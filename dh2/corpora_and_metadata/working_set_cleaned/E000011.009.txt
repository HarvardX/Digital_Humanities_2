constitutional code book i preface to the whole contents of this proposed code one allcomprehensive objection will not fail to be opposed in whatever political community by which it were adopted it would to a greater or less extent probably to a very large extent involve the abolition of the existing institutions but by whomsoever this unquestionable truth is put forward in the character of an objection let it be understood what the confession is which is involved in it it is—that among the institutions to which the objector is thus giving his support there exist in an indefinite number those of the mischievousness of which he is himself fully conscious—that in what he is thus endeavouring at he therefore acts to his own full knowledge the part of an enemy to the community to which he belongs and for whose welfare he pretends to be solicitous the more absurd the more mischievous the more abundantly productive of human misery in every shape an institution or set of institutions is in the defence of which he is thus acting the more necessarily is he reduced to have recourse to this mode of defence and cry out against the subversion of ancient institutions suppose an institution like that for example of sacrificing men to idols as in ancient mexico or tormenting and slaughtering them for sport as in modern ashantee—the most shameless corruptionist would not dare to stand up in defence of it taken by itself but neither for the defence of this institution nor of any other still more atrocious if any such were conceivable would a corruptionist or lawyer in this or any other country be wanting if in so doing they beheld any prospect of success and unhappily such is the weakness of human nature that there are many down to this time upon whom such a defence would make a great impression such as it is the present legislative draught is the first in point of time in which any such additament as a rationale was ever inserted now that it does exist the utility of its existence will not be matter of dispute of its nonexistence hitherto two causes may be assigned in every government not having for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number—want of inclination and want of ability both together in a government having for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number on the part of the leading class namely the lawyer class want of inclination as to all three branches of the pannomion except the constitutional branch and in relation to all three branches and even that branch in particular want of ability want of that anticipation of ability which being necessary even to the bare endeavour is still more plainly so to correspondent success nor need the deficiency of ability be an object of surprise wherever adequate motives are wanting actions will be wanting likewise physical desires out of the question where motives are wanting desires are naturally wanting and with desires endeavours the quantity of labour necessary has been such as to fill up the ordinary capacity of a whole life and in return for this burthen what was the benefit that could by any one be expected thus much as to legislators and legislative draughts in regard to expositors and commentators the absence of everything in the shape of a rationale has not been thus entire fragments of the sort of work have even been seen in abundance of a rationale yes but of what sort of a sort which perhaps not altogether without truth may be pronounced worse than useless instead of giving existence to the arrangements the rationale has derived its existence from them in the breast of the ruler selfinterest has given existence to the arrangements in the breast of the commentator selfinterest has again given birth to the rationale to the only right and proper problem which the case admits of has been substituted an opposite one right and proper problem—to ascertain in each case that arrangement which is in the highest degree contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number sinister problem which has almost uniformly been substituted—to ascertain in each case that arrangement which under existing circumstances has in the highest degree the approbation of those in whose hands is in the greatest quantity the disposal of the matter of reward in all its branches the political states for the use of which this code is principally designed are those in whose instance the existing form of government is republican to no inconsiderable extent and in no inconsiderable detail the features of inaptitude or in a word the abuses of the english form of government are brought to view useful and highly instructive however with reference to the main purpose will this exposition be as well as to what may be considered as   an additional though collateral purpose for a republic it may serve the whole of it together at any time for england independent of any such sudden revolution as under the provocations given will be always upon the cards it may in proportion as it is well adapted to its purpose be of use in giving direction to the views of all such persons as may feel disposed to occupy themselves in the effecting of melioration by gradual changes which in so far as they are conducive to the professed end will be so many approaches towards republicanism to the establishment of a republican form of government which is the term and ne plus ultra on the one hand as a purely monarchical form of government is on the other it will apply acceleration or retardation—or the maximum of retardation to wit final prevention according to circumstances but in neither can the effect of it in so far as it has any fail of being productive of good prevention is that the result the good produced will in that case be pure from evil but the arrival of the maximum of good will either not take place at all or not till at the end of a length of time more or less considerable retardation is that the result the number of persons excluded from a participation in the maximum of good will be the greater but the good will be pure from admixture with evil in those shapes which are inseparable from all change preceded by hostile contention or sudden and uncompensated transfer of property or power in proportion as of the arrangements here proposed and the reasons on which they are grounded and by which they are explained and justified or at least endeavoured to be justified application is made to the corresponding arrangements made by english law or english practice the reader will observe that from first to last with few or no exceptions nothing can be more opposite for expressing the cause of this contrariety few indeed are the words that will be found sufficient in each case the contrariety will be found to have one and the same cause namely the nature of the end in view that end being in each one of the two cases the direct opposite of that which it is in the other in the here proposed code of every proposed arrangement from first to last without any one exception the end in view is the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the several arrangements in the english system in no one instance has the greatest happiness of the greatest number been the end in view at all times—on every occasion—in every instance the end actually pursued by the several sets of rulers has been the promotion of the particular and thence sinister interest of these same rulers look the world all over in no one place—at no one time has any arrangement of government had for its object any other object than the interest of those by whom it has been made in this case as in every other in so far as the felicity of the greatest number has been the result the cause of its being so is that in the particular case in question whilst seeking the insurance of their own personal felicity it was not in their power to avoid seeking the insurance of the felicity of the greatest number but under the english government not to speak of others those by whom the powers of government have been exercised have at all times had an interest and a desire operating in direct opposition to those of their subjects and having by the supposition the power in their hands the corresponding power to give effect to that same interest and that same desire such accordingly has been the consequence the sacrifice of the interest and felicity of the greatest number to the particular and sinister interest of those same rulers in no instance has any benefit the receipt of which if received by the governed would have been attended with any corresponding sacrifice in any shape on the part of the rulers been conferred on the people but under a sense of necessity and with reluctance in no case of design—never but either of necessity or accident has any such benefit been the result taking therefore the whole system of government in all its parts and more particularly the constitutional branch never in the direct ratio always in the inverse ratio of its strength has been the felicity of the people at no time have the constituent members of the governing body at no time has the monarch at no time have the hereditary aristocracy at no time have the proprietors of seats in the house of commons† at no time have the clergy at no time have the judges had any better endeavour or desire than to swell each of them his own power to its utmost possible pitch to the weakness of the law taken in its totality—to its weakness and not to its strength are the people indebted for everything in their condition by which they are distinguished from that country in europe whatever it be in which the people are in the most miserable degree oppressed and this weakness from what source has it arisen—from the sinister interest and particular situation of the lawyer tribe now for the first time is the invitation given to examine and discuss the most interesting of all temporal subjects on the ground of a set of determinate and throughout mutually connected and it is hoped consistent principles now for the first time to the subjectmatter of this proposed examination and discussion is given the form and method of the matter of a distinctive branch of art and corresponding science in so far as what is said is right and true will be afforded the utmost facility of conception   to whatever is erroneous and false will be afforded a correspondent facility of and for detection and exposure the constitutional code is the first in importance as on it will depend the matter of all the other codes as in the physical so in the moral branch of the field of thought and action parts still remain which may be stated as being as yet unexplored in the political branch in that subbranch of the moral one topic is that which regards the rights and the obligations of onehalf of the species—the female sex the rights which it is fit they should possess the obligations to which it is fit they should be subjected this inquiry stretches itself over all three parts of the pannomion—the constitutional the civil or rightconferring and the wrongrepressing—or say the penal others there are which belong exclusively to the penal but of these the mention may with more advantage be reserved for the code to which as above they belong should it ever happen to the present work to be taken for the basis of the constitutional code of any nation that which presents itself as the proper way of putting it to use is this in the code to which authority is given insert the enactive part and the ratiocinative and the expositive eliminate the instructional and the exemplificational why eliminate the instructional and the exemplificational—because neither of them has any other object than the giving assistance to the legislator in the task of composing the authoritative code in the composition of which he will have derived from them such information as appears to him useful and the remainder not being designed to serve as a rule of action for the people need not and therefore should not lie as a burthen upon their pockets and their time why insert the expositive and the ratiocinative the expositive because regarded as necessary to right interpretation the ratiocinative as being assistant to right interpretation and as helping to create and preserve in the minds of the people a persuasion of the aptitude of the enactive and a disposition to lend their assistance as occasion calls to the giving execution and effect to it and as serving to produce the like persuasion in the breasts of legislators present and future and thereby preserve the law itself against changes from the better to the worse also to create and preserve in the breasts of judges the disposition to act their parts in giving execution and effect to it not for amusement assuredly were the lists and explanations of the various subjectmatters and functions inserted in this code any more than the like might be in an index or a dictionary no more need therefore has the reader of this proposed code to read them in the order in which they stand unless for some special use any more than to read the same quantity of matter in the one or the other of those useful fruits of hard labour in the field of literature not for amusement but for substantial use subjectmatters for the purpose of making as sure as the faculties of the labourer will admit that nothing which the purpose required to be noticed had been left unnoticed and for that of making the reader satisfied that everything which the purpose required to be noticed has been noticed accordingly the term functions has been employed for the sake of conciseness correctness clearness and symmetry but for this comprehensive denomination where arrangements were intended to be the same assemblages of words more or less different from one another would have been apt to have been employed in giving expression to them and from this diversity in expression diversity of meaning might on each occasion have naturally been inferred but by a single word with a few others necessary to complete it into a proposition less space by an indefinite amount will be occupied than would be occupied by any equivalent phrase of which this same word formed no part—hence in a proportionate degree conciseness if in any one of these same instances the word function with the attribute connected with it is the proper one so by the supposition is it in every other so much for correctness if in any one of these same instances the import meant to be conveyed is clear so will it be in every other for there being no obscurity in it on the first that occurs of those occasions so neither can there be on any other as little can there be any ambiguity so much for clearness symmetry or say uniformity that which in relation to the multitude of objects symmetry requires is that each of them be presented to view in forms mutually agreeing but no two forms that are in any particular different can agree so well as the same form does with itself and as to the order in which they present themselves it will on each occasion be that which on that same occasion is best adapted to the writers purposes those objects which require to be put together will have presented themselves together in the compass of this single word and in exactly the same form one error in practice there is against which it seems necessary to give warning it being at once so mischievous so natural and so common this is the depriving the people of the benefit of such parts of what is proposed as are not unsuitable to the existing form of government on account of their contiguity to others which are unsuitable to it introduction section i first principles described in general terms to whatever portion of the field of thought   and action the literary work in question belongs it has been found convenient and is accordingly usual to place at the beginning of it some opinion or opinions embracing in their extent the whole of the portion in question or as large a portion of it as may be on this occasion a number of expressions mutually related are found needful or convenient and are accordingly usually employed take for example first principles leading principle first lines outlines positions axioms aphorisms if in the composition of the work the design be to recommend a certain course of action as proper to be pursued for the attainment of a certain end thereupon come certain other words and phrases of correspondently extensive import of this sort are ends objects of pursuit means obstacles—helps counterforces acting in opposition to the obstacles where the object of the inquiry and discussion is what is the course of action which with relation to the field in question is proper to be pursued a necessarily concomitant object of regard throughout is—the course actually pursued pursued in the community which the writer has in view if the course actually pursued is in all points the same with the course proper to be pursued it is well and unless on the supposition that in default of apposite warning and instruction a departure to an extent more or less considerable may have place any work on the subject in question would be useless and by him in whose opinion such coincidence has place cannot consistently be undertaken in regard to some expressions viz course proper to be pursued course not proper to be pursued one matter of fact there is which on every occasion it may be of use to the reader to have in mind this is that everything of which any such phrase can be in an immediate way the expression is a certain state of mind on the part of him by whom the expression is employed the state of his mind with relation to the subjectmatter of the discourse whatsoever it happens to be the state of mind will be the state of one or more of his intellectual faculties in one word his understanding—or the state of his sensitive faculties in one word his feelings or the state of his volitional faculties in one word his will his desires his wishes thus in the case here at present on the carpet when i say the greatest happiness of the whole community ought to be the end or object of pursuit in every branch of the law—of the political rule of action and of the constitutional branch in particular what is it that i express—this and no more namely that it is my wish my desire to see it taken for such by those who in the community in question are actually in possession of the powers of government taken for such on the occasion of every arrangement made by them in the exercise of such their powers so that their endeavours shall be to render such their cause of action contributory to the obtainment of that same end such then is the state of that faculty in me which is termed the will such is the state of those particular acts or modifications of that faculty which are termed wishes or desires and which have their immediate efficient causes in corresponding feelings in corresponding pleasures and pains such as on the occasion in question the imagination brings to view in making this assertion i make a statement relative to a matter of fact namely that which at the time in question is passing in the interior of my own mind—how far this statement is correct is a matter on which it belongs to the reader if it be worth his while to form his judgment such then being the desire truly or falsely expressed by me but at any rate expressed by me—in his breast has that same desire a place if so then may it be worth his while to apply his attention to the course herein marked out by me under the notion of its being correspondent and contributory and conducive to the attainment of that same end on the other hand if so it be that that same desire has no place in his breast on that supposition generally speaking it will be a useless trouble to him to pay any further attention to anything contained in it to this observation one exception it is true there is and it is this namely that if the end in view which it is his wish to see pursued is different from this it may be of use to him to take note of the arrangements herein proposed as conducive to the end pursued by me for the purpose of taking or recommending such different and opposite arrangements as may prevent the attainment of the end proposed by me and procure or promote the attainment of that other end be it what it may which is more agreeable to his wishes—say for example the greatest happiness of some one member of the community in question or of some other number smaller than the majority of the whole number of the members so again when i say—in the breast of every ruler on the occasion of the arrangements taken by him in the field of government the actual end or object of pursuit has in the instance of every such arrangement been his own greatest happiness and that in such sort as that wherever in his judgment there has been a competition between his happiness and that of all the other members of the community in question taken together he has on each occasion given the preference to his own happiness over theirs and used his endeavours to giving increase to his own happiness in whatsoever degree the aggregate of their happiness may in his judgment he lessened by it—in saying this i have been exhibiting the state of my own mind viewed in another point of view viewed as it were in another part of it—my judgment the judicial faculty i have given that as my opinion an opinion of   which i am prepared to bring to view the efficient causes while i am so doing i observe another writer who on the score of my so doing taxes me with egotism or to use another word with dogmatism meaning by dogmatism the doing something which it is his wish his desire should not be done in answer to this charge what i say is that either a man must do this or he must forbear to write at all for that it is not possible for a man to write without doing thus but this defence against the charge of dogmatism is not confined to selfdefence against the charge of dogmatism it has for its object the giving warning against that form of discourse to which the imputation expressed by the word dogmatism does really and properly attach in a work of selfbiography personality called in english when disapproved of egotism is at once unavoidable and agreeable in a work on legislation except in so far as it is unavoidable it is irrelevant impertinent and disagreeable in a certain case in the mouth of a public functionary it is not only impertinent but insulting and thereby to every individual who is not by habit inured to insult supremely disagreeable this is where the rest of the community being brought upon the stage in the character of subjects of property the speaker brings himself to view in the character of proprietor or owner of the property thus to speak is to spit in the face of every one who either hears or reads it the present is an occasion on which personality is unavoidable in saying as above the proper end of government is the greatest happiness of all or in case of competition the greatest happiness of the greatest number it seems to me that i have made a declaration of peace and goodwill to all men on the other hand were i to say the proper end of government is the greatest happiness of some one naming him or of some few naming them it seems to me that i should be making a declaration of war against all men with the exception of that one or of those few be the subject what it may unless it be allowed to me to say what in relation to that subject are my judgment my feelings or my desires i cannot say anything in relation to it and as to my judgment on each occasion giving it as i do for no more than it is worth it seems to me that it is on my part no unreasonable desire to be allowed—free from every imputation conveyed or endeavoured to be conveyed by the word dogmatism—to be allowed to give it this being the basis on which all legislation and all morality rests these few words written in hopes of clearing away all obscurity and ambiguity all doubts and difficulties will not i hope be regarded as misapplied or applied in waste section ii first principles enumerated the right and proper end of government in every political community is the greatest happiness of all the individuals of which it is composed say in other words the greatest happiness of the greatest number in speaking of the correspondent first principle call it the greatesthappiness principle in speaking of this end of government call it the right and proper end of government the actual end of government is in every political community the greatest happiness of those whether one or many by whom the powers of government are exercised in general terms the proof of this position may be referred to particular experience as brought to view by the history of all nations this experience may be termed particular inasmuch as the particular class of rulers is the only class concerned in it to which it bears reference this may be called the experimental or practical proof for further proof reference may be made to the general indeed the allcomprehensive principle of human nature the position which takes this fact for its subject may be termed an axiom and may be expressed in the words following in the general tenor of life in every human breast selfregarding interest is predominant over all other interests put together more shortly thus—selfregard is predominant—or thus—selfpreference has place everywhere this position may to some eyes present itself in the character of an axiom as such selfevident and not standing in need of proof to others as a position or proposition which how clearly soever true still stands in need of proof to deliver a position in the character of an axiom is to deliver it under the expectation that either it will not be controverted at all or that he by whom it is controverted will not in justification of the denial given by him to it be able to advance anything by which the unreasonableness of his opinion or pretended opinion will not be exposed of this stamp are the axioms laid down by euclid in the axioms so laid down by him nothing of dogmatism will it is believed be found by the principle of selfpreference understand that propensity in human nature by which on the occasion of every act he exercises every human being is led to pursue that line of conduct which according to his view of the case taken by him at the moment will be in the highest degree contributory to his own greatest happiness whatsoever be the effect of it in relation to the happiness of other similar beings any or all of them taken together for the satisfaction of those who may doubt reference may be made to the existence of the species as being of itself a proof and   that a conclusive one for after exception made of the case of children not arrived at the age of which they are capable of going alone or adults reduced by infirmity to a helpless state take any two individuals a and b and suppose the whole care of the happiness of a confined to the breast of b a himself not having any part in it and the whole care of the happiness of b confined to the breast of a b himself not having any part in it and this to be the case throughout it will soon appear that in this state of things the species could not continue in existence and that a few months not to say weeks or days would suffice for the annihilation of it of all modes in which for the governance of one and the same individual the two faculties could be conceived as placed in different seats—sensation and consequent desire in one breast judgment and consequent action in another this is the most simple if as has with less truth been said of the blind leading the blind both would in such a state of things be continually falling into the ditch much more frequently and more speedily fatal would be the falls supposing the separation to have place upon any more complex plan suppose the care of the happiness of a being taken altogether from a were divided between b and c the happiness of b and c being provided for in the same complex manner and so on the greater the complication the more speedy would the destruction be and the more flagrant the absurdity of a supposition assuming the existence of such a state of things note that if in the situation of ruler the truth of this position held good in no more than a bare majority of the whole number of instances it would suffice for every practical purpose in the character of a ground for all political arrangements in the character of a consideration by which the location of the several portions of the aggregate mass of political power should be determined for in the way of induction it is only by the greater and not the lesser number of instances that the general conclusion can reasonably be determined in a word mathematically speaking the probability of a future contingent event is in the direct ratio of the number of instances in which an event of the same sort has happened to the number of those in which it has not happened it is in this direct ratio and not in the inverse if such were the condition of human beings that the happiness of no one being came in competition with that of any other—that is to say if the happiness of each or of any one could receive increase to an unlimited amount without having the effect of producing decrease in the happiness of any other then the above expression might serve without limitation or explanation but on every occasion the happiness of every individual is liable to come into competition with the happiness of every other if for example in a house containing two individuals for the space of a month there be a supply of food barely sufficient to continue for that time not merely the happiness of each but the existence of each stands in competition with and is incompatible with the existence of the other hence it is that to serve for all occasions instead of saying the greatest happiness of all it becomes necessary to use the expression the greatest happiness of the greatest number if however instead of the word happiness the word interest is employed the phrase universal interest may be employed as corresponding indifferently to the interest of the greatest number or to the interest of all in the eyes of every impartial arbiter writing in the character of legislator and having exactly the same regard for the happiness of every member of the community in question as for that of every other the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the members of that same community cannot but be recognised in the character of the right and proper and sole right and proper end of government or say object of pursuit for the designation of the opposite or reverse of what is right and proper the term sinister may in consideration of the relation borne to each other by the two terms taken in their original physical sense be employed accordingly in so far as between the happiness of the greatest number and the happiness of any lesser number any incompatibility or successful competition is allowed to have place it may be styled a sinister end of government or say object of pursuit if as above so it be that in the situation of a ruler whatsoever that situation be the conduct of no man can reasonably be expected to be governed by any interest that stands at that same moment in opposition to that which in his conception is his own individual interest it follows that for causing it to take that direction in which it will be subservient to the universal interest the nature of the case affords no other method than that which consists in the bringing of the particular interest of rulers into accordance with the universal interest here then we have a third principle of the first rank in addition to the two former ones call it the meansprescribing or junctionofinterestsprescribing principle the first declares what ought to be the next what is the last the means of bringing what is into accordance with what ought to be meantime this junction of interests how can it be effected the nature of the case admits but of one method which is the destroying the influence and effect of whatever sinister interest the situation of the individual may expose him to the action of this being   accomplished he will thereby be virtually divested of all such sinister interest remains as the only interest whereby his conduct can be determined his right and proper interest that interest which consists in the share he has in the universal interest which is the same thing as to say that interest which is in accordance with the universal interest taken in the aggregate be the act what it may there are two modes in either of which a man may be divested of the interest requisite to his performance of it one is the overpowering the force of whatsoever body of interest may be acting on him in a direction tending to engage him in the performance of it by a stronger counterinterest this is the direct mode the other is the divesting him of the power of performing that same act for that which in his own eyes it is not in a mans power to perform it cannot in his own eyes be his interest to endeavour to perform it can never be a mans interest to expend time and labour without effect considered in its application to a mans interest this mode may be termed an indirect mode thus it is that by one and the same arrangement application may be made to the power and the will at the same time and in either mode the requisite junction of interests is capable of being effected or promoted a question that now immediately presents itself is whether to any individual supposing him invested by the constitution in question with the supreme power any inducement can be applied by that same constitution of sufficient force to overpower any sinister interest to the operation of which by his situation he stands exposed inducements operating on interest are all of them reducible to two denominations—punishment and reward punishment in every shape his situation suffices to prevent his standing exposed to so likewise reward being by the supposition invested with supreme power the matter of reward cannot be applied to him in any shape in which he has not already at his command whatever it would be in the power of the constitution by any particular arrangement to confer on him to him who has the whole it is useless to give this or that part to a question to this effect the only answer that can be given is sufficiently manifest by reward an individual so situated cannot be acted upon for there exists no other individual in the community at whose hands he can receive more than he has in his own by punishment as little for there exists no individual at whose hands he is obliged to receive or will receive any such thing the result is that in a monarchy no such junction of interests can be effected and that therefore by no means can monarchy be rendered conducive to the production of the greatest happiness of the greatest number nor therefore according to the greatest happinessprinciple be susceptible of the denomination of a good form of government what then is the best form of government this question may itself be clothed in an indefinite number of forms what is the most eligible what is the most desirable what is the most expedient what is the most right and proper and so on in whatsoever form clothed it is resolvable into these two—what is the end to which it is your will to see the arrangements employed in the delineation of it directed what are the several arrangements by which in the character of means it is your opinion that that same end in so far as attainable is most likely to be attained to write an answer to this question—to write on the subject which it holds up to view—is virtually is in effect from beginning to end to write an answer to one or other or both of these questions to the first my answer is—the greatest happiness of all the several members of the community in question taken together is the end to which it is my desire to see all the arrangements employed in the delineation of it directed that being taken for the end to which it is right and proper that all legislative arrangements be directed my opinion is that so far as they go the proposed arrangements which here follow would be in a higher degree conducive to it than any other could be that could be proposed in a work which was not particularly adapted to the situation of any one country to the exclusion of all others should it be asked what is the community which by the description of the community in question you have in view my answer is—any community which is as much as to say every community whatsoever should it be asked why is it your desire that the greatest happiness of all the several members of the community in question should be the end to which all the several arrangements employed in the delineation of the form of government by which that same community is governed should be directed my answer is—because on the occasion in question such is the form the establishment of which would in the highest degree be contributory to my own greatest happiness should it again be asked by any man what proof can you give of this what cause can any other person have for regarding as probable that what you are thus saying is conformable to truth the only answer which would not be irrelevant impertinent egotistical is this behold for proof the labour it cannot but have cost me to give expression to these several arrangements and the so much greater labour which it cannot but have cost me to bring to view the reasons which stand annexed to them—reasons which have for their object the causing them to be adopted and made law by the persons to whom in the several communities the power of determining on every occasion what shall be taken for law   and have the force of law depends viz by showing that on each subject they are in a higher degree conducive to that end than any others that could be proposed in saying thus much i have already laid down what in my view of the matter are the two positions of which in the character of first principles the whole sequel of this work will be no more than the development and the application these principles are the greatest happinessprinciple and the selfpreference principle chapter i general division of the aggregate body of the law on viewing the aggregate of that which in any country has the force of law it will be found divisible in the first place the whole of it into two portions or branches viz in the first place that in which the rule of action is laid down simply and absolutely without reference to the functions of any such members of the community as those whose business it is under some such name as that of judges or ministers of justice to secure the observance of it in the next place that in which a description is given of the course to be taken by those same official persons for securing the observance of and giving execution and effect to the several arrangements contained in that same main or substantive branch this branch may be distinguished by the name of the adjective branch or law of judiciary procedure the main or substantive portion or branch of the law may again be distinguished into two portions or branches in the first place that in which individuals are considered separately only and in their private capacity this may be distinguished by the name of private law in the next place that in which individuals are regarded collectively and in some public capacity with a view to the powers necessary to be exercised by some of them over others for the good of the whole this branch may be distinguished by the name of public or constitutional law the law cannot in any part of it operate without doing more or less towards the making distribution of benefits and burthens burthens it may distribute or impose without distributing or conferring benefit in any shape benefit in any shape it cannot confer without at the same time imposing burthen in a correspondent shape either on the individual benefited or intended to be benefited or on some other or others most commonly even on all others with little or no exception the whole body of the law may again by another division derived from the source just mentioned be distinguished into two branches viz that which is occupied in the description of the distribution intended to be made of benefits and burthens respectively as above this branch may be styled the distributive branch of law it is that which is occupied in the description of the arrangements for giving effect to such distribution by furnishing individuals with inducements adequate to the purpose of rendering their conduct conformable to the plan of distribution so marked out of the inducements thus employed some will be of a disagreeable nature and thus come under the notion of burthens others of an agreeable nature and thus come under the notion of benefits that branch of law the arrangements of which are occupied in the application of burthens to the purpose of securing conformity to the arrangements made by the distributive branch of law is distinguished by the name of penal law that branch of law the arrangements of which are occupied in the application of benefits to the purpose of securing conformity to the arrangements made by the distributive branch of law may be distinguished by the name of the remuneratory or remunerative branch of law of the whole body of actual law one preeminently remarkable division derived from a correspondently remarkable source and pervading the whole mass still remains it is that by which it is distinguished into two branches—the arrangements of one of which are arrangements that have really been made—made by hands universally acknowledged as duly authorized and competent to the making of such arrangements viz the hands of a legislatorgeneral or set of legislatorsgeneral or their respective subordinates this branch of law may stand distinguished from that which is correspondent and opposite to it by the name of real law really existing law legislatormade law—under the english government it stands already distinguished by the name of statute law as also by the uncharacteristic undiscriminative and in so far improper appellation of written law the arrangements supposed to be made by the other branch in so far as they are arrangements of a general nature applying not only to individuals assignable but to the community at large or to individuals not individuals assignable may stand distinguished by the appellations of unreal not really existing imaginary fictitious spurious judgemade law under the english government the division actually distinguished by the unexpressive uncharacteristic and unappropriate names of common law and unwritten law of the manner in which this wretched substitute to real and genuine law is formed take this description in the course of a suit in which application is made of the rule of action thus composed the judge on each occasion pretends to find ready made and by competent authority endued with the force of law and at the same time universally known to be so   in existence and so in force a proposition of a general aspect adapted to the purpose of affording sufficient authority and warrant for the particular decision or order which on that individual occasion he accordingly pronounces and delivers partly from the consideration of the general propositions so framed as above by this or that judge or set of judges partly from the consideration of the individual instruments or documents expressive of such individual decision or order as above partly from the consideration of such discourses as have been or are supposed to have been uttered whether by the judges or by the advocates on one or both sides—a class of lawyers have under the names of general treatises or reports of particular cases concurred in the composition of an immense chaos the whole of it written and a vast portion of it printed and published constituting an everincreasing body of that which forms the matter which passes under the denomination of unwritten law chapter ii constitutional law in every community in which a constitutional code generally acknowledged to be in force is in existence a really existing constitutional branch of law and with it as the offspring of it a constitution is so far in existence in no community in which no constitutional code thus generally acknowledged to be in force is in existence is any such branch of law as a constitutional branch or any such thing as a constitution really in existence in a community in which as above no such thing as a constitution is really to be found things to each of which the name of a constitution is given are to be found in endless multitudes on each occasion the thing designated by the phrase the constitution is a substitute for a constitution—a substitute framed by the imagination of the person by whom this phrase is uttered framed by him and of course adapted to that which in his mind is the purpose of the moment whatsoever that purpose be in so far as that purpose is the promoting the creation or preservation of an absolutely monarchical form of government the constitution thus imagined and invented by him is of the absolutely monarchical cast in so far as that purpose is the promoting the creation or preservation of a limitedly monarchical form of government it is of the limitedly monarchical cast in so far as the purpose is the creation or preservation of a democratical form of government it is of the democratic cast the angloamerican united states have a constitution they have a constitutional code the constitution is the system of arrangements delineated in that code it has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number and in pursuit of that object the powers of government are allotted by it to the greatest number the french and spanish nations have constitutions the english monarchy has no constitution for it has no allcomprehensive constitutional code nor in short any constitutional code whatsoever generally acknowledged as such nor by any one individual of the whole community acknowledged as such hence so it is that of the assertion contained in the phrases excellent constitution—matchless constitution an assertion by which every endeavour to produce the effect of the worst constitution possible is so naturally accompanied no disproof can be opposed otherwise than by the assertion of a plain and universally notorious matter of fact viz—that the english people have no constitution at all belonging to them england not having any constitution at all has no excellent no matchless constitution for nothing has no properties if ever it has a constitution that constitution will most probably be a democratical one for nothing less than an insurrection on the part of the greatest number will suffice to surmount and subdue so vast a power as that which is composed of the conjunct action of force intimidation corruption and delusion the constitutional branch of law is that branch by which designation is made of that person or those persons to whose power it is intended that on each occasion the conduct of all the other members of the community in question shall be subjected the power which is here conferred is the supreme power of the supreme power thus designated that is to say of the aggregate of the operations by which the exercise of it is performed there are of necessity two perfectly distinct branches the operative and the constitutive the operative is exercised by the declaration made of the alldirecting will above alluded to the constitutive is exercised by the determination made of the individual or individuals by whom the operative power is exercised constitutional law has for its object security against misrule security against those adversaries of the community in whose instance while their situation bestows on them the denomination of rulers the use they make of it adds the adjunct evil and thus denominates them evil rulers in a code of constitutional law as has been already observed arrangements of two different complexions must have place one set of the nature of those belonging to the distributive or civil branch of law having for their occupation the distribution of the powers of government with the opposite and correspondent burthens the other set presenting a penal aspect having for their occupation the giving a description of a particular class of crimes and of the means employed against  0 them in the character of remedies but that the thread may not be interrupted convenience recommends the placing what belongs to these crimes in company with what belongs to others in the penal code on the occasion of ordinary offences the persons against whose mischievous enterprises the security is to be afforded are individuals at large on the occasion of this particular class of crimes to individuals considered in the character of subjects are added or substituted individuals considered in the character of rulers this distinction the draughtsman will when occupied on the penal code at all times keep in view in the situation of a ruler as such in a monarchy no act that he can commit be it in ever so high a degree mischievous wears the denomination of a crime king or by what other denomination designated a ruler can do no wrong for the same evil act which if committed by a subject would be wrong becomes by the mere circumstance of its being committed by a ruler not wrong but right so far as it wears the complexion of penal law constitutional law has these two for its distinguishable and contrasted objects first the ordering matters so that those who to some purposes and on some occasions occupy the situation of rulers shall in respect of their conduct in that and other situations be liable to be dealt with in the character of offenders delinquents criminals could the ordering matters so that to acts done in resistance to or for prevention of misrule and thence productive of more good than evil—to such acts of whatever penal denomination they may appear susceptible no such punishment if any shall be allotted as might with propriety be allotted to them if the application of them to the prevention of misrule had no place under an absolute monarchy the constitutional branch of the law has for its sole actual end the greatest happiness of the one individual in whose hands without division the whole of the supreme operative power is lodged for decencys sake the end thus actually and exclusively pursued is not the end professed and declared to be pursued for the designation of the end actually pursued regard for decency and conciseness substitutes on each occasion one or another of a small assortment of phrases preservation of order preservation of legitimacy for example under a limited monarchy the constitutional branch of law has for its actual object a more complex object viz the greatest happiness of the monarch coupled with and limited by the greatest happiness of the conjunctly or subordinately ruling few by whose respective powers the limitations that are applied to the power of the monarch are applied under a representative democracy the constitutional branch of law has for its actual end the greatest happiness of the greatest number accordingly so far as it exists in the utmost degree of perfection which the nature of the case admits of the right of indicating by the respective suffrages among what individuals the supreme operative power shall be shared is exercised by all the concurrence of all in the effective designation of the individual by whom the share in question in the operative power shall be possessed not being possible wherever the wishes of one part of those by whom the suffrages are given point to one person while the wishes of another part point to another the next most desirable result with reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number is that instead of being exercised by the whole number the power shall be exercised by the greater part of it such being the most desirable result such accordingly is the actual result in a representative democracy the exercise of this designative power is performed by human judgment under a monarchy it is performed by fortune or providence—the cause being the same and that cause out of the reach of our knowledge each man may on each particular occasion do as he is accustomed to do employ that one of the two terms which on that occasion is regarded by him as best suited to his purpose under the exercise made of this power by fortune the supreme operative power finds itself at the death of the last possessor in the hands of the only child or in case of children more than one living at that moment—of the first born of the children of a certain woman the power of removal is under the direction of fortune providence or by accident human judgment exercised by death in so far as the power of appointment is thus exercised by fortune or providence no degree of relative inaptitude short of universally manifest and complete insanity of mind has the effect of preventing the operative power from finding itself lodged in the hands thus designated and appointed no degree of inaptitude short of that produced by insanity as above takes the power of removal out of the hands of death the persons in whose hands is lodged the supreme operative power as also those in whose hands the supreme designative power appointment and removal included is lodged being determined what remains for the matter of the constitutional code is the declaring in what manner the power and functions of the persons in whose hands the designative power is lodged shall be exercised as likewise the marking out into a number of distinct branches the whole mass of subordinate power a constitutional code might in a certain sense be said to be complete if neither any distribution of operative power among subordinate authorities nor any mode of appointment or removal in relation to the possessors of any such subordinate power were contained    in it for by the description given as above of the supreme power and the provision made as above for the exercise of the designative power with relation to the possessors of that same supreme operative power provision would be made for all such subordinate arrangements as above as it might be the pleasure of the possessors of those two branches of the supreme power to concur in the making of chapter iii civil or distributive law section i general object of law in general and of this branch in particular the principal object is to give security to rights viz to such as it finds in existence and such others as under and in virtue of such arrangements as it finds in existence are from time to time successively brought into existence to wit either by such events as take place without the operation of human will such as deaths and other casualties and the produce of the elements of the three kingdoms of nature—the mineral the vegetable and the animal and such as are brought into existence by the operation of the human will such as voluntary contracts and ordinances of the administrative branch of government in comparison with the security thus afforded for rights in general such benefits as belong to this or that one of the three remaining heads under one or other of which all the asyetunmentioned benefits which it is in the nature of government to confirm or secure may be classed are but of secondary importance to wit subsistence meaning incidental arrangements for securing national subsistence against incidental causes of failure abundance meaning continual increase to that which is a common matter of subsistence and abundance and equality meaning the giving to the several masses of the matter of wealth in the possession of different individuals such approach and perpetual tendency to absolute equality as shall not be inconsistent with the security which ought to be afforded to the rights relative to property and the rights relative to condition in life security subsistence abundance and equality—by these then will be presented to view the several subordinate or particular ends most immediately in contact with and branching out from the only legitimate and universal end of government neither in the import of the word subsistence nor in the import of the word abundance is any relation to futurity necessarily involved in the import of the word security that relation is constantly and necessarily involved the present being at all times but a point the word security can never present itself without presenting to view one point at least which is neither the present nor the past section ii security first on the list of benefits which the civil branch of the law is occupied in distributing is security security may be considered with reference to the objects which are secured and with reference to the objects against which they are secured taking human beings individually considered these are the only real entities considered as being secured but when a particular and practical application comes to be made of the word security certain names of fictitious entities† in common use must be employed to designate so many objects to and for which the security is afforded person reputation property condition in life—by these four names of fictitious entities all the objects to which in the case of an individual the security afforded by government can apply itself may be designated security has for its adversaries against whose enterprises it is to be afforded three classes of persons differently situated and denominated viz foreign adversaries considered as such foreigners considered in so far as they are or are liable to become adversaries rulers viz of the country in question considered in that same light and fellowcitizens or fellowsubjects considered in that same light as to the acts against which security is to be afforded and by which in so far as they are performed security is broken in upon and lessened they are in themselves and their immediate effects the same by which soever of the three species of adversaries they are exercised taken however in the aggregate they are wont to be designated by a different denomination according to the situation of the class to which the person or persons by whom they are exercised is considered as belonging if to that of foreign adversaries they are denominated acts of hostility if to that of domestic adversaries considered in the character of rulers acts of oppression—or if the oppression be considered as to a certain degree flagrant acts of tyranny if to that of domestic adversaries considered in the character of subjects acts of delinquency the case of foreigners and also the case of rulers are treated of elsewhere remains the case in which the persons against whose enterprises security is to be afforded are considered in the character of subjects in this instance the principal and leading operation by which the security is afforded consists in giving to the several distinguishable    acts by which the security considered as applied to the several sorts of possessions is considered as being broken in upon and lessened the denomination and character of so many different offences considered with reference to the persons engaged in the exercise of those acts but so nice and difficult of apprehension is in many cases the distinction—on the one hand between one mode of delinquency and another—on the other hand between the several modes of delinquency and innocence and so inadequate to the purpose of conveying in this case a clear correct and complete conception of the object denominated is any single word of which a denomination can be composed—that to each such denomination it is altogether necessary that a definition be subjoined or to speak more extensively an exposition as also on the occasion of each such exposition a portion of explanatory matter applied to the several distinguishable terms of which it is composed were nothing further necessary to the purpose the list of these several definitions considered as being so many instruments employed in the process of affording security against so many acts by the exercise of which security is broken in upon and lessened might without any apparent impropriety be allotted to the branch of law here in question but such are the temptations by which in the instance of each such offence men are liable to be invited to the exercise of it that unless for the purpose of restraining them from the commission of those acts respectively inducements of the nature of punishment were employed and announced every such definition so sent abroad without support would be a dead letter and as such be without effect penal law is therefore the branch of law which occupies itself in the distribution of burthens to the intent of their having the effect of punishment with relation to the civil code—taking the mass of its arrangements for an intermediate end the matter of the penal code is but a means by the arrangements contained in the civil code so many directive rules are furnished what the penal code does is but to furnish sanctions by which provision is made for the observance of those directive rules in truth it goes but part of the way towards furnishing that indispensable appendage for of sanctions there are two sorts viz the punitive and the remunerative and the punitive is the only one of the two which is furnished by the penal code as such hence it is that in the field of law command occupies a much greater extent than is occupied by invitation between the idea of command and the idea of eventual punishment the connexion is inseparable thus it is that the character and form of penality are given to the principal mass of those directive rules by which the distribution of benefits as well as that of burthens is effected the matter of the civil code is in its form little else but a sort of exposition of the terms employed in the commands delivered by the penal code thus to give effect to the distribution made of property against the several acts by which it is invaded—usurpation for example or theft or endamagement—the law must afford the means of knowing what is each mans property and for this purpose employ some such word as titles to denote the several efficient causes of it but so long everywhere is the list of the different sorts of titles and so unavoidably complicated and voluminous the descriptions of the modes in which they may be acquired and lost that to insert all this matter of detail in the body of the penal code would give an altogether disproportionate bulk to the matter of the different sections which necessarily belong to it and in particular the several sections in and by which the several acts which have been distinguished and crected into offences have been described hence from the several passages in which in a penal code any such word as title occurs reference will be made to the division headed with some such word as titles in the civil code so again of the offences enumerated and defined in the penal code nonperformance of services due by contract or more shortly nonperformance of contract must necessarily be one but as of services the variety is infinite so of services to the rendering of which a man may seek to oblige himself by contract the variety is great correspondently great on the other hand is the variety of cases in which notwithstanding the entrance made into this or that contract it is not fit that the sanction of the law should be employed in enforcing the performance of it of the matter of the penal code the designation made is not complete until a designation has been made of all the sorts of acts which by it are dealt with in the character of offences of the matter of the civil code the efficiency would be throughout as nothing were not the several acts by which the distributions made by it are violated dealt with on the footing of offences yet there is no such correspondency between the one sort of matter and the other as to render it convenient that both together should be amalgamated into one and the same code for though there are some offences for the full and adequate description of which abundance of the sort of expository matter above spoken of is necessary—as for instance the offences by the creation and punishment of which protection is afforded to property—yet property is but one out of several endowments to which protection is afforded and some there are to the protection of which by appropriate arrangements of penal law no such voluminous masses of expository matter are requisite every man for example has on certain conditions and in certain modes a right to protection at the hands of law against such acts as are injurious to his person but for the designation of his title to his person or of    his title to such protection for it no such details are necessary as in the case of property and the like may be said with regard to reputation section iii subsistence original and allcomprehensive derivative and incidental means of subsistence by these words may be designated the two branches of a division which it is necessary in the first place to bring to view the original fund of each mans subsistence is each mans labour the production of it is the work of nature without law and antecedently to law what it looks for at the hand of law is security security against calamity security against hostility from foreigners from fellowsubjects and from rulers incidental and derivative means of subsistence the need of these arises out of the deficiences that are liable to have place in the produce of each mans labour considered as a fund for each mans subsistence certain and casual by the two distinctions thus designated may be comprehended in the first place all the varieties of which the cause of this deficiency are susceptible certain is the nature of those produced by time of life by the time antecedent to the capacity for labour and by the time subsequent to it by immaturity and by caducity the time of immaturity endures for years the time of caducity may endure for years or may terminate in the same moment in which it commenced want of capacity for labour want of employment for labour under one or other of these heads may be comprehended all the casual causes of deficiency in regard to subsistence casual want of capacity for labour is indisposition—relative indisposition indisposition may be of body or of mind the degree of indisposition in question is designated by the effect if against any of the causes of deficiency in regard to subsistence the government has failed to provide an efficient remedy the consequence is death security against calamity has so far failed to have been afforded but against deficiency in regard to subsistence no remedy can ever be provided but at the expense of security for abundance the fund of abundance is composed of the stock remaining of the produce of labour deduction made of the several amounts substracted by consumption useful and useless immediate and gradual natural and human in all their several shapes in his endeavour to provide a remedy against deficiency in regard to subsistence the legislator finds himself all along under the pressure of this dilemma—forbear to provide supply death ensues and it has you for its author provide supply you establish a bounty upon idleness and you thus give increase to the deficiency which it is your endeavour to exclude under the pressure of this dilemma how to act is a problem the solution of which will in a great degree be dependent upon local circumstances nor can anything like a complete solution be so much as attempted without continual reference to them one leading observation applies to all places and all times so long as any particle of the matter of abundance remains in any one hand it will rest with those to whom it appears that they are able to assign a sufficient reason to show why the requisite supply to any deficiency in the means of subsistence should be refused section iv abundance of the instruments of abundance the fund is composed of the surplus of the means of subsistence deduction made of the quantity destroyed by consumption in all its shapes increase of production—decrease of consumption under one or other of these two heads may be comprehended all the possible causes of increase to the abundance fund natural and factitious under one or other of these two heads may be comprehended all the possible modes of increase to production by natural understand all those that have place without intervention on the part of the government in this particular view under this same head natural is therefore comprehended whatsoever assistance is afforded to production by the security afforded to produce by factitious modes of increase to production understand all such as are employed by government in that special view here comes in with propriety one general and allcomprehensive rule in so far as the natural means of increase to the abundance fund suffice for the production of the effect forbear to employ any factitious means for giving increase or acceleration to it neither for this purpose nor for any other can the power of government be employed but coercion must be applied immediately in so far as the inducements employed are of the penal kind unimmediately in so far as the inducements employed are of the remunerative kind but it is only by coercion that any means of remuneration can be collected in favour and for the benefit of a you cannot seek to give increase to production in the hands of a except in so far as coercion is applied either to a himself or to b c and d and so forth but why seek to benefit a by coercion applied to a his regard for himself is greater than yours can be—his knowledge of what is most beneficial to himself is greater than yours can be—his experience of what has been most beneficial and most hurtful to himself is greater than yours can be why seek to benefit a by coercion applied to b c and d and so forth coercion is evil—positive evil—suffering absence of increase    is but negative evil no suffering is the result of it a is but one b c d and the rest of them are many by the number of them all after allowance made for the lessening of loss by the distribution of it is the quantity of the suffering produced by the coercion multiplied increase cannot thus be sought to be given to production otherwise than at the expense of equality by violations made of the rules of equality for the importance of which to the greatest happiness of the greatest number see further on for security yes without decrease and with increase to the greatest happiness of the greatest number the rules of equality may be infringed for increase to abundance without decrease to the greatest happiness of the greatest number they cannot be infringed the negative means of increase to the abundance fund is by decrease of consumption in so far as it is by voluntary decrease of consumption that decrease is made in the amount of the abundance fund by the respective proprietors pleasure and security in all their various shapes are the effects of it and are in proportion to it in the case of by far the greatest portion in quantity and value of the produce of labour subsistence pleasure and security in all their several shapes have place only in so far as consumption has place in each individual instance from which of two causes pleasure or security or both are derived by him in greatest quantity viz from consumption or from avoidance of consumption—in a word from preservation is better known to the proprietor himself than it can be to any body and not at all known to you the great cause by which decrease is produced in the abundance fund always without pleasure and in too great degree without proportionable security to the possessors is that which consists of the draughts made upon it by government the abundance fund being composed of savings made out of the subsistence fund includes in it the subsistence fund the materials or instruments of abundance are the materials or matter of subsistence diminution of consumption being one of the two means of increase to the abundance fund hence upon occasion where under the notion of providing security in all its branches for the several instruments of felicity draughts are made by government upon the abundance fund by taxes some indication may be afforded respecting the subjects on which with least detriment the taxes may be imposed with or without design in so far as a tax is imposed upon any article the consumption the use and thereby the production of it is discouraged to that article discouragement is applied and at the same time to all other articles in so far as they are rivals to it encouragement hence other effects laid out of the question for increase of the abundance fund with a view to subsistence there is a use in imposing taxes rather on objects to the use of which prompt consumption is necessary than on objects to the use of which slow and gradual consumption is sufficient on objects applicable to the purpose of subsistence of themselves and without exchange rather than on objects not applicable to that purpose otherwise than by exchange especially if not otherwise than by exchange with foreign or distant countries section v equality fourth on the list of the benefits which the civil branch of the law is occupied in distributing is equality by equality is here meant not the utmost conceivable equality but only practicable equality the utmost conceivable equality has place only in the field of physics it applies only to weight measure time and thence to motion the utmost conceivable equality say absolute equality admits not of degrees—practicable equality does admit of degrees equality is not itself as security subsistence and abundance are an immediate instrument of felicity it operates only through the medium of those three especially through abundance and security of all three taken together the use fruit and object is felicity—the maximum of felicity of this maximum the magnitude depends upon the degree of equality that has place in the proportions in which those three are distributed apply it first to subsistence—means or instruments of subsistence—subsistence taken in the strict sense there is not in this case a place for degrees in the scale of equality for by the supposition no inequality has place in this case as contradistinguished from the instruments of abundance by the means of subsistence is meant that least quantity of those instruments which is such that with any lesser quantity existence could not have place no subsistence no existence it is when applied to abundance—to the elements or instruments of abundance that the nature and with the nature the importance of political economy is most plainly discernible in the aggregate of the elements of abundance is included as above the aggregate of the means of subsistence if the aggregate of felicity were as the aggregate of the elements of subsistence no addition could be made by any degree of equality to the aggregate of felicity but so far is this from being the case that it is a question scarcely susceptible of solution whether where the aggregate of the elements of abundance is represented by the greatest number possible the aggregate of felicity is so great as or greater than two take on the one hand the daylabourer who    throughout life has had complete means of subsistence but at no time any portion of the elements of abundance take on the other part the monarch who throughout life has had the elements of abundance together with all the other instruments of felicity in the greatest quantity possible ages equal scarcely can any one assure himself by full persuasion that the quantity of felicity enjoyed by the monarch has been twice the amount of that enjoyed by the labourer for the quantity of felicity is not as the quantity of the elements of felicity simply but as the quantity of the elements of felicity and the capacity of containing the felicity taken together in a basin of water introduce anywhere a secret wastepipe inject through another pipe any quantity of water how great soever the vessel it shall happen will be never the fuller for as fast as it flows in at one part it flows out at another just so it is with the elements or instruments of felicity when a stream of them of boundless magnitude is injected into the human breast of pain in all its shapes a monarch is no less susceptible than the labourer and in its most common shapes the quantity of pain may be and frequently is so great as to outweigh the greatest quantity of pleasure in all its shapes of which human nature is susceptible even suppose pain in all its severe shapes absent during the whole time the quantity experienced the whole time suppose it a minimum this being the case in both situations still the question will remain insoluble as before for in both cases the quantity of felicity actually enjoyed depends on the degree of sensibility to enjoyment in each instance and while in the labourer the sensibility is a maximum the degree of sensibility in the monarch may be a minimum even supposing this sensibility to be at the same degree in both instances at a given time of life it is in the case of the monarch exposed to a cause of diminution which has no place in the case of the labourer for by high dozes of the exciting matter applied to the organ its sensibility is in a manner worn out and in fact number for number the certain probative symptoms or circumstantial evidences of infelicity as exhibited on the countenance are at least as frequent in the case of the monarch as in the case of the labourer apply the investigation to any of the situations intermediate between that of the labourer and that of the monarch the result will be the same the more closely the subject is looked into the more complete will the persuasion be of the enjoyments or instruments of positive felicity the principal and most unquestionable will be found to be as constantly and in as high a degree attached to the situation of the labourer as above delineated—the labourer to whom none of the means of subsistence have been wanting though none of the other elements of abundance have been present—as to that of the monarch the principal enjoyments of which human nature is susceptible constancy of repetition being considered as well as magnitude are—those produced by the operations by which the individual is preserved those produced by the operations by which the species is preserved that cessation from labour which is termed repose and that pleasure of sympathy which is produced by the observation of others partaking in the same enjoyments these four with the exception of repose are so many positive enjoyments upon the face of them cessation from labour presents it is true upon the face of it no more than a negative idea but when the condition of him by whom repose after corporeal labour is experienced is considered the enjoyment will be seen to be a positive quantity for in this case not merely a cessation from discomfort but a pleasurable feeling of a peculiar kind is experienced such as without the antecedent labour never can be experienced in the case of the labourer it may indeed be said that before the time of repose with its enjoyment arrives the labour is pushed to a degree of intensity of which pain in those degrees at least in which it is denoted by the word discomfort has been produced but the greater the degree of the pain of suffrance the greater the degree of the pleasure of expectation—the expectation of the pleasure of repose—with which it has been accompanied and this pleasure of expectation has had for its accompaniment the pleasures of expectation respectively appertaining to the other pleasures of enjoyment abovementioned sensibility with regard to each being increased by that very labour to the intensity of which that of the pleasure of repose is proportioned pursue the investigation throughout the several other enjoyments of which human nature is susceptible the ultimate result will not be materially different except in so far as security cannot be afforded to one man but by defalcation made from the security afforded to another where is the man to whom appropriate security ought not to be afforded for his person for his reputation or for his condition in life where is the man to whom for any one of those three possessions greater or better security ought to be afforded than to any other remains property as the only one of the four possessions in relation to which the application of the benefit of equality requires any considerate discrimination or reserve when and in proportion as by any cause defalcation to any amount is made from the mass of a mans property whether in possession or in contingency a correspondent defalcation there is always sufficient reason for believing is thereby made from the sum of his happiness    the defalcation thus made from happiness may have place without his being apprized of the defalcation made from his property such is the case for example where a man having in his possession a mass of property the exact amount of which is not known to him a defalcation not known or suspected by him is made from it whether by design or accident so again in case of contingency a gift or legacy being without his knowledge intended for him a third person intervenes and without his knowledge or suspicion prevents the intention from being executed in these cases happiness is diminished viz by diminution of pleasure but in these cases no positive pain is produced if with his knowledge and without his free consent a defalcation is made from the mass of his property in this case over and above the sort of negative defalcation made as above defalcation of a positive aspect is made viz by means of and in proportion to a particular pain which in some quantity or other he cannot fail to experience a pain of privation or a pain of loss are the names by which this species of pain has been distinguished if from the operation of a cause the same with or similar to that one from the operation of which a loss as above has been sustained by a man he is made to entertain the apprehension of ulterior loss produced by ulterior operations of the same cause another pain of a different description takes place in addition to the above this pain has been denominated a pain of apprehension grounded on loss if but for the loss thus incurred the man would have continued or engaged in some profitseeking and profitable course of labour or if he is by the apprehension of the like eventual loss prevented from continuing or engaging in such course—a loss to a further amount is thus produced and by means of it it will generally happen an additional and correspondent pain the loss has been denominated loss by depression of industry the pain pain from repression of industry of these four modes of defalcation from happiness by defalcation from property the two firstmentioned apply exclusively to the individual thus damnified and the circle of his connexions in the way of interest and sympathy from the two last by the observation of his suffering may be propagated as it were by contagion a cluster of similar evils in the breasts of other persons the number of whom will be determined by the number of those by whom intimation having been received of his loss apprehension comes to be entertained of loss to themselves or their connexions from the operation of the same cause or similar ones this pain to the extent of which that is to say to the number of persons participating in it no exact limits can be assigned has been denominated the pain of insecurity by contagion when a mass of property not as yet in the mans possession having been an object of expectation to him fails at the expected time to come into his possession disappointment on his part takes place—a correspondent pain is experienced by him a pain of disappointment correspondent to the pain of privation in case of defalcation is the pain of disappointment in case of expectancy in the case of the first of these evils if by the same cause by which it has been produced to one party good to an amount not inferior has been produced to another party no sufficient reason will have place for abstaining from the production of it where no expectation has had place no disappointment can have place in the exclusion of the above evils may be seen the only reasons why for property in any shape against the acts of persons of any description security should in any shape in any place at any time be afforded why for theft in any case for fraudulent attainment by any means for robbery for extortion for peculation in a word for depredation in any shape punishment should be appointed in the instance of each individual a particular point of time there is at which without defalcation made from security in his instance or in the instance of any other individual his property may be subjected to a distribution or other disposition whereby according to the amount of it advance towards absolute equality may be made this time is the time of a mans death in his instance no such evil is produced for he is no more in the instance of no other individual if sufficient and effective care has been taken to exclude expectation will evil be produced for the only evil incident to the case is disappointment and by the exclusion of expectation disappointment has been excluded whatsoever be the amount of a mans property if within a certain distance from him in the line of natural relationship relations of his knowing themselves to be such and known by him to be such are in existence an expectation of possessing at the time of his death the whole or a portion more or less considerable of that property with the expectation of such part if any as it is known will terminate at his death will in proportion to their several degrees of propinquity and correspondent amity be entertained—that is in the instance of such of them as in respect of age and other circumstances are capable of entertaining expectations of this nature in the instance of some of these persons this habit of expectation has had for its cause and support a correspondent habit of coenjoyment in this case are constantly a mans wife and children a womans husband and children incidentally any other such near relations especially bloodrelations whose circumstances in conjunction with his own have happened to    produce on their part such habit of coenjoyment on this occasion by the distribution which according to the natural course of things takes place abstraction made of arrangements established by positive law for the express purpose of controlling it equality and that without defalcation from security is promoted so various are the circumstances in which on the occasion of any such decease a family is capable of being left that in the way of detail it is impossible to pronounce by any general rule what course or plan of distribution is most natural what course or plan is in the highest degree conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in general terms thus much however may be said that among those by which equal regard is paid to the habit of coenjoyment other grounds of expectation and demand being on the same footing that course will be most beneficial which in its nature and in the conception entertained of it and the description given of it is the most simple say for example children or no children on the death of the husband the whole of his property to the widow on the death of the wife the whole of her property to the widower on the children the state of dependence in which they are thus left imposes no new hardship this dependence is but a continuation of existing dependence as between child and child on the decease of the widower or the widow equality this for a general rule is the most obvious and has the advantage of simplicity abstraction made of any difference of demand that may be regarded as produced by sex—in favour of an elder child in support of a claim on his part to a more than equal share may be adduced the longer continuance of his habit of coenjoyment but in favour of the younger in support of a claim on his part to a more than equal share may be adduced the more urgent need resulting from and proportioned to the deficiency in his capacity of providing the means of subsistence from his own labour in comparison with a brother or sister of maturer age of this latter reason the force presents itself as being superior to that of the former for the solution of these and a host of other difficulties altogether incapable of being aptly provided for by general rules provision may be made and very generally is made by a power of disposition given to the parents or one of them natural affection guided by ordinary prudence being in this case trusted to for the accomplishment of the universal object—the greatest happiness of the greatest number interested but neither are natural affection nor prudence in this case in every instance what it were to be wished they were this considered a course that may naturally enough present itself to the legislator is to divide the thus vacated mass of property into two parts one the division of which shall be determined by the single consideration of equality the other in relation to which the case of providing for the differences liable to be made in the proper quantum of allowance by the difference that may have place in respect of the quantity needed and the correspondent urgency of the demand is left to be provided for by natural affection guided by ordinary prudence as above in modern europe by the operation of causes produced by a state of society such as has no longer any place anywhere an arrangement altogether different from the above and as adverse as possible to equality of distribution and the beneficial effects depending on it has to a vast extent for many ages had place and continues to have place to females nothing to males if but one the whole if more than one to the eldest the whole to the other or others in whatever number nothing for this arrangement in times of high antiquity there existed a cause which was not wholly destitute of reason from external adversaries or from this or that portion of its own members and in particular from the great majority of them placed in relation to the ruling few in the condition of slaves the state of the whole community was a state of continual allpervading and imminent danger the mode of armament was at the same time compared with the immature state of the arts on the operations of which it depended a highly expensive one for defence in addition to the ordinary habiliments were others composed of iron for offence lances spears or bows and arrows lances were in an eminent degree exposed to fracture by a spear no chance of producing effect could be afforded but by its being parted with and conveyed to the adversary and so in the case of the arrow to these as well for offence as defence was added a horse nor for the defence of the horse was a sort of appropriate armour always refused bridles and saddles for him were at any rate necessary and employed or not employed food for him with a certain degree of attendance was at all times necessary to destruction or cessation the services of the animal were exposed at all times a succession was therefore necessary to be kept up by the conjunct operation of all these causes taken together to the maintenance of each individual whose powers were thus applicable to the defence of the community a mass of property continually kept on foot was indispensably necessary in the possession of any such individual suppose a mass of property sufficient but not more than sufficient for this purpose if upon his decease this mass of property were to be subjected to division the national force would thus be bereft of one of its constituent parts and in a state of society    in which the cultivation of the means of subsistence had made so small a progress so small was the number of the individuals thus equipped that no individual could be subtracted from the number without sensible diminution of national security from all labour employed in the production of the means of subsistence and the matter of abundance all persons thus engaged in the defence of the community stood exempted partly by necessity in respect of the need of the application of it to their military function partly by the power they had of exacting from others labour for those and other purposes for their own use in regard to exposure to the necessity of labour from this state of things has been produced in the minds of a certain portion of the community a division of the members of that same community into two classes one composed of those in whose instance the need of employing labour in the acquisition of subsistence and abundance is no hardship another composed of those in whose instance the need is a hardship the exigencies and habits of acting produced by this state of things have long been at an end everywhere but habits of thinking produced by it are scarcely at an end anywhere to descend from a higher to a lower place in the scale of opulence is a change which can neither be endured nor apprehended without uneasiness on the decease of any possessor of property living without labour laying out of consideration the widow or the widower no division can have place among the children but that at any rate if it be an equal one this inconvenience must be experienced—experienced by all of them in a degree proportioned to their number—if by the late proprietor a house of a certain extent and appearance with servants in a certain number and a table furnished at a certain expense were kept up in the comforts of all which during the life of the father the children had all of them in a greater or less degree and naturally in an equal degree participated—after the decease of the parent no such equal enjoyment except on condition of a degree of harmony not to be expected from equals so situated and not under the control of any superior nor in that case without universal renunciation of the comforts of matrimony could be maintained but in a situation of this sort such is the course taken by selfregard looking forward to the time in which in his own person he will have ceased to exist imagination presents to a man as a sort of substitute to his own person that of another who in nature denomination and in amount of property shall come as near to himself as one person can come to another a person whose body once formed a part of his own and in the rendering of whose mind a continuation of his own as much care and labour has been employed as it was agreeable to him to employ the usefulness of the benefit of equality stands then upon these positions—   the quantity of happiness possessed by a man is not as the quantity of property possessed by the same man   the greater the quantity of the matter of property a man is already in possession of the less is the quantity of happiness he receives by the addition of another quantity of the matter of property to a given amount   the addition made by property to happiness goes on increasing in such a ratio that in the case of two individuals—he who has least having at all times a quantity of the matter of property sufficient for a subsistence while he who has most possesses it in a quantity as great as any individual ever had or ever can have it is a question scarce capable of solution whether the one who has the greatest quantity of the matter of property has twice the quantity of happiness which he has whose quantity of the means of happiness in that shape is the least if this ratio of two to one be regarded as too small a ratio substitute to it the ratio of   to   the ratio of   to   and so on till you are satisfied you have fixed upon the proper ratio still the truth of the practical conclusion will not be affected this conclusion is that so far as is consistent with security the nearer to equality the distribution is which the law makes of the matter of property among the members of the community the greater is the happiness of the greatest number and accordingly this is the proposition which so far as can be done without preponderant prejudice to security ought at all times and in all places to be established and maintained as to absolute equality in relation to property such equality is neither possible nor desirable it is not possible because supposing it to have place at the commencement of any one day the operations of that one day will have sufficed to have destroyed it before the commencement of the next it is not desirable because never having had existence in any country at any time it could not have place in any country in future without having been endeavoured to be established in that same country in which case not only the endeavour but the very design alone accompanied with any assurance of its being about to be followed by the correspondent endeavour perseveringly exercised would suffice to destroy the whole of the value and the greatest part of the substance of the matter thus undertaken to be divided section vi rights and obligations correspondent to rights are obligations    without the idea expressed by the word obligation no clear or correct idea can be annexed to the word right rights are either simple or complex simple rights are the elements out of which complex rights are composed those which first come to be considered are simple rights an original or primary right is that which is constituted by the absence of the correspondent obligation this is the sort of right which has place antecedently to the formation of government it belongs equally to every agent and has place with relation to every subject no man as yet being under any obligation to abstain from making any use of anything every man has as yet a right to make every use of everything next come those rights the existence of which is constituted by the existence of correspondent obligations first comes that right which is constituted by an obligation imposed upon other men inhibiting them from exercising with relation to the subject in question the sort of right above designated by the appellation of an original or primary right call this a right by obligation to wit restrictive obligation—imposed by the addition of this secondary right the primary right acquires the character and name of an exclusive right if the birth of the exclusive right awaits a manifestation of the will of the person in whose favour it is created it receives the appellation of a right of excluding or say of exclusion in this case the word power is in use to be employed and we say accordingly right of exclusion or power of exclusion in the case of the right by exclusion or the right of excluding the subject to which the right and the exclusion apply may be an individual or a species an individual for instance the paper and the collection of marks called letters which have been superinduced upon it a species for instance any paper of the texture or appearance of this individual paper or any marks presenting to view in the same order the same words i e words of the same import as those which upon this paper are superinduced of this species of exclusive right to wit the exclusive right which applies to sorts of subjects the origin is of a date long posterior to that of the right which applies to individuals when as in the case of copyright the duration proper to be given to it came in question its nature and the mode of its formation were so imperfectly understood—so far from being clear and correct were the ideas suggested by the words employed in giving expression to it that the mass of argument produced by the contest exhibits a web of confusion no where unravelled of the original sort of right it was said that it presented something tangible of the more recently created sort of right it was said that it presented nothing tangible and in this supposed absence of tangible matter was found a sufficient reason for disallowing the right but it has just been seen that whereas in the case of the original right the quantity of tangible matter belonging to the case is but individual and therefore finite in the case of the more recently created right that quantity is a species and therefore infinite on the occasion of these rights will come to be considered the subjects to which they are applicable and also their efficient causes to wit the several states of things or occurrences by which they are wont to be respectively brought into existence section vii benefits and burthens of the distribution made of benefits the proper object is that the sum of them be as great as possible the distribution made of benefits has two classes of effects the first belong to the sensitive faculties only the other through the sensitive to the active those which belong to the sensitive faculties only are the effects universally produced throughout the whole of the field to which this branch of law applies itself those which operate on the active faculties are incidental only they consist of those produced by the subject matter of the distribution operating in the character of the matter of reward in the way of reward a benefit thus distributed is capable of being made productive of mischievous effects of two different descriptions according to the two modes of existence of which in respect of duration it is susceptible viz transitory and permanent the degree of permanency being in some cases in its nature not incapable of extending to perpetuity in the case where the benefit thus made to operate is of a transitory nature in so far as application is made of it to the production of mischievous effects it may be termed the matter of subornation instances are insurances against misfortune in every shape against sufferance by fire water ordinary mortality the law of succession has this mischievous tendency how effectually soever the tendency is in general counteracted and nullified by natural sympathy by the tutelary force of public opinion wagering is capable of receiving a subornative tendency when it does so it operates in that way by a double force by the force of punishment added to that of reward where the shape in which the benefit exists is the eventually perpetual shape and the operation of it extends itself to the active faculty the act by which it is established is what is styled foundation and in conformity to a grammatical ambiguity so extensively  0 prevalent the permanent result of that same transitory act is styled a foundation out of this law supported by no other than a remuneratory sanction thus limited may be and is made to grow in each instance an indefinitely extensive mass of law having for its support with or without remuneratory a penal or punitory sanction an example is seen in all foundations having the advancement of art and science in adults or nonadults for their object or pretence take for example a college in an english university out of a mass of income produced by an estate in land or an annuity payable by government certain annuities for life or years are distributed among certain of the members by the name of fellows and scholars the greater masses of the annuity being styled fellowships the lesser scholarships it is only on certain conditions that the possession of those several annuities can be made to commence or to continue to give to such or such an act or mode of conduct the effect of terminating the continuance of the annuity is to prohibit such act by a penal law having for its support the punishment consisting in the forfeiture of the fellowship or scholarship as the case may be in the value of the benefit thus denominated may be seen the limit on the side of increase of the mass of punishment which the laws of this foundation have for their support and by the force of this punishment punishment to any inferior amount may in this case be substituted according to certain opinions of the whole number of the individuals past present and to come belonging to the human species a majority or some other very large proportion are on the termination of the present life consigned to a state of torment exceeding in an infinite ratio as well in intensity as in duration the most afflictive that in this life has ever been experienced or can be conceived according to these same opinions there exists a certain class of persons so gifted that by certain acts performable by any one of them in favour of any individual chosen by him for that purpose diminution may be effected either to the probability of his being subjected to such torment or at any rate to the duration of it let an exemption to this effect be supposed obtainable the greatest mass of the matter of wealth that ever was possessed or ever could be possessed by any man would in the character of a reward for the service by which this exemption or rather this chance of exemption was afforded be as far from being equal in value to the service thus obtained as the value of the smallest denomination of coin would be to the value of the richest treasure ever accumulated within the compass of one and the same receptacle let these opinions be the political community in question what it may—let a set of opinions of this nature be universally nay let them be but generally prevalent it is evident that sooner or later human nature being constituted as it is amongst the effects of them would be the lodging in the hands of the persons thus gifted as large a portion of the good things of this world—of those benefits which it is in the nature of distributive law or of constitutional law to confer as it is in the nature of things that such hands should in the whole assemblage of them be capable of containing according to the nature of the event which is the subject of it lay a wager you may unite in that one arrangement the power of punishment and the power of reward lay a wager of £ 000 that a certain individual outlives a certain day you offer to the person with whom you lay the wager a reward of £ 000 for putting him to death on or before that day you subject him at the same time to a penalty of £ 000 in case of his not putting the man to death on or before that day thus it is that as it were in the three different languages—in the languages of these three different branches of law one and the same arrangement may stand expressed being expressed in the first instance in any one of these three languages it may be translated into one or both of the two others of the effect of any arrangement in the first instance as belonging to this or that one of these three branches would you have a clear correct and complete view grudge not the trouble of this legislators exercise render the cessation of a permanent reward eventual in the event of the performance of this or that act by the individual rewarded you graft on the reward a punishment render the cessation of a permanent punishment eventual in the event of the performance of this or that act by the individual punished you graft on the punishment a reward by donation or bequest give a man a hundred pounds ayear for his life remainder to his son for his life you offer to the son a reward of a hundred ayear life rent in the event of his putting to death his father to a certain extent in the instance of the law of most countries counter causes natural or factitious or both have sufficed for the most part to divest these distributive arrangements of their deleterious quality in the case of the wager the penal law against murder in the case of the donation or bequest the same penal law preceded and strengthened by natural affection and the habits that ground it thus on taking on the one hand a view of the deleterious influence of the temptation presented by arrangements which in the first instance may have presented themselves in no other character than that of arrangements of civil or distributive law operating on no other than the passive faculty care should be taken on the other hand not to suffer to pass unheeded the moral forces by which in the    character of tutelary sanctions the force of the temptation may be and in the ordinary state of things is effectually resisted unfortunately for mankind those salutary restraints which in ordinary cases operate with sufficient effect on a small scale operate with no effect at all or at the best with comparatively very small effect on a large scale acting with effect in the prevention of suffering producible to a small amount by men in the situation of individuals they act with little or no effect in the prevention of suffering producible by men in the situation of rulers in the course of some reign which it would not be material or perhaps altogether easy to particularize the law servants of an english king fabricated an imaginary law producing by the help of their power the effect of a real one giving to their master—not forgetting themselves—the proceeds of all such vessels as should be or rather as had been captured from the subjects of any foreign state antecedently to any declaration of war by him against such foreign state of this ex post facto law what was the effect offering to him a reward payable in the event of his giving in this way commencement to a war necessary or unnecessary justifiable or not justifiable if not necessary not justifiable—and if not justifiable giving commencement to a course of murder exceeding in mischief and in guilt any act punished by the hand of the ordinary judge in the instance of a private offender under the name of murder by the same amount by which the number of lives destroyed in the course and by means of the war exceeds number one supposing the war so commenced not until at the end of a competent time after such declaration of war would the profits of these murders in certain fixed proportions have been divisible among such of the persons as were employed in the capture of the respective vessels in this particular case in which at the time of the commencement of the plunderage no declaration of war has been made this part of the profits of it was by the abovementioned spurious substitute to an ex post facto law given to the most gracious and religious king whose instruments the fabricators of it were of a declaration of war the purpose intended or professed is by warning of sufficient length to enable persons who on the faith of a state of peace have trusted themselves or their goods within the reach of the state thus constituting itself in a state of war to remove themselves in time for escape by forbearing to issue this warning all such persons as if it had been given would have escaped the calamity are comprehended in it by subjects not commissioned for that purpose by their sovereign capture thus made would have given to the act by which it was made the denomination of an act of piracy and the agents the name of pirates of the distribution made of burthens the proper object is that the sum of them be as small as possible inseparable and separable—on this occasion this is the first distinction that requires to be made with regard to burthens by inseparable understand that class of burthens the imposition of which is in the instance of each individual benefit inseparable from the creation and collation of that same benefit with reference to the same individual possessor thus the exclusive possession of any subjectmatter of property cannot be conferred on any one man except in so far as all others are debarred from intermeddling with it but as in the case of any object of general desire the being allowed to make use of it is a benefit so the being debarred from making use of it is a burthen by separable burthens understand those which in their nature are not incapable of being imposed respectively upon any individual without the conferring of any correspondent and inseparably connected benefit on any determinate individual or set of individuals or the whole community taken in the aggregate in the case of this class of burthens comes in the first place the following rule—no burthen without a correspondent and preponderating benefit in so far as this rule is observed no burthen can in any case be imposed but that there are at least two parties whose interests are affected by it the party favoured and the party burthened to the party favoured the first place is here given for by this arrangement two mementos are given one is not to impose a burthen in any instance until some determinate party on whom a correspondent favour will be conferred by the imposition of it has been found the other memento is to consider and ascertain who or what is or are the parties on each side whether for example it is for the benefit of the many that the burthen is imposed upon the many upon the few or upon the one or for the benefit of the one or of the few that the burthen is imposed on the many but on every occasion without detriment to the greatest happiness of the greatest number a burthen may in any shape be imposed upon any individual or individuals in any number for the benefit of an individual or individuals in any number so that this condition be fulfilled viz that the sum of the benefits conferred be greater in value than the sum of the burthens imposed on this occasion when for the sake of a benefit intended to be conferred on one party a burthen is imposed on another party the burthen is apt to be either altogether overlooked or set down at a value less than its real one for the benefit being by the supposition the object that first presented itself to the mind and by its nature the more agreeable object such is the natural consequence    thus much as to the party in favour of whom the burthen is in contemplation to be imposed next comes the consideration of the serviceable object by the creation and collation of which the benefit is conferred in so far as for the purpose of conferring a benefit on one party a burthen is imposed on another an obligation and a right are by the same operation created having for their common subjectmatter a service to the one party a right to receive the service—to the other the obligation of rendering it services by which the possession of money is conferred and services at large—such is the division which how disproportionate soever the terms of it may appear requires to be made instead of services by which the possession of money is conferred money precision being sacrificed to brevity is a term which on this occasion must henceforward be employed to money in preference to services at large is the first place on this occasion assigned of money the equivalent of almost all those other services the comparative importance being so great and at the same time the conception at the utmost point of simplicity while of the objects thus contrasted with it the diversity is without end of the mass of burthens imposed by the exaction of money the first in extent and importance is that the imposition of which has for its object the provision made for the exigencies of the whole community taken together as such i e for the rendering of such services of which the whole community taken together stands in need this branch will be subject to a division which has its source in the nature of the different branches of the public service to the same head belongs the consideration of such monies as may be required for the service of the several portions of territory into which the whole of the territory belonging to the whole of the community stands divided for example—for roads rivers and all other communications by land or water provisions for security against calamity provisions for security against hostility on the part of internal adversaries by arrangements of a preventive nature and also such monies the employment of which has for its object the giving positive increase to the sum of felicity for example the establishment of public schools in regard to services by the exaction of which burthens are imposed on individuals for the benefit of individuals the first division that requires to be made is that between such services as require to be exacted in virtue and in pursuance of contract and such services as may require to be exacted without contract in the case of a contract a burthen is imposed on each side but on each side error and unforeseen evil consequences excepted a benefit more than equivalent to the burthen is received to enter into the details necessary to the laying down of the rules indicated by the regard due to the greatest happiness of the greatest number on the subjects of contracts—though the rules were no others than such as have application to all contracts without distinction—would require more room than could be allotted to such a subject consistently with the nature and limits of the present design the like applies to the case of such services as require to be exacted of individuals for the benefit of individuals without contract of these services the most extensive and most important class is of a negative description it is rendered by abstinence from all acts by which injury in any shape would be done to assignable individuals it is by the exaction of these services that security is afforded to individuals the art of government has therefore been the art of extracting from the persons over whom the powers of government are exercised service in all shapes in which it is regarded as contributing to the happiness of those same rulers services are extracted by fear through the medium of penal laws by hope through the medium of patronage by delusion through the medium of factitious dignity by penal laws it is only in this or that particular shape on this or that particular occasion that service can be extracted by patronage and factitious dignity it is extracted in all imaginable shapes and on all occasions chapter iv penal law the accession made to the stock of happiness by everything that is actually done by the power of the law is extremely small in comparison with that which is made by the expectation of what it eventually will do what it does by affording compensation in comparison with what it is expected eventually to do in the way of punishment in the way of compensation it makes not any positive addition to the stock of happiness all it does is to reduce a defalcation that has been made from the stock of happiness it creates not any instrument of felicity—towards augmentation or rather lessening the diminution in the stock of felicity all that it can do is by transferring a portion of the stock of these instruments from hands in which it would have produced less into hands in which it will produce more felicity this is the utmost which it does in the most favourable case the most favourable case is where at the charge of an indigent man injury having been sustained at the hands of a rich    man it affords him compensation at the charge of the rich man suppose that taking advantage of the injury to promote equality without detriment to security it renders the condition of the indigent man at the expense of the rich man better than it was before the injury still along with the good thus done factitious evil created by the law is mixed on the other hand whatsoever of good is produced by expectation of what the law will eventually do—all this good is pure the penal branch of law has for its object and occupation the giving execution and effect to the civil or distributive branch as also a portion of the constitutional branch such is the benefit conferred or sought to be conferred by it but no benefit as we have seen can have existence but with and by means of a correspondent burthen no profit without loss without expenditure and expense which is voluntary loss what remains is that in quantity and value the benefit—the profit—be as great the burthen—the loss—as small as possible for rendering it such keep in mind this radical allusion the community is the body politic misdeeds are its disorders occupied on the penal branch of law the legislator is its medical practitioner—its surgeon in a surgical operation the cure is the benefit the pain of the patient the burthen the operations of the surgeon have for their object the rendering the cure as prompt and as complete as possible at the expense of as little pain as possible the surgeon when he cuts into the bladder of the patient for the extraction of a stone—does he say the patient deserves to be so cut not he indeed by no surgeon was any such absurdity ever uttered the possessor of political power—the magistrate—the legislator—has at all times in all places uttered it without a blush why because at all times in all places till yesterday and in the new world the magistrate—the legislator—such is mans nature—have been tyrants tyrants having each of them for the object of his acts as such—not the greatest happiness of the greatest number but his own single greatest happiness in the origin from which he deduced the word indicative of the demand for or propriety of the punishment he was occupied in the application of—he found a pretence for tyranny for tyranny exercising itself in the taking of vengeance the term desert which is not applicable without hazarding the production of useless punishment to an indefinite extent is and ever was in use to be employed without hazard of any such evil where on the occasion of a contract for service between individual and individual good in the shape of reward was to be applied on the one part the work contracted for has been done—the service has been performed at the hands and at the expense of the other title has been made to the correspondent service the pay—the reward—has been deserved hence arise two radical positions—   objects which punishment ought never to propose to itself are vengeance establishment of imaginary congruity and equality between transgression and punishment   objects which punishment ought ever to propose to itself are compensation in so far as the nature of the case admits of the application of it for the evil produced by the misdeed prevention of the commission of similar misdeeds in future as well by the misdoer himself as by all other individuals taken at large exacted at the expense of the evil doer compensation necessitates suffering exacted in consideration of and in proportion to the evil done by him that suffering by the whole amount of it operates as punishment in the first place compensation for the party injured in the next place over and above compensation punishment for the benefit of the public and punishment for appeasement of the wrath of the offended and wrathful monarch—such is the arithmetic of tyranny punishment including to the profit of the monarch the exaction of the whole of that matter by which compensation to the individual injured might have been afforded after that compensation or no compensation to the individual injured—such is the order the method of tyranny compensation by one course of procedure punishment by another and a different course of procedure reformation by health given to the soul by a third and different course of procedure such is the arithmetic of lawyercraft—confederate partner and instrument of tyranny of lawyercraft in its most rapacious character and elaborate garb—the character and garb of the english lawyer compensation and satisfaction are synonymous of the word compensation the psychological import has its root in the physical idea of weight compensation is weight for weight satisfaction is giving enough for what has been suffered in such sort that the weight of the good in the scale of enjoyment shall be equal to the weight of the evil in the scale of suffering satisfaction has been distinguished into lucrative and vindictive lucrative is satisfaction in any shape considered otherwise than with a view to vengeance vindictive satisfaction is satisfaction in any shape considered with a view to vengeance in no shape or quantity should suffering be created for the single purpose of affording satisfaction of the vindictive kind only when for the sake of the community at large punishment is inflicted if there be any shape by which without increase of suffering to the wrongdoer satisfaction to the individual wronged may be administered that shape may be employed    by that shape the apprehension of the eventual punishment may moreover be rendered the more impressive upon the mind of him on whom the temptation to do the wrong is operating to the word punishment lawyercraft in confederacy with religious fraud and hypocrisy—and in subserviency to monarchical tyranny has of late years furnished a synonym—viz visitation—penal visitation in the language of the english translation of the bible visitation is employed as synonymous to punishment synonymous but in what case—where the misdoer being a man the ruler is the invisible almighty considered in this point of view sin is the name employed for the designation of the misdeed of the almighty invisible whose throne is in heaven the monarch is the visible representative here on earth the representative according to the certificate given to him by blackstone invested with no small part—with as large a part as is necessary for the accomplishment of the indisputable object of his government—the greatest happiness of him in comparison of whom all others are but as creatures to their creator—invested in a word with a completely sufficient part of his divine constituent attributes by the alleged offender a misdeed has been committed by this misdeed the monarch has been offended the monarch being god upon earth the offence is a sin sins deserve to be visited for this his sin this sinner deserves to be visited at the charge of him by whom sin has been committed punishment is due proportioned to the dignity of the offended ruler should be the magnitude of the punishment where the offended ruler is that god which is in heaven dignity being infinite that punishment ought to be and is in each instance infinite where the offended ruler is that god which is on earth the punishment ought not to be infinite it ought only to be next to infinite were justice alone consulted such accordingly would be the punishment of this sinner but in the heart of that god which is upon earth and with us justice has for her neverfailing companion and appeaser mercy mercy has for her function the rendering of no effect to an amount more or less considerable the decrees of justice in this as in all other cases mercy has interposed and—after deducting from what has been ordained by justice what has been substracted from it by mercy—the balance forms that punishment which the sentence is about to declare in relation to punishment considered as so much evil employed as a means for excluding—as far as possible without greater evil evil considered as producible by misdeeds thus converted into offences three main questions on every occasion present themselves in what cases shall punishment be applied in what proportion in what shape in what cases shall it be applied to a question of the opposite aspect—the question in what cases shall it not be applied—a more commodious howsoever indirect answer may be given where it would be groundless where it would be needless where it would be inefficacious where it would be unprofitable in each one of these cases supposing them realized punishment it is evidently manifest would be unapt of all these cases it may be said they are unmeet for punishment case the first—where punishment would be groundless where the application of punishment would be unapt necessarily included in the notion of punishment is the notion of misdeed done of offence given of the sort of operation by which for the exclusion of greater evil evil is purposely produced the operation called punition or more commonly punishment is but one mode for taken by itself government is in itself one vast evil only except in so far as evil already produced by it is done away or lessened can any exercise of government be performed—can the power of government be in any way exercised but evil is produced by it but wherever by evil thus produced greater evil is excluded the balance takes the nature shape and name of good and government is justified in the production of it in this case in the account of good and evil the evil produced and applied in the shape of punishment would unless it excluded some greater evil or produced some preponderant good be all loss thus it is that where evil applied as punishment would be groundless what will often happen is—that evil produced though designedly is not causeless—is not unjustifiable where it would be needless here the circumstance from which the evil receives the denomination of punishment viz misdoing offence has place as such evil is among the consequences of it but by the operation of some other cause all the relative good that could be done by the evil of punishment is done without it in this case therefore whatsoever portion of punishment were applied would be all loss where it would be inefficacious in this case too be the evil of the offence ever so great the evil of punishment though it could not be said to be needless would however be all loss to the undiminished evil of the offence would be added the evil of the punishment where the punishment would be unprofitable of the evil which in its totality would otherwise be produced by the offence a portion more or less considerable would be excluded by the punishment but the evil thus introduced is greater than the evil excluded by it in the three former cases the evil of the    punishment is all loss in this last case the evil produced is not all loss but after deducting from the sum of what is produced by it the sum of what is excluded by it there still remains on the balance a net remainder or difference which is so much loss comprehensive and on that account theoretical as the description of these cases may appear there is not one of them that has not to a vast and deplorable extent had its exemplification in practice to afford an indication of every one of them would be to give an allcomprehensive picture of whatever has been hitherto done on the field of penal law rules tending to augmentation of punishment— in no case leave to the evildoer any net profit from his evildoing in adjusting the quantum have regard to all the several articles in the list of aggravating circumstances circumstances aggravating either the evil of the offence or on any other score the demand for punishment see whether any have had place in the case in question in no case suffer anticonscientious pursuit or practice to go unpunished whether principal or incidental whether at the commencement the party were in the wrong or in the right for by a man whose demand is just anticonscientiousness may have been manifested by the practice employed in the pursuit of it in particular if the anticonscientiousness be accompanied with mendacity rules tending to diminution— to the account of punishment place every pecuniary loss or other hardship produced on the part of the injurer by compensation afforded at his expense to the injuree so every suffering produced on his part by means of the pursuit whether by pecuniary expense by loss of time or by vexation in any other determinate shape chapter v procedure law† the penal branch of law as already observed has for its object and occupation the giving execution and effect to the civil or distributive branch as also a portion of the constitutional branch both together compose the substantive branch of law the law of judicial procedure constitutes the adjective branch of law this adjective branch has for its object and occupation the giving execution and effect to the aforesaid substantive branch for the production of this effect the requisite means are right decision and conformable execution to the positive expression right decision substitute an expression with a negative aspect it will stand thus—avoidance of misdecision in so far as the law is of a beneficial nature giving execution and effect to it will bating accidental preponderant evil be in a like manner a benefit but as above in the field of law no benefit can have place without its attendant burthen the burthens inseparably attendant on judicial procedure stand comprised the whole assemblage of them within the import of three words—vexation delay and expense to give to the benefit the utmost practicable extent to confine the burthen within the narrowest practicable limits—to these two perfectly distinct but intimately connected modes of promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number the one positive the other negative it belongs to the legislator to direct his operations here then we have two conjunct ends of judicial procedure main or direct end right decision or say avoidance of misdecision collateral end avoidance of vexation expense and delay decision is right in so far as by giving execution and effect to it the will expressed by the law is conformed to—the eventual predictions delivered by the law carried into effect here then on every occasion is a standard composed of a certain portion of a certain text of the law to which to give warrant to his claim by him by whom a call is made for execution and effect to be given to the law reference direct or implied must be made but to constitute any such claim the existence of some individual matter of fact or state of things must be asserted and in consideration of the existence of this matter of fact a demand must be made that execution and effect may be given to that same corresponding portion of the body of the law misdecision is liable to be produced—either by the nonexistence of any portion of law applicable to the case or by the misinterpretation of this or that portion of law applicable to the case in the former of these cases if any decision at all—if any decision to any other effect than that of the rejection of the claim be pronounced by the judge misdecision is an appellation which with unquestionable propriety may be applied to it for in this case by the supposition there is no ground for it in this case are all decisions whatsoever in so far as they have for their pretended ground the sort of nonentity called common or unwritten law a spurious ground which by the supposition is not the work of the legislator—is not the work of any person having authority to make law or so much as claiming authority to make law    in the supposition of misdecision from misinterpretation the supposition of the existence of a portion of real law applicable to the case is involved where there is nothing to interpret no such thing as misinterpretation can have place in the first case the evil has for its manifest cause negligence on the part of the legislator this negligence has not at present either justification or any the least shadow of excuse in the early stages of society the evil was not the result of negligence the nature of things rendered it an unavoidable one particular cases presenting a demand for legislation had not as yet presented themselves in any quantity or variety capable of affording any adequate idea of any extensive much less of any allcomprehensive body of law all this time as often as compensation or satisfaction for evil suffered at the hand of another was claimed the judge if he did any thing did as he would have done if a law had been already made containing the description of a genus or species of case in which the individual case before him was comprehended in the case of every decision thus pronounced the very sort of evil had place which in the present state of things is produced by what is called an ex post facto law on the part of the defendant no expectation of finding any such burthen imposed upon him previously entertained no cause for abstaining from the act on the ground of which the burthen was imposed present to his mind consequence on his part sufferance from a burthen which had a law to the effect in question been already in existence and sufficiently known to him might not have had place what in this case is neither impossible nor out of the ordinary course of things is—that by some general conception of the several sorts of acts by which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is liable to be impaired he may have been led to the conception that the act for which the burthen has been imposed upon him is in its nature of that number and on that score might come to be taken by a judge as a sufficient cause for dealing with him as in effect he has been dealt with but in comparison with a state of society which furnishes a real law actually applying to the case how wretched that state of society cannot but be in which the rule of action is left in an ever floating state must be sufficiently obvious on any part of the field of human action a body of law conceived in general terms cannot have been framed on adequate grounds except in so far as a certain stock of individual cases spread over that same ground and constituting a demand for legislation—have rendered themselves present to the mind of the legislator the greater the length of time during which the government in question has continued in existence the greater the extent of the country and of the population subject to it the greater will have been the number of those individual cases that will have presented themselves to the cognizance of the judge but let the stock of those cases thus presented have been ever so numerous only in proportion as some unperishable memorial has been made of them can they have had the effect of contributing to furnish the legislator with this necessary ground memorials affording indication more or less particular of individual cases of this sort as having on such or such grounds called for decision at the hands of the judge and on such and such grounds received decision accordingly are in the language of english jurisprudence called by the common appellation of reports in no other country upon earth have these indispensable grounds for apt legislation presented themselves invested with permanence by the press in any variety or extent comparable to that which stands exemplified in english jurisprudence thus it is that from a combination of causes for which no room can be found here no country upon earth affords so rich and apposite a stock of materials and grounds for legislation while on the other hand by an unhappy fatality no civilized country on earth can be assigned which is so likely to be the last in which the appropriate use of those riches will have been made on the occasion of each individual course of judicial procedure there are two necessarily distinguishable questions—the question of law and the question of fact whether the state of the law is as alleged and whether the state of facts is as alleged if so it be that the state of the law is really as alleged the bringing to the view of the judge that part of the law on which the claimant grounds his claim cannot be attended with much difficulty not so the bringing to view the state of facts the means or instruments by which a state of facts is thus brought to view and the persuasion of its existence endeavoured to be established in the minds of those to whom it appertains to form a decision in relation to it are called the evidences or by one collective appellation the evidence under one or other of two denominations—things and persons—every imaginable source of evidence will be found comprisable it is not to any comparatively great extent that for a purpose such as this things themselves—material bodies—can without the intervention of persons be brought within the view of the judge in the most common case it is only by the account given of it—by the report made of it—by the discourse held or the deportment exhibited in relation to it by some person or persons denominated on this occasion witnesses that the state of things in question real or alleged is brought to the view of the judge    so far as depends upon the single exertions of the claimant himself in the bringing to view on each occasion the mass of evidence thus described there will not in general be much difficulty but most commonly for the production of the necessary mass of evidence in addition to or instead of all operations performable by the claimant himself appropriate operations performed by other persons neither to the number of whom nor to the distance of whose residence from the seat of judicature can any determinate limits be assigned may be necessary and in the instance of each such person either willingness or reluctance may to any degree have place here then for one main purpose viz the yielding evidence there will on each occasion be a need that either things or persons or both should be forthcoming at the seat of judicature here accordingly one main problem presents itself for solution at the hands of the legislator—how to secure forthcomingness on the part of persons and things for the purpose of evidence saving the accidental case of a mutually voluntary application of the possessors of two conflicting interests for a decision at the hands of the judge—a claim of this sort cannot be preferred without experiencing at the hands of some other person or persons more or less reluctance if not in reality at any rate in belief the object of the claim will always be some benefit but no benefit as before mentioned can exist without a correspondent burthen the benefit required at the hands of the judge by the claimant cannot be granted but in so far as upon some other person or persons a correspondent burthen is imposed for the attainment of this benefit to cause this burthen to be imposed will throughout be the object and continual endeavour of the one party to avoid the imposition of it that of the other party who will act on the occasion the part of a defendant where punishment is out of the question at the commencement of any course of judicial procedure the natural state of things is in the first place on the part of the claimant voluntary appearance at the seat of judicature for the purpose of preferring his demand thereupon from the judge if upon hearing the claim a sufficient ground has been made for subjecting the other party to the vexation inseparable from defence summons to that party either to do that which the claim requires him to do or to appear at a certain day and hour at that same seat of judicature to defend himself against it this is the most obvious and upon the face of it the least vexatious mode of giving commencement to a suit but there are various circumstances by which a departure from it in some way or other may be rendered matter of convenience or even of necessity as where by a party on the defendants side he knowing himself to be in the wrong his person or any property of his would be to be disposed of in any manner burthensome to him by the decision of the judge voluntary appearance on his part cannot reasonably be to be depended upon by bare notice to him of that which is in contemplation to be done the possibility of its being done may be done away when the suit has commenced let evidence be received from any and every source—exclude none for if any evidence is excluded there will be danger of misdecision as a security against improper conduct on the part of the judges and all other functionaries the utmost publicity must be given to all judicial proceedings chapter vi financial law the financial department is that by which is performed the extraction custody and expenditure of such money and moneys worth as is employed or professed to be employed in the public service viz in this and the several other branches of the public service whatsoever be the public function by the exercise of which service is rendered or pretended to be rendered to the public or to any part of it money or moneys worth or both are in a quantity more or less considerable necessary to be employed and disbursed on the occasion of its being rendered the financial branch is thus a branch which intertwines itself and runs through the several other branches of the public service this branch of government has for its proper end that branch of good economy which consists of appropriate frugality of economy there are two branches the one positive or say distributive the other negative or say restrictive the distributive branch has for its object the due appropriation of the aggregate of the sums levied to the several services for which they are levied the restrictive branch has for its object avoidance of all exaction the burthensomeness of which is not outweighed by the usefulness of the application made of it for judging of the consistency of any mass of expenditure with the proper ends of economy take for a test this directive rule with the alleged benefit alleged to be expected from the expenditure compare the unquestionable burthen produced by a tax to the same amount forego the benefit the burthen is excluded taken in its narrowest and most ordinary sense economy in a state has for its subjectmatter money and moneys worth taken in    its most extensive sense it comprehends the matter of reward in those additional shapes in which it is to government that it is indebted for its existence—viz power and factitious honour in what way may the principle of minimization and other safeguards be applied with the greatest advantage to the case of money by observation of the following rules viz— except as excepted suffer no man to make for himself profit in any shape from public money deposited in his hands or at his disposal in the instance of each functionary having in charge any of the public money minimize the quantity of it not suffering to be lodged in the hands of any moneykeeping functionary money in any quantity exceeding the sum in relation to which he has obtained fidejussors bound by agreement on their part to the eventual payment thereof into the hands of some government functionary in the event of his failing to pay it when called upon in due course if there be or can be brought into existence any bankingcompany of sufficient pecuniary trustworthiness who are willing to receive public money upon the ordinary terms—keep as much as may be in their hands ordering matters at the same time by law in such sort that in case of failure the public shall have the preference as against all private creditors by this means instead of paying functionaries of its own for the keeping of the public money in their charge the government may so order matters as to receive a compensation for money so deposited by it the keeping of money by the government of a country in treasuries of its own is but a makeshift employed by necessity where no sufficiently trustworthy bankingcompany for the keeping of it can be found by some governments the concurrence of functionaries more than one has been rendered necessary to the issue of each sum from a public treasury and to render this concurrence necessary physical means have been employed such as the rendering the opening of locks more than one necessary to the extraction of it locks to the opening of which so many keys of different forms are necessary and allotting to that same number of persons the custody of the keys in russia such has accordingly been the practice as appears by an ordinance of the empress catherine creative of an official establishment for the several provinces of the empire the inconvenience here is that there must be a number of functionaries unremittingly occupied and on account of the constancy of their attendance and the magnitude of the trust highly paid in every department of the public service good managment has two perfectly distinguishable branches the first peculiar to itself being correspondent to the particular nature of the service the other common to it with all the others—this universally applying branch of good management is frugality considered in another point of view the peculiar and characteristic branch here spoken of may be styled the positive branch this which is common to all the negative branch the dictates of frugality are conformed to in so far as without preponderant prejudice to good management in other respects money and moneys worth is avoided to be disbursed or consumed in a representative democracy all the several departments having for their actual end good management as applied to each the financial department has for its actual end frugality as above defined in a pure monarchy when that expenditure which is employed in giving supply to that waste by which gratification is afforded or endeavoured to be afforded to the appetites of the monarch his favourites and instruments—of which the expense of the war department constitutes always the most expensive article this branch has for its actual end the same as that which in a representative democracy it has viz frugality the same with whatsoever inferiority in respect of uniformity steadiness and success pursued even in the war department frugality is in all the details an object actually pursued of the dictates of frugality the only one purposely violated is that by the observance of which by far the greatest part of the whole expense of this department would be struck off viz that part which has for its object the carrying on a perpetual offensive war against the subject many instead of keeping their physical force without expense in a state of constant preparation for defensive war against foreign nations in a limited monarchy the financial department has for its actual end the opposite of frugality waste—the maximum of waste under this form of government this waste has three objects— personal gratification to the several appetites of the ruling one and the subruling influential and opulent few this object in so far as regards the appetites of the ruling one it has in common with absolute monarchy corruption exercise of corruptive influence for the purpose of securing corrupt obsequiousness on the part of those whose declared duty and professed endeavour it is to keep applied to the respective powers of the monarch and the subruling portion of the aristocracy those limitations which they respectively acknowledge corrupt obsequiousness to the effect of causing them to forbear from keeping actually applied those several limitations thus rendering the government in form and pretence limited in effect to the benefit of the ruling one and the subruling influential and opulent few to the sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number    delusion—in so far as the waste applies itself by means of corruptive influence to the production of corrupt obsequiousness on the part of those selfacknowledged and selfprofessed trustees for the whole community it employs itself in rendering them and in so far as it produces its intended effect it actually does render them by so much inferior in respect of public virtue and good behaviour—in respect of benevolence and that beneficence which is the fruit of benevolence upon the largest scale—inferior to the rest of the community taken at large inferior to the subject many inferior to the vast majority of the whole population of the country in the same proportion as those on whose part corrupt obsequiousness is produced are rendered inferior in these respects are those rendered by whose corruptive influence this corrupt obsequiousness is produced or at least in an equal degree inferior in so far as with reference to that better and happily larger portion of the whole community they are regarded as being in the scale of public virtue and good behaviour superior or equal delusion has place raising up to its maximum the degree and effect of this delusion is a third purpose in which under this form of government public waste employs itself in proportion to the quantity in which the waste employs itself in the affording of gratification to the appetites of the individuals in question and by the whole of that quantity the purpose of delusion is completely accomplished and the purpose of corruption in a principal degree to screw up the effect of corruptive influence to its maximum may probably require endeavours to an amount more or less considerable specially directed to that purpose such endeavours being accordingly nowhere and never wanting—means are wanting for pronouncing by any sufficiently grounded judgment whether without such endeavours the mere possession of that same or any other quantity of the subject matter of waste operating of itself in the character of matter of corruptive influence would in the hands in question be adequate to the production of the actual effect be this as it may it will be if it is not already sufficiently manifest that by the same quantity of the matter of wealth thus expended in waste by the hands in question in addition to the gratification of the several appetites those two other purposes corruption and delusion—all three though so inseparably connected so perfectly distinguishable from each other are produced look for example to the situation of the monarch in the procuring to him for example that sort of gratification which is afforded by quick motion together with prompt conveyance at all times to the several different places at which a promise is afforded of successive gratification to his several other appetites—horses in vast multitudes each in respect of its capacity of affording gratification to those by whom it is used and abused brought by a long and expensive course of training to the most exquisite degree of perfection possible—the labour of men in correspondent multitudes having been exclusively consecrated to this one purpose a proportionable quantity of money has necessarily been employed but for an establishment of this kind good management so far as regards aptitude for the service is really desired in the hands of an individual and not in those of a board is this branch of the public service accordingly lodged for were it in the hands of a board each member in reality as well as in name and pretence bearing a part in the business what is sufficiently understood is—that there never would be a horse fit for service each member would appoint to the management of one of the sacred horses some dependant of his who had never had anything to do with horses constituting a necessary exception to the general rule this branch of the public service will therefore of necessity have found itself in individual hands for performing in the best possible manner this important service were this the whole of the service thought fit to be required at the hands of the individual an extremely moderate annual salary not more than ten or twenty times the expenditure of an individual whose severe and bodily labour is employed in the production of the money for the purchase and maintenance of these fourfooted and preeminently favoured subjects of a monarchy would be sufficient but in this instance good economy in an additional shape is found practicable and profitable instead of no more than ten or twenty times the salary necessary for the maintenance of an individual of the productively labouring class let two hundred or though it were but one hundred times that amount be allotted individuals might in the very highest rank next to that of the royal family be found—individuals in multitudes who being in a state of constant appetency for such a place and thence in a state of constant competition with each other will thereby be placed in a state of equally constant and proportionably abject and corrupt obsequiousness with relation to the corruptive influence exercised with or without his caring or thinking anything about the matter by the royal proprietor of these consecrated quadrupeds so many as there are of these competitors so many men are there whose votes and in so far as they have the faculty of speech their speeches are in readiness to contribute to the fulfilment of the will and the gratification of the correspondent appetite of him whom it is their ambition to be entitled to designate by the appellation of their royal master thus much as to the effect in that house which is styled right honourable but in some if not all these instances what will have place  0 moreover is that to these several superlatively although it be but positively noble persons may appertain through the medium of this or that borough or of this or that county a seat or seats to the number of from two to ten in that other house so inferior in dignity so superior in power which in style and title is no more than simply honourable of the appetites to which in the case of the monarch gratification is sought to be afforded one nor that the least voracious is—that appetite or desire of esteem respect love or at least the exterior evidences of them true or false—that desire which notwithstanding the complicatedness of its object is in one word commonly designated by the appellation of pride proportioned to the depth to which the humiliation of the individual at whose expense this gratification is afforded descends is the intensity of the gratification but proportioned to the antecedent elevation of this individual in the scale of dignity natural or factitious or both together is the relative depth of the humiliation to which on any given occasion for any particular purpose he is capable of lowering himself by the holding of the bridle of a favourite horse while the royal master is in the act of mounting—by this or any other act performed in the execution of his office the utmost length of the descent capable of being made by the man the magnitude of whose salary was determined by no higher mark of value than that which corresponded to the skill possessed and exercised by him in the field of this particular office and profession could not at the utmost be any greater than that which corresponds to the difference between the pay of this official functionary and the pay of an ordinary groom but the amount of the pay which in consideration of the exalted station occupied by the titled and most noble though unskilled attendant upon horses is ten times the amount of the pay which it would be convenient and advisable to give to the untitled but wellskilled functionary and thereby a hundred times the amount of that which good economy would require to be given to the untitled and unskilled attendant the consequence is that if as between the inward sensation and the external cause—between the quantity of actual gratification and the quantity of the instrument of gratification—the proportion were correspondent and kept pace—the intensity of the gratification afforded to the royal rider by the view of the humiliation submitted to by the most noble holder of the horse would be ten times the amount of the gratification afforded to a most excellent king by the view of the humiliation if any submitted to by the untitled but wellskilled holder thus it is that one and the same quantity of the matter of wealth employed in waste—wasted in the vain endeavour to inject an additional quantity of happiness into a receptacle over and over again disabled from the capacity of receiving any more—this same quantity of wealth is employed to the three purposes at once viz gratification of the royal appetites securing of corrupt obsequiousness and the production of delusion in the case where production of corrupt obsequiousness was the object the persons on whom the operation was performed were the subruling influential and opulent few with no other addition than that of that comparatively small portion of the subject many to whom the corruptive influence of these their superiors could be applied for the purpose of producing correspondent corrupt obsequiousness in the case of delusion the persons on whom the effect is endeavoured to be produced are in addition to the subruling the influential and the opulent few—for these are not less exposed to nor less susceptible of the delusion than the many—the subject many likewise—in a word the whole of the community without exception—the royal chief himself by whom the benefit of the delusion was reaped in the greatest abundance not excepted the opinion endeavoured to be inculcated in the case in question is that the quantity of the matter of wealth so employed and produced if not employed in the making a clear addition to the happiness of the greatest number is employed at any rate to some other equally or superiorly proper purpose whatsoever be the quality or other thing designated by the word excellency such is the excellence that belongs to them whether it be exaltation in the scale of virtue public or private or both or exaltation in any other scale of still superior dignity—say for example piety that whatsoever quantity of the matter of wealth instead of being left in each instance at the disposal of those by whose labour and capital it has been produced—is employed in the endeavour to afford additional gratification to the appetites of these same exalted persons is employed in a manner more useful more dignified or on some other account more laudable than it would have been had it been left to pursue its original destination as above in regard to usefulness if so plain and vulgar an effect and quality were regarded as worth attending to it would lie on those by whom on this ground this diverting of the matter in question from its originally intended destination to this new one were justified to prove it but in regard to this quality the existence of it being altogether incapable of being proved is of necessity and with the utmost composure assumed if ever the existence of it should be endeavoured to be proved it would of necessity be in some such shape as this the quantity of obsequiousness necessary to the production of good government and thence if so pedantic uncourtly democratical jacobinical anarchical and impious a phrase be insisted upon    the greatest happiness of the greatest number is by means of the application thus made of the quantity in question of the matter of wealth actually promoted but as if of that quantity of wealth no part at all were thus employed civil society would not to any effect have existence so by any and every defalcation made from the quantity of that precious matter thus applied a proportionable defalcation from the quantity of happiness enjoyed by the greatest number would be made to this latter assertion there are two answers one is—that it is a mere assertion altogether destitute of any ground that ever has been attempted to be made or in the nature of the case is capable of being made good the other is—that such experience as the nature of the case has been capable of furnishing operates the whole of it in contradiction to this same assertion the political states by which this body of experience has been furnished are the confederated body of the angloamerican states original number of them at the time of their declaration of independence thirteen that number by successive accessions augmented to its present number twentytwo or twentythree in no one of these has the matter of wealth in any quantity whatsoever been applied to the gratification of personal appetite in any shape either to the person of the chief or any other functionary or to the purpose of producing by means of corruptive influence corrupt obsequiousness or to any purpose to which the appellation of delusion can with any propriety be applied if in the situation of the chief functionary of the whole confederacy the matter of wealth has in any quantity been applied to any one of these purposes so small is the utmost quantity that can be suspected of being so applied that it can scarcely with reference to any such subject as that in question be spoken of as worth notice the sources or modes actual and customary of wasteful expenditure may be distinguished into two classes having quantity for their mark of distinction—viz wholesale and retail the wholesale may again be distinguished into those which are essential to the form of government and those which howsoever congenial are incidental to it the matter of wasteful expenditure essential to the form of government is in the case of an absolute monarchy the difference between the pay of the monarch and the least pay sufficient for the president of a representative democracy in the case of a limited monarchy it is that same quantity with the addition of the quantity employed in the works of corruption and delusion as already seen corruption applied more immediately to the representative of the people delusion applied more efficiently and needfully to the people themselves pensions of retreat may be stated as being altogether needless and to say that which is thus disposed of is given needlessly is to say that it is given in waste allowances thus made may either be made with certainty in virtue of general rules applied to all individual cases or incidentally for special cause assigned in each individual case to the first case preferably at least if not exclusively apply the observations following labour applied directly to a mans own use or indirectly in exchange for an equivalent given by an individual in return for it is one source of subsistence labour employed for an equivalent in the service of government that is of the public at large is another source in the first case generally speaking no such allowance of reward after service has ceased has place in the case of him whose subsistence is derived from dealings with the public at large as in the case of a wholesale or retail trader a mastermanufacturer an artisan or a manufacturer it is impossible in the case of habitual service rendered by contract to an individual there is no custom for it the case of incapacity produced by age or disease is a case equally open to expectancy in both instances from the time of his embarking in his profitseeking occupation a man makes for all such contingencies such provision as his means enable him to make and his prudence disposes him to make for the securing to individuals any such extraordinary supply at the expense of the public there is if there be any difference less demand in the case of an occupation pursued by the rendering of service to the public for hire than in the case of him whose subsistence as above is derived from commercial dealings with individuals in the case of a public functionary a mans income is completely certain—certain as to its existence certain as to its quantity in the other case it is altogether uncertain in both respects among profitseeking occupations at large there are those to a great extent in the whole in which by the nature of the occupation men are exposed to the danger of ceasing to derive subsistence from that or any other source with the single exception of military service by land or water no such exposure has place in the case of public functionaries    first among the useless places in addition to that of the monarch himself is the whole of the establishment kept up for the service of the person of the chief functionary in a monarchy kept up as the phrase is for the support of his dignity the maintenance of the lustre of his crown and the splendour of his throne the proof of the uselessness of this office may be seen as already observed in the peaceful and flourishing condition of the angloamerican united states in which in the federal state the pay of the chief functionary is no more than £ 000 ayear and it is rather by imitation and prepossession it should seem than by any clear proof or view of a real and adequate demand to that amount that in that instance the allowance of so large a sum was determined secondly in every country in which the great body of the people profess to believe in the religion of jesus in any shape the whole of the pay allotted at the expense of the subjectmany under the notion of pay for teaching it and performing the ceremonies that have been attached to it and note that pay produced by the occupation or rent of property in an immoveable shape is so much extracted at the expense of the subjectmany for by applying that same money to the provision made for real exigencies—money to that same amount and the suffering produced by the exaction of it might be spared proof of the needlessness of such forced exactions is the nonexistence of any such system for the support of the catholic members of the ecclesiastical establishment in ireland proof that no such exactions are ordained by or conformable to the religion of jesus—is that no text in the new testament is there to be found speaking of him as ordaining any such exaction while various texts ordaining perfect equality among all the professors of his religion are to be found pay of useless offices pay of needless overpay of useful offices pay of sinecures i e of places to which no duty is attached—these are the shapes in which at the expense of the greatest happiness of the greatest number money in excess is extracted from the people for the benefit of public functionaries remains that source or mode of wasteful expenditure in the wholesale way which howsoever congenial is not essential to the form of government these are—unnecessary wars and distant and thence preponderately expensive dependencies in a representative democracy unnecessary wars against foreign adversaries can scarcely have existence for the sake of profit to the supremely ruling body the people—in whom is the power of appointment and removal with relation to the operatively ruling body their representatives—it is not possible but what none of them can avoid seeing is that with reference to the utmost possible profit capable of being reaped at the expense of the people of any other state the expenditure that must be made is not only immediate and certain but antecedent as well as in the ultimate result greater upon their representatives it is indeed that in an immediate way the engaging or not engaging in any such war would depend but that which as above would be manifest to the least reflecting of the two portions of the community—viz constituents—would be still more manifest to the most reflecting of those same two bodies their representatives in their eyes accordingly of the engaging in any such unnecessary war nonreelection—that is removal and with disgrace would be the certain consequence another conceivable cause of unnecessary war against foreign adversaries is irritation but if not for the commencement for the continuance of a war considered as being thus produced what is necessary is—that in the breasts of the majority of the people hatred of others should be more strong and efficient than love of self for a small portion of time and on the part of a small proportion of the people such predominance is at any rate conceivable but for any considerable portion of time on the part of the majority of such a people the nature of man considered it does not seem possible in an absolute monarchy the exemplification of this mode of wasteful expenditure will of course be frequent frequent in proportion to the power the monarch possesses or regards himself as possessing with relation to the inhabitants of such states as are within his reach in the case of a limited monarchy the practice will be still more frequent the propensity still more incessant and much more intense for in this case whatsoever addition is made to the waste is so much made to the instrument the existence and use of which is necessary to this species of monarchy viz the corruption fund as to distant dependencies comes to be considered the whole expense of the official establishment and the aggregate of the stock or materiel employed in the maintenance of the power exercised over the inhabitants of territories so circumstanced when the expense of the military force by land and sea together kept up for the defence of the distant dependency in question is taken into account it may be questioned whether in the instance of any nation sending out a colony the money extracted from it and employed in lieu of so much money that would otherwise have been extracted by taxes from the inhabitants of the ruling country has in any instance been so great as the expense in general the loss on this account has been prodigious suppose for example that hitherto in this or that instance a colony has been a source of net profit to the ruling country still it is not in the nature of the case that it should    long continue so to be over the inhabitants of the dependency in question power cannot be exercised—from them such profit cannot be extracted without manifest injury done to them without manifest oppression exercised upon them no sooner do they view the case in its true light than they will resist the injury and form a determination and use endeavours to disburthen themselves of it if after this the maintenance of the power of the ruling people or rather of the rulers of the ruling people is persevered in here then is war civil war a war the expense of which increases with the distance between the country subject to the dominion and the country which is the seat of it—to say nothing of the misery caused by such a war loans to foreign powers are another source of wasteful expenditure to go no farther back than the revolutionary war all money thus obtained and disposed of may with the most perfect truth though obtained by extortion be stated as obtained on false pretences—on pretences known by the obtainers to be false in fact of the money thus lent not a particle has ever been received back it was not in the nature of the case that in the minds of those by whom it was obtained and thus disposed of any expectation should have been entertained of receiving back any part of it at the time when under the name of a loan obtained by the foreign government from this government the very cause and reason of its being so obtained was—that from no resources of its own from no subjects of its own was it in the power of that foreign government to obtain it by no degree of success of which there could have been any tolerably wellgrounded prospect could the power of the foreign government to repay that money have been increased on the contrary after any ordinary degree of success that power could not but for a long time have been diminished as to security under the name of security nothing having the effect of security was given or could by the foreign power in question have been given of no portion of territory to serve as a security was possession given to this government of no such portion of territory could any possession have been taken accompanied with any possibility of raising money out of it either in the shape of principal or in the shape of interest by contributions levied upon the inhabitants if any such additional contributions could have been levied upon the inhabitants they would have been levied with abundantly more facility and abundantly less expense by their own government than by this government no such possession could have been kept by this government without a proportionable military force paid by itself instead of reimbursement the cost of keeping such possession would have been so much addition to the loss if instead of what it was not or intended to be a loan it had been named according to what it was a subsidy it would have been productive of two unpleasant effects of an effect unpleasant to each of the two high contracting parties to the emperor of austria it would have been humiliation placing him with no other difference than that occasioned by the difference in the state of society at the two periods in the situation in which his ancestor maximilian placed himself with relation to our henry the eighth to the subject many in england it would have displayed the true nature of the transaction the very object which for fear of that discontent which would have been so just was by this deceit but too effectually concealed that there had not on either part been any such intention as on both parts was professed was afterwards more fully confirmed and manifested by an eventual state of things which could not originally have been on any rational grounds anticipated upon the destruction of all power of resistance on the part of france she being treated on the footing of a conquered country was laid under contribution for the joint benefit of all parties to the conquest garrisons paid by her being kept for a number of years in the country to secure the levying of it by contributions levied in the manner of taxes neither the whole of the money nor any considerable part of it could even thus and upon a conquered enemys country be levied at length however in the way of loan capital being received by the conquered government from its own subjects on government annuities payable out of additional taxes to be imposed a part of the money originally stipulated was provided and distributed among the conquering governments here then was an occasion on which had there been any intention of repayment that intention might could and would have been fulfilled instead of being sent to vienna the whole of the austrians share might have been sent to london or otherwise disposed of to the account of england was the whole or any part of it thus disposed of not a sixpence hand in hand with waste is to be found taxation considerable must have been the difference between the quantities of evil produced by the different sorts of taxes resorted to and the different degrees of mischievousness of those several taxes even in the best governed state still more in every other state in proportion as it is ill governed of this inferiority in the scale of aptitude as applied to a tax the cause may be seen partly in a deficiency in the article of appropriate intellectual aptitude partly in a deficiency in the article of appropriate moral aptitude on the part of the authors of the tax in other words in a want of wisdom and in a want of feeling in the one case if he produces so much needless suffering it is for want of knowing how to find another sort of tax that shall not produce so    much of that undesirable result in the other case it is because so as the money is but produced to the treasury he cares not how much suffering is produced elsewhere by it the general and utter absence of all real sensibility ought to be considered as a state of mind inseparable from the situation in question if the financier professes to be in any degree afflicted by the sufferings of the people in the character of taxable subjects—the feefed judge by their sufferings in the character of suitors—the feefed advocate by their sufferings in the character of clients or the great military commander by their sufferings in the character of soldiers or inhabitants of the theatre of war—the truth of such a profession is possibly not altogether without example but the examples if any are so rare and so inconsistent with the ordinary constitution of human nature that on the occasion of any such professions no man can produce any just claim to general credence that which in the situation in question any man may with reason be considered as more or less sensible to—is any inconvenience to himself that may happen to present itself to him as likely to be among the effects of the tax the inconvenience for example producible by any opposition that may seem likely to be made by any persons who consider themselves as likely to be in any way sufferers by it to which of course will be to be added if it be not implied the inconvenience liable to be produced without doors as well as within doors by all parties out of place this is the evil by which the impression if any made on the mind of the financier will in reality be produced the evil to the contemplation of which that impression will of course be ascribed by him is the evil seen or apprehended to be produced in the breasts of the contributors and other sufferers be this as it may what in every state ought to be expected is in the first place that among the existing sorts of taxes there should be different degrees of mischievousness in the next place that the degrees of mischievousness should not exactly follow the chronological order of the taxes to the perfection of appropriate intellectual aptitude on the part of the financier suppose the perfection of appropriate probity added—the degree of mischievousness will on this supposition be in the inverse ratio of the chronological order of the different sorts of taxes as first in time will come the least mischievous—last in time the most mischievous compare now the mischief of the waste with the mischief of the tax to obtain an adequate conception of the quantity of evil produced by a quantity of waste to a given amount find and compare with it the quantity of evil produced by the levying of a correspondent and equal portion of the most mischievous of all the existing taxes for on condition of abstaining from the commission of the waste you may relieve the people from the burthen of that portion of the produce of the tax—you may abolish so much of the tax note that to render this rule strictly conformable to the truth the quantity of waste abstained from must be equal to the whole amount of the tax for in the case of a tax there will always be a portion of evil the quantity of which will be the same be the produce ever so great or ever so small for example a certain portion of the expense attached to the official establishment employed in the collection of it by the above general observations the reader will now have been in some sort prepared for the forming a just estimate of the evil produced in the shape of waste by various branches of customary expenditure hitherto very commonly regarded as justifiable either on the ground of absolute necessity or at any rate on the ground of utility take for example the splendour of the crown the support of the dignity of the peerage—jobs for the enrichment of the ruling or influential few and jobs for the amusement of the ruling and influential few chapter vii prescriptions or bearings of the other codes or branches of law to the constitutional code section i civil law not only the comfort of the individuals but the security of the whole community requires that as well against the calamity of famine as against external hostility individuals should be protected the treasure of the comparatively opulent is an insurance office to the comparatively indigent but forasmuch as it is only in a minute ratio that increase of happiness is concomitant with the increase of the external means of happiness the principle of equality requires that so far as may be without taking away the inducement to productive industry and frugality the opulent few should be prevented from doing injury to the indigent many by means of the power necessarily and proportionably attached to opulence and that so often as this can be done without the production of the sensation of loss opportunity should be taken of breaking down large masses into smaller ones hence it is that on the death of the proprieprietor provision is made in the civil or distributive branch of the law to prevent it from falling entire into the lap of any single individual in a family of brothers and sisters to the exclusion total or partial of the rest another instance in which the matter of the civil code belongs in spirit to the constitutional code is—that of the sort of institution already spoken of called a foundation foundation abd   is another name for legislation under the name of a founder a man if permitted by the legislator may exercise those same powers in a manner not less effectual though neither declared nor open nor by many an eye observed c the legislator recognised as such has equally at his command two instruments—punishment and reward—each of which or both as in his eyes occasion requires he employs in the performance of his work of these two instruments openly and immediately the founder employs but one viz reward but immediately and to many an eye secretly he employs the other likewise for in truth such is the connexion between those two instruments that he who has either at his command has at his command the other likewise each of them is in effect contained within the other subtraction of reward is punishment subtraction of punishment is reward under a weak and purblind legislator a foundation is an instrument with which the crafty individual may undermine the power of the legislator and set up his own in the room of it under a crafty legislator a founder with his foundation may be an instrument with which without being seen to be engaged in it the legislator may give advancement to his own private at the expense of the public interest he may thus at once demoralise and disintellectualize the great body of the people over whom he rules take the following example and in this one example behold how thin and indeterminate are the divisions by which the abuse and the use are separated first take a foundation having for its object the diffusion and advancement of this or that branch of art and science or in a word of all branches taken together what can be more innoxious what can be more manifestly useful and proportionably laudable all this while whether it shall be useful or in the highest degree noxious depends upon a difference to many an eye so slight as to be imperceptible in the mode of teaching to which the mass of reward which the foundation has for its instrument is annexed leave the whole field open to inquiry unreserved and unfettered inquiry—useful or useless everything that is done and said is at any rate innoxious for if from one mouth noxious matter issues from another comes medicinal matter which neutralises it and destroys its effect but be the portion of the field what it may—on that portion be the question what it may—let the supposed service be giving support to one side of that question to the exclusion of the other—now it is that the reward becomes poison to gain it he whose real opinion is on one side of the question pretends it to be on the other and employs his endeavours in inculcating it as if it were his own here then if insincerity be immorality already behold the moral poison but to no man is the idea of his own immorality a pleasant one feeling it an unpleasant one his endeavours will be naturally and constantly at work in ridding him of it for this purpose nature affords and on every occasion presents an appropriate process it may be styled the selfdeceptive process the receipt is this be the subject what it may be the question what it may be the side of the question what it may that you have pretended to espouse direct your attention to the arguments in favour of that side keeping it turned with inflexible perseverance against all arguments in favour of the opposite side if your understanding is not more or less above the level of that of the ordinary run of men—if at the same time the reward with the punishment included in it is strong enough to give to your attention the requisite fixity sooner or later the opinion howsoever at one time scorned by you becomes yours were the treasures of both the indies exhausted for the purpose in the offer of a reward support could not be purchased for an opinion more palpably and flagrantly absurd than those are which minds in countless millions have actually been made to fold in their embrace introduce religion and with her in addition to insincerity comes cruelty or in the words ascribed to her hatred malice and all uncharitableness to cause men to teach some absurdity or other treasures up to the value of whole kingdoms have been employed to cause men to force themselves into the belief of it—or rather for that can scarcely be said to be possible to keep out of their minds the disbelief of it—eternal terments i e the fear of them has been and continues to be employed but proportioned to the difficulty of keeping out this unbelief and thereby of purchasing a supposed security against these torments will be the uneasiness experienced by the miserable patient as often as any consideration tending to produce such disbelief is presented to his view proportioned to this uneasiness will of course be the anger excited in his mind the anger of which any man who has contributed to the production of this uneasiness will be the object this anger there are two classes of persons by whom it will be shared the hypocritical knave by whom with the full consciousness of its absurdity the dogma has been inculcated and the miserable dupe by whom for want of courage to open his eyes to the absurdity it has been embraced now then comes the cruelty the more flagrant the absurdity the greater the difficulty of causing men either to embrace the dogma or to pretend to embrace it the greater the difficulty the greater moreover the anxiety of the tyrant by whom the command to profess the belief of it has been issued lest universal indignation with its consequences should take place of the universal prostration of understanding and will the    production of which he has thus hazarded himself to endeavour at to quiet this anxiety to satiate this anger if moderate punishment is not sufficient immoderate must be employed and thus in spain and portugal have come those temporal and visible burnings forerunners and prototypes of the announced immediately future though as yet invisible ones such are the scenes which in spain and portugal the hypocrites and their dupes have witnessed and enjoyed such are the scenes which in england hypocrites and their dupes unless in england man is an altogether different animal from what he is in spain and portugal have never ceased nor as long as man is man can ever cease to wish to witness and to enjoy—to enjoy in that same land which two centuries and a half ago presented these same scenes to the wisdom and piety of their ancestors section ii penal law to the vocabulary of tyranny belongs the word mercy the idea expressed by this word is a sort of appendage to and antagonizes with the idea designated by the word justice the word justice as but too commonly employed matches with the word deserved as applied to punishment in this sense penal justice is exercised by the application of punishment on the occasion on which and in the quantity in which it is deserved in this case if mercy be exercised it is in opposition to and at the expense of justice in so far as mercy is exercised justice is not done what in this as in every case the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires is—that if on the occasion in question the application of the punishment in question would be conducive to that happiness the punishment should be applied if not not if in either case justice is administered no such thing as mercy is exercised in either case under a government which has for its actual end the greatest happiness of the greatest number thus it is that mercy is unknown mercy unknown—and why only because tyranny is unknown under a representative democracy—under the government of the angloamerican united states for instance—mercy is unknown or at least might be so with great advantage and therefore ought to be unknown under that government for a functionary as such to stand up on any occasion and say—i will on this occasion show mercy would be as much as to say—the power of a tyrant is in my hands but on this occasion i will not exercise it the surgeon when it appears to him that it would be for the greatest happiness of the individual under his care that one of the patients legs should be cut off does he say—i will do justice upon this leg as little if it appears to him that without cutting off the leg a cure may be effected does he say—i will show mercy to this leg it is for the accommodation of tyrants and that they may receive tribute of praise which soever course they take in whichsoever shape they do mischief to the public or in which way soever they afford gratification to their own passions and sinister interest if for the advancement of personal interest or for the gratification of present passion at the expense of lasting personal interest punishment is applied justice is the word if for the advancement of personal interest in that same quarter or for the gratification of this or that official servant interfering gratuitously or for a price punishment is forborne to be applied mercy is the word in the one case insult is offered to the public in one shape in the other case in the other in the one case it is on the score of wisdom that the praise so sure to be bestowed is bestowed—in the other case on the score of humanity benevolence charity clemency what you please clemency is a name given to supposed or alleged beneficence when exercised by the exclusion of punishment and seated on a throne the greater the aggregate quantity of punishment ordained by law the greater is the quantity of mercy capable of being exercised by particular prerogative in opposition to and at the expense of the general tenor of the law accordingly where mercy is most heard of be assured there is most tyranny the making a ground for the exercising of tyranny under the mask of clemency is one purpose for which punishment without limit or measure is anywhere by law established the making a ground for the praise of benevolence and thus providing malevolence and tyranny with a mask is another purpose under an absolute monarchy malevolence selfishness tyranny and thence punishment established by law being unbounded mercy is at times scattered with a proportionably lavish hand when it has been the pleasure of the monarch to go through a matrimonial ceremony with a partner of the same class punishments have been remitted by wholesale gaols delivered at one stroke of the innocent and the guilty criminality in all its shapes let loose to recommence its ravages and evil in all its shapes thus sown over the whole field of action when in the person of another alleged supporter to the throne providence has been pleased to add another mouth to the mouths employed in devouring the produce toiled for by labouring hands here has been another occasion for the reproduction of evil in those same shapes under a limited monarchy the quantity of punishment capable of being applied not being so completely unlimited the quantity of mercy for which with its due reproach and undue praise there is room is not quite so great room for it however always exists and is always occupied in enormous superabundance the unofficial intercessor is    mostly kept out by the official arbiter who with the language and deportment of obsequiousness on pretence of responsibility dictates on each occasion to the vicegod which of two courses his next to divine pleasure shall take in england while men are condemned to death by hundreds death is inflicted on them by units the difference between the unit and the hundred has for its cause the purposes abovementioned in practice the privilege of thus abandoning men to destruction or saving them from it at pleasure is shared among functionaries in rank office number and proportion—all indeterminate or at best hidden from the eyes of all but the few who share among them a sinister interest in the abuse of it a judge or lawyer of one class or denomination on one occasion of another on another along with and above them all stands the archfunctionary who numbers among his titles that of keeper of the kings conscience a man out of whose mind by the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong with no other difference than the predilection naturally conceived for the best customer everything that in any other mind has ever been designated by the name of conscience has long before his taking that exalted conscience into his keeping been obliterated remission of punishment yes for that there may be good reason on various occasions but they are all of them capable of being and all of them ought to be specified in one word mercy and justice are incompatible in a government where there is room for mercy it is because justice is overruled by cruelty as mercy is a subject of praise the more cruel the tyranny the greater is the room made for praise a few words as to conspiracy treason and libel under a representative democracy no place can conspiracy ever find for itself for needless and to this prefix or subjoin impossible—such are the properties which it would find belonging to itself impossible for there is nobody to conspire against under a monarchy—under an absolute monarchy at least there is a person to conspire against there is the monarch for if you get possession of his person you may get possession of his power under a representative democracy there is no such person for by getting possession of the chief magistrate you cannot get possession of an atom of his power in the import of the word conspiracy where the act is treated on the footing of a crime the idea of secrecy is included to conspire is to make mutual communication of opinions desires and eventuallyintended endeavours in secret these desires and endeavours if they bear any relation to the government have for their object the bringing about some change in the government which change howsoever desirable in the eyes of those who thus project it would not so they are assured be so in the eyes of the existing rulers—for on the supposition of its being so the secrecy has no use in an absolute monarchy no change presented by any pair of hands more than one can be agreeable in the eyes of the monarch or of any under him if in itself it be agreeable to them and it had not of itself presented itself to any of them they may vouchsafe acceptance to it if presented to them by no more than a single pair of hands and in a cringing attitude yes and even if presented by any such hands after conference on the subject between two or more persons in an erect posture but in this case while they are availing themselves of the plan they will punish the authors as being conspirators under an absolute monarchy any discourse of a nature otherwise than agreeable to the monarch or any of those by whom execution and effect is given to his will is if uttered by word of mouth in the hearing of any other person a seditious discourse if committed to print or writing a seditious libel such of course is the character of every discourse by which intimation is given that in this or that particular still more if in general the system pursued or the conduct of those who act under it might if different from what it is be better than what it is under a limited monarchy the case is in these respects the same under a representative democracy suppose conspiracy not impossible—suppose it not groundless—still there could be no need of it under a representative democracy individuals in any numbers may in any places at any time meet and say and hear whatsoever whether in relation to the system pursued or in relation to the conduct of those who act under it is agreeable to the respective speakers to whatsoever degree it may be otherwise than agreeable to the hearers or to their common rulers be the purport of what is thus said what it may the speaking of it will not be seditious speaking written or printed unpublished or published a paper in which it is contained will not be a seditious libel suppose a proposition made for killing or beating a judge a governor a president for pulling down or plundering his house a proposition to any such effect if followed by any correspondent endeavour will be an offence against person or property as the case may be and punishable as such for a judge a governor a president is an individual but in neither case would it be either treason or say lese majesty divine or human or so much as sedition at any rate if by the legislature of any such state the judge was suffered to    punish it as such it would be in humble imitation of an original by the imitation of which on any one occasion they ought to be covered with shame under the general government of the angloamerican united states there is no such thing as a seditious libel charge the president of congress charge the vicepresident charge the chief justice with having taken a bribe—do this in print circulate the print all over the united states no one of them will cause you to be punished as for a seditious libel no one of them will have it in his power so to do for no such injury will any criminal prosecution lie no information granted exofficio without motion no information granted on motion no nor so much as any indictment action civil i e nonpenal yes viz as for defamation prove thereupon the imputation to be well grounded in a man on whom it has been cast and he will be punished accordingly though such is the effect of blind obsequiousness to a corrupt original be the evidence ever so complete it will have to be delivered over againin a needless and worse than useless prosecution required by lawyercraft for the purpose if you fail in the proof you may be punished for the injury by being obliged to pay money on that account to the individual injured and it is right you should be so if you had not before you a reasonable ground for believing the imputation much more if you are conscious of the falsity of it in this there would be nothing but what is right for though he is neither a vicegod nor a magnate the person in question is an individual and an individual whom you have injured under a representative democracy though there can be no lese majesty divine or human nor anything of that stamp there may be hostility for there may be disagreement disagreement by men in any numbers on two opposite sides and how improbable soever such disagreement may rise to hostility here then is war and this war a civil war it will be carried on as in the case of ordinary war carried on between civilized nations it will be carried on by each in such a manner as shall present to its view the fairest promise for the attainment of its end with the least damage—in the first place to itself in the next place to the enemy some will accordingly on the losing side at least be killed others wounded others in the situation of prisoners left at the disposal of the commander of the victorious army having them at his disposal how will he deal with them does he put them to death in cold blood with a gang of lawyers to give form and colour to his cruelty will he with any such gang for his prompters tell them that their blood is corrupt and that on that account it was just and necessary that their wives and children should be destitute of subsistence and in that state kept by law as far as practicable till they die no he will do nothing of all these things the men he will keep to the best of his power their arms he will as soon as possible take into his custody lest they should turn them against him and his but sooner or later hostility will give place to peace on that joyful occasion these captives will the whole remainder of them be sent back to their homes and families bodies fed wounds healed ignominy in no shape either cast upon them or endeavoured to be cast whence all these differences answer on neither side has any vicegod been seen or fancied and on neither side has any such word as legitimacy been pronounced in so far then as it matches with and is determined by the state of the constitutional branch of law the state of the penal branch of law will under the different forms of government present the different aspects following conscious more or less of the opposition that has place between their own particular interests and the greatest happiness of the greatest number alive at the same time to a sense of the dangers that attach upon the situation from which they derive that sinister interest—haunted not merely by a correct and adequate but by an exaggerated image of those dangers—under monarchy whether absolute or limited under aristocracy under every form of government but representative democracy—never in the imagination of the ruling one of the subruling or the influential few can the mass of securities in which they intrench themselves be sufficient in that part of the intrenchment which is the work of penal law death substituted to punishment in any less odious and more appropriate form torture antecedent and concomitant added to simple destruction of life punishment of the acknowledged innocent added to that of the reputed guilty confiscation under pretence of corruption of blood interception of inheritance for that and other purposes pains of hell in prospect under the sad necessity of not being able to apply them in present reality and existence—all these penal securities put together are insufficient to produce that inward tranquillity which conscience keeps for ever banished from those miserybound and miseryproducing situations hence it is that every act which in those distempered imaginations threatens to substitute to the superlatively mischievous form of government in which they behold the source of their sinister benefits a form in any degree less mischievous—is by that same distempered imagination elevated to a rank towering above the most mischievous of those offences by which real mischief is produced treasons—political offences—state offences—offences against government are the denominations by which acts bearing this character are in these days commonly designated lese majesty divine and human is of the number of the denominations by which in former days    offences of this same description were by the wisdom of the ancestors of those who number ancestry among their possessions denominated and distinguished of lese majesty a division was made but with little difference between its parts and between that which was human and that which was divine lese majesty human an offence against the power crown dignity and majesty of that but too visible god whose throne was upon earth lese majesty divine an offence against the power crown dignity and majesty of the invisible god whose throne is in heaven the authors printers publishers circulators lenders borrowers hirers readers hearers—if not denunciators of libellous discourses—all discourses either actually displeasing to the monarch or any of his chosen servants have always been punished by halter ball bayonet or imprisonment under a representative democracy scarcely for offences of this class it has been seen can so much as a place be found on the one hand stand offences of individuals against individuals on the other hand acts of hostility by enemies against enemies rulers being individuals—rulers and subjects at the same time—for person reputation property and condition in life rulers receive the same protection as subjects and of no other protection have they or can they conceive themselves to have any need under a monarchy by sudden death inflicted upon the chief of the government changes to the importance of which no limit can be assigned may be produced by an operation to the same effect upon the person of a chief magistrate in a representative democracy no such effect—scarce any such effect as would in any sinister estimate be worth producing would ever be produced another as good as he and no better nor of any better would there be any need would as soon as the election had run its course step into his place in a monarchy especially if absolute take possession of the chief magistrate you take possession of an immense part if not the whole of the power which is in his hands he signs what laws and orders you give him to sign he utters whatever speeches you give him to utter he takes whatever oaths you give him to take reserving to the first moment after he is out of your hands the signing of repealinglaws and counterorders the utterance of counterspeeches the declaration that the former oaths were null and void and the taking of as many counteroaths if any as shall in his eyes afford a promise of being contributory to the purpose of the moment whatsoever that purpose be whatever course of conduct he has ever given a promise to pursue with this ceremony or sanction to the promise if at any moment being called upon to pursue a different course it be more agreeable to him to persevere in the original course he will assure you that oaths all oaths are things sacred and inviolable if at the moment in question it be more agreeable to him to violate the oath than to keep it he will take a distinction all proper oaths he will assure you are sacred and inviolable and as such ought to be fulfilled all improper oaths are in their own nature null and void and as such ought not to be fulfilled make your way into the capital some dark night steal into the presidents bedchamber through one of the windows drag him out through it and convey him into the hut or boat you have provided for the purpose then see what you can make of him what power you can get possession of by this exploit what money what arsenals what fortresses you can get possession of what change you can by this means make in the constitution but no whoever you are you will do no such thing if you are a thief you will ransack his pockets—the man you will not meddle with for no use whatever could you make of him under a monarchy accept the invitation of the wife of the chief magistrate you beget a future possessor of the throne taking your chance for keeping your head or losing it in a representative democracy accept the like invitation from the wife of a chief magistrate you beget a future possessor of a farm or a countinghouse your head is not in danger your purse is or is not according to circumstances the imputation of moral depravity does not necessarily attach upon any endeavour to subvert the constitution or to oppose the power of any individual functionary or functionaries although it be by force no such endeavour can be used with any chance of success unless in the opinion of a considerable portion of the members of the community such success would be acceptable to the whole as contributing to the greatest happiness of the greatest number the government of the state will of course defend itself against all such as in its eyes are domestic adversaries as well as against those who in its eyes are foreign adversaries if in the course of any such endeavour injury be done to person property reputation or condition in life those who have been concerned in doing it will in this as in any other case be exposed to the burthen of compensation together with whatsoever further burthen has been provided on the score of punishment if no such injury has ensued there can be no need of any specific infliction in the name of punishment the notoriety of the endeavour coupled with the notoriety of the illsuccess will itself have the effect of punishment for the endeavour to give aid to a foreign enemy to the detriment of the state the penal consequences say shall or may be as follows namely— personal exposure with appropriate inscription—banishment or confiscation the mode of personal exposure may be as follows—  0 the patient to be placed in an elevated situation in the middle of some open space sitting in a chair and confined thereto with his hands tied behind him so as to prevent his employing them in concealing his face the chair turning on a pivot in such sort that by four periodical movements his countenance may be presented to the view of all the spectators in the surrounding circle a covering of iron in the manner of a birdcage to protect him from corporeal injury by missiles from the crowd banishment for any term not exceeding a year with imprisonment in such sort as shall be necessary for carrying the banishment into effect the banishment at any time before expiration renewable for the same or any less time by a fresh order issued without fresh trial by the minister of justice notified in the government newspaper and so for any successive number of times confiscation of property total or partial temporary but renewable as above such confiscation has not for its object anything more than the preventing the patient from employing his property to the detriment of the state it is not therefore meant to be taken without reservation made for his use of an income sufficient for the bare subsistence at least of himself and otherwise destitute wife and children section iii procedure law the expense vexation and delay incident to judicial procedure fall most heavily on those by whom they can least be endured viz the greatest number these burthens have hitherto by official and professional lawyers under the sanction of the legislative authority been maximized of those by whose labours the matter of abundance is furnished to the rest by far the greater number are everywhere so circumstanced as to have no money at all to spare for any such afflictive casualties in the case of an individual of this class whether it be in the shape of money or of time any the slightest addition to such expense of time and money as the nature of the case renders absolutely unavoidable operates as a denial of justice it exposes every individual by whom such expense cannot be sustained to suffer oppression to an unlimited amount at the hands of every individual by whom such expense can be sustained it operates as a bounty upon oppression and as an instrument in the hand of the oppressor in every case in which the power of the judicial authority is among the instruments by which the oppression is exercised on this account it is that the following arrangements are of such indispensable importance judicatories to be near each mans house and thence correspondently numerous judicatories to be paid by government out of the common fund and not by the individual suitors—individuals by whom so far from greater benefit less benefit is reaped from the services of the judge than is reaped by nonlitigants because that protection and that security which litigants do not obtain nonlitigants do obtain without expense to themselves judicatories never to be in a state of inaction so long as there is any business to be done the sort of causes which ought to have the precedence in the attention of the legislator will be those in which the greatest number are in one way or other concerned and among them those which are of the most frequent occurrence these in the eye of the legislator for mankind will be the most important causes in a code which has for its object the greatest happiness of the ruling few in particular of the ruling one this order will of course be reversed section iv financial law conformably to the principles of this code no tax can be imposed for any of the purposes following— augmentation of the collective splendour of the state or of its functionaries collectively augmentation of the splendour of any one functionary in particular advancement of purely agreeable or curious branches of art and science expenditure of money derived from any other source is the same thing in effect with a tax to that same amount section v military law for obtaining equal security it is requisite that the military means of selfdefence be spread all over the territory and all over the population with as much equality as possible that accordingly skill in the use of arms and as the means and instrument of it the being instructed and exercised in that use be with that same degree of equality universally diffused for eventual defence against external enemies it will or may be necessary that at all times a body of men more or less considerable be kept up in whose instance military exercises will occupy the whole of their time the effective force of this constantly trained and exercised class will therefore be of necessity considerably greater numbers being equal than that of the less frequently exercised class in the hands of a mischievously ambitious commander this regular force might be dangerous to the independence of the rest of the community if the inferiority which has place in the article of skill were not decidedly more than countervailed by superiority in the article of number on the part of that less perfectly exercised body who compose so very    large a portion of the whole population and whose interest is nearly identified with that of the whole moreover as the members of the imperfectlytrained force will maintain themselves while those of the perfectlytrained force must be maintained at the expense of the rest of the community economy joins with political security in prescribing the confining the perfectlytrained force within its narrowest limits hence came two correspondent subordinate objects or ends in view expressible in these words militia force maximized regular force minimized chapter viii publicopinion tribunal in the designation of this species of unofficial judicatory the appellation publicopinion tribunal is here employed in conformity to and compliance with universal usage by the word opinion however an erroneous conception is liable and apt to be conveyed and produced namely that it is by mere opinion—by the mere exercise of the judicial faculty that those effects which on the actions of other persons are so manifest and so universally acknowledged are produced this conception is however an erroneous one for it is only by a sense of interest by the eventual expectation of pain or pleasure that human conduct can in any case be influenced if it is by any opinion supposed to be formed by other men that a mans conduct is in any way and in any degree influenced it can only be through the medium of expected action and thence of correspondent will on the part of the individuals in question that the influence can be produced the expectation that by the opinion favourable or unfavourable correspondent will will be produced and by correspondent will correspondent action in the shape of good or evil offices and by such good or evil offices on the one part pleasure or pain on the other the members of the publicopinion tribunal in a community are the members of that same community the whole number of them considered in respect of their capacity of taking cognizance of each others conduct sitting in judgment on it and causing their judgments in the several cases to be made known in the english house of commons in the formation of a committee of the members for this or that particular purpose an order that now and then is seen to have place is that all who come to the committee shall have voices the members of the publicopinion tribunal are to the members of the community at large what the members of the house of commons committee thus formed are to the members of the house the publicopinion tribunal may be conceived as sitting and acting in full assembly or through the medium of a committee a specially and actually appointed committee in the character of a full assembly whatsoever is said of it may contain more or less of truth but must unavoidably be mixed with more or less of fiction the best course therefore will be to consider it as acting by a committee in this case all fiction may be excluded that which is real being thus explained the explanation may afterwards be applied with advantage to the mixture of the real and the fictitious as this tribunal by the counterforce which by its punitive power it applies to the power of government contributes to keep it in check and keep its course within the paths indicated by the greatest happiness principle thereby operating as a security for appropriate moral aptitude in the conduct of rulers as such so may it in no inconsiderable degree by its remunerating power there are two distinguishable forms in which influence more or less effective may be given to the will and understanding of the great body of the people in one form their opinion—that is the opinion of such of those whose opinion can be brought to bear upon the subject in question—is accompanied with a will clothed with power in the other form whatsoever effect is given to what passes in their minds it is by the declaration of their opinion alone that the effect is produced in the one case of any declaration of their opinion obligatory effects are made to follow it in the other case no such effects are made to follow it of the case in which its opinion receives an obligatory effect the function of a jury is an example a jury in so far as it is what it professes to be is a sort of committee of the whole body of the people—a section of that vast polypus the decision or verdict of the jury is productive of an obligatory effect i e it determines the fate of the cause say publicopinion tribunal adopted into and constituting a constituent part of the legal tribunal the case in which the opinion has no obligatory effect would have place on the supposition that the verdict of the jury though pronounced in the same manner as in the former case would not be obligatory upon the judge but would leave him at liberty either to give effect to it or to give effect to a decision of his own framing howsoever different from it or even directly repugnant to it say publicopinion tribunal delivering verdicts but those verdicts not obligatory a third mode would have place if a certain number of men in the character of a section of the publicopinion tribunal stood engaged to be present during this or that part or during the whole progression of a cause or suit but without either obligation or power or at any rate without obligation to deliver any conjunct portion of discourse in the character of a verdict say a silent jury    in the second mode the effect produced on the mind of the judge by the counterforce thus applied would be produced by what they were known by him to think in this third case by what they were supposed by him to think these judges by whom every person and everything are to be judged who it may be said are they who but the members of that body the vast majority of whom are and always will be in all places and at all times the comparatively ignorant and weak judgmented and is it by these least informed that all better qualified judgments are expected to be influenced and guided answer it is not from any particular judgment ascertained to be on any occasion actually delivered by them that the good here looked to is expected what is not proposed is that the votes of any of them shall on any particular question be collected on no other occasion than that of an election of deputies will that be done in regular course it is from the opinion expected to be on each occasion inwardly entertained by them that the good is looked for it is not from anything expected to be said only from what it is expected will be thought that the benefit is expected included in this aggregate judgment are the judgments of the most unapt as well as those of the most apt by a functionary especially if acting singly as often as any act of misconduct is committed the consequence of it sooner or later or at any rate the tendency of it will be to produce in some shape or other evil that by individuals in a number more or less considerable will be felt in a word suffering in some shape or other on the part of these same individuals to all by whom any such suffering is experienced will at any rate be known that they do experience it and among those who experience added to those who witness those same sufferings there will always be some who being qualified to trace them to that misconduct in which as above they have their source will naturally be disposed to make communication of such their discoveries to the rest as to the opinions by which in each case the cause of the suffering is undertaken to be assigned they will commonly be many of them wrong but on each occasion they may be for aught that the rulers can know in any number right and it is by the fear of the conduct that may be the result of these opinions that the check which applies itself to the conduct of the ruling few is applied and the corresponding benefit produced in his quality of member of the publicopinion tribunal every member of the constitutive body in giving expression to a sentiment of disapprobation so grounded exercises a judicial function any such expression if made in the hearing of others may be considered as a motion made for censure on the conduct of the functionary in question if by any author of such virtual motion in consideration of such supposed delinquency a vote be given at any election in disfavour of such functionary the part acted by such vote may be considered as an act done for the purpose of giving execution and effect to the condemnatory judgment so formed as above on the occasion of an ordinary suit between individual and individual or between government and individual any such union of the functions of accuser judge and executioner would be incompatible with justice but in the case here in question all that it amounts to is this namely that for his guidance in the exercise of his share of constitutive power—the giving of his vote—the individual takes the only course which the nature of the case admits of the following may be employed amongst other means of bringing the force of the popular or moral sanction to bear with greatest advantage upon the conduct of public functionaries in the several departments— in every apartment in which a public functionary sits to do business keep in view of the public a table in placard form containing admonitory rules and notices having for their object the prevention of the moral failings to which by his situation the functionary is most exposed to these admonitory rules and notices the distinction between universallyapplying and particularlyapplying will be found applicable i notices   name of the edifice over every door that opens into or is visible from the public highway   in each edifice over each door of each chamber the name of the chamber   in each chamber over the seat occupied by each functionary the name of the office and the proper name of the functionary who sits in it   in each chamber over the door designation of the hour at which the functionary ought to take his seat and of the hour at which he is at liberty to desist from the exercise of his office   so an almanac marking the months weeks and days of the attendance in each year ii admonitory rules   admonitory rules of general applicability expressive of the duties of the functionary   admonitory rules of general applicability expressive of the duties of persons attending at the office as having business therein   admonitory rules of general applicability expressive of the powers given to the functionaries in question for preventing interruption of the business of the office and annoyance of them in the exercise of their functions rule of general applicability expressive of    the duty of the functionary duty of urbanity abstinence from the insolence of office   in this office let the functionary consider that it becomes him not in quality of his office to assume any superiority over any person having business therein that in his quality of public functionary his situation with reference to every such person is rather that of a servant than that of a master he being remunerated at the public expense for the rendering of such services as appertain to the nature of his office   if in his dealings with any suitor to the office any expression which by such suitor is regarded as an expression of contumely illhumour or undue impatience or contempt be uttered by the functionary the suitor may if he pleases upon the spot commit the same to paper and require of the functionary under his signature to avow or deny the having employed it if the functionary refuse a memorandum may be made of such refusal in order to form the groundwork of an accusation before a judicatory of the powers given to the public functionary the sole object is the enabling him to fulfil his duties to render to the public the services for the rendering of which the office has been instituted the institution of it has not among its objects the affording gratification to the vanity much less to the pride of the functionary at the expense of the feelings of those who have business to do at his office of these admonitory rules the use is to apply the force of the moral sanction in cases when by reason of the overweening power of the functionary or in case of transgression the impossibility or difficulty of obtaining adequate evidence the force of the political sanction is not sufficiently applicable a solemn engagement in which either the rules themselves or the substance of them is repeated should be pronounced by the functionary in the face of the public upon his entrance into office it might if worth while be repeated periodically for example in case of a new constitution on the anniversary of the celebration of the constitution for what purpose professedly employ and seek to increase the power of this unofficial judicatory answer to a representative democracy this unofficial unpaid and incorruptible judicatory is an instrument of support and in regard to it the object and endeavour will be to maximize the rectitude of the decisions given by it in the several instances and in so far as that rectitude has place the force with which it operates to every other form of government it is by correspondent causes rendered an object of terror and anxiety though the magnitude of its power is universally acknowledged among them in proportion however to the magnitude of the force attributed to it is the endeavour to oppose whatsoever is salutary in its influence that is to say either to give to it a sinister direction by the united power of force intimidation corruption and delusion or in so far as the giving to it any such sinister direction is regarded as impracticable to exclude from its cognizance every topic that presents itself as bearing any relation to politics morals or religion the tribunal of public opinion may be considered as composed of two sections the democratical and the aristocratical on every occasion the conduct of every human being will be determined by his own interest taken in its most extensive sense that is his own interest according to his own conception of it correct or incorrect in relation to it at the moment of action on every occasion the opinion acted upon by each individual in his character of member of the publicopinion tribunal will therefore be determined by his own interest so therefore will that of the whole tribunal considered as a whole be determined by the interest of the majority of those who act as members the interest of the democratical section is that of the majority of the members of the whole tribunal taken in the aggregate it is consequently the interest of the subject many the opinion on which it acts will be that which is in the highest degree contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in so far as the conception entertained by the several members in relation to their respective interests is correct the interest of the aristocratical section of the publicopinion tribunal is that of the members or the majority of the members of that portion of the entire number of the members of the political community which is composed of the ruling and otherwise influential few of the highest rank of the functionaries of the state with the addition of such other classes whose particular interests are in league with theirs the opinion on which as in their several other characters so in this they will act will therefore in each instance be determined by the interest common to the members of this section but in a great not to say the greatest part of the field of morals including that of legislation the interest common to the members of this narrow section is in direct opposition to the interest of the other more comprehensive section the democratical section or the section of the subject many is composed chiefly of the productive classes including under that denomination those occupied in giving facility to the distribution of the good things produced without which distribution production would not be of any use the section of the ruling and otherwise influential few is composed principally of the nonproductive classes corresponding to the deviation in regard to interest will be the several opinions pronounced and acted upon by these two sections    by the democratical section disrepute or say disapprobation will be attached to all such actions as in the conception of its members are detrimental to the universal interest and that in a degree of force proportioned to the degree of the injuriousness approbation to all such actions as in the same conception are in an eminent degree contributory to the universal interest the aristocratical section will be determined by the respective opposite interests in the disposal of such expression of disapprobation and approbation as it is respectively in their power to make with regard to human conduct in every part of the field of law and morals by approbation and disapprobation understand in both cases that which is expressed and otherwise acted upon immaterial taken by itself is any which is not expressed or acted upon of this aristocratical section there is commonly a subsection by whom in appearance opposition to the work of corruption will naturally be maintained this subsection is composed of such of those corruptionists who being such in desire and expectation only without being in connexion with those in possession will in this way as in all others be making war with them which they can no otherwise do than by accusing them at the bar of the publicopinion tribunal and using their endeavours to draw down upon them the discontent and resentment of the people but in no such apparent endeavour have they ever or can they ever in the nature of the case be sincere as has been fully explained elsewhere unhappily for the members of the democratical section their conceptions their judgments their suffrages their language have till this time been placed almost completely under the guidance and almost as it were at the disposal of those of the aristocratical and thus it is that by the sinister interest of these their adversaries not only have they been placed and kept under the yoke of misrule but the only instrument in which they could seek relief from the disorder of misrule has been employed in a great degree in the aggravation of it and in keeping them as far as may be from all thoughts of applying a remedy offences against the person property reputation and condition in life including power of individuals—under these denominations may be included all modifications of conduct detrimental to the happiness of individuals individually considered and this whether opposed or not by the power of the political including the legal sanction it is the interest of a member of the democratical section as such that no such misdeeds as come under any of these denominations should have place in any instance with respect to the aggregate mass of these same misdeeds it is the interest of a member of the aristocratical section as such that no offence of any one of these descriptions should have place to the detriment of the happiness of that particular section to which he belongs but in so far as the effect of any such misdeed is to operate to his own benefit though it be to the detriment of the more numerous class to which he does not belong it is in his view of the matter generally speaking his interest that to the extent of that case those misdeeds in all their several shapes and denominations should be as abundant as possible that it should at all times be in his power to inflict on all the individuals belonging to the democratical section evil in all those shapes in so far as by the infliction of it gratification to himself in some shape shall thereby be produced it is his interest to have it in his power to beat maim or otherwise maltreat for example the person of every other man whose lot it has been to fall under his displeasure to cover him with ignominy on the supposition of his having committed misdeeds which in truth he has not committed to deprive him of any part or of the whole of his means of subsistence to deprive him of the power of directing the conduct of his children during the time of their immaturity by fraud or force to violate the person of his wife his daughters or sisters all this without danger of suffering on his own part on the ground of any of those misdeeds at the hands of law or otherwise on the contrary to possess the assurance of seeing the force of the law employed in securing him against suffering in any shape on the account of his having committed them a right of this sort—this right of doing wrong is in so far as it is enjoyed by the members of a small class at the charge of the aggregate of the members of the community termed in the laws of all nations a privilege in so far as it is possessed by a single individual it is in the language of english law termed a prerogative it is the interest of every member of the aristocratical section as such that there should exist a class of citizens provided he be one of them in whose power it should be to enjoy benefits in all imaginable shapes at the expense of the greater number if by any efficient cause the members of the aristocratical section receive the power of producing on the part of the members of the democratical section suffering in all manner of shapes for the gratification of their own appetites while the members of the democratical section as such stand debarred from doing the like to the injury of the members of the aristocratical a natural consequence is that the judgment entertained as well as declared on this subject should on the part of the members of the democratical section be unfavourable and condemnatory with relation to this state of things and so far to a government    in which any such state of things is kept in existence but for the correspondent and opposite reason a consequence equally natural is that of the members of the aristocratical section as such the judgment pronounced on this same state of things should be favourable and commendatory what is the conclusion of all this that in so far as it differs from the judgment pronounced by the democratical section every judgment pronounced by the aristocratical section will be erroneous—erroneous and to the prejudice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number from this it follows again that in every factitious assemblage of functionaries instituted for the purpose of serving as a representation of the publicopinion tribunal all individuals of whom it appears that they appertain to the aristocratical section ought to be either excluded altogether or if admitted not admitted but in a number extremely small admitted not in the quality of voters where votes would have an obligative effect but only in the quality of advisers and instructors a jury may be considered as a section of the publicopinion tribunal called in on a certain occasion of judicature to serve as a counterforce to the operation of particular and sinister interest in the situation of permanent judge in the practice of english law there are two sorts of juries—the petty or common and the special the common jury is a committee of the democratical section a special jury of the aristocratical the common jury is a safeguard against oppression the special jury an instrument of oppression and injustice fabricated by the corruptive system the judgment of the democratical section has many errors in it it has some that are common to it and the aristocratical section it has some which are peculiar to itself but in proportion as it becomes more and more mature it becomes more and more favourable to the universal interest whereas the judgment of the aristocratical section becomes more and more adverse to the universal interest the members of the aristocratical section being as much members of the community as those of the democratical section they have every one of them a vote in this tribunal and this vote not only has a force and effect not less than that of a member of the democratical section but a force and effect much greater rising above it in a scale composed of numerous degrees of magnitude still however in proportion as the number of the members of the community at large in the habit of acting in this character increased the ratio of the numbers in this more extended section to the numbers in the more contracted section would increase and thus the members of the aristocratical section being constantly in a minority the whole section would be without much or any influence to preserve their influence they therefore make common cause secede from the democratical members and sit in a section apart forming as it were a house of lords—having an interest of its own distinct from and opposite to the interest of the remainder and acting in pursuance of that particular and sinister interest if in a committee of the public the presence of a member of the aristocratical section of it can with reference to the interest of the public taken in the aggregate be of use it can only be with a view to appropriate intellectual aptitude knowledge and judgment taken together in respect of moral aptitude it can scarcely happen but that in comparison with an average number of the democratical section he will be inferior his situation exposing him to those temptations from particular and sinister interest to which the member of the democratical as such is not exposed but whatever knowledge and judgment is possessed by a man communication may as easily be given without a vote as with a vote possessed by that same individual if then there be any preponderant demand for the assistance of a person of that class with a view to accession of appropriate knowledge and judgment a single individual of that class may be regarded as sufficient whatsoever be the number of the remainder in which case his having or not having a vote in common with them will hardly be worth contending for as practice and experience under the constitution in question increases any deficiency which at the outset may have place in regard to these requisites in the instance of the democratical members will be receiving continual supplies the demand therefore for any such aristocratical assistance will in the same proportion decrease in comparison with the aggregate number of the members of the democratical section of the publicopinion tribunal that of those of the aristocratical will be small here then is another reason why the number of the aristocratical members in each such committee should be small for the larger it were the greater would be the number of those on whom the burthen of such attendance in proportion as the attendance were felt as burthensome would be pressing from interests real or supposed come desires from desires come expressions of will and expressions of opinion for the purpose of drawing through the medium of opinion other wills into a coincidence and conformity with a mans own from the united force of an adequate number of wills in appropriate and adequate situations come legislative arrangements but in the drawing together of opinions great is the advantage which the aristocratical section has over the democratical in the aristocratical section is the acknowledged standard of taste and the taste of the aristocrat    is always conformable to and to a great extent determined by interest—by their separate and sinister interest to increase their own importance the ambitious youth of the democratical section and those who float between the two sections make a point of adopting declaredly the tastes and opinions of the aristocratical that they may be regarded as belonging to it and be accordingly respected and courted by substituting the principle of taste to the greatest happiness principle taste is made the arbiter of excellence and depravity and thus the great mass of the community is in the very sink of depravity witness the use that is made of the words bad taste and disgusting bad taste pours down contempt disgusting is a superlative above flagitious—it is a quasi conjugate of taste and bad taste those of the democratical section in so far as they adopt such expressions act in support of the hostile section against themselves for the rich and powerful will always be the arbiters of taste what is an object of disgust to them will to those who follow this principle be an object of disgust likewise but that the poor labouring and nonlabouring—all those who cannot afford a clean shirt every day and a suit of clothes every two or three months—are to the men of the first circle objects of disgust is altogether beyond dispute as to distinction between these two sections—to draw any determinate boundary line—a line on the one side of which shall be the situation of the several individuals belonging to the one section on the other side all the several individuals belonging to the other is plainly precluded by the nature of the case if of the superiority in question there were but one element say factitious dignity yes to the aristocratical belong all who possess any particle however small of this creature of the imagination to the democratical all who have not any particle of it so perhaps if instead of factitious dignity it were power understand political power to the exclusion of domestic so far then as depends upon two of the species of matter of which aristocratical superiority is composed yes but what remains is the third composed of the matter of wealth to this species attach two causes of impossibility one constituted by the article of quantity the other by that of time first with reference to quantity as where physical light is concerned it is impossible to say where dullness ends and gives place to brightness so is it to say where poverty or indigence ends and gives place to affluence so as to time suppose the quantity determined and thereby the section to which each man appertains for today good but tomorrow some men in any number by increase given to this quantity have from the indigent class been lifted up into the opulent others from the affluent been sent down into the indigent class nor yet with a view to action to influence on the conduct of the individuals in question are the above any of them the immediately operating efficient causes of action the sole efficient cause is interest if interest be taken in its most enlarged sense i e according to each mans perception of what at the moment in question is his most forcibly influencing interest the interest determined by social sympathy and antipathy as well as that which is of a purely selfregarding complexion included thus to the purpose of action to the aristocratical section belong all such individuals who by hope of factitious honour power or wealth are dependent on the members of the aristocratical section so to the democratical belong all those who their selfregarding interest in any of these shapes notwithstanding are listed on the democratical side by sympathy with the sufferings of those belonging to that section or by antipathy towards this or that portion of the aristocratical section belonging in reality to a side to which they are opposed in appearance chapter ix good rule and bad rule of bad rule or say misrule the sensible evil effects in all shapes are reducible to one or other of two denominations—oppression and depredation they may even be comprehended under the single name of oppression the exercise of depredation in so far as committed by the hands of rulers being but a particular modification of oppression oppression exercised for this particular purpose applied to the purpose of obtaining benefit in some shape at the expense of the persons on whom the oppression is exercised but oppression may be exercised in cases where no immediate benefit in any shape is the object the attainment of which is the final cause of the oppression exercised no benefit in any shape unless the pleasure resulting from the contemplation of the suffering produced by the oppression in the breast of the oppressed person be regarded as coming under the denomination of benefit though in this way the cause of the evil may in all its shapes be comprisable under the one denomination of oppression there will be a convenience in the employing of the other denomination namely depredation likewise and thus considering it as something distinct from oppression at large for as in the two cases the evil effects on the part of the sufferers are different so are the modes of operation on the part of the agents different the giving support and strength to the power of depredation is the chief purpose to which the exercise of a power which in its    immediate effect is purely oppressive is principally directed when for example individuals who are suffering under the privations produced by the depredation exercised at their expense make communication of their sufferings or of the cause to which they ascribe those sufferings or of the displeasure with which the authors of those sufferings are regarded by them and for the making of such communication to this effect pain under the name of punishment or any other is inflicted on them without anything in the shape of money or anything else from the use of which the rulers would derive pleasure in any shape being taken from them here indeed oppression is exercised on them but it cannot be said that in this particular instance depredation is exercised upon them at the same time but for the depredation the oppression would not have been exercised in every government which has for its object and effect the pursuit of the happiness of the governors at the expense and by the correspondent sacrifice of the happiness of the governed oppression at large will be the habitual and unintermitted practice of the government in all its ranks the only species of government which has or can have for its object and effect the greatest happiness of the greatest number is as has been seen a democracy and the only species of democracy which can have place in a community numerous enough to defend itself against aggression at the hands of external adversaries is a representative democracy a democracy then has for its characteristic object and effect the securing its members against oppression and depredation at the hands of those functionaries which it employs for its defence against oppression and depredation at the hands of foreign adversaries and against such internal adversaries as are not functionaries every other species of government has necessarily for its characteristic and primary object and effect the keeping the people or nonfunctionaries in a perfectly defenceless state against the functionaries their rulers who being in respect of their power and the use they are disposed and enabled to make of it the natural adversaries of the people have for their object the giving facility certainty unbounded extent and impunity to the depredation and oppression exercised on the governed by the governors the argumentation creation or preservation of felicity being the allcomprehensive object of desire and end in view as to human action in every situation so necessarily in that of all those by whom rule is exercised felicity together with its opposite infelicity in their several modifications are as necessarily the subject matters of its operations but in their several modifications these same elements are also by an equal necessity rendered the equally necessary and indispensable instruments for the attainment of that end in no case without the elements of infelicity and felicity only by pain and pleasure applied to them in a certain manner can sensitive beings be rendered instrumental in the exclusion of evil or in the production of good in the exclusion of pain or in the production of pleasure when however they are spoken of as being employed in the character of instruments they are spoken of by appellatives different from those by which they are designated when spoken of in the character of ends force intimidation and remuneration by one or other of these three denominations may be characterized all those incorporeal instruments of rule which being indisputable instruments of all rule cannot therefore but be such with relation even to the best rule by force understand here physical force—that of which the body as contradistinguished from the mind is the seat only by means and through the intervention of this instrument can those others be brought into action only by physical force by whatsoever agent applied to them can any operation be performed upon objects not endowed with sensation in a word upon inanimate things and in this respect many are the occasions on which this only mode of operating upon things is not less necessary to the purpose of operating with efficiency upon persons only by force by physical force can a person who against the will of the occupant continues in a house be removed out of it if neither intimidation nor remuneration are capable of being applied with effect to the purpose of affording him an inducement adequate to the purpose of causing him to remove himself force in so far as considered as being applied to the mind and applied not without effect is termed intimidation intimidation is the eventually efficient cause of the matter of evil considered as applied to the purpose in question the most prominent and extensive instance is that in which the matter of evil is applied to this same purpose in the character of matter of punishment punishment in the event of a mans failing to contribute to the felicity of the person in question in the manner pointed out to him by the directive rule of law which the arrangements of government furnish remuneration is the efficient cause of the matter of good considered as applied to the purpose in question good applied in consideration of a mans having contributed or being engaged or expected to contribute to the felicity of the person in question in some manner pointed out as above by directive rules laid down with more or less precision by those arrangements in the furnishing of which the government is occupied among the imperfections of language may be reckoned the not furnishing a denomination which shall designate in relation to good that which is designated by intimidation in relation to evil intimidation is fear exciting    what is wanting is a single word by which hopeexciting may be expressed the more particularly the analogy between punishment and reward is brought to view the more ample is the practically useful instruction that is conveyed the more clearly it is seen that to reward is to punish when the dispensing hand in question is the hand of government and that as to whatsoever is above the least quantity sufficient remuneration is depredation—with the less difficulty will men be brought to extend to the matter of reward whatsoever frugality they are not averse to apply in the case of punishment towards the holding up to view this instructive analogy something it is hoped has been done in the théorie des peines et des récompenses but on going back to it i should not expect to find that as much was done there as might at present be done intimidation and remuneration are employed both of them by good rule and by misrule but though in this they agree there is one point in which they not only are different but opposite this is the quantity of the matter which they respectively employ by good rule it is as in the one case so in the other minimized it is the least possible by misrule it is maximized by good rule intimidation is minimized why even because threatening to produce evil would be in vain if with more or less frequency the threat were not executed—the evil were not produced and even because the fear of evil is itself evil from the fear of sufferance actual sufferance is inseparable by good rule allurement or prospect of remuneration is also minimized why because in government good is not procured but by means of evil the matter of good by means of the matter of evil indeed to no small extent the matter of good and the matter of evil are one and the same thing witness wealth witness power by the receipt of wealth pleasure—enjoyment is produced by the loss of it pain and so likewise in regard to power between wealth and power the connexion is most close and intimate so intimate indeed that the disentanglement of them even in the imagination is matter of no small difficulty they are each of them respectively an instrument of production with relation to the other by wealth with or even without parting with it power may be obtained even in the import of the word power that of wealth is included since power employing for its instrument the matter of remuneration includes in it the power of making application of the matter of wealth and thereby the possession of it occasions however are not wanting in which while on the one hand wealth is conferred no power over any particular person or any particular thing is conferred occasions on the other hand are not wanting in which while power is conferred the matter of wealth is not at the same time in any determinate shape conferred anything else that comes under the denomination of remuneration follows or does not follow according to the use that happens to be made of the power under misrule waste of the matter of good and evil in both its forms takes place of course the quantity wasted affords a measure the most exact that can be found of the degree or quantity of the misrule—of the badness of the rule receivers of the bitter fruits the adversaries of the misrule of the sweets its chief operators and their accomplices as to adversaries misrule has as many as among the individuals subject to it there are those who to sensation add the faculty of thought proportioned to the degree of sufferance is the degree of resentment naturally produced thus it is that misrule has for its inseparable concomitant the thirst of vengeance and this thirst is essentially insatiable as to the sweet fruits it is under pretence of the demand for them in the character of instruments of government that they are collected that to this destination they are in part applied is what cannot be avoided on the one part nor denied on the other for otherwise the government whatever it be could not be in existence but to this indispensable portion is added of course as large a portion as possible of which there is neither need nor use and this needless and superfluous portion is what in addition to whatsoever is needful is made the subject of division among the rulers their instruments dependents and favourites in addition to force intimidation and remuneration which are necessary to all rule misrule adds corruption and delusion the matter or efficient cause of corruption is the matter of good considered as employed in giving effect to sinister interest and thereby to evil by delusion understand the production of erroneous conceptions the effect of which is to engage men to concur in the sacrifice of the universal to the sinister interest in regard to these instruments of misgovernment the need there is of them differs more or less according to the form of the government considered in regard to its form—a government is in the hands either of a ruler or of rulers if in the hands of a single ruler it is a pure monarchy if in the hands of rulers more than one it is either an unmixed or a mixed government if an unmixed government it is either an aristocracy or a democracy if a mixed government the mixture may be composed of monarchy and aristocracy alone of monarchy and democracy alone of aristocracy and democracy alone or of monarchy aristocracy and democracy—all three    of these seven cases the exemplifications of pure monarchy are most numerous the case of pure aristocracy is not exemplified to any considerable extent of the case of pure democracy the longest established and as yet the only completely established exemplification is that afforded by the cluster of incorporated republics constituting the angloamerican united states of the mixture composed of monarchy and aristocracy an exemplification is now scarcely to be seen anywhere of the mixture composed of monarchy and democracy an exemplification may be seen in the case of spain as also in that of portugal of the mixture composed of monarchy aristocracy and democracy in howsoever different proportions exemplifications may be seen in england and in france in regard to the use made of the two abovementioned instruments of misrule the case of the bipartite mixture composed of monarchy and democracy and that of the tripartite mixture composed of monarchy aristocracy and democracy are so nearly the same that what is said of either one may with very little variation be found applicable to the other as in so far as with monarchy a portion of either of the two other simple forms of government has place the power of the monarch finds a limit in the power or powers thus conjoined with it the will of the monarch has a source of resistance and obstruction in those other wills the sensation thus produced in his breast being of an unpleasant nature an object of his constant endeavour will of course be the removal of it by the lessening of the obstructing power—by lessening the resistance opposed to his will by the obstructing wills wherever such a monarchy has place the disposal of official situations is to an extent more or less considerable in the hands of the monarch and to these same situations all or most of them objects of general desire abovementioned is attached money and power with or without factitious honour and dignity this power is called the power of patronage it is the interest and desire of the monarch to increase the number of these situations as much as possible it is the duty of that body to which belongs the portion of power coordinate with that of the monarch with reference to the interests of the community at large to diminish the number of those situations in so far as between the monarch on the one hand and the majority of representatives as they are called on the other an agreement can be come to and is accordingly come to respecting the proportions in which the patronage shall be shared between the parties the sacrifice of the universal interest takes place of course the arrangements which afford a promise of operating as securities to the fabric of government against corruption and corruptive influence—against that dry rot to which all government stands exposed by the nature of the materials of which it must everywhere be composed may it is believed be comprehended all of them under one or other of the heads following viz—   minimizing the quantity of power in the hands of the functionaries   minimizing the quantity of the matter of wealth at the disposal of functionaries   minimizing the quantity of the matter of wealth employed as pay of functionaries   applying legal counterforces to the power of functionaries   applying moral counterforces to the power of functionaries   exclusion of factitious honour or say factitious dignity   exclusion of all other factitious instruments of delusive influence as in the case of every other act so in the case of every act of government add the power to the will the act takes place take away either the act does not take place the problem is—throughout the whole field of legislation how to prevent the sinister sacrifice leaving at the same time unimpaired both the will and the power to perform whatsoever acts may be in the highest degree conducive to the only right and proper end of government in the case of a public functionary the will is on each occasion under the pressure of two opposite and conflicting interests his fractional share in the universal interest and his own particular and personal interest the former is a fraction and everywhere a small one—a partnership interest in a firm in which the partners are counted by millions the latter is an integer and the forces with which they act are proportional still be the fraction ever so small action will be determined by it if the integer be either taken out of the scales or overbalanced whatsoever arrangement has for its object the prevention of the sinister sacrifice must apply itself either to the will or the power but the same arrangement may apply itself to both of the two necessarily conjunct faculties take in hand first the power leaving the power to do good take away or if that cannot be done minimize the power to do evil into the composition of all power enter three elements intensity extent duration its intensity has for its measure the magnitude of the effect produced by the exercise of it within the extent assumed by it the extent has for its measure in so far as it has persons for its subjects the number of those same persons in so far as it has things their number and respective values as to duration it has in this case the same measure as in all other cases in the highest rank to the intensity of power it will be seen no limits can easily if at all be assigned without taking away along with  0 the power to do evil the power to do good and thus leaving evil unopposed to the extent still less to the duration with the utmost ease as well as perfect safety witness in a word the united states in any rank but the highest limits may be set to it in any of its elements or dimensions without any the slightest difficulty power considered in respect of the instruments by which it operates on the human mind and exercises it is either power operating by punishment whence fear of evil or power operating by reward whence hope of good of reward or say remuneration the main shape is the matter of wealth or for shortness putting as is not unusual the part for the whole in one word money by which must in this case be understood not only money but moneys worth—everything that is to be had for money in so far as punishment is the instrument employed and trusted to the word power is retained and employed in so far as reward is the instrument employed and trusted to the word money or some equivalent of it is most commonly employed and note that by being taken away the matter of punishment may be made matter of reward witness pardons as likewise by being taken away the matter of reward may be made matter of punishment witness fines when public money is placed at the disposal of a public functionary the purpose for which it is so placed may be that of its passing out of his hands in exchange for something designed to be employed in the public service or that of its being applied to his own use in retribution for the services whatsoever they may be which he is regarded as rendering or about to render to the public so much for power taken by itself for power and the minimization of it considered as a means of prevention applicable to the abuse of it now as to the other faculty the will by the force of that particular interest to the action of which every human breast stands exposed every functionary is at every moment prompted as above to make by himself or to concur in making the sinister sacrifice if this sinister force can by any means be prevented from becoming in that way effective it must be by the operation of some counterforce in addition to that opposed by his share in the universal interest selfpreference or sinister force the temptation counterforce the sanction antagonizing with one another as to sanctions three of them there has been frequent occasion to hold up to view elsewhere the political including the legal the popular or say the moral and the superhuman or say the religious for a counterforce to the native indigenous sinister interest first as to the political sanction including the legal the force of this sanction is the whole of it at the disposal of the rulers therefore in the very nature of the case it is incapable it may be said of being opposed to them if for a moment it were so the next moment they would rid themselves of it true but though two rulers taken singly cannot be made punishable—legally punishable at the same time and for the same cause each of them by the will of the other—yet arrangements in considerable variety are by no means wanting by which opposition may even under an absolute monarchy be made for a time at least to the will of the rulers even of the supreme ruler or rulers for example in a monarchy were it only to satisfy those whom it may concern that such as is expressed in a certain document is the will of the monarch the countersign the name for example of some official servant of his is regarded as necessary—this servant so long as he continues in such his office has a negative upon that branch of his masters power and possesses in conjunction with him a share in it so again in an absolute monarchy suppose two official servants in the service of the same monarch in the same office or in different offices and one of them having committed a misdeed the other takes measures for punishing him the misdoer being at the same time a favourite with the monarch to the monarch were he so disposed and determined to exercise it the power of saving the misdoer from all punishment and from all prosecution cannot be wanting but this power for some reason or other it may happen to him not to be disposed to exercise here then may be seen another instance of a counterforce even in an absolute monarchy opposing itself to the will of the sovereign a counterforce which though by adequate exertion it might always be in his power yet for this or that cause on this or that occasion it is not his will to overpower and reduce to inefficiency thus have two instances of such counterforces been brought to view both of them capable of having place even under the strongest of all governments—an absolute monarchy but in like manner as these two may have existence and actually have existence so in any number may other such cases have existence in the political machine obstacles of this sort have the effect that friction has in a corporeal machine thus much may suffice for such counterforces belonging to the political sanction as are capable of having existence and not altogether without efficiency even under and against the supreme power in a monarchy the most absolute now as to the force of the popular or say the moral sanction considered in respect of its capacity of operating in relation to the will of the possessor or possessors of the supreme power in the character of a counterforce what for the present may suffice for bringing this moral force to view is the phrase public opinion an object the conceptions commonly suggested by which though not as clear as could be wished cannot be to any eye an altogether    new one in the opinion thus denominated stand included all those by whose obedience the power of the monarch be he who he may or of the rulers be they who they may is constituted let this opinion take a certain turn the habit of obedience ceases on the one part and with it all power on the other accordingly in every government but a representative democracy the idea of this sanction and of the counterforce which it opposes is of all ideas that are capable of presenting themselves to a ruling mind the most disagreeable the most hateful and afflictive between these two sanctions in every such government a war has place a war which until either the form of the government be made to give way to the democratical or the people reduced to the condition of beasts and the force of this sanction thus reduced to nothing can never cease as in a constitution which has for its object the greatest happiness of the one or the few the main object will necessarily be to minimize this counterforce or even to annihilate it so in a constitution which has for its object the greatest happiness of all the great object will be to maximize it the cause that presents itself as being in the highest degree conducive and contributory to this purpose will here come to be delineated in its place and in the reception given to whatsoever shall promise to be in the highest degree contributory to this effect may be seen the most instructive test that imagination can frame of appropriate moral aptitude on the part of rulers lastly comes the superhuman or say religious sanction but of this it will be seen that to any such purpose as that of being employed in the character of a counterforce to the power of those in whose hands is the force of the political including the legal sanction it is essentially inapplicable to the possessors of the supreme power be they who they may instead of being a counterforce it will be an instrument in their hands giving facility instead of applying restriction to misrule is not the force of the religious sanction capable of being employed with useful effect in the character of a counterforce to the possessors of the supreme operative power assuredly not the question here is—what shall be what can be reasonably expected to be done by the possessors of the supreme operative power in the way of applying a bridle to their own power only under the fear of what may otherwise happen to them from the displeasure of the people can they be reasonably expected to do anything to the intent of its contributing to this end under that apprehension it is not impossible for it is not unexampled that institutions may be established operating with considerable force towards the production of this effect but as to the force of the religious sanction in no political state has the supreme operative power ever made this application of it in no political state is it at all probable that by the supreme operative any application should ever be made of it to any other or better purpose than that of an augmentation of its own force instead of a diminution of it in a word the converting it into an instrument of support to misrule instead of an instrument of restraint upon misrule a part of the people are separated from the rest a pretence is set up of their holding with the almighty power a sort of intercourse which no other part of the people hold with it of this pretended intercourse no proof has ever been given the assertion is therefore plainly groundless yet upon no better ground than this unsupported assertion do they take upon them to predict misery beyond conception and without end to whosoever shall presume to deviate in his conduct from the path whch they chalk out this path is the path of unreserved obedience to the rulers with whom they enter into a confederacy this confederacy for the purpose of enabling the contracting parties the more effectually to make the more extensive sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to their own particular and sinister interest is called the alliance between state and church or in the order in which they are preferably mentioned between church and state thus delusion lends its aid to oppression and oppression extorts money to pay for the assistance of imposture as to moral and legal responsibility the counterforces thus distinguished require in the first place a joint consideration by moral responsibility understand here the result of subjection effective subjection—to the power of the moral sanction as applied by the publicopinion tribunal by legal responsibility understand effective subjection to the power of the political including the legal sanction as applied by the several legal judicatories that have place under the government in question to the word responsibility the import thus attached is common to all languages which have sprung out of or derived supplies from a latin stock in english however attached to this same word is another import which requires to be distinguished from it a person is said to be a responsible person not in virtue of his actual and effectual subjection to either tribunal and in particular the legal but in virtue of his being in such a situation principally in respect of his pecuniary circumstances that if it were the desire of government that by means of coercion he should be made to do or suffer so and so he would accordingly be made to do so and so namely by reason of his being in possession of benefits either in money or power or both on which it would be in the power of government at large and the judicial branch of it in particular to take hold supposing it disposed to do so the distinction is a real and an important    one in england the situation of king by the avowed state of the law is placed above the field of legal responsibility to the purpose of exposure to punishment he cannot be made to suffer nor consequently to do anything that it does not please him to do or suffer in the other sense however he is in an abundant degree responsible he has money enough for example by which could it be got at without his name he could be brought to do anything which by any one it was desired he should be seen doing it is by the plenitude of his responsibility in this particular sense that he is eased of all responsibility in the general sense so material it is that the two senses should be mutually distinguished in general from the top of the scale to the bottom the more abundantly responsible a man is in respect of sufficiency the less responsible is he in respect of effectual exposure to punishment under an absolute monarch no responsibility can in the instance of any functionary under him have place unless such should be the masters pleasure and it will not be the masters pleasure unless he be an object of his personal displeasure whatsoever misdeeds he may have committed to the detriment of the universal interest so far as this effective responsibility has place so far it is evident the power of the legal sanction cannot be presented in the character of a counterforce to the power of government in the hands of a supreme ruler or set of supreme rulers but a case not altogether incapable of having place is—at the charge of one set of functionaries his subordinates and instruments say in the department of finance he suffers punishment to be administered by another set say those belonging to the judicial department here then the force of one of those sets acts as a counterforce to another set his equally obsequious instruments thus much as to an absolute monarchy in the case of a limited monarchy the result is not in this respect materially different in this case likewise the power of giving impunity to any one and every one is commonly given by law such is the general rule and if in words and show there be any exceptions the extent given to them is extremely narrow and even to that extent they are without substance and effect as to this point between an absolute and a limited monarchy the mean difference consists in this the impunity which in a direct and open way might by law be alike conferred in both monarchies is in an absolute monarchy accordingly conferred in a direct and open way in a limited monarchy in some indirect and concealed way in preference in a limited monarchy the acts of the monarch and his instruments are necessarily in one way or other more exposed to observation than in an absolute monarchy suppose then a case in which the grant of impunity would in the eyes of the public be in a flagrant degree repugnant to the received notions of justice there may be a convenience in employing some indirect and covert method rather than a direct and open one for the production of the effect a party of soldiers for example are they set on to slaughter a company of malcontents whose abstinence from all violation of the law has rendered it impracticable to apply punishment by the hand of a judge the monarch if he pleased might first give the order to the slaughterers and then pardon them under the english constitution such is its excellence the king might thus kill his subjects and has done so and yet no law be violated so much as to the case of a monarchy in the case of a representative democracy at the charge of the members of the supreme operative power without exception legal responsibility may have place without difficulty legal responsibility not in name only but in effect namely to the purpose of exposure to punishment even during their continuance in office the minority remain in the very nature of the case in a state of legal responsibility as towards and under the majority and from and after the expiration of their authority being on a footing no other than that of the other members of the community they remain each and every of them responsible in the legal sense for whatsoever they may have done—whether in that situation or any other look now to moral responsibility responsibility to the purpose of eventual exposure to the punitive power of the publicopinion tribunal and in particular the power of the democratical section of that same invisible yet not the less effectively operative tribunal to not altogether ineffective responsibility in this shape not only in a representative democracy but even in an absolute monarchy the possessors of the supreme operative power are capable of standing exposed in fact in this shape in some even the most completely absolute monarchies the monarch is always to a certain degree responsible and feels himself so to be though in some monarchies at some times such has been the feebleness of this responsibility in the character of a counterforce to the powers of government in the highest grade that the effect of it in respect of a cause of mitigation to the evils of misrule namely of depredation and oppression has hardly been perceptible the less the quantity of counterforce a public functionary feels opposed to his particular interest in other shapes the greater the need there is of his finding it opposed to him in this shape an absolute monarchy is therefore the sort of government in which the need of it is most pressing and in which accordingly if the end of the government was the greatest happiness of the greatest number it would be established with the greatest promptitude and maintained with the most    anxious care but as in all monarchies the end in view is the happiness of the one with or without a small number of sharers in the operative power the repression of this same prime instrument of security to good government and good morals has been the object of the most anxious and uninterrupted care for bringing into action the force of the publicopinion tribunal—for bringing it to bear upon any pernicious act by whomsoever performed whether by a public functionary or by a nonfunctionary two distinguishable sorts of matter are contributory namely evidentiary matter and commentative matter or matter of comment by evidentiary matter understand matter the effect or tendency of which is to bring or hold up to view the individual act in question in conjunction with all the several circumstances on which the nature of its operation on the happiness of the community depends by matter of comment understand all such discourse the effect or tendency of which is to afford indication true or false correct or erroneous concerning the operation of such act on the happiness of the community in such sort as to be in this or that way contributory or detrimental to it all such salutary matter in both these forms every functionary in proportion to the power which from the nature of his situation he has of pursuing his own particular interest at the expense of the universal interest has an interest in the suppression of an interest the strength of which is in proportion to the profit capable of being derived by him from such sinister acts every functionary in proportion to his power and accordingly in a monarchy whether absolute or limited the monarch in a monarchy limited by an aristocracy the aristocracy by every act a functionary exercises for the purpose of destroying or weakening the power of this counterforce in order to prevent or restrain the publication of such tutelary discourse he manifests himself an enemy thus engaged in a course of actual hostility against the happiness of the community in the sinister interest by which they are engaged in the endeavour to effect such suppression functionaries engaged in giving execution and effect to the acts of a bad government and functionaries engaged in misdeeds for their own benefit in disobedience to the good acts of a good government are naturally joined by individuals concerned or meaning to be concerned in such pernicious acts to the repression of which the power of the legal sanction is not applicable of every such indication and of every such comment the tendency is defamation defamation with reference to the party to whom the alleged pernicious act whatsoever it be is thereby imputed to oppose defamation as such to oppose without exception or discrimination every act to which the term defamation may with propriety be applied is to act as an accomplice to all crimes—as an instrument of all mischief as above every such act is therefore a virtual confession of such complicity of such hostility to the happiness of the greatest number to profess to be a supporter either of good government or of good morals and at the same time to profess to be desirous of seeing defamation suppressed or even restricted in a case in which the imputation conveyed by it is true is little less than a contradiction in terms it is to desire that the same thing shall and shall not have place at the same time one case there is and but one in which the effect of defamation supposing the misdeed charged by it really committed is not to increase but to reduce the quantity of happiness in the community this is where the mischief produced is produced—not by the act itself but by the disclosure of it in this case are comprehended all those in which for want of sufficient maturity in the public judgment the popular antipathy has been drawn upon this or that act the nature of which is not upon the balance of a pernicious nature examples of this case are—   in a community in which the public mind is infected with the disease of intolerance in matters of religion indication of an act evidencing the entertaining an opinion contrary to that which is established or predominant   so in the field of taste eccentricity of any venereal appetite the sexual for example by which no pain in any assignable shape is produced anywhere here by the supposition by the act itself no pain no sensible evil is produced but by the disclosure of it evil to a most deplorable amount may be produced by the antipathy though by the supposition groundless—by the antipathy called forth by it a whole life may be filled with misery the real enemy to the happiness of the community is not he by whom this obnoxious act has been exercised but he by whom the indication of it has been afforded the suffering being greater the mischief is greater in the case where the act has been than in the case where the act has not been really exercised for he in whose instance the imputation has been groundless has for his consolation that which is wanting to the other   indication of a breach of a marriage contract on either side more particularly the female suppose the commission of it unknown no pain is produced by it anywhere what then when committed ought it to remain exempt from punishment oh no why not even for this cause namely that without the commission the divulgation could not have place and that by commission divulgation is always rendered but too probable those who cry out against what they call the licentiousness of the press as if it were so    much uncompensated evil for which complete suppression would be an appropriate and innoxious cure might with much more reason cry out against all punishment without distinction and in particular against all punishment at the hands of the legal sanction and the tribunals by which the force of that sanction is applied for in no other form at once so gentle and so efficient and in particular in no form of legal punishment could punishment be employed in the repression of anything that has ever been characterized by the names of crime or vice punishment as applied by the legal tribunals attaches to such evil acts alone the mischief of which has place as well in a shape sufficiently determinate as in a quantity sufficiently great to warrant the application of evil in the shape and in the quantity to which the denomination of punishment is in common use punishment as applied by the publicopinion tribunal applied as it is in effect without the name attaches itself to mischief in all shapes in which the hand of man can without special and sufficient justification be instrumental in the production of it applied by the legal tribunal punishment is not only thus narrow in its applicability and thence in its use but continually exposed to the danger of running into excess evils from which the punishment which the publicopinion tribunal makes application of is altogether exempt and free the efficiency of the popular or moral sanction with its publicopinion tribunal cannot be strengthened but the efficiency of the law in so far as its force is employed in augmentation of the happiness of the people is also strengthened in so far as a misdeed which by reason of its detrimental effect on happiness is vicious and thereby exposes the agent to punishment at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal is moreover criminal—an act of delinquency against the law exposing the agent to punishment at the hands of the law—every channel through which defamation as above may be divulgated is a channel through which in so far as the defamation takes this turn strength and efficiency are given to the law through these channels men who would otherwise remain helpless receive help and abatement of their sufferings injuries and sufferings which would otherwise swell to a boundless magnitude and be rendered altogether remediless are met by complaint and kept within bounds through these channels men who by their own indigence and the rapacity of lawyers are deprived of all help at the hands of the legal sanction with its judicatories find a limit and a mitigation to their sufferings for suppose the act in question to be of the number of those to which punishment stands attached as well at the hands of the legal sanction as at the hands of the popular or moral sanction this being the case to give intimation of it to the members of the community at large in their capacity of members of the publicopinion tribunal is to give indication by the light of which not only witnesses but prosecutors at the bar of the competent legal tribunal may be brought into action and the further investigation of whatever relevant facts would otherwise remain in darkness produced that which to the publicopinion tribunal is evidence to the purpose of conviction in an immediate way being to the legal tribunal evidence to the purpose of investigation for the obtainment of ulterior evidence such as suffices in the first place for a ground to accusation and in the next place for the obtainment of such evidence as shall suffice for conviction and punishment against all such misdeeds as are produced or protected by supreme rulers the legal sanction with the corresponding judicatories refuse of course all redress against all such misdeeds whatever redress if any is afforded it is by the popular or moral sanction with its publicopinion tribunal that it must be afforded of the channels through which information in both its shapes as above must find its way to the public eye and the public ear beyond all comparison the most ample and efficient are those in the designation of which the collective term the press is commonly employed and of those again the most ample and efficient are those for the designation of which the collective term the periodical press is employed every act by which the net mass of benefit derivable through these channels is lessened or endeavoured to be lessened is of the number of those by which the actor is rendered as above an enemy to all mankind for lessening the net amount of this benefit the nature of the case affords two expedients or courses of policy the one consists in the blocking up of the channels and thereby stopping in the whole or in part the current of information that would otherwise make its way through them to the eyes and ears of the public—of the members of the community taken in the aggregate the other consists in rendering in a greater or less degree corrupt and delusive the stock of information which is so received the one system may be styled the blockading or obstructive system the other the corruptive the obstructive operates by the simple subtraction of such information as being correct is at the same time usefully instructive the corruptive operates by the addition of a mass of information in itself false and designed to be deceptious by subtraction deception may also be produced as well as by corruption to this purpose what may happen to be sufficient is to render partial the stock which is suffered to pass on partial that is to say in the bad sense of the word being the same in which it is used when subservient    to injustice that which is regarded as operating against the side meant to be favoured by the deceit being stopped while that which is regarded as operating in favour of it is suffered to pass on for operating on the obstructive plan the nature of the case affords two modes of restriction—the licensing system and the prosecuting system licensing is an operation of which prohibition and that a universally extensive one forms the principal ingredient in the first place comes prohibition which applies to everything in the next place comes permission given to any such persons or any such things as it is intended to exempt from the prohibition in comparison with the licensing system the prosecuting system is in an eminent degree inefficient it cannot be employed except in so far as the very sort of thing which it is the endeavour of it to cause not to be done has been actually done where it does operate its mode of operation is comparatively weak and its effect uncertain in the licensing system is included the employing for the stoppage of the obnoxious matter physical force seizing for example the whole impression of a work and either keeping or destroying it it operates not only thus upon the body but also upon the mind viz in the way of intimidation by fear of loss if similar works are prepared for publication in future while it keeps from observation the mischief which it produces prosecution proclaims that same mischief the punishment which in the shape of loss as above is one of its means of action is much more effective than any which being applied under the name of punishment cannot be applied without prosecution for a preliminary to it not to speak of the expense the uncertainty which in the case of prosecution always hangs upon the result together with the delay and vexation which even on the prosecutors side stand inseparably attached to prosecution is saved not only too is the punishment so much more efficacious but it is moreover kept concealed from observation and thus is not only more efficacious than punishment under the name of punishment but at the same time less odious though it affords just ground for greater odium yet it attracts less by the prosecuting system punishment is applied as above under the name of punishment having or seeking to have the effect of prohibition if in england it be in the way of common law that the punishment is applied the prohibition is fictitious as to the act for which the punishment is sought to be inflicted there has been none as to future contingent similar ones each man is left to imagine for himself a prohibition from the case in which he sees the punishment applied if it be in the way of real or statute law that the punishment is applied the eventual denunciation made of it comes before it—the subject of the prohibition has been described prohibition is either complete as under the name of prohibition it is of course or incomplete as it is where in so far as to the form of prohibition that of taxation is substituted under every application of the taxing system in so far as applied to articles for consumption or use an application of the licensing system is contained pay the tax you have a license to use the article omit paying the tax the license is refused to you but under the licensing system is in this case concealed the corruptive system by the effect of the tax such information as a man is able and willing to purchase and obtain by paying the tax is suffered to pass on and reach him such as he is either not able or not adequately willing thus to purchase is stopped and prevented from reaching him note the consequence where there is a desire to serve the comparatively rich at the expense of the comparatively poor that which the poor man has need of to enable him to form a right judgment and pursue a line of conduct beneficial to his interest is stopped from reaching him while his comparatively rich antagonist receives the matter on both sides in the contest between rich and poor the means of attack are thus suffered to find their way to the rich while from the poor the means of defence are kept back and rendered inaccessible the indirect mode of corruption by garbling is not altogether so mischievous as either of the two others of the matters thus kept from publication no such individual selection can be made as in the other case still however separation in no small degree mischievous can be made and is made as it is only by the power of government that this corruption and this obstruction can be carried into effect it is manifestly for the purpose of misrule for the purpose of giving extension and perpetuity to misrule and thereby to human misery in all its shapes that war upon the happiness of mankind in both these shapes is carried on but information to any one nation is information to every other thus to add to misrule and misery in one nation by obstructing the press is to endeavour to add to misrule and misery in all it is still more extensively and effectively an act of hostility against all nations than piracy is for the mischief and terror produced by a pirate is confined to the seas in which his acts of piracy are exercised it is confined also within the space of time never a very long one during which those acts continue to be exercised but the mischief produced by the suppression of information on the side of the victims of misrule while false and delusive information in support of misrule is let through may spread itself over all nations and continue in all times among the consequences of restrictions imposed in the ordinary form on the press one is the efficiency thus given to false reports in their most mischievous shapes false and mischievous    reports as such whosoever may be the parties on whom the evil produced by them falls take in the first place the situation of the ruling functionaries and in particular those of the highest rank in the scale of subordination defamation in the written shape it is possible to keep suppressed defamation to the same effect in an oral shape it is not possible to keep suppressed you may keep a watch upon all presses you cannot keep a watch upon all tongues when it is in a printed shape it is in a determinate shape and being in a determinate and that an enduring shape any one who feels disposed to make answer to it knows what it is he answers and where to find it in whatever state it first makes its appearance in that state it remains it cannot by the author or by the adopter be altered from shape to shape in a manner contrary to truth and justice just as occasion calls it may be met and opposed in whatsoever manner is best adapted to the nature of it is it in any way false it may be opposed by simple denial or by the statement of the opposite truth is it not only false but improbable the arguments demonstrative of the improbability may be opposed to it is it mischievous the mischievousness of it may be laid open to view and shame proportioned to the evil be poured down upon the head of the author and his accomplices in proportion as they are discovered such are the facilities which present themselves for the encountering of it when the shape in which it presents itself is thus determinate now suppose it merely in the oral shape being refutation proof being proof against exposure the probability is that even in its first shape it is false it is either a complete fabrication in the whole texture of it or if there be a groundwork of truth belonging to it an embroidery of falsehood is interwoven in it such as suits the particular purpose whatever it be but this first howsoever mischievous and injurious is naturally its least mischievous and least injurious shape and even in this shape it is not capable of being encountered from the first mouth it passes on to another and in the second mouth further mischievousness further injuriousness with or even without consciousness and intentionality are naturally added thus it travels on from mouth to mouth and as it rolls on it adds to its mischievousness and injuriousness at every stage to the number of these stages there is no limit and at no one of them can it ever be encountered a circumstance which has a natural tendency to provoke falsehood and through falsehood injury to the prejudice of the government by which the restriction is imposed is the resentment which the restriction itself calls forth a resentment than which nothing can in any case be better grounded or more just where oppression is exercised and there is no other remedy—no other defence against it is afforded by the nature of the case falsehood if not justifiable is at any rate comparatively excusable of every such restriction the effect and object is to secure efficiency and impunity to oppression and depredation in every shape the worst imaginable not excepted from no course that can be taken by the endeavour to put an end to such an instrument of oppression can any evil be produced equal to the evil produced by the application of the instrument itself if the application be effective to the encountering of such endeavours by appropriate falsehoods in the way of retaliation the grand objection is that in general it will be needless for seldom are they employed but for the purpose of concealing enormities the correct statement of which would suffice for the imfamizing of the oppressive rulers without the addition of anything that is not true and besides in proportion as falsehood comes to be discovered the discovery casts reproach upon the heads of those concerned in the propagation of it and discredit upon such reproachful imputations as are true be this as it may thus much is clear that where any such restriction is employed whether all the injurious allegations made against the rulers are true or not no suspicions that can be entertained of them can be illgrounded for supposing the intentions of a ruler the worst imaginable such is the course which he would not fail to take for the carrying of them into effect while on the other hand suppose his conduct free from all just imputation of misrule no need would he have of any such screen the just odium which the employing of it could not fail to draw upon him would be so much net evil drawn down upon him by himself by no number of determinate acts of tyranny could a more proper and reasonable cause for resistance and insurrection be afforded supposing success in a sufficient degree probable than by the establishment of this restriction for in the use of this instrument the intention of exercising tyranny in its worst shape is included the intention coupled with a probability always but too great of its being carried into effect in proportion to the amount of the burthen of the restriction does it exclude from the exercise of the functions of the publicopinion tribunal a number more or less considerable of its members it excludes from the benefit of appropriate information those in whose instance such information is most needed there are two correspondent and apposite modes of laying claim to the exercise of the blockading power on the ground of alleged or assumed superiority in intellectual aptitude the one consists in magnifying the alleged aptitude of the governors the other in parvifying the aptitude of the governed each of them is employed as occasion serves the parvifying mode may be used in all situations as it may happen it gives no offence to    the reader or hearer if he be of the ruling or otherwise influential class in a word unless in his own conception he belongs to that inferior class at the expense of which the pretension is set up the magnifying mode being in fact the selfmagnifying mode cannot without giving offence be employed in any other situation than those in which custom has thrown its veil over arrogance impudence and insolence namely the situation of those by whom the power of surmounting contradiction by punishment is possessed and exercised it is curious to see with what complacency in certain authoritative discourses the possession of the maximum of official aptitude in all its branches and in particular intellectual aptitude in the degree indicated by the romantic appellation wisdom is predicated of themselves by the very scum of the population for be it pot or be it kingdom that which occupies the top of it is it not the scum by a set of men in comparison of whom the most vicious of those whom they consign to death or punishment which ends not but with life are virtuous by a body composed of the principals and instruments of misrule depredation and oppression all upon the largest scale of corruptors and corrupted of selfish and emptyheaded lawyers—led by a few venal utterers of vague generalities and commonplace fallacies men whose minds being debilitated by that worse than useless education which under a system of corrupt and corruptive establishments overgrown opulence bestows know not an unapt argument from an apt one a relevant argument from an irrelevant one possessing neither the inclination nor the ability to discern the difference whichsoever of the two courses be taken they lead to the same result absolute power on the part of those on whose behalf they are taken absolute subjection with no option other than that between silence and obsequiousness on the part of those at whose expense they are taken what by depravity what by folly you are incapacitated not only from giving direction to your own conduct but from having any part in the choosing of those by whom direction to it shall be given such being your deplorable state it belongs to us and to us alone to give direction to your conduct in this line as in every other to determine what you may say and what you shall not say for so sure as you are suffered to say anything to our prejudice to start so much as a doubt on our probity or our wisdom so sure will you do injury irremediable injury to yourselves and to one another the points by which your happiness now and for ever is most deeply affected are those which belong to religion and politics on these it is therefore in a more particular manner our duty to prevent your looking in any other point of view than such as we prescribe it is your first of duties to hold yourselves deprived of all liberty on these points it is our first of duties so to hold you deprived of it thus it is that with benevolence in their mouths all by whom any such language is employed declare themselves in effect enemies of mankind if the benevolence be but in their mouths it is bad if it be in their hearts it is worse still worse if so it be that it is only by some temporal and temporary interest of his own that a man is induced thus to persecute and torment others no sooner is that interest overcome by an opposite interest than the persecution ceases by force by intimidation by superior benefit from a contrary course he may be led to give it up at any time but if it really be either by fear of infinitely intense and lasting torment or hope of infinitely intense and lasting happiness that a man stands engaged thus to do his utmost for the tormenting of others in the only state of things which falls under our experience or observation his mischievousness in the firstmentioned character is small in comparison with his mischievousness in this if in all other points his conduct be even a pattern not only of beneficence but of benevolence he is rendered by it but the more mischievous the more so the more extensive his beneficence for the utmost good a man can do by beneficence in other shapes can never approach to the evil it may happen to him to do by maleficence in this if therefore there be a sort of man whom interest and moral duty should lead all others to shun contact with as they would shun contact with a man infected with the plague it should be the man who under a sincere persuasion of religious duty on his part seeks to prevent others from the defence or utterance of opinions be they what they may on any subject belonging to the field of religion or the field of government in the case of private defamation the mischief stares every one in the face but along with it is mixed much good and of this good men do not in general seem sensible to take the strongest case—the case in which if in any the evil would appear pure—the case where the misconduct imputed is by the imputer known not to have had place the imputation in a word known to have been knowingly and wilfully false here the effects of the first order the uneasiness experienced by the individual to whom the misconduct is imputed are evil though less evil than where the imputation is true because a man suffers less from the imputation when groundless than when true the effects of the second order the apprehension excited in other persons at large—the apprehension of being made sufferers by similar attacks from the same or other sources are also evil but by the contemplation of the evil suffered in these two ways by groundless imputations the attention of men is directed to and the more firmly fixed upon the like suffering as being    more or less likely to be produced by true imputations and in this way accordingly addition is made to the fear of punishment at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal what is too obvious and too certain to pass unnoticed is that the inducement being equal in both cases a defamer if he knew of an article of misconduct of which his intended victim had been really guilty proofs of his guilt more or less satisfactory being in existence would never think of preferring an ungrounded accusation in any shape to that same well grounded one not that currency knowingly allowed to false and unjust imputation is in any degree as such conducive and necessary to the repression of the misconduct that would have had place had the imputation been well grounded not that the antipathy against the inventors and common circulators of such false imputations is not well founded not that they ought not to be subjected to legal punishment in so far as sufficient proof can be obtained all that is meant is that all imputations grounded and ungrounded together ought not to be suppressed without distinction for the more effectual suppression of ungrounded ones the publicopinion tribunal with its numerous useful effects ought not to be suppressed for the single benefit of more effectually preventing the pernicious ones that which a man suffers in whose instance the imputation is false is little in comparison with what the man suffers in whose instance the same imputation is true accordingly the marks of vexation exhibited will naturally be in the same proportion the intensity of the desire manifested for suppression and vengeance factitious honour is a sort of counterfeit substitute for money invented and fabricated by governments money procures services factitious honour procures services and among them even such as it is not in the power of money to reach power and money though in both instances the less the quantity that can be made to serve the better are to the purpose of doing good indispensable instruments in the hands of rulers they are both of them according to the direction in which they are made to operate instruments of preponderant good or instruments of preponderant evil factitious honour it will be seen is purely an instrument of evil in the hands of rulers power and money require to be minimized out of the hands of rulers factitious honour requires to be altogether kept one advantage in beginning with power on the occasion of the minimization process—one reason for proceeding in this order may now be visible the less the power you have to contend with the greater the facility in such application as you have to make to the will thus as above if the possessor of the power is at all events to keep his hold of it so long as he lives or even so long as he remains legally unconvicted of a specific misdeed the difficulty of dealing with him may be insurmountable and by a mass of power small in extent as well as intensity evil to an almost indefinite amount may be produced were it only that by means of one lot of power thus intrenched as in a stronghold others indefinite in number and value may be added by him on the other hand when it is to the dimension of its duration that the defalcatingknife is applied no power so ample in its other two dimensions but may be conferred with comparative safety witness in the roman commonwealth the dictatorship—a power which with the exception of what was thus defalcated from it was absolute monarchy all this while one thing is undeniable namely that for the purpose of establishing and in the endeavour to establish security those who establish government must begin with establishing insecurity insecurity viz as against those in whose hands the means of security against others are reposed on the other hand another thing is no less undeniable namely that without this risk the other a still greater evil cannot by any possibility be avoided and that is want of security against foreign enemies or unempowered malefactors another thing equally true is that by the badness of other governments whoever you are you are prevented from making your own whatever it is so good as otherwise it might be in this case are the civilized nations of europe at present with their standing armies in every foreign nation each nation beholds a population which may every moment become a hostile one—a population of foreign adversaries each nation is thus laid under the unhappy necessity of providing itself with a correspondent instrument of defence to preserve itself from a distant yoke it submits itself to present servitude hence it is that to the other articles in the list of counterforces must be added the institution of a national militia the more extensive this counterforce is the greater the security of the nation not only against foreign but against domestic adversaries not only against the rulers and subjects of every foreign nation but against its own rulers whoever they are against these where the quantity of armed force in this shape is at its maximum so is this security—the security thus established in a word it is entire for in this case the degree of efficiency with which in case of depredation or oppression on the part of rulers the people are capable of acting in concert for the purpose of redress is at its maximum an entire people with arms in their hands cannot be employed as instruments of oppression why for this plain reason that they have no victims to act against—to operate upon    the elementary units of this force—the individuals of which it is composed are no other than the members of the publicopinion tribunal they are judges with arms in their hands prepared in case of necessity to give execution to their own judgments a force thus circumstanced may be so organized as that while it is incapacitated from being made to act as an instrument of offence it may be rendered completely adequate for every purpose of defence and to this purpose one simple arrangement is sufficient a declaration that without an express law for the purpose no part of the population thus fortified shall be obliged or permitted to move out of the territory of the state for providing the community with the very maximum of force in this shape small in comparison is the utmost expense that can be necessary of the incorporeal instruments of misrule shall fiction be added to the list with respect to the others it is altogether disparate for it is not produced by the same efficient causes—by money power and factitious honour though not the sister of delusion it is however in a certain sense the offspring of that evil genius fiction men have actually been made to regard as an instrument apt and necessary to good government in general and to good judicature in particular so mischievous an error where shall the efficient cause of the prevalence of it be found in delusion—in delusive influence by the same causes that delusion has been produced has this preeminently mischievous error been produced by the several efficient causes of delusive influence men have been led to regard as their natural and best friends—their protectors and guardians their most implacable and irresistible enemies namely kings and judges and advocates placed over them by kings for giving effect to the system of depredation and oppression concerted between the archdepredator and these his instruments they have woven a tissue of falsehood—they have concocted a mass of poison in the shape of falsehood and with the name of fiction—which by the stupid ignorant patience of the people they have been suffered to inject into every vein of the bodypolitic and have thus added this source of corruption to the others corruption and delusion are necessary concomitants to each other the same causes that produce the one produce the other likewise the corruption cannot exist but the delusion must exist likewise the delusion cannot exist but the corruption must exist likewise for it is out of the same matter that both evils are engendered not so fiction without fiction corruption and delusion might have done their worst fiction is a production of peculiarly english growth in the roman law the word may here and there be seen fiction debases the moral part of the mental frame of all those by whom application is made of it fiction debases the intellectual part of the mental frame of all those upon whom the imposition passes and by whom the lie uttered in place of a reason is accepted as constituting a reason and that a sufficient one and when employed by a judicial functionary the evil is greatly aggravated in general fiction may be stated to be an instrument of arbitrary power invented by functionaries invested with limited power for the purpose of breaking through the limits by which their power was intended to be circumscribed reference had to the greatest happiness of the greatest number appropriate aptitude on the part of public functionaries depends upon the efficiency and the use made of the several securities abovementioned reference had to the greatest happiness of the ruling one and few appropriate aptitude on the part of those same functionaries depends in great measure on the nonapplication of those same securities taking them one by one the state of the matter in this respect will be as follows— good government i moral aptitude     identification of rulers interest with peoples interest     minimization of rulers power     minimization of money at rulers disposal     minimization of rulers pay     maximization of legal responsibility     maximization of moral responsibility ii intellectual aptitude     or   application and maximization of the precedential test of appropriate aptitude viz appropriate examination     or   minimization of factitious remuneration iii active aptitude     or   maximization of official attendance iv all branches taken together    0 or   maximization of the collation and publication of appropriate facts and judgments indicative of official aptitude or inaptitude      or   maximization of publicity of official obligations english government i moral aptitude     sacrifice of peoples interest to rulers interest     maximization of rulers power     maximization of money at rulers disposal     maximization of rulers pay     minimization of legal responsibility     minimization of moral responsibility ii intellectual aptitude     or   nonapplication of the precedential test of appropriate aptitude viz appropriate examination     or   maximization of factitious remuneration  0 iii active aptitude     or   minimization of official attendance iv all branches taken together    0 or   minimization of the collation and publication of appropriate facts and judgments indicative of official aptitude or inaptitude      or   minimization of publicity of official obligations in defence of the system of misrule as at present carried on in england a plea in bar against reform and a plea that seems to be most generally employed and relied on is—that the system that has place now is the same as that by which all the good effects that have ever been experienced have been produced the same on which all the praises that have ever been bestowed upon it by foreign nations as well as its own have been bestowed if things themselves are to be considered and not mere words—the things themselves and not merely the words employed in speaking of them nothing can be further from the truth the assertion if it be anything to the purpose amounts to this viz that to the power exercised by the ruling one in conjunction with the subruling few once the subject many there exists at present checks and securities against abuse either the same as or not less effectual than any which ever had place at any former point of time this will be found completely false and groundless whether the power of aggression on the part of the one and the few be considered or the power of selfdefence on the part of the many on the part of the rulers the power of aggression may be distinguished into the power of violence and the power of corruption on the part of the subject many the power of selfdefence may be distinguished into that which they exercise by their representatives meaning always their actual deputies and delegates freely chosen by them and that which they exercise by themselves first as to the power of aggression by violence it consists in and in its amount is proportioned to the standing force of a military nature under the absolute command of the ruling one of this force there are two branches the land force and the sea force for the period of comparison take in the first place the year      being the fifth year after the war that terminated in the peace of      army in       0000 army in       00000 navy in        000 navy in       0000 so far as aggressive power is concerned to say that it is no greater now than it was in      is to say that one hundred thousand is no more than twenty thousand or that sixty thousand is no more than fifteen thousand the more assured the influence and efficiency of those causes by the force of which in every government the ruling functionaries are on each occasion prompted and urged to concur in the making of the sinister sacrifice the more strenuous and universal will of course be the endeavours to conceal from the eyes of all who do not participate in the benefit of it the existence of the sacrifice itself and thence the existence and the efficiency of the motives which on each occasion give birth to it by action if sufficiently observed the demonstration afforded by it is on every occasion complete for producing disbelief of the existence of it—for preventing men from descrying motives through the medium of actions remain as the only resource which the nature of the case furnishes or admits of—professions in this case the actions constitute the circumstantial evidence and professions—mere words the direct evidence the circumstantial evidence by which the existence of the sacrifice and the part borne by each man in the making of it is demonstrated being conclusive nothing is left but to abuse the ears and if possible blind the eyes and confound the understanding the conception and the judgment by an allembracing and indefatigably and vehemently urged body of this same direct evidence evidence which in every instance is mendacious but the mendacity of it not being in its nature capable of being rendered perceptible to sense—perceptible to the bodily organs of those addressed in the character of judges hence it is that it ever has been in the most unblushing manner obtruded and will so continue to be to the very last for this purpose not inconsiderable is the variety of phrases as common as any is purity of motives by this phrase what is meant to be insinuated is either that in the part the man takes he has no regard whatsoever for his own personal interest or any other narrow interest or that if he has any it gives way at all times to his regard for the national or some other more extensive interest but preferably the meaning is such being the more direct and obvious import of the words the utter absence of every particle of selfregard of this immaculate purity each man in the most peremptory manner asserts the existence in his own instance deny it or hesitate to admit it you offer him an affront—an affront the stain of which he perhaps not unfrequently invites you to permit him to wash away with your blood of this same purity he calls upon    you though perhaps in a tone not quite so loud to admit on the part of his colleagues and supporters nor yet unless under the smart of some particular provocation or in the ardour of some particularly advantageous thrust is he backward in the acknowledgment of the same purity in the breasts of honourable gentlemen on the other side of the house by this means while the praise of good temper and candour is obtained the price for the purchase of the corresponding acknowledgment on the other side is thus paid in advance no government so corrupt but that it is in the habit of receiving acknowledgments of this sort from its opponents nor are these acknowledgments inconsistent with the rules of policy for if the position were—all is impurity on that side all is purity on our side—people might be found to doubt of it especially in those instances in which the very same men have been seen sometimes on the one side sometimes on the other and in that case the result might be in some eyes a rational supposition of its nonexistence on either side at the expense of truth need it be said is all this laudation and selfworship every atom of it but the more irrefragably true is the contrary position the more strenuous is the urgency of the demand for it thus it is that urged by the necessity which on all sides they are under of making men in general continue in the belief of the nonexistence of that which they are seeing and feeling the effects of at every moment public men join in the inculcating of the errors correspondent and opposite to the most important truths in causing men to believe that under a form of government so thoroughly corrupt that all who belong to it are in a state of corruption—none are to believe in that fabled purity which is not ever true even where temptation is at its minimum much less in a situation in which it is at its maximum this being the language of rulercraft what is the language of simple truth that in spite of everything which is said the general predominance of selfregard over every other sort of regard is demonstrated by everything that is done that in the ordinary tenor of life in the breasts of human beings of ordinary mould self is everything to which all other persons added to all other things put together are as nothing that this general habit of self preference is so far from being a just subject of denial or even a reasonable cause of regret that the existence of it is an indispensable condition not only to the wellbeing but to the very being of the human species and should therefore be a cause of satisfaction that admitting as perhaps it may be admitted that in a highly matured state of society in here and there a highly cultivated and expanded mind under the stimulus of some extraordinary excitement a sacrifice of selfregarding interest to social interest upon a national scale has not been without example—public virtue in this shape cannot reasonably be regarded as being so frequently exemplified as insanity and that as in the case of insanity so in this—it is in what has place in the conduct on the part of the thousands and not in what has place in the conduct of one in every thousand that all rational and useful political arrangements will be grounded of a state of things thus incontrovertible no sooner is the existence to a certain degree extensively acknowledged than all pretence to this species of purity will be regarded as would an assertion of chastity in the mouth of a prostitute at the very moment of solicitation regarded as an insult to the understandings of all those to whom it is addressed—and will as such be resented partly through artifice partly through blind imitation almost every sort of document by which right instruction ought to be administered is regularly and constantly employed in the drawing of those flattering pictures of human nature flattering in so far as that disposition is ascribed by which if really possessed in the degree in which it is represented as possessed the destruction of the whole species would be the consequence these pictures of human nature are drawn without any determinate and declared line of distinction yet so ordered that the favourites of fortune are the only individuals that have the benefit of it in all histories in all biographies in all funeral sermons in all obituaries is praise poured out with the most boundless and indiscriminating profusion upon those who howsoever spoken of while living are thus richly compensated when dead that for fortunes favourites alone is the praise destined—that by them alone it is or can be invoked is not expressly said yet so it is that to none other can any part of it ever have application thus it is that in all these documents honour and praise bestowed operates as a bounty upon oppression and depredation as an encouragement to persevere in all those courses by which human misery on the largest scale is produced it is from the same pernicious artifice that the adage—of the dead say nothing but what is good has its source i e give on every occasion false and delusive instruction in the most important of all branches of art and science instruction by which the few may be engaged to commit oppression and depredation in every shape and the many engaged to submit to it tender in their sympathy for those who have no feeling callous to the sufferings of all those who are exposed to suffer from the crimes of their confederates this doctrine is inculcated in all seats of instruction in every monarchy to his disadvantage nothing to his advantage anything thus bating a few exceptions the portrait presented by the aggregate of these documents is that of universal excellence not that by    the word excellence anything approaching to the character of a distinct idea can be ever presented all that is presented is a something by which the individual is constituted a fit subject of admiration and consequently of imitation but these so fit subjects of admiration and imitation to which class do they belong uniformly to that class by which all the mischief done in the world has been done while those who never come in for any share of this admiration and this praise are with a few exceptions as before of the class of those by whom at the same time whatever good has been done has been done in the labouring—the productive class life in its general tenor is a life of beneficence whatever maleficence has place forms the exception and in comparison with the beneficence those exceptions are extremely rare by the produce of his labour he procures his own subsistence and contributes to that of the family to which he belongs in so doing he contributes at the same time to his own gratification for by the constitution of human nature gratification is inseparably attached to those operations by which the individual—and hence by which the species—is preserved at the same time to an indefinite amount according to the nature of his employment he contributes to the gratification of others in abundance others by whom no such contributions are made to the general stock of felicity by him no mischief is done no depredation committed—no oppression in any other shape committed not the smallest particle of that praise and admiration ever falls to the share of this uniformly beneficent class so far from being objects of respect or sympathy they are objects of contempt and antipathy they serve but as foils to the receptacles of all excellence here then are two distinct and opposite classes the one composed of those by whom the disagreeable sensation called disgust is constantly experienced the other composed of those who are the objects of it—those from whom it is experienced but those from whom it is experienced are undoubtedly in a physical sense comparatively impure the quality on account of which they are the objects of disgust is impurity while the opposite agreeable quality is among the incontestable attributes of those by whom they are contemplated in this point of view but by those by whom everything is produced small indeed in comparison is either the time or the money that can be afforded by them in freeing themselves from impurities—never sufficient for the satisfaction of those their superiors in the scale of fortune unfortunately of the appellation impure in the case in which it is with propriety applied to the productive classes the propriety is much more obvious and incontestable than in the case in which it is with so much less propriety applicable to those same classes namely in the moral sense—while it is with so much more propriety applicable to the unproductive classes if a man be covered with dirt you see it in a moment by a glance at his face but if he be a man who after sacrificing to his own gratification the subsistence of  00000 human beings of the productive class is still running in debt disdaining to apply a bridle to that rapacity by which he is urged to go on in the same sinister sacrifice so long as an obtainable particle of it remains unsacrificed—nothing of this do you see in his face or in anything about him on the contrary you see him encompassed with trappings the object of which and in but too great a degree the effect is to cause you to regard him not as being distinguished by any of those mischievous qualities by which he is so preeminently distinguished—but as one who is pure of all those qualities from the effects of which suffering in various shapes to other individuals is derived to the devising of any wellgrounded and rational course for the surmounting of the obstacles opposed to good government by the universal selfpreference in the breasts of the functionaries of government—of the constituted guardians of the universal interest—the first step was the taking a true observation of the existence and shape of that same universally prevalent particular and sinister interest this theory being accomplished correspondent and accordant practice becomes a matter of course hence into the compass of these two words may be condensed the alldirecting and leading rule—minimize confidence such then is the advice which the framer of this constitution has not been backward in giving to all who are disposed to accept it confine within the strictest limits of necessity whatsoever confidence you may be tempted to repose either in them or their successors at the same time here as in a watch does this mainspring require another to antagonize with it of all constituents be it at the same time the care from no delegate to withhold any of that power which may eventually be necessary to the due performance of the service looked for at his hands while confidence is minimized let not power be withheld for security against breach of trust the sole apt remedy is—on the part of trustees not impotence but constant responsibility and as towards their creators—the authors of their political being—on every occasion and at all times the strictest and most absolute dependence in the first place with powers no otherwise limited on the part of the supreme legislative the most absolute dependence on the supreme constitutive and thus in a chain reaching down to the lowest functionary each link through the medium of the several increasing links in a state of equally perfect dependence on the supreme legislative and by this means on the supreme constitutive if    the supreme constitutive were in a single hand—in the hand of a monarch no objection would there be on his part to this chain of dependence nor on the part of any of those who that the many may be dependent on them are so well content to be dependent on that one can it be said there is less reason for content when the few are thus dependent on the many with the maximization of beneficial power to reconcile and embrace the minimization of maleficent power lies the great not to say the only difficulty for surmounting it the course here taken is—the keeping throughout the whole field of action in the hands of the many the faculty of dislocating the possessors of operative power—in the hands of those by whom and in so far as maleficently exercised the suffering thus produced will be felt in vain would the efficiency of the course here recommended be questioned or its alleged dangerousness asserted and magnified for a complete demonstration of its efficiency as well as its undangerousness one and the same example has already sufficed this is that of the angloamerican united states in essentials the principals by which the arrangements in the constitution of that confederacy have been determined are the same it may be seen as those here laid down and applied of that constitution the fundamental principle is the omnipotence of the many the omnipotence in so far as established by the constitutive power though not a particle of the operative power can be seen lodged in those same hands by the adoption and application made of this principle while an unexampled quantity of good has been produced and evil in the shape of evil from misrule excluded—not a particle of the alleged mischiefs or dangers has ever been seen to result while the evils which for want of this safeguard have at the same time as well as in all former times been produced in all other governments are and have been multitudinous intense and incontrovertible and are destined to go on increasing till the governments themselves are dissolved not that even in this hitherto matchlessly felicitous system imperfections of detail are wanting witness the still unabrogated sanction given to domestic slavery on account of difference of colour and the misrule submitted to at the hands of the lawyer tribe for want of an allembracing and determinate rule of action not to speak of a quantity of useless and thence mischievous complication by which the transparency of the system still continues to be disturbed but in these imperfections there is nothing that flows from the abovementioned fundamental principle nor yet any evil that may not be seen in still greater abundance in those other states in the constitutions of which this principle has no place neither is there any evil which without any change in the constitution might not receive and beyond doubt is destined sooner or later to receive an easy cure while to the evils resulting from the constitutions of all other states no cure can by possibility be effected by any other means than the abrogation of those constitutions and substituting the sort of constitution of which it is the characteristic to have for its fundamental principle the omnipotence of the many as above at the same time men being the same everywhere not less universally exemplified is the principle of selfpreference in that than in every other form of government but where the government is in the hands of all or what comes to the same thing of those whose collective interests are the same with the interests of all the natural effect of the principle of selfpreference is—not as in the case where it is in the hands of one or of a few the sacrifice of the interest of all to the interest of that one or those few but the sacrifice of all interests that are opposed to the happiness of all in so far as his aim is to sacrifice all interests to his own—the interests of others to that which is peculiar to himself no man finds any effective number of hands disposed to join with his in so far as his aim is to serve such of his interests alone as are theirs as well as his he finds all hands disposed to join with his and these common interests correspond to the immediately subordinate right and proper ends of government maximization of subsistence abundance security and equality in so far as by the principle of selfpreference he is led to promote his own happiness by augmenting theirs at the same time or even without diminishing it so far he finds himself capable of acting without obstruction but no sooner does he attempt to promote his own happiness by means by which theirs is diminished than he finds obstruction thrown in his way by all whose happiness is by this his enterprise already more or less diminished and by all who in case of his success are apprehensive of suffering the like diminution thus then the principle of selfpreference has for its regulator in the breast of each the consciousness of the existence and power of the same principle in the breasts of all the rest and thus it is that the whole mechanism is at all times kept in a state of perfect order and at all times performs to admiration everything that is desired of it everything it was made for as to professions and boasts of purity of motives in the debates and discussions that have place in those united states little or nothing of this sort of talk is heard why because in the first place there is no such demand for it in the next place there would be no use for it for there would be no prospect of its gaining credence no such demand for by no functionary or set of functionaries is any such power there possessed as that of exercising depredation or    oppression in any shape—that of making of the interests of others any such enormous sacrifices to his own particular interest as are made under all other governments—any such power nor consequently any such habit the sinister interest not being proved by his actions there is no such circumstantial evidence calling for direct evidence to furnish a disproof of it no credence would any such profession obtain if uttered in a monarchy while producing its effects in the way of corruption on the selfstyled agents of the people the matter of good abovementioned in their hands and thrown round their persons is producing its effects in the way of delusion upon the people themselves full they are seen to be of money power and factitious dignity proportionably full under favour of the delusion they are believed to be of excellence as of excellence in general so of excellence in the shape of sincerity in particular so that when they say their motives are so pure their regard for the interests of the people so intense their disregard for their own interests so entire the assertion of all these impossibilities impossibilities as they are is not the less followed by belief but in those united states no such source of delusion has place no man whose impudence has soared to any such pitch as to make pretension to any such excellence by inward consciousness each man stands assured of the dominion of the principle of selfpreference in himself by analogy receiving continual support from experience each man stands equally assured of its existence in the breast of every other man no man therefore sees any advantage in coming forward with pretensions which if made would be productive of no other fruit than scorn and ridicule by nothing which is to be found in that example is any contradiction or exception applied to the rule by which the greatest happiness of the rulers themselves is asserted to be the end in view of all rule why for this simple reason—the supreme rulers themselves are those whose interests are not decidedly distinguishable from those interests of which the universal interest is composed whatsoever moral considerations—notions of moral obligation—should induce a man to abstain from acts injurious to individuals or to the community in the aggregate and to oppose himself to acts of the like tendency on the part of the other individuals or of foreigners considered in the character of enemies should urge him to the like conduct as against the correspondent acts of misrule on the part of the government and as against the form and system of government which gives birth to them so much with regard to direction then as to force and energy in the case of the public wrong the resistance ought to be to what it is in the case of the private wrong as are the number of the sufferers in the two cases in other words as the mischief done by the public wrong is to the mischief done by the private wrong chapter x corruption taken in its largest sense the word corruption is employed to denote the deterioration of the subject to which it is applied—the rendering it worse than it was before or would have been otherwise corruptio is in latin breaking up the breaking up of the texture of the subject in question it being understood that by such breaking up it is rendered worse in the first instance the word was used in a physical sense the breaking up the texture of a mass of animal or vegetable matter from thence it comes to be used in a moral sense—the breaking up for the worse the texture of the mental frame when the sense in which the word is used is the physical sense no more than one object is necessarily considered as having place in the operation namely the corruptible mass in which the change has place by another object operating in the character of a ferment the change may be promoted but no such exterior object is necessary to it where the sense in which the word is used is the moral sense the idea of two objects at once is commonly presented by it the part in which the one appears an active part the part in which the other appears a passive part the objects thus presented to view are commonly persons in this case what is presented to view is an operation in which two persons are concerned one the agent in the operation corrupting the other and thereby rendering himself a corruptor the other the patient in the operation being corrupted by the former and by the having been so corrupted becoming and continuing corrupt thus it is that an operation called corruption has been performed and by the same word corruption the result of the operation—the state of things brought about by it—is designated in the operation thus described by the party corrupting corruptive influence has been exercised by the party corrupted say in one word on the plan mentioned and recommended by blackstone the corruptee—corrupt obsequiousness has been practised in the idea thus brought to view is also commonly comprised that of an auxiliary agent considered as being employed as an instrument by the principal one this instrument is a quantity of what may be termed the matter of corruption employed in that same character of an instrument applied in the physical sense and to a physical subject this instrument is what is called a jerment    this matter employed as an instrument to act upon the mind if it operates it is in the character of an inducement that it operates an inducement is constituted either of the matter of evil or of the matter of good operating on the mind in those their respective characters an inducement to which the name of corruptive might without impropriety be attached is an inducement of the intimidative kind say for example the fear of death intimation being given that if the party meant to be corrupted will not do the sinister service desired at his hands he shall be put to death—in the opposite case not an instrument of this sort is not however the sort of instrument the idea of which will by the words matter of corruption instrument of corruption—be in general most apt to be excited not a portion of the matter of evil but a portion of the matter of good is the sort of instrument the idea of which will by any such appellations in general be apt to be excited this matter of good will be some portion of the matter of which the external instruments of felicity are composed namely power and wealth with or without the addition of factitious honour or dignity in regard to corruption the first grand distinction is the distinction between that which is designed and that which is undesigned by undesigned understand that which is capable of having place without design not that which is not ever in any instance the result of design for of that which is capable of having place without design there is not any portion but what is not altogether capable of having place with and by design and is abundantly in the habit of being so produced suppose the creation of it the work of chance nothing is more natural than that the preservation of it shall be the work of design the corruptive influence by which in the case of bribery an elector of a representative of the people in a mixed monarchy is engaged to give his vote in favour of a candidate by whom or by whose agent money is given for it is the work of design on the other part the corrupt obsequiousness is accompanied with a consciousness of the nature of the corrupting inducement to which it is indebted for its existence the corruption in consequence of which the representative perseveres in giving support to the measures of the monarch in that same monarchy for a course of years notwithstanding any depredation and oppression of which those same measures are all the while productive may by possibility be produced on the one part without any such design and on the other part without any such selfcriminating consciousness the monarch in his quality of chief executive functionary must have subordinates in the several situations with large masses of emolument attached to them the representative seeing that these situations must have place and thinking that the masses of emolument attached to them must have place thinks that of these good things the possession and enjoyment may as well be in his hands as in any others the monarch is kind and bountiful in return for kindness and bounty the moral and the religious sanction join in commanding gratitude and thus it is that without design of evil on the one part or consciousness of it on the other corruption may do its work and evil to any intensity extent and duration be produced corruption may also be distinguished into personal or say personally seated and systematic or say systematically seated by the case in which it is personally seated understand the case in which a determinate individual is assignable by whom a portion of the matter of good constituting the temptation has been presented to the view of the individual at whose hands the sinister service was desired and the bait accordingly swallowed and the sinister service rendered in this case stands the transaction between the candidate and the elector as above by the case in which the corruption is not personally but systematically seated understand the case in which no such individual is assignable but the cause of the corrupt transaction—the source of all transactions of the same nature pervading the whole official establishment is in the system or frame of government a system of government in which an irremoveable functionary possesses an indispensable share in the supreme legislative power and at the same time the whole or the greatest part of that branch of the supreme executive power by which the subordinate functionaries are placed and in a proportion more or less considerable displaceable is a system in which corruption is systematically seated on the one part the corruptive influence of the chief functionary on the other part the corrupt obsequiousness on the part of the peoples representatives has its source not in the mental texture of this or that individual but in the political texture of the system or frame of government itself it will therefore of necessity go on in the production of the fruits of corruption namely depredation and oppression in a quantity continually increasing unless and until the form of government receive an apt and adequate change obsequious dependence is produced by fear or hope fear of eventual evil or hope of eventual good dependence by the tie of fear is generally most effective the greatest evil which a dependent is capable of receiving at the hands of a superior being more than equal to the greatest good suppose the degree of probability of the result to be the same the same sum produces more effective dependence by the fear of losing it than by the hope of gaining it punishment by the fear of losing it    produces a dependence more effective than reward by the hope of gaining it under the english form of government all desirable offices without any exception worth taking into account being in the gift of the monarch and to the greater part of the extent the power of dislocation being in relation to those same offices also in his hands—hence on the part of all other members of the community dependence more or less effective has place universally the interest of this one member being opposite to that of all the rest it is his constant desire and correspondent endeavour to cause them to support his interest at the expense of theirs thus under that form of government corruption is all prevalent on the part of those who possess and those who look to possess a share in it and whatever may be the variation in degree as in that so is it in this respect in every other limited monarchy one great misfortune attendant on the use made of corruption and delusion is the extreme facility with which the fabrication of these instruments of misrule is attended force and intimidation are not applied without special and strenuous exertions on the part of possessors of power specially directed to the production of obsequiousness—the desired effect corruption and delusion are produced by them not only without any strenuous exertions but without so much as any expense in the article of thought are produced by them just as well when asleep as when awake to exercise corruptive influence to any amount—to produce corrupt obsequiousness to any amount it is not necessary that either endeavour or so much as desire so to do should have place in the mind of the ruler all that is necessary is the desire and the endeavour which in his situation is of course followed by accomplishment—the endeavour to produce and of course the production of waste in a word all that is necessary to him is on every occasion that presents itself to yield to the appetite for money in his own breast or in the breasts of any individual or individuals connected with him in the way of interest or sympathy for the purpose of their individual gratification the money is put into their pockets thereupon by the eventual expectation of the like benefit from the like source corruptive obsequiousness is produced in the breast and conduct of ten twenty or perhaps fifty times as many breasts as those in which the gratification attached to the receipt and expenditure of the money was produced in itself corruption is no evil for neither is the receipt nor the conferring of a benefit in any shape an evil in so far as it is an evil corruption is so only in respect of the evil effects produced by it abstraction made of these effects it is even a good to prevent here and there an insulated breach of trust effected by means of remuneration is impossible but to prevent the evil effects of corruption from having place to any such amount as to be perceptible on a national scale is possible in a limited monarchy corruption by intimidation at large cannot have place to any considerable extent the intimidation and the consequent suffering would extend to those by whose power the limitation to that of the monarch is applied they would call in the power of the people to their aid and make a change either in the form of government or in the person of the chief governor and his family or both the case in which corruption by intimidation is capable of having place is therefore reduced to that in which corruption by intimidation is connected with corruption by remuneration the state of intimidation in question having for its efficient cause the fear of losing a benefit which has proceeded from the intimidating hand such then will be the effect of the universally applying dislocative power here proposed to be vested in the people in their quality of members of the constitutive authority it will be an effectual preventive of depredation and oppression in every other shape at the hands of rulers it will not indeed operate as a completely effectual preventive of corruption in the shape of corrupt remuneration in particular instances as above but so few will be these instances and the evil effects if any so inconsiderable that in a national point of view they may be regarded without much regret by the most anxious lover of mankind suppose that in the instance of this or that office the choice made of the functionary by the patron as between c a corruptor in whose favour the matter of corruption has been employed and n a noncorruptor in whose favour no matter of corruption has been employed has been determined by the giving of a daughter of cs in marriage to a son of the patrons with a fortune greater than would have been given otherwise c and n being exactly upon a par in respect of appropriate aptitude in this case the corruption has place but by the supposition no ill effects whatever are among the results of it suppose now that though neither of the candidates be to any such degree absolutely unapt as that any determinate ill effects should be seen to result from their want of aptitude in such sort as to be neither of them perceptibly below par in the scale of aptitude—yet one of them there is to whom though above par in the scale of aptitude the one who is not above par has been preferred this is the sort and degree of corruption against which neither the universally applying dislocation in the hands of the constitutive nor this in addition to all remedies whatsoever which the nature of the case admits the application of can ever operate as a completely adequate preventive but so long as the effects of corruption rise not above this height neither    the framer of the constitutional code nor any spectator of it need feel much dissatisfaction at the contemplation of the work corruption may be understood in a more extensive sense namely by being considered as designating the matter of good or evil operating on the mind of an individual in such sort as to cause him in contemplation of a less good to forego a greater or by the contemplation of a less evil to subject himself to a greater or by the contemplation of a less evil to forego a greater good thus when esau as in the history sold his birthright for a mess of pottage thus sacrificing to a lesser present a greater future interest his will may on this occasion be considered as having been governed by corruptive influence and the portion of the matter of corruption by which the effect was produced was in this case the mess of pottage in a word whosoever the party is to whose happiness reference is made by the word good every case in which the lesser good is embraced in preference to the greater or even the greater evil in preference to the less may be considered as a case in which corruption or say corruptive influence has had place and has in such sort operated as to have given birth to the sinister effect an elector who by his vote should contribute to the establishment of a constitution having for its effect instead of the greatest happiness of the greatest number the greatest or supposed greatest happiness of the ruling few at the expense of the happiness of the many would supposing himself to become in consequence of the misrule a sufferer to a greater amount than that of the benefit received by his vote be an esau selling his birthright for a mess of pottage look to a man whose situation places him under the temptation above described—see him putting into his pocket the reward thus proffered by it—conceive him standing up and saying—never from either the prospect or the receipt of this reward has my conduct ever experienced any the slightest influence—a declaration to any such effect can it in the instance of any man which ever breathed have presented any so much as the slightest claim to credence yes if—when for the obtainment of legal evidence of a capital crime pardon together with a thousand pounds reward has been offered to any partaker in the crime who with the effect of producing the conviction of a fellow criminal will repair to the judicatory and give his narrative of the case if in the course of his narrative he should take upon him to say—neither by the assurance of receiving the thousand pounds nor by the assurance of saving my forfeited life am i influenced by the statement i am now giving—if with a protestation to this effect in his mouth the malefactor could present any claim to credence if to assurances to this effect protestations were added—if to protestations eyes lifted up to heaven—if to eyes lifted up to heaven summonses to god to come down and bear witness—if to summonses to god to bear witness tears—if to tears faintings were added to the claim made by the simple declarations would any additional claim either in the case of the chancellor in office or out of office or in the case of the minor malefactor be made to credence yes if by his display in the character of iago mr kean calls him from the grave calls the dead to life and transforms himself into that personage by the common name of corruptionists corruptors and corruptees may both of them be designated by the use of this common appellative the difficulty and obscurity attached to the operation of ascertaining which of the two parts was on this or that occasion acted by the individual or individuals in question may be avoided everywhere the whole official establishment is a corruptive establishment to possess the sinister benefits of corruption is the universal wish but without their own pale the members of the official establishment have in their quality of corruptors or wouldbe corruptors their accomplices and in the natural course of things their confederates these are the several classes of which the aristocracy of the country is composed they have all of them that which is sufficient to make them so the particular and sinister interest and the situation in life which gives them such of them as are not rulers the faculty of serving by confederacy with such as are rulers that same sinister interest of the expense of government every part which has for its effect or its object the affording to the few gratification in which the many cannot participate is so much of the corruptive fund employed in gaining over the aristocratical classes and obtaining their support and assistance in the depredation and oppression exercised on the many to the other ingredients of the corruptionfund may be added everything that goes by the name of grace and favour admission to places to which others would not be admitted admission to more convenient or more honourable situations in places in which persons in general are admitted opportunities of purchasing this or that object of desire with more certainty or upon terms more advantageous than those on which persons at large can obtain them corruption has place where by means of some benefit to himself a functionary is made to violate his trust on this occasion the following points must be considered namely—   the sinister effect produced viz mischief in some shape or other to the public service   the nature of the benefit or say the sinister benefit received      the person corrupted—say the corruptee   the hand by which the sinister benefit is received namely the corruptees own or some other   the person benefited by the sinister effect—say the corruptor   the immediately corrupting hand by which the sinister benefit is applied   the relative time at which the sinister benefit is received relation had to the time at which the sinister effect is produced namely consequent or antecedent   the motive by the operation of which on the mind of the individual corrupted the corruption and thence the sinister effect is produced   as to the sinister effect of the corruption this considered in its general complexion is violation of the trust in question of the trust correspondent to the power with which in virtue of his office the functionary on whom the corruption operates is invested or if the functions be no other than such by the exercise of which no power is exercised—the duties attached to the situation of the corruptee the object here proposed being the keeping as far as possible excluded corruption wherever it is liable to have entrance or at any rate the keeping excluded as far as possible whatever evil effects it is pregnant with the effect must to this purpose be presumed to be in every case evil in what particular shape will depend upon the particular nature of the function attached to the office whatsoever it be and the correspondent trusts or duties of which the violation is produced   as to the nature of the benefit this may be good in any of its shapes the matter of corruption is accordingly the matter of good in any of its shapes considered as employed to this sinister purpose for examples of the shapes in which the matter of good is at the disposition of governments or individuals take the several external instruments of felicity in all their shapes including money power factitious dignity ease at the expense of official duty vengeance at the expense of justice in the idea of good in all its shapes is included the idea of evil in all its shapes how so because whatever be the shape in which it is possible for evil to show itself the exclusion or removal of it is a correspondent good and in the same way under the idea of evil in all its shapes is included the idea of good in all its shapes good may accordingly be divided and distinguished into positive and negative positive good is good not consisting in the absence or removal of evil negative good is good consisting in the exclusion or removal of evil punishment may therefore in this way be made and accordingly is made an instrument of corruption give a man to understand that if he will not render the sinister service he will be punished but that if he does render it he shall remain unpunished the nonapplication of the punishment has the effect of reward where the instrument is in both cases the same as in the case of money and the magnitude of it equal the actuating force of punishment is much greater than that of reward aggregate value of a mans property say £ 00 give him £ 0 you do not produce near so much enjoyment as you do suffering by taking from him that same sum the ratio of £ 00 to £ 0 is twice as great as the ratio of £  0 to £ 00 give him £ 00 still further are you from producing on his part as much enjoyment as you would suffering by taking from him that same sum you in this case take from him his all scarcely by giving him £ 000 would you produce so much enjoyment as you would suffering by so stripping him man is susceptible of pain in greater quantities than pleasure considered as forming part and parcel of the matter of corruption a benefit requires to be distinguished into that which is irrevocable and that which is revocable in the case where it is irrevocable the effective or say corruptive force with which it operates is that only which belongs to it in the quality of matter of reward in the case in which it is revocable the corruptive force with which it operates is that which belongs to it in the character of matter of punishment by giving to a man an eventually permanent benefit of which you reserve to yourself the power of depriving him at pleasure you invest yourself with a power of inflicting punishment—you place him in a state of dependence and subjection to that same power as to the creation of such a power it is an evil altogether inevitable for without power of dislocation on the one part and dislocability on the other no tolerably efficient security for appropriate aptitude on the part of subordinates can be established but for excluding the abuse of it no securities which the nature of the case admits of can be superfluous to this head belongs the case of pardons and the exercise of mercy which has been considered elsewhere   the corruptee namely a public functionary of any grade in any department at whose hands the sinister service is thus obtained whether his function has power in any shape attached to it or not   the immediately receiving hand—the hand by which without the intervention of any other the sinister and corruptive benefit is received this may be that of the corruptee or any other of any other person whatsoever if connected with the corruptee by any tie of selfregarding interest or though it be but sympathetic interest for example a son of the corruptee or any other person who is in such sort in the dependence of the corruptee    that but for the sinister benefit thus received the corruptee would at his own expense have had to make provision to the same or any part of the amount or even an ever soperfectlyindependent friend for so long as sympathy has place between man and man the sinister effect of corruption may be produced as fully by a benefit conferred on a person other than the corruptee as by a benefit conferred on the corruptee himself this or that man who would not be won by a benefit offered to him for himself might be won by a benefit especially if conferred in a manner called handsome on a friend   corruptor or corruptors parties by whom the benefit from the sinister effect is reaped on each occasion these may be distinguished into special corruptor or corruptors and corruptor or corruptorsgeneral special corruptors are those by whom the benefit on the occasion of this or that individual transaction is reaped corruptorsgeneral are those by whom the benefit from the whole system of corruption taken in the aggregate is reaped in every political state the whole body of public functionaries constituting the supreme operative require to be considered in the character of corruptors and corruptees at the best they are at all times exposed to the temptation of being so and in a greater or less degree are sure to be made to yield to that temptation in a republic the sinister effect of that temptation is capable of being confined within bounds—within such bounds as will exclude all practical evil under that form of government the constitutive authority is placed over the supreme operative with dislocative power with relation to it as well as locative between the corruptors and the corruptees the distinction is not very easy to trace out and delineate in an absolute monarchy the corruptor and corruptee may be said to be one for the monarch or corruptorgeneral has in one hand the whole mass of the instruments of felicity and in the other he lodges them all for his own use sacrificing to his own expectation of happiness the happiness of the people at large but as by his own hand alone no such sinister sacrifice could be made hence the necessity he is under of applying more or less of the matter of good in his hands to the making of corruptees in the case of a mixed monarchy the distinction shows itself most clearly   the immediately corrupting hand—the hand by which without the intervention of any other the sinister benefit is applied to the receiving hand this may be the hand of him by whom on the particular occasion in question the sinister benefit is received or any other with relation to the sinister effect whether it be the one or the other will of course make no difference   the relative time at which the sinister benefit is received namely before or after the production of the sinister effect—the rendering of the sinister service on the part of the corruptee relation had to this point the receipt of the matter of corruption may be said to be antecedential or consequential according as it belongs to the one or to the other of these two descriptions the inducement or say the motive by which on the part of the corruptee the sinister service the sinister effect is produced is it will be seen of a very different description   the inducement or say the motive or motives by which on the mind of the corruptee the sinister service and with it the sinister effect is produced this will be altogether different according as the receipt of the sinister benefit in respect of relative time is antecedential or consequential as above of the two cases the simplest is that where the receipt is consequential in this case the determining motive is expectation or hope of the benefit in question where the receipt is precedential the determining motive will generally be gratitude and sometimes the fear of the reproach of ingratitude or of perfidy if the views of the legislator do not comprehend corruption in all its possible shapes as well or better might he leave it untouched altogether for whatsoever be the shapes to which the arrangements made by him do so extend to those will it betake itself and operate with effect the two shapes or forms—the consequential and the antecedential are apt to have place and operate together in the same case indeed it is not often that they are found separate in so far as they are separate of that in which the remuneration is regarded as consequent to the corrupt service rendered the efficiency is obviously much more assured and discernible in this surest case it is altogether by expectation that it is produced from this one circumstance flow several important results to produce every bad effect of corruption there needs not any special act of corruption there sits a person who has good things in abundance at his disposal and who has an interest in disposing of them in a certain way namely in favour of such persons as by their agency contribute to the accomplishment of a certain end an individual observes what passes and acts accordingly by his agency he contributes to that end why because in consequence and consideration of the doing so he expects to receive some good thing or other in the character of a reward whether at the hands of the person in question he actually receives any such good thing makes not to this purpose any difference in a certain state of things to produce the effect of corruption no corruptor other than the corrupted person himself is necessary in virtue of a preestablished state or order of things a sinister effect to the community at  0 large and a beneficial one to himself follows from an act the performance of which lies within his own competence thus in the case of the war commenced by the monarch without any previous declaration he by a preestablished arrangement and by means of his legal instruments received the net amount of the depredation this is the simplest case where the expectation or hope of the benefit in question is the determining motive or say inducement the moving pleasure is the pleasure produced by the contemplation of the pleasures which the possession will it is expected afford accompanied as the contemplation is with the belief more or less intense of their future existence suppose a functionary who has an office at his disposal he locates in it an indisputably unapt individual from whom however a bribe is expected and afterwards in consideration of and recompense for the benefit thus conferred the functionary receives a sum of money which is in this case called a bribe or suppose a legislator meaning a person having a share in the legislative power in the expectation of receiving for himself or friend a lucrative office at the hands of a minister who for the purpose of adding to the number of good things at his disposal is bringing about an unjust war gives his vote in favour of the war and receives the office accordingly or suppose an elector in the expectation of receiving a certain sum of money at the hands of a candidate for a seat in the legislature delivers his vote for that same candidate and thereupon afterwards receives the money in all these cases the cause by which the sinister effect is produced is the pleasure of expectation by the contemplation of the good eventually expected—the desire of that same good—the good itself not being yet in possession—in a word by hope in the case where the receipt is precedential the motive or inducement must be of quite a different stamp with relation to the individual benefit in question hope it cannot be for by possession expectation has been crowned and terminated suppose the sinister service rendered the act must have had for its cause one of the following namely—   gratitude meaning the sentiment of gratude sympathy for the corruptor—the benefactor—sympathy produced by the contemplation of the enjoyment received from his benevolent effective and beneficent hands   fear of the reproach of ingratitude namely in the event of the nonrendering the sinister service for the obtainment of which the sinister benefit has been conferred on the one part received on the other if in so far as in a case of this sort that which is called ingratitude is the subject of reproach it is because this is one of the points on which the force of the publicopinion tribunal has been made to operate in a direction unfavourable to the greatest happiness of the greatest number namely by a judgment which has for its cause sinister interest on the part of the aristocratical section of that tribunal and relative ignorance on the part of the more numerous or democratical section gratitude at large is a sentiment which in every other breast not to speak of his own every individual in proportion as he understands his interest sees it to be his interest to cherish in gratitude for past kindnesses he will see the source of future ones but for a misdeed to the prejudice of the whole community service rendered to an individual is no justification   fear of the reproach of perfidy in so far as the acting in the way in question towards the production of the sinister effect is regarded as matter of moral obligation in requital for the sinister benefit the whole transaction on both sides being considered as forming the subjectmatter of a contract superadded to the reproach of ingratitude will on this same occasion be the reproach of perfidy men ought to requite services is a general rule men ought still more punctually to requite services when engaged for by contract is another general rule unbounded in its extent is the benefit derived from the observance of both these general rules either of them would suffice for the destruction of society were it not narrowed by certain exceptions but the good from the observance of the general rule meets the eye much oftener than does the evil from the nonobservance of the exceptions in whatsoever shape or degree an act is mischievous an engagement to bear a part in the commission of it does not do away the mischievousness of it great and nearly irresistible has been and is but just ceasing to be the influence of the members of the aristrocatical section of the publicopinion tribunal over the minds of the members of the democratical section not only the influence derived from power—the influence of will on will but the influence derived from knowledge the influence of understanding on understanding on every part of the field of action have the subject many found themselves under the necessity of deriving their conceptions and their judgments from the reports made to them by the ruling and influential few and with no exception capable as yet† of operating with any considerable influence have these reports contained anything but what was false and in effect if not in intention delusive causing    the people to regard as conducive to their interests those practices which were most adverse to those same interests practices having for their effect the establishment of misrule and of corruption as an efficient cause of it as in the case of mutually beneficial and innoxious engagements mischief and vice consists in the breach of them so in the case of those so extensively noxious engagements does mischief and vice consist in their observance of the nonobservance of a class of engagements the ultimate effect is—that the practice of entering into such engagements is at an end this is exactly the result conducive to human happiness—the result desirable in the case of all preponderantly noxious engagements if for example notwithstanding all engagements no favours were by any possessor of patronage ever obtained at the hands of any member of the legislative body nor therefore at the hands of a majority of that body no part of his patronage would ever be made to take that direction it would be applied the whole of it to his own particular purposes good or bad whichever they happened to be but at any rate it would not be applied to that worst of bad purposes causing the legislative to add depredation to depredation and oppression to oppression by giving constantly increasing patronage and undisturbed impunity to the executive of all the members of the community taken in the aggregate it is therefore no less decidedly their interest that in regard to all such noxious engagements unfaithfulness should be entire than it is that in regard to all preponderantly beneficial ones observance and faithfulness should be entire from sense of interest come all notions of honour there are says a common observation notions of honour among thieves how should it be otherwise gangs of robbers could not have existence unless engagements between member and member for the purpose of the common pursuit had existence but if by fidelity to honest engagements between man and man entered into for an innoxious purpose the happiness of mankind is promoted—so by fidelity to engagements between thief and thief entered into for the purpose of thieving the happiness of mankind is diminished of the matter of corruption the elements may be distinguished into the immediately applying and the unimmediately applying by those which are immediately applying understand those which are themselves among the objects of general desire or to which some of those same objects are attached those the application of which is unimmediate are those in which the immediate objects have their source of those which are unimmediate the most fruitful by far are wars and distant dependencies wars and distant dependencies beget offices offices corrupt obsequiousness corrupt obsequiousness on the part of all who seek them as towards all who give them wars are alike employable in all monarchies distant dependencies are peculiar to those which are in possession of a quantity more or less considerable of naval force where as in the latter case situation is favourable these sources of corruptive influence are necessarily productive of each other never can war take place but the quantity of the matter of corruption must increase successful or unsuccessful this is among the number of the effects of it be it ever so unsuccessful it makes addition to the number of offices of military offices obviously and in the train of military offices come civil ones in so far as credit has place it adds to the quantity of public debt and of the taxes imposed for the payment of the interest of it public debt requires offices for the payment of it taxes require offices for the extraction of them in a monarchy possessing distant dependencies if a war in which it is engaged proves successful an addition to the extent or number of those dependencies is a natural and frequent consequence of the success to every other such government each such dependency is an object of envy and among all together a bone of contention hence it is that as war begets distant dependencies so do distant dependencies beget wars in both these instances diametrically opposite to the universal interest is that particular interest by which in every monarchy the rulers are so uniformly governed no war has there ever been by which the citizen subjects have not been losers no war has there ever been by which their rulers have not been gainers no distant dependency by the possession of which the people at whose expense it has been acquired are not losers no such possession by which the rulers by whom whether acquired or no it is retained are not gainers in the literature of most states may be seen a sort of periodical work in which is represented the state of the official establishment the offices that have place in the state being designated by their respective titles with or without a designation complete or incomplete of the masses of emolument and other objects of desire respectively attached to them and the individuals by whom at the time of the publication in question these offices are respectively possessed in these books may be seen the matter the maximization of which has in every government but one been hitherto the primary not to say the sole end of government in the breasts of the respective rulers for bringing to view the influence of the matter of corruption upon public functionaries the shortest course that can be pursued is to commence with that mass which in a mixed and limited monarchy is in the hands of the monarch from thence a conception of the extent and operation of it in inferior hands may be formed without difficulty    in its composition it includes all those external instruments of felicity which constitute the necessary instruments of government together with those which not being needed nor capable of having place but under a bad government are exclusively the produce of a bad government in addition to power and money it accordingly includes factitious honour and dignity vengeance and official ease these objects not only does the monarch possess and employ for his own gratification but he possesses the faculty of making communication of them to all those who occupy in relation to him the situation either of instruments or favourites prodigious is the quantity of public money a man may receive—receive and in a certain sense convert to his own use if he can but content himself with receiving it by any hand other than his own prodigious in proportion the power he may thus exercise prodigious the degree of servility and baseness he may thus surround himself with prodigious the contribution he may be able to make to the treasury of public mischief and misrule no part of the money thus received being seen to go nor perhaps actually going into his own purse the consequence is—that to any amount the praise of disinterestedness may be attached to the career of rapacity thus run the praise of independence to a course the most abject and dependent the influence exercised over those who are actually partakers in the good things conferred by it is inconsiderable in comparison with that exercised over those who never receive any share in it in the train of one single possessor there is no saying how many expectants are attached numerous in many cases are the links one beneath another in what may be termed the chain of patronage or dependence by the monarch an office is conferred to which is attached the power of placing with reference to suppose twenty offices to each of which such offices is attached the power of placing with relation to twenty more offices and so on and to the possessor of every office in each such rank is attached a swarm of expectants as above of these good things so great is the variety that there is something capable of suiting every taste and among them are those with which a man may suit himself and at the same time be receiving the praise of disinterestedness those whom no lucrative places may gain over a ribbon may subdue if with relation to the individuals on whom it operates the power in question were confined to the placing of them in the several desirable situations vast would be the influence exercised by it but in relation to no small portion of the aggregate probably the largest proportion is annexed the power of displacing but in comparison with the power of displacing the power of placing is comparatively trifling in the mere power of placing no power of punishment is included in the power of displacing with reference to a situation of the kind in question is included a power of punishment far superior in its effect to any power commonly exercised under that name excessive would be deemed and on that account interdicted by the bill of rights a pecuniary punishment by which a man in england should be deprived of a situation equal in value to the least valuable situation in any of the government boards not till after trial nor without conviction can any punishment which is called punishment be inflicted no conviction no trial is requisite in the other case without opportunity of defence without exposure to the eye of the publicopinion tribunal without a moments warning it may be inflicted at any time it enjoys to a prodigious degree an exemption from the controlling power of the publicopinion tribunal that power to the operation of which the exercise of coercive power is in a much greater degree subjected for the production of any corruption aimed at no act on the part of the corruptergeneral is necessary therefore no act is there to which disapprobation can attach itself this unofficial judicatory is scarcely less subject to his corruptive influence than are the official judicatories nothing can he ever do or abstain from doing—no course on any occasion can his actions take but laudation and admiration follow it and attach upon it laud is bestowed upon him for everything he parts with and for everything he keeps in his own hands especially if and in so far as others are let in to a participation of the benefit of it not an article can he consume or use for his own personal gratification but from various quarters praise follows him for what is done in the first place come all those who derive a profit from the supplying him with it or hope to do so with similar articles to act thus is called conferring a benefit on trade and in the pleasure of conferring this public benefit he is said to find his only motive by every such act he moreover adds to the splendour and lustre of the crown and the throne and by all to whom the constitution is an object of attachment the necessity of this splendour and this lustre is a fundamental and unquestionable article if and as often as money or moneys worth to any amount is parted with by him without any immediate receipt or expectation of an equivalent in any determinate shape or at any determinate time the field of praise receives another great enlargement then in full chorus may be heard joining all those to whom munificence generosity and liberality are objects of sympathy and admiration not a particle of money can he thus give which has not been extorted from unwilling contributors not a particle can he give which will not be reimbursed to him in the same manner    in his situation not a particle can he ever give which is not given at the expense of others but his case is confounded with that of those benefactors who have no means of giving but at their own expense of a halfstarved beggar who should share a penny just received from the hand of casual charity with another in the same condition the so dearly exercised beneficence would remain unknown and unapplauded and even though it were universally known faint is the applause that would be vouchsafed to selfdenying liberality when exercised on so minute a scale to help to gain a million sterling for paying debts already contracted and make way for contracting more suppose a monarch promising to the public a collection of books purchased at the public expense of no use to the purchaser and of no determinate and assignable use to anybody else—the praises of royal munificence will be sounded in the assembly of the legislature and echoed wherever the fame of the virtue reaches as to the prevention or even diminution of corruption nothing in a government so constituted can be more plainly or everlastingly impossible of all arrangements employed for the professed purpose of excluding it or diminishing it by means of punishment the effect if any is to give increase to it or to increase the mischievousness of it the only case to which punishment can attach to it is that where a direct bargain is made but in the case of any such bargain the quantity of mischief will have its express limits put out of the case the bargain the quantity will be unlimited the greater the service i render to the giver of good gifts the greater is the value of the good gifts which i may reasonably expect to receive such is the reasoning which in a breast so situated can never fail to be made at the same time by the profession and apparent endeavours thus made to put an end to a practice to the increase of which or at least the maintenance all real endeavours are directed the effect if any is to give strength to the delusion employed to secure submission to the misrule by no man can support have been given to any such pretended or supposed remedy without proof made of inaptitude opposite to one or other branch of appropriate aptitude in case of insincerity of the branch opposite to moral aptitude in case of sincerity of the branch opposite to intellectual aptitude in a pure monarchy it has been already stated the operation of corruption has little place in comparison with what it has in a mixed and limited monarchy there is no subjectmatter for it to work upon in a mixed and limited monarchy this subjectmatter is essentially present this subjectmatter is the body which represents or is dealt with as if it represented the people and which as such is let in for a share in the exercise of the sovereign power of legislation without the concurrence of this body the sinister desires of the monarch cannot receive their gratification with that concurrence they may do so to an unlimited extent but in an unmixed and unlimited monarchy they may and do receive their gratification to an unlimited extent without the concurrence of any such body for no such body has place in it not that even in the most unlimited monarchy corruption is without its influence nor therefore altogether without its use it contributes to the mass of that sinister influence but for which many whom it has the effect of preventing might otherwise embrace the cause of the universal interest in england in virtue of the preestablished harmony so long as the constitution stands corruption with its etceteras is predestinated to go on in a state of perpetual advance never to be stationary much less retrograde in this or that department an enormous abuse is brought to light a member in opposition moves for papers to serve as documents with a view to the moving for a committee to inquire and report on this occasion till of late years the practice was to resist the inquiry in limine—to refuse the papers this practice continues at present but upon the whole such a facility in the granting them has place as forms a striking contrast with the ultimate result the case is and so it has been found that on this ground in relation to their own sinister interest the government cannot do wrong if the papers are refused all subsequent trouble is saved though they gain nothing yet nothing do they lose for as to reputation of probity for this long time none have they had to lose if the papers are granted then instead of loss comes positive gain of abuse of the mass of abuse a portion more or less considerable is brought to light placed in so strong a glare as to be wholly uncontrovertible now comes the season of candour the seat of the abuse being in the misconduct of the subordinates of government it belongs to government to rectify what is amiss in the conduct of those its subordinates a commission is now wanted a commission ie a set of commissioners all of them of course named in one or other of two ways by government but this being a public service—a service of considerable labour—a labour too the quantity of which will naturally be apt to increase with the quantity of abuse remuneration becomes necessary it being without example that in some shape or other it should not be given it is given as of course no argument being regarded as necessary to be produced in support of it the only argument if any regards the quantum and the shape as to the modes of nominating these commissioners    there are two by the crown or by parliament by the crown is by the ministry in their closet by the parliament is by the ministry in the house of commons the result being equally at command in both instances a question that naturally occurs is wherein can consist the difference what is it that should render it an object to either party that either course should be chosen in preference to the other to give the answer another distinction must be brought to view in the number of these commissioners it is thought or not thought advisable by government to place a member of parliament a member of parliament i e one who is already of the number of their own adherents or one who by this means is to be made so if there be no member of parliament all they get by the business is the confirmation of the abuse the impunity of those concerned in it and the increase given to the quantity of the matter of corruption employed as such if a member of parliament who was not before of the number of their adherents is put into the commission in that case they get the additional advantage of this addition to their list in every political state in which there exists a legislative body with an executive authority in other hands there are two parties in the representative body one composed of persons by whom the sweets of office are either possessed or expected to be received call these the ins another composed of those by whom no expectation of favour in that shape is entertained and whose whole course is accordingly directed in the endeavour to gain possession of the aggregate mass of those sweets of office and to that end to the putting out of possession the actual possessors these are the outs the outs are not less in an unquestionable state of dependence than the ins nor in their case is the dependence less corruptive than in the other in the state of the dependence there is indeed some difference in the two cases in the case of the ins the individuals on whom the dependence is are more determinate in the case of the outs less determinate still however neither in the nature of the dependence nor except in regard to the degree of corruptive efficiency in its effects is there in the two cases any difference in both situations the temptation to yield to and be determined by the sinister influence applies to every individual member nor in the instance of any one such individual on any occasion can the probability of his resisting it and not being determined by it be asserted at the same time it is on both sides on all public occasions a universal practice of every individual not only to deny the actual prevalence of the corruptive influence in question on each particular occasion but the possibility of its prevalence on any occasion in his instance in denying the existence of this prevalence the sort of phrase commonly employed is that by which purity of motives is professed true it is that on this or that occasion thus much it may be competent to a man always on the supposition that by the nature of the motives by which his conduct is determined the merits of the question are in some determinate way affected to make known and thence to assert namely—that on the occasion in question he does not stand exposed to sinister interest in any shape or if there be any shape in which he is exposed to sinister interest that sinister interest has for its counterpoise a right and proper interest by which it is overpowered when the phrase corruptive influence is employed it is by the laws and institutions themselves that the corruptive influence must be said to have been applied applied to the individual in such manner as to have given birth to the sinister effect dear in this case it may be imagined how dear both to corrupters and corrupted are these same laws and institutions in this case it is not common for complaints of corruption to have place to any considerable extent in general scarcely is it seen or so much as suspected that in consequence of this state of things any considerable mischief has place every man as early as he has been taught anything having been taught to regard as objects of the most prostrate veneration and the most boundless confidence those same sources and receptacles of corruption—those same instruments of depredation and oppression at the same time this is the case in which mischief has place in a quantity greater by far than in the opposite case it has place to a greater extent and throughout the whole of its extent it is effectually out of the reach of all cure or even of restraint for no one individual is perceptible on whom it is possible without the appearance of injustice to fix in any shape the imputation of blame but if neither open accusation nor so much as secret imputation can have place still less can remedy in any shape have place so far therefore as the corruption has place in this shape the system of misrule by means of corruption may be said to have been raised to the very pinnacle of perfection the greater the extent to which corruption in this shape has place the more conclusively probative is the circumstantial evidence by which it is proved that on the part of the persons exercising in chief the powers of government and by whom in the whole or in part the profit from the mass of corruption thus constituted has been reaped the corruption that has place is the fruit of design that they know what they are about and are fully conscious of the evil that has place and that they by being supporters are for the time being authors of it in this case the corruption may be said to    be singleseated or borrowing an expression from botany monœcious the persons thus corrupted namely the persons reaping the sinister and dishonest profit may be said to be selfcorruptors selfcorrupted and a species of misdeed styled selfcorruption may be said to have place and to be habitually committed where the corruption is doubleseated or say diœcious the nature of it is more easily conceived in this case the corruption is reciprocal by the corruptor and the corruptee a sinister benefit is either reaped or expected to be reaped selfcorruption always has place in the case where the two powers legislative in chief and executive in chief have place in one and the same hand this is as truly a case of corruption as that where it is doubleseated by the hand of power a benefit is reaped and it is at the expense and by the sacrifice of the universal interest that it is reaped with how much more facility the sinister private benefit is in this case reaped than in the other case and the sinister public effect produced is sufficiently manifest in the present case there is no room for selfcorruption in the highest grades by the supposition the legislative power is in one set of hands the power of patronage in another in any one of these two departments selfcorruption may have place in the executive a superordinate to save himself from providing at his own expense for a son of his places him though unapt in a situation under him this is as truly an instance of corruption as if to a stranger he had sold the place for what it would bring and put the money into his own pocket the prime minister for example appoints a coward or drunken son to the command of an army being engaged in the carrying on a manufacture or having a son or other near relative of his who is so engaged an influential member induces the legislature to pass a probative or restrictive law having for its object the preventing the rest of the community from being supplied with the sort of article in question in better quality or on cheaper terms behold here an instance of selfcorruption in the legislature in the judiciary department the whole mass of that spurious sort of law which goes by the name of unwritten or common law is the product of selfcorruption the judicial power entrusted to the judges is employed in lodging legislative power in their own hands to the field of this power scarce are there any assignable limits scarcely is it distinguishable from that of the legislative by means of it the parliament of paris in the middle of the seventeenth century contended with the regent for the sovereignty if power were all and power had no tendency to beget money here would be matter of corruption abundantly sufficient to produce the sinister effect but wherever there is power money cannot fail to follow it under the name of fees judges impose taxes on the suitors denying protection and security against injury to all those who are not able to pay those taxes—that is to say the vast majority of the inhabitants of the state formerly the head judicatory in france the parliament of paris set such a price upon their definitive judgments that for want of customers they found themselves under the necessity of giving it up in particular instances by selling a something at much less than an equivalent as they could make it on cheaper terms in scotland the court of session taking french judicature for their example have followed in this particular the same course by this in england have been produced the enormous emoluments of the higher judges and thence the denial of what is called justice both in england and ireland by the supreme and acknowledged legislature acting and acknowledged in that character this usurpation is connived at thus much as to the incurable nature of corruption now as to the extent given to its influence observe the several classes which by the nature of their situations are subjected to the operation of it   the several members of the legislature and in the instance of every one of them every individual who has or supposes himself to have any connexion with him by any adequate tie of selfregarding or though it be but sympathetic interest   the several connexions in like manner of the administrative chief himself   the several ministers heads of the several departments of the administration with their several clusters of connexions as above   all individuals who look either to the prime minister or to any of the subministers or to any of their subordinates having locative power with reference to official situations under them—these and their several connexions let it not be said—this then is an objection against a representative democracy for suppose any other form of government the case is beyond comparison worse although the complete exclusion of corruption is too much to hope for what is not too much to hope for is the bringing it about to a degree less than it exists at present even in the united states and though it were never to be reduced to an inferior degree if it could but be brought down to that degree in every political state a reduction to that extent might be contemplated with exultation by a lover of mankind for reducing its evil effects to a minimum several arrangements present themselves one consists in reducing to its minimum the quantity of the matter of good capable of operating in the character of matter of corruption another in providing a terminative remedy by    giving as above to the constitutive the power of removing from the establishment unapt members in any number as soon as may be after their inaptitude has become in the judgment of that authority sufficiently manifest a third expedient consists in the bringing to bear in undiminished force the power of the publicopinion tribunal upon the conduct of the individual by whom in each instance the location is performed vesting the power of location in the hands of a single functionary and no more than one much less in any such large number as shall constitute what in england is called a board this last arrangement if adopted would put an exclusion upon the administrative that is to say upon the locative branch of he power of the senate in the constitution of the united states thus in act every form of government except where the only possible antiseptic system is applied and in tendency even where it is applied the whole official establishment is a corruptive establishment to establish the constitution is to establish a system of corruption by law well and with strict truth may it be said to be by law for by constitutional law it is planted and by penal law it is supported and maintained and by law in neither ever has been nor is nor ever can be excluded chapter xi delusion the process of delusion may be considered either with reference to the class of persons operated on by it or with reference to the instruments by which or by means of which the operation is performed and the effect produced the class of persons on whom the most important corruptive influence operates are the representatives of the people the class of persons on whom the most important effects of delusive influence are performed are the people themselves not that in the case of corruptive influence the effects do not spread far and wide among the people not that in the case of delusive influence its effects are not to an extent more or less considerable produced on the representatives themselves essentially and mutually concomitant during the whole of that progress these two supporters of misrule go hand in hand and increase the force and efficiency of each other but of corruption the principal and direct use is to engage the representatives of the people to betray their trust and sell themselves and the people to the universal corrupter—the monarch in his capacity of corruptergeneral of delusion the principal and direct use is to engage the people to acquiesce in the breach of trust and submit to be sold oppressed and plundered the instruments by which delusion may be produced in company with corruption are principally of that sort which operate by some special association which they have with the condition of the great pampered ruler of this sort are the trappings of monarchy fruits or indications of the matchless opulence so constantly attached to supreme power when placed in a single hand the gorgeous palaces the glittering throne and still more glittering crown only as examples can these elements serve for the multitude and variety of them is inexhaustible the objects of delusion are to cause men to take an improper end for the proper end of government and to entertain erroneous conceptions respecting the dispositions of the persons exercising the powers of government for this purpose discourse is employed of the laudatory kind applied indiscriminately to all persons participating in the exercise of the powers of government the praise rising according as the place assigned to the person in question rises in the scale of excellence that is according to the money power and factitious honour attached to it thus the character always attributed to the monarch of england is—most excellent most gracious most religious and most sacred to this head belong those discourses by which credence is endeavoured to be gained for those false conceptions which have been brought to view namely that by which the happiness of this almost superhuman person is stated as an apt object of regard and solicitude to the exclusion or preference of the happiness of all besides that by which the happiness of all besides is represented as being to the exclusion of his own or in preference to his own the object of his regard amongst the instruments of delusion employed for reconciling the people to the dominion of the one and the few is the device of employing for the designation of persons and classes of persons instead of the ordinary and appropriate denominations the names of so many abstract fictitious entities contrived for the purpose take the following examples instead of kings or the king—the crown and the throne instead of churchman—the church and sometimes the altar instead of lawyers—the law instead of judges or a judge—the court instead of rich men or the rich—property of this device the object and effect is that any unpleasant idea that in the mind of the hearer or reader might happen to stand associated with the idea of the person or the class is disengaged from it and in the stead of the more or less obnoxious individual or individuals the object presented is a creature of the fancy by the idea of which as in poetry the imagination is tickled—a phantom which by means of the power with which the individual    or class is clothed is constituted an object of respect and veneration in the first four cases just mentioned the nature of the device is comparatively obvious in the last case it seems scarcely to have been observed but perceived or not perceived such by the speakers in question has been the motive and efficient cause of the prodigious importance attached by so many to the term property as if the value of it were intrinsic and nothing else had any value as if man were made for property not property for man many indeed have gravely asserted that the maintenance of property was the only end of government one of the causes of the delusion which attributes to the higher orders preeminence in relative moral aptitude i e in effective benevolence is the association by which men are led to regard a mans benevolence as being in proportion to his beneficence were this or any thing like it the true ratio or in any degree approaching to the truth the richest would have against the poorest a complete monopoly in the merit constituted by the possession of this quality the poorest would be altogether without a share england contains several individuals whose incomes respectively have been between £ 0000 ayear and £ 00000 suppose any such opulentist disposed to employ his money in the purchase of praise and to employ  0000 ayear in the purchase of it what bounds could be set to the quantity he could command of it a man who has but twenty pounds ayear to live on suppose him disposed to expend a tenth part of his income in the purchase of this brilliant commodity how much would he be able to get for it would you see effective benevolence in perfection—look to the shillings sixpences and pence given to the men who have been persecuted for the cause of the people in the hearts of the givers if anywhere would you find effective benevolence compare with their offerings the offerings made by men who while overflowing in wealth and luxury yet pretend affection for the same cause other causes of delusion are—arrogance in official language display of irresistible power pretence to superior appropriate aptitude in any of its branches in particular pretence to matchless wisdom of matchless carefulness for the morality and felicity of subjects add to these peculiarity with or without expensiveness in official habiliments chapter xii fiction by fiction in the sense in which it is used by lawyers understand a false assertion of the privileged kind and which though acknowledged to be false is at the same time argued from and acted upon as if true belonging to it are various characteristic features it has never been employed but to a bad purpose it has never been employed to any purpose but the affording a justification for something which otherwise would be unjustifiable no man ever thought of employing false assertions where the purpose might equally have been fulfilled by true ones by false assertions a risk at least of disrepute is incurred by true ones no such risk it is capable of being employed to every bad purpose whatsoever it has never been employed but with a bad effect it affords presumptive and conclusive evidence of the mischievousness of the act of power in support of which it is employed it affords presumptive and conclusive evidence of the inaptitude of the form of government in support of which it is employed or under which it is suffered to be employed it affords presumptive and conclusive evidence of moral turpitude in those by whom it was invented and first employed it affords presumptive and conclusive evidence of moral turpitude on the part of all those functionaries and their supporters by whom it continues to be employed it affords presumptive and conclusive evidence of intellectual weakness stupidity and servility in every nation by which the use of it is quietly endured in regard to fiction two sources of service require to be noted one is the extent of the sinister service rendered the other is the extent of the class of persons to whom the service is rendered in respect of the extent of the service rendered the use of fiction may be distinguished into general and particular by particular use understand the particular benefit which on the occasion of such fiction results to the class or classes of persons served by it by the general use the benefit which accrues to all of them in the aggregate from the general principle of demoralisation which it contributes to establish viz that in regard to human actions in general right and wrong proper ground for approbation and disapprobation depends not on the influence of the action on the greatest happiness of the greatest number but on the practice consequently on the will and thence on the interest real or supposed of the aggregate of those same particular classes of the establishment of this principle of demoralisation the object and the effect is—the causing men to behold not merely with indifference but even with approbation in the first place the perpetration of injustice and in a word of political evil in all its shapes and in the next place the employing as an instrument in the    commission of such mischief wilful deliberate and selfconscious falsehood in a word mendacity the practising on this occasion and for this purpose that vice which when by individuals not armed with power it is employed to purposes much less extensively mischievous is by these same men habitually and to a vast extent visited with the severest punishment now as to the extent of the class of persons to whom the sinister service is rendered in this respect likewise the service will require to be distinguished into particular and general of the wilful and mischievous falsehoods in question some will be found in a more particular manner serviceable to the functionaries having the direction of that particular department of government in the business of which they are employed to the giving augmentation to the arbitrary power of those same rulers thus enabling them with the greater efficiency and to the greater extent to make sacrifice of the universal interest to their several particular and sinister interests in every case and throughout the whole field of government these instruments of misrule have had as they could not but have had for their fabricators the fraternity of lawyers more particularly and obviously such of them as have been invested with official power principally in the situation and under the name of judges though in the unofficial and less formidable characters of writers authors of reports and treatises men of the same class have not been wanting in contributing their share the situations on which by means of this instrument of misrule arbitrary power is to be heaped by those same indefatigable hands are that of the monarch and that of the judge on that of the monarch the chief portion his being the only permanent one of the two situations and that to which the subject many were at all times engaged by habit to manifest that obsequiousness on the one part of which power on the other part is composed chapter xiii factitious honour by the appellation factitious honour a general conception of what is meant by it will without difficulty be brought to view by factitious honour understand honour procured or endeavoured to be procured at the hands of the public at large in favour of some particular individual by means of some token or tokens giving an intimation to them to that effect by the functionary by whom the honour is said to be conferred on this occasion a word for the most part interconvertible with honour is dignity the idea conveyed by the word honour is however that of a fictitious entity extraneous to the individual in question the idea conveyed by the word dignity a fictitious entity a quality the seat of which is within him dignity is the name given to a quality in the human character the idea annexed to it seems not to be altogether a very determinate one—it is that quality which is such that by the opinion of its existence respect is produced on the part of others as towards him in whom it is regarded as existing say for shortness dignity is the efficient cause of respect the dignity may be styled natural in so far as the respect of the tokens of which the possessor is the object has for its efficient cause the opinion entertained by him who pays it in relation to the conduct and thence the frame of mind of him who is the object of it the dignity is factitious in so far as it has for its efficient cause the act of another person a person other than he in whom the quality is considered as having its existence of this factitious sort the distinctive character is this namely that by it respect may be caused to be shown to men in unlimited numbers to no one of whom in so far as depends upon his conduct and frame of mind respect would be paid to whom but for the operation by which this dignity is conferred no respect at all would ever be paid by any one for giving of the desired intimation to the public at large signs of various sorts are in use one sort of sign is of the purely visible sort of this sort are ensigns of honour another as being verbal are at once audible as well as visible of this sort are the signs called titles of honour titles may be and are unaccompanied with ensigns ensigns can scarcely exist without corresponding titles in both forms they may be either purely personal or successional of the successional class the most obvious subclass is the hereditary ensigns are not so apt to be successional as titles are howsoever designated they may be seen standing in some cases singly in others in a climax of various length or occupying any number of degrees rising one above another in a scale a factitious honour is seen sometimes in conjunction with a lot of power received at the same time with it as in the case of a member of the english house of lords sometimes without power as in the case of a spanish grandee sometimes without power but with privilege as in the case of the titled noblesse of france sometimes without power or privilege as in most christian flations in the case of the orders of knighthood which are designated by ensigns that are worn about the person and in the simple knighthood of england distinguished by an appellative but without any ensign worn about the person when combined with power in some cases    elevation in the climax of honour carries with it elevation in the climax of power as in the case of bishoprics and archbishoprics in the english house of lords in some cases the honours rise in a climax the power remaining unvaried as in the case of the lay lords of the english house of lords the power being annexed to the lowest degree in the climax of of honour termed a barony while above that rise other degrees in a climax namely a viscounty an earldom a marquisate and a dukedom in some cases it is or has been seen conjoined with property in land as in the case of some of the spanish orders and also in the case of some english baronies in others with landed property in the dominions of different states and a share in the supreme operative power in one state as in the case of the knights of malta before the cession of the power to great britain in consequence of the conquest made of the island in some cases it is seen conjoined with pensions as in the case of the french legion of honour instituted by napoleon infinite in number and variety are the compounds of power privilege landed property and pecuniary property in which it is an ingredient the cases above given are given as examples only and to aid conception in those examples incorrectnesses might probably be found in abundance with the facts belonging to the subject folios upon folios have been filled an analytical view of it that should be at once clear correct and allcomprehensive would be matter for a work of months and the whole together so much paper and time employed in waste the task would bear a resemblance to that of a set of industrious labourers who may be seen in london occupied in watching the rubbish and refuse of all sorts as it is conveyed from the various dwellinghouses to a spot allotted for the purpose in carts called dustcarts the compound is analyzed and the individuals belonging to the several species of matter collected in heaps between the one task and the other there would be this difference when rightly assorted the contents of the dustcart have all of them their modes and degrees of usefulness those of the budget of honour their modes and degrees as will be seen of mischievousness as to the compounds in which this article is an ingredient the consideration of them need not add to the trouble though in fact conjoined with the several other articles in idea there will be no difficulty in keeping it separate primarilyseated and in an extravasated state—say in one word extravasated—by these two words the distinction of greatest importance in respect of usefulness or mischievousness will be brought to view primarilyseated the honour may be said to be in the instance of the individual on whom by an appropriate act of power it has been first conferred extravasated in the instance of the individual who without any additional act of power has received the honour in virtue of a relation borne by him in some mode or other to him on whom it was conferred genealogical relationship is one of those modes official is another the origin of extravasated reward may be traced to three sources viz favouritism rapacity and sinister policy in what proportion they have contributed to the effect cannot in every instance be determined in england seats in the oligarchical body which after having been called the council settled at last under the name of parliament a speaking place became appendages to the vast portions of territory which the rapacity of the monarch was from time to time obliged to give up to the rapacity of the lesser tyrants his subordinates a time at length arrived when the prodigality of the monarch having left him no territory with which to satisfy this or that favourite instead of the title and the seat with the land the favourite received the one and the other without land as prodigality and rapacity went on their course all such portions of land valuable enough to support the expense attendant on a seat being all gone and the demand for money being pressing title and seat were not merely conferred without land but money was taken for them they were in a word sold when baronies together with the higher titles in which they are included first came to be sold the money with or without privity and connivance on the part of the monarch went wholly or principally into the pockets of the brokers in the transaction—the favourites the occasion on which for the first time the money went avowedly into the pocket of the monarch was that of the creation of the order of baronets by james i an appellation by which these men and their firstborn for ever were confounded with the order of knights—this appellation with or without title to precedence above knights was all that the purchasers of the article got for their money some thousands apiece to such a pitch had the fascinating power of this instrument of delusion arrived already in that age in a monarchy so long as there has been either a lawyer or a priest in office under it and no monarchy has there ever been without both the policy which consists in the endeavour to cause established vice to be venerated under the name of virtue has never been neglected mans elevation in the scale of virtue—real and useful virtue—is as it has been shown as his altitude in the conjunct scales of power opulence and factitious honour or dignity not directly but inversely but if this which is so incontrovertibly true were universally or very generally perceived monarchy though  0 it would still have for its supports force intimidation and corruptive influence would be limited to those supports it would be left destitute of the support afforded to it by delusive influence it was not without great exertion that mens eyes could be kept shut from the truth of a position which was demonstrated by experience no less universal and constant than the opposite falsehood what could not but add in no small degree to the difficulty of the process was that in the writings universally recognised as dictated by the almighty himself so far as opulence was in question its incompatibility with what they saw represented not merely as meritorious service but as almost the only meritorious service namely piety stands asserted asserted in terms if any such there are in the language by much too clear to admit of the possibility of mistake but of these writings the priests were the interpreters authoritative and sole authoritative interpreters and as in other instances so in this for the guide to their interpretation they found neither conscience nor anything else to restrain them from employing the rule of contraries into the kingdom of god no man who trusts in rulers can ever enter but the place that a church of england priest wants to enter into is a seat in the house of lords with the title of bishop or archbishop and £ 0000 ayear tacked to it accordingly no sooner does it please the almighty than he sits himself down in this same seat and as to the entrance into the kingdom of god he leaves it to all those who by the track which he has chalked out to them can find their way to it the circumstance to which they have been indebted for their success was this to their class belonged either as principals or as dependents all men from whom either by the ear or by the eye men of other classes were capable of receiving instruction the case where the distinction in question has been received in the way of succession after the manner of property in a pecuniary shape is an altogether curious one wastefulness and absurdity vie with each other in the composition of this arrangement it is among the fruits of monarchy as on the one hand misseated punishment abounds in a monarchy so on the other hand does misseated reward in both instances the contempt with which the people and their happiness are regarded alike manifests itself aptlyseated punishment is aptly or say rightlyseated in so far as the individual on whom it falls has been a partaker in the misdeed punishment is unaptlyseated or say misseated in so far as it falls on any individual who has not been a partaker in the offence of misseated punishment the absurdity as well as the atrocity is to such a degree flagrant as not to be capable of remaining unrecognised by any mind not blinded by terror or terrorbegotten prejudice with as much justice as any one nonmisdoing individual is punished so may every other misseated punishment has been termed vicarious it has place where an individual who has been a partaker in the misdeed not being subjected to punishment in consideration of it one who has not been a partaker is subjected to punishment in his stead misseated punishment may be termed extravasated where an individual or individuals who were not partakers in the misdeed are subjected to punishment in conjunction with those who were punishment in a vicarious shape is no less opposed to nature than it is repugnant to reason and general utility in consequence of the various connexions of interest and sympathy more especially domestic ones by which men are linked together punishment in an extravasated state is to an indefinite extent unhappily unavoidable by evil to this amount a moderate appetite for the spectacle of human suffering would have been satisfied not so in the eyes of english lawyers to reconcile men to the view of the boundless quantity produced by them under the orders of the monarch for the gratification of the kindred appetites of rapacity and vengeance they have pointed to that unhappy abundance of misseated punishment which no human ingenuity under the orders of human benevolence is able altogether to exclude tax not with irrelevancy what is here said of misseated punishment partly in the way of suggestion partly in the way of supposed or pretended justification injustice in the application of the matter of evil leads to injustice in the application of the matter of good to be lavish of punishment and lavish of reward belongs to the same mind and to the same form of government prodigality whatsoever be the subjectmatter of it prodigality by which others suffer is the offspring of contempt—of the contempt with which they are regarded who suffer by it vicarious reward is an absurdity that even in the most barbarous state of society appears not to have been exemplified the deficiency has however been amply compensated for by the amplitude of the field in which extravasated reward with its waste and absurdity have been and continue to be exhibited    where for the waste made of reward in the shape of factitious honour anything in the shape of a justification is adduced it is the remuneration and by means of the remuneration the production of extra meritorious public service that is stated as the good produced by it but where the individual to whom the reward is given is a person other than him by whom the supposed service is supposed to have been performed the plea such as it is is manifestly without application and such is the case in so far as the reward is in a state of extravasation in the case of punishment at the time when the extravasated mass was added the addition had if not a sufficient justification at any rate a partial one and at the worst a pretence in the case of reward reward in the shape here in question there is not so much as that pretence for in the case of punishment forfeiture being the mode there was in the first place in the case of offences against government need of selfpreservation on the one part need of disablement on the other part disablement for the commission of the like offences at the same hands there was also need of intimidation as a further means of prevention should the other fail thereupon what may here be said is this whatsoever fear has for its object evil in the case of its being borne immediately by a man himself a source from which it cannot fail to receive an addition is evil about to be eventually suffered by a party dear to him—a party who is the object of his sympathetic affection extravasated factitious honour aggravates the evil of inequality and does so without necessity and without use all inequality is a source of evil for by the inferior more is lost in the account of happiness than is gained by the superior inequality in the scale of power is a source of evil but inequality in this scale is necessary to the existence of society still the less there is of it consistently with the wellbeing of society in other respects the better inequality in the scale of opulence is necessary to a certain degree to the very being of society for any continuance for habitual superabundance is necessary as a security against such casual deficiency of which famine and mortality would be the results and unless men in general were permitted to give increase to their respective portions of superabundance no aggregate of superabundance could have place inequality in the scale of moral virtue of moral accomplishments of a nature useful to society may even be a source of evil but inequality is the inseparable result of competition and competition is the parent of increase and only in proportion to increase in such accomplishments can general felicity increase inequality in the scale of intellectual and active accomplishments is a source of evil for the reason above given but here too inequality is the inseparable result of competition competition is the parent of increase and in intellectual accomplishments in so far as they are kept in subservience to and under the control of moral accomplishments general felicity finds an increase to the inequality produced by extravasated factitious honour no such necessity attaches no such use to the evils of which it is the source no compensation attaches itself in any shape extravasated factitious honour has place most commonly in the instance of the same individual with superiority in power or opulence or both it produces none of the benefits of either but it adds to the evils produced by both as to power to the account of the benefits conferred by power are to be placed over and above those which may be termed direct those which may be termed indirect the direct are those which are derived from the exercise of it and from the idea of being able to give exercise to it the indirect consist in the respect entertained for it the respect the parent of good offices that is of beneficial service in all its various shapes as it is with power so it is with opulence in the case of power indirect benefits follow in the train of the direct so is it in the case of opulence the direct consist in the possession and use of the instruments of enjoyment and security purchased by it the indirect consist in the services which other individuals are disposed voluntarily and spontaneously to render to the possessor for the hope of being let into a participation of the use made of those instruments—the house the table the library the garden the instruments of locomotion and conveyance suppose not only no extravasated factitious honour but no superiority by power no superiority by opulence to have place—sympathy and esteem and thence free and spontaneous service in all its shapes would attach itself to superiority in the scale of genuine moral virtue of effective benevolence in harmony and alliance with selfregarding prudence this order is disturbed by power it is disturbed by opulence it experiences further disturbance from extravasated factitious honour and in so far as that order is disturbed by them those instruments of felicity are every one of them instruments of moral corruption    of all modifications of factitious honour the most curious is that which has place in the way of what in the physical world—in the world of realities—used to be called equivocal generation—made without a maker so many hundred years ago a mans supposed ancestor was it is supposed numbered among those whose whole life was a life of oppression and depredation embellished with incidental acts of murder upon a scale more or less extensive for this cause it is that by himself and others respect is required to be paid to this descendant of that same malefactor in this case the honour cannot be said to be extravasated for were the receptacle in which it was primarily seated looked for by the supposition no such receptacle would be to be found the more respect a man receives on account of factitious honour and dignity or on account of ancestry the less the inducement he has to practise those selfdenials those labours and those abstinences which are more or less necessary to a mans rendering himself serviceable to mankind the less therefore is likely to be his aggregate appropriate aptitude with relation to the habit of such serviceableness or in a word in relation to virtue public and private oh no cries the man of ancestry i possess a title to your esteem and confidence—a title such as no man who is not equally gifted in this respect can pretend to for good conduct in all its modifications i have an inducement in which no other man whose ancestry is not so illustrious as mine can pretend to have an equal share nothing dishonourable could i ever do without tarnishing the lustre of my family—the lustre shed on it by my ancestors how supremely silly is all such language supposing it sincere how perfect the blindness it betrays of the ruling principle of human conduct what he has in common with all others is the being dependent for no small part of his comforts upon the good opinion the goodwill and the good offices positive and negative of men in general and particularly of those individuals with whom it happens to him to have most intercourse by anything otherwise than honourable by any act of his that has anything dishonourable in it whatsoever kindness may be in their sentiments and affections in relation to him will be lessened suppose this inducement to have lost all force what force in that same tutelary direction can be exerted by those empty sounds if his care for himself be so little on what ground can it be regarded as any greater for a set of men whom he never saw of whom he knows comparatively nothing from whom he never could have received any token of kindness and to whom his qualities and his very existence were alike perfectly unknown in relation to this artificial product of the power of government in the field of society the general conclusions are as follows—they constitute so many reasons why the here proposed exclusion should have place every institution of this sort is needless needless with reference to all purposes contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number and in particular to the production of extraordinarily meritorious public service for all such purposes as far as dignity suffices natural dignity if aptly made known suffices all factitious honour is mischievous everywhere factitious honour in a monarch is in a political point of view mischievous by making addition to a power otherwise excessive in a political point of view factitious honour conferred by a monarch is mischievous as being an instrument of corruptive influence in a political point of view factitious honour conferred by a monarch is mischievous as being an instrument of delusive influence in a moral point of view factitious honour is mischievous by counteracting the influence of the publicopinion tribunal and thereby by lessening moral worth in the dignified and the undignified in its character of a certificate a document of this sort does not so extensively or so immediately operate on mens minds as in the character of an order for respect its character of a certificate is rather a character ascribed to it to reconcile men to it in the character of an order for respect than a character which belongs to it of course the reader will presently be in a condition to judge whether with exceptions in a very minute proportion in so far as it is a certificate of meritorious service the certificate is not false as also whether in so far as it is true any effect which it has in the way of affording payment as a reward for such service already rendered and thereby giving increased probability to the rendering of the like service to an indefinite extent in future is not capable of being produced in a much greater degree and to much greater certainty by other means as also what those other means are    also whether this alleged mode of procuring beneficial service be not pregnant with evil in a variety of distinguishable shapes and whether that evil be not so much net evil without any good attached to it or if there be any good in any shape attached to it whether by the evil such good is not greatly outweighed in such sort as to leave a net quantity of evil on the evil side of the account the benefits produced to the possessor by factitious honour whether primarily seated or extravasated are considerable and unquestionable individually and separately taken they may seem trifling not so the aggregate which is composed of them they either consist in or are produced and conferred by free and spontaneous service in so many various shapes as for example— on every occasion the most commodious seat or standingroom the faculty of being heard in preference the faculty of being addressed in preference the faculty of taking the lead in conversation and thus choosing and determining the subject matters of it the subjects from the discussion of which he expects most benefit to himself whether in the way of amusement at the present or with reference to the future the satisfaction of observing in mens words countenance and deportment those tokens of respect which with more or less reason express a general promise of free and spontaneous service in all shapes power is purely mischievous whatsoever of it is not needful but factitious honour is in the whole of it purely mischievous as at the expense of the whole of the community is all power created and conferred so at the expense of the whole is all factitious honour created and conferred of operative power the immediate effect is not only obsequiousness but obedience on the part of him on whom it is exercised of factitious honour an effect is not obedience indeed but obsequiousness on the part of those at whose expense it is created and conferred in so far as it is productive of this effect it is by producing in the minds of those at whose expense it is created the opinion of the existence of superiority in respect of moral and intellectual endowments of power and opulence separately or collectively on the part of him on whom it is conferred in so far as it is productive of obsequiousness though without actual obedience it does not indeed confer power on the individual on whom it is conferred but in his favour it produces the effect of power—viz conformity as towards his will at the same time it creates and confers power and in much greater quantity in favour of him by whom it is itself created and conferred say in favour of the patron of the dignity for the patron of the dignity is himself the most dignified of all the dignitaries the respect of which factitious honour is productive has for its more remote cause a confused and undeterminate mass of opinions or conceptions of which the following seem to be the ingredients— opinion of the existence of preeminent power on the part of the dignitary opinion of the existence of preeminent opulence on the part of the dignitary opinion of the dignitarys being in the habits of personal converse with other persons possessed of equal and even superior dignities and thence of equal and even superior masses of power and opulence opinion of the dignitarys having a place in the esteem or affection or both of the patron of the dignity thence of his having a chance more or less considerable of obtaining for other persons such benefits as it is in the power of such patron to bestow opinion of his being in a preeminent degree in possession of qualities extensively useful such as while they afford him the power or means confer on him the disposition to render his faculties conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number all but the last of these opinions are in a degree more or less considerable sure to be wellfounded only in the instance of the last is it illfounded the opposite being the opinion that as above has truth on its side the cause of this last opinion is altogether curious—deplorable considering how mischievous it is the dignity has in every instance for its immediate efficient cause or rather instrument some symbol perceptible to sense—to the sense of hearing at the least an appellation—most commonly in addition to it some symbol perceptible to the sense of sight an embroidered imitation of a star a ribbon of a particular shape and colour a medal of this power of symbols or signs over opinions the cause lies in the association of ideas—in the principle of association between idea and idea the curious circumstance is the irresistible force with which in this instance the cause operates in the production of the effect here are a set of men whom taken in the aggregate i cannot upon reflection look upon as fit objects of a greater portion of esteem and respect nor even of so great a portion as an equal number of men taken at random at the same time spite of myself by the idea of any one possessed of any one of these symbols a greater degree of those social affections is excited than is excited by the idea of any one not possessed of any one of those symbols whence this inconsistency by a continually renewed train of association commencing at the earliest dawn of reason this opinion of the constant connexion between the possession of the external symbol in question and the mental quality in question has been created and confirmed for the revival of the erroneous opinion a single instant suffices at all times for the expulsion of it nothing less than a train of reflection can suffice    to this case i feel a very conformable parallel may be seen in the case of ghosts and other fabulous maleficent beings which the absence of light presents to my minds eye in no mans judgment can a stronger persuasion of the nonexistence of these sources of terror have place than in mine yet no sooner do i lay myself down to sleep in a dark room than if no other person is in the room and my eyes keep open these instruments of terror obtrude themselves and to free myself from the annoyance i feel myself under the necessity of substituting to those more or less pleasing ideas with which my mind would otherwise have been occupied those reflections which are necessary to keep in my view the judgment by which the nonexistence of these creatures of the imagination has so often been pronounced the cause of these illusions were the stories told by servants in my childhood the tale of the apparition of ghosts and vampires is not more fabulous than is in general the tale of worth moral or intellectual as applied to these creatures of a monarch who form the class of state dignitaries in what circumstance did this erroneous opinion find its cause the answer has in it neither doubt nor difficulty one word adulation suffices for the expression of it at first by the pen it is now by the press that opinions are chiefly disseminated in proportion to the quantity possessed by them of the objects of desire and sources of power have writers beheld in the hands of their readers those instruments by which the happiness of the writers has been dependent on their will in some readers do all writers behold those on whose will in some way or other their happiness depends in some readers do writers accordingly behold those in whose favour it is their interest and consequently their endeavour to ingratiate themselves and obtain a place—the higher the better in one word they behold their patrons thus the opinions to which a writer so circumstanced gives utterance will be determined not by the opinions really entertained by him but by the degree of kindness or unkindness of which he regards it as likely to be productive in the breast of those on whose kindness and unkindness his happiness is thus dependent if even in the early stages of society the fascinations produced by factitious honour were ever conducive to the creation and preservation of government no argument can thence be deduced for the preservation of this delusion with its instruments in the present stage of society that they are in various respects mischievous has been proved above that they are altogether needless has been proved by an experiment on a large scale and continued during so long a period—viz by the experiment made in the angloamerican united states from the several other elements of effective power in the hands of the ruling few this element has been detached and excluded and the result is the aptitude of the system of government not impaired but improved in the character of a testimonial or certificate what are the matters of fact which with relation to the individual so honoured it renders more or less probable they are that either immediately or unimmediately namely through the intervention of some other or others to the individual by whom the honour has been conferred he was at the time of its being conferred an object of sympathy that is to say in a monarchy to the monarch this however it is evident cannot be a matter of complete certainty that if not an object of sympathy at any rate not an object of antipathy for if yes the functionary would not have subjected himself to the pain necessarily attendant on the conferring it that partly by gratitude for this past favour partly by hope of further favours he is attached to the person of the functionary by whom the benefit was conferred on him disposed to contribute according to the measure of his faculties to the advancement of the particular interest of this same patron disposed to be obsequious to his will disposed to concur in the advancement of that particular interest at the expense and by the sacrifice of all conflicting interests in general that whatsoever in this respect may have antecedently been the case the individual thus honoured has the faculty of mixing in society with other individuals possessing factitious honour of the same species and the same rank still more assuredly with all those below him in the same line and in all probability with others if any such there are who in relation to him are superior in rank to speak in general terms he is known to have access to persons occupying an elevated situation in the community that as his interests are in alliance with so his affections sympathize with the interests and affections of that portion of the community whose station is thus elevated and that in so far as between the higher and the lower orders in consequence of such difference of interests and affections a difference of judgment naturally has place—his judgment will on each occasion side with theirs his judgment and in consequence his conduct in a word that in his character of member of the publicopinion tribunal it is to the aristocratical section of that judicatory that he belongs but the interest consequently the affection and judgment of the monarch as such are adverse to the general interest of the community so are those of the aristocracy in all its modifications not contributory but detrimental to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in relation to these several matters the evidence thus afforded is not conclusive evidence it is capable of being rebutted and outweighed by other evidence but in so far as it has any operation such is the tendency of it whatsoever be the degree of probability in relation to    each part such is the side on which it is situated why as a testimony of meritorious service is it essentially unapt and fallacious it is given without any published proof of the particular nature of the meritorious service if any that is supposed to have been rendered without any published proof of the fact of the mans having rendered any such meritorious service it is given for aught that appears without any proof received by him by whom the honour is conferred of service in any shape as having been rendered to any one by him on whom it is conferred in a word the act by which it is conferred is essentially an arbitrary act it is with relation to reward that is to say to the good that is done—that which in relation to evil punishment is in so far as inflicted without trial without judicial inquiry as to the ground of it without reference to the conduct of him to whom it is applied the consequence is that by every such honour so conferred injustice is done not indeed to the individual to whom the reward is applied as in the case of punishment to the individual to whom the punishment is applied—not to him indeed but to others namely to those at whose expense it is applied one case alone can be mentioned in which it affords any just ground for supposing that in its character of a certificate of meritorious service it may perhaps not be false and that is the case where it is conferred as a reward for military service but even in this case it cannot but be frequently false—false perhaps in more instances than those in which it is true and if so absolutely unapt at any rate comparatively unapt—comparison had with a method in which the most efficient means are employed for preventing it from being given where it would be false while where given as it has everywhere as yet been actually given no such means are employed when arbitrarily conferred it is conferred either without so much as an indication of service in any specific shape rendered to the public or if with any such indication without proof made and published of the reality of the facts on the supposed reality of which it is grounded if conferred without indication of service to the public that which is indicated by it is—that the individual on whom it is conferred is an object of favour to the person or persons by whom it has been conferred in this case it is mischievous on the following accounts there are two sets of persons at whose expense is conferred every honour that is conferred all the members of the community at large—the whole number of them and those particular ones if any among whom benefits in this shape have been shared by the members at large of any donation of this sort taken singly the expense is in but a small degree if in any degree felt but when viewed in the aggregate the expense to which communities have been subjected in this shape will by every man be more or less clearly perceived and acutely felt in proportion as he thinks of it evil   burthen to the unhonoured at large by those who at the time when in the individual instance in question the honour was conferred were already in possession of it the expense is felt in a much more intense degree witness the duchess of northumberland who in the days of george the second durst not spit out of her coach as she passed along the streets for fear of spitting upon a lord evil   burthen to the cohonoured every honour that has been conferred on any man in whose instance it is not clear that extraordinary service to the public has in any shape been done is conferred in a more particular manner at the expense of all those by whom extraordinary service to the public has really been rendered it is felt by them as an injury it has always for its tendency and to an unmeasurable extent for its effect the preventing men in general from taking on themselves any extraordinary burthen for the purpose of rendering to the public in any shape extraordinary service publication of service secures to every extraordinarily meritorious individual for services past and thence for services to come the exact portion of honour which in a comparative as well as absolute point of view is most apt with relation to the service no injury does it to any man to men in any number it may produce uneasiness but in no instance can the uneasiness be productive of or accompanied by any such sensation as the conception of injustice—of injustice done to any one by him to whom the honour has been adjudged evil   burthen to the meritorious unhonoured when monarchy was specially on the carpet in the account given of the several external instruments of felicity in their eventual character of instruments of corruptive influence this one had its place considered in comparison with the other articles it will be found to stand upon a very different footing from both of them power is necessary to the very existence of government it is the very matter of which the means of government are made excluded it cannot be the utmost that can be done is to limit it so again money—money at the disposal of government without it government in a political community of any considerable extent could not be carried on to exclude it is altogether impossible to exclude the difference between what is necessary and what is not necessary—and to take care that that which is necessary should according to its destination be applied to the service of government and to no other purpose—this is the utmost of what can be done evil   evil by contribution to the corruptive fund    on the same occasion it has been seen how by the possession and eventual expectation of them the external instruments of felicity contribute as such to the general debasement of the moral part of mans frame in private life as well as in public of those same objects of general desire this is not less true of this one than of either of the other two abovementioned evil   evil by demoralising influence or say evil of demoralisation by sinister independence when factitious honour has been raised to a certain level thereupon has come the observation that money is needed for the support of it on this occasion dignity is the term that seems most commonly employed but it is out of the pockets of the people that as for all other purposes so for this the money has come if in conjunction with this factitious dignity the man has opulence of his own in a certain degree of plentitude—in a degree sufficient for the support of the imaginary burthen—it is sometimes held sufficient sometimes not as it may happen but if he has not—if this be an agreed matter money in such quantity as shall be sufficient must at all events and at any rate be found for him thus it is that when obtained by swindling honour carries depredation along with it for this application of public money there are sundry reasons more really operative than readily avowed when from this factitious title to respect the support given to it by money is taken away contempt will be apt to substitute itself to the respect by the decomposition thus made the false colour will vanish men will be led to say to themselves—a man may bear this mark upon him and yet be a poor creature what then is it good for and thus its worthlessness being seen in the case of this poor man may by degrees come to be recognised in the case of the rich ones in place of the respect they have been accustomed to receive these his fellow dignitaries will be apprehensive of sharing in the contempt under which they see him suffering the more generous of them will feel a pain of sympathy from the observation of what they see him suffering evil   evil by pretence for depredation as a certificate of merit on the part of the wearer we have seen that it is false combined with this false certificate is a draught drawn upon the members of the community for value received a draught payable in tokens of respect value received in the shape of meritorious service the functionaries by whom this deceptious instrument is uttered are by the practice of uttering it and the habit of seeing it accepted encouraged to act in the character of impostors it operates in this way on their moral faculties as an instrument of demoralisation evil   evil by sanction given to imposture delusion is the counterpart of the last preceding evil in so far as the fraud passes upon them undetected—in so far as they are imposed upon by it and bestow respect where respect is undue and the payment of it mischievous mischievous to themselves and to everybody—it operates upon their intellectual faculties it operates as an instrument of intellectual depravation evil   evil by propagation of delusion whether it be in the scale of power or in the scale of opulence it has been seen elsewhere that by every degree of distance from the point of equality the loss to the inferior in the account of happiness is greater than the profit to the superior in the scale of power inequality to a certain degree is as has been observed above matter of indispensable necessity so likewise in the scale of opulence in both those instances the evil is therefore compensated and overcompensated by the good in this case it stands altogether uncompensated evil   evil by aggravation of inequality in the chapter relating to the publicopinion tribunal will be seen how much the interest and influence of the aristocratical section of that tribunal is at variance with that of the democratical the small minority with that of the vast majority evil  0 evil by addition to the antisocial force of the aristocratical section of the publicopinion tribunal specific reasons for extra respect not having place the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that in the scale of respect in pursuance of the principle of practicable equality the superiority should be attached to age for on this plan all will in their turn enjoy the benefit of it all suspicion of injustice is excluded by it all envy and jealousy are excluded by it time and labour of contestation are saved by it a compensation is afforded as far as it goes for the diminution produced in the account of felicity by the age of caducity and thence by every ulterior approach that is made to it evil    evil by usurpation of respect due to age it has been seen in how many ways the disposition thus made of the matter of good in this shape presents to view the picture of injustice there is a burthen without compensation imposed on the members of the community at large burthen imposed in a more particular manner on those who have rendered meritorious service to whom benefit in this same shape is justly due burthen by injustice to age burthen by useless and avoidable addition to unavoidable inequality the example of injustice produced by the joint influence of all these causes is itself a thing distinct from all of them bad is that government where injustice having place discontent has place in consequence still worse that where injustice having place no discontent is excited by it by the spectacle of established injustice in    any one shape injustice in every other shape is promoted by habit those at whose expense it is committed are lulled into acquiescence under it and by the spectacle of this acquiescence the authors of the baleful habit are encouraged to persevere in it evil    evil by the spectacle of injustice as in the case of injustice so in the case of waste by the same disposition by which waste in any one shape is produced waste in every other shape is produced and by the example of waste in any one shape waste in every other is promoted by habit those at whose expense it is committed are lulled into acquiescence under it and by the spectacle of this acquiescence the authors of the waste are encouraged to persevere in it the wasting hand is like the blasting pestilence under a monarchy neither good nor evil in any shape escape it money power punishment pardon respect of the people the security of the people is wasted by blind pardons their respect by factitious honour evil    evil by the spectacle of waste in any one nation let evil in this shape be produced it spreads itself as it were by contagion over all other nations among all nations in whose instance any habit of intercourse has place—in a word among all civilized nations the draught drawn in any one by its ruler upon his own subjects for the appropriate quantity of mechanicallypaid respect is to a greater or less degree honoured in every other true it is—not inconsiderable are the diversities of which the quantity of respect paid in other countries to the possessor of an article of this kind belonging to the country in question is susceptible to this variation two circumstances are contributory   the different degrees of honour designated and thence the different quantities of respect drawn for by the same denomination or mark in different countries   the different degrees of appropriate information possessed in each such foreign country by different individuals in relation to the true import of the article and the proportion borne by the value of it to the several other articles belonging to the aggregate list but at any rate if so it be that his appellation presents to view a title of honour or his person a mark of honour he is recognised as belonging to the caste of the privileged orders to that caste in which no individual who not belonging to it has any tolerably correct conception of the nature and effects of it can fail to behold a species of men by whom a comparatively small mass of felicity is possessed at the expense of a more than equiponderant mass of infelicity to others—whose existence is an injury to all others and in one word a universal nuisance in england the title of prince has never been borne by any individual who has not been a member of the royal family when under this title the member of another nation is presented to notice this idea of blood relation to royalty the highest order in the state naturally presents itself it is only by particular information that he learns by how great and various distances the rank of the bearer of this title is separated from that of royalty and sovereignty in other states how in france for example the throng of princes are confounded with those of counts viscounts and barons how abundant they are in various parts of italy how in russia while the title is borne by some of the most opulent as well as ancient families it is borne by others whose place is in almost the lowest rank in the scale of opulence the advantage of being thus confounded in mens conceptions with the members of sovereign families seems of late to have recommended it in germany as well as in france hence it is that in the course of the revolution undergone by france buonapartes generals received some of them indeed the title of dukes but others the title of princes and talleyrand though a member of one of the oldest and as such most honoured families of the noblesse of france saw an advantage in accepting in form the title of prince in germany this title has been borne by several of the little sovereigns future feudatory monarchs with which the constitution of that confederacy still continues even in its present altered state in the prussian monarchy made up of shreds and patches torn at different times from their various possessors—in the prussian monarchy till the other day there was nothing above a count of late the monarchy being enlarged and consolidated the treasury of honour has been enriched there with an order of prince in poland before its partition a few of the most opulent families that is to say the greatest landholders though it is believed without any formal creation used to bear in other languages the title of princes and continue to do so since in russia there are barons and above them counts but nothing higher the princes having been such not by creation but some how or other it is not generally known how it remains for the genius of the present or some future autocrat to import from england the titles of duke and marquis to sit above those of count and baron evil    evil by international contagion a few points relative to this product of government call for explanation it operates as already stated as an order for respect for respect to be afforded and as it were paid by persons in general to him on whom the honour is said to be conferred it operates therefore as a title to respect in this particular it is in regard to respect that which an order for the payment of money—a draught for example on a banker—is in regard to money but with this difference that it is at the hands of one individual only that    the order for money calls for money whereas it is at the hands of all persons in general that the title of honour—the order for respect—calls for respect on the occasion of each such act it is an exercise of dominion over the many for the benefit of one over the many—indeed with little exception over all the means not being coercive it produces not that sense of oppression which dominion in general employing as it must do coercion for its instrument cannot when directed towards so unjustifiable an end fail to produce it is by delusion that the effect is produced not by force or intimidation but the effect of it being as will be seen purely mischievous the circumstance of there being one evil not produced by it will not suffice to turn the whole mass of evil into good it operates as an article of documentary evidence as a certificate of good desert or merit of such certificate the effect is to cause respect in degree and quantity more or less considerable to be entertained by the members of the community in question towards and in relation to him who bears it respect or at any rate the outward signs and tokens of that inward sentiment this effect is produced by ascribing dignity to him or worthiness by causing it to be believed that in the opinion of him by whom the honour is conferred he on whom it is conferred is worthy of receiving at the hands of the members of the community in general those same outward tokens it gives intimation that in the opinion of that same functionary the person in whose favour it is his desire that those same tokens of respect should be manifested and paid has been and is deserving of such respect to deserve anything good—any instrument of felicity—is to have a claim to it in the character of a reward on the score of service in some shape or other rendered by the individual in question to some other individual or individuals which service if it be real must have been the contributing in fact or in probability to cause him to experience pleasure in some shape which he would not have experienced otherwise or to be exempt from experiencing pain which he would have experienced otherwise with the word merit if any clear idea is attached to it stands associated the idea of service for by him to whom merit is ascribed suppose no service rendered or endeavoured to be rendered to anybody—the idea of merit evaporates and leaves the word in a state of nonsignificance if then in virtue of the dignity conferred on him and the alleged claim to respect given to him—he has rendered service to anybody it must have been service of the meritorious kind service by the rendering of which the existence of merit has been displayed moreover this service must have had something extraordinary in it in its nature something whereby it stands distinguished from ordinary service—from service in those shapes in which it is continually rendered by everybody to everybody by every dealer for example to his customer by every customer to his dealer by every purchaser to his seller by every seller to his purchaser as in the case of service so in the case of respect the worth of it if it has any must consist either of a certainty as where the event is past or of a probability of pleasure in some shape or other experienced or pain in some shape or other avoided and not experienced laying all together—the intimation conveyed by an act by which a title of honour is conferred is—that the individual on whom it is conferred has in some determinate shape or other rendered to some individual or individuals or to the whole community together service of a meritorious and in some way or other of an extraordinary kind and has thereby proved himself to be possessed of dignity i e by such service to have given himself a title to receive at the hands of the community in general a token of the existence of the sentiment of respect in relation to him in their minds as if in payment or part payment of such service in reality this question about rank is by no means so frivolous as it may appear to be for by all its varieties it will be seen how the people are tormented and depressed in the several countries in which a title originally conferred by the monarch has been assumed by men on whom it has not either in their own persons or in the persons of their ancestors been conferred an instance may be seen of a sort of superfœtation of depravity—a fraud made to grow out of a fraud the monarch by the conspiracy by which this false certificate of meritorious service has been produced the monarch and the individuals thus honoured by him have swindled the public at large out of a certain quantity of respect not really due imposing thus upon the public at large and the usurpers of it have on their parts imposed upon the public at large and the monarch both by pretending to have received from him what in truth he never gave the most disastrous case is that which has place where the title is made a pretence for depredation for example where the monarch of a country receives the title of king to a king not to speak of a sceptre and a palace belong a throne and a crown to this pair of implements a quality called splendour is necessary the throne must have gold about it the crown besides gold pieces of natural glass called diamonds by these ingredients or appendages with the help of a little manual labour splendour in the physical sense is constituted but to splendour in the physical sense must be added splendour in a superior sense the metaphorical or hyperphysical sense    appetite in all snapes is stimulated by the title the quantity of his superfluities must receive increase the quantity of the superfluities enjoyed by his courtiers and his living instruments of government must be increased the number of these instruments themselves must receive increase being admitted into the circle and fraternity of kings his appearance must in everything be if possible upon a par with theirs the story of the frog and the ox is exemplified but with a disastrous variation it is not by themselves but by the overgrown frog at the head of them by the great frog with a crown on his head that the little frogs are burst the language employed in reference to these kingly implements demonstrates in how deplorable a degree the power of the intellect may be debilitated by the force of custom and prejudice always in the character of an object of prime necessity is this furniture of the great babyhouse—the mass of the instruments of corruptive and delusive influence spoken of this which is so much worse than useless is spoken of as of more importance than the whole aggregate of those benefits the securing of which constitutes the only compensation for the evils necessarily produced by government not any the faintest colour of reason being capable of being given for it it is on every occasion taken for granted in the character of an incontestible truth ask in what way it contributes in the character of a mean to the pretended end no answer will you receive ask in what particular the governments in which there is no such splendour lustre or support of dignity—ask in what particular they are the worse for the absence of it—no answer will you receive as in the situation of king honour and dignity require for their support splendour and lustre—that is to say money taken for the purpose out of the pockets of the people—so in every situation within the reach of the royal eyes hence it is that if a man in a certain rank be in want of money whether it has been by misfortune or by prodigality that the want has been produced the deficiency is to be supplied at the expense of the laborious part of the people—money must be squeezed out of the productive classes incessant are the complaints of the expense of affording to the helpless among the productive classes those supplies without which starvation and death must of necessity be their fate profound is the silence as to the expense of supplying to the extravagant in the higher orders the means of further extravagance grievous the complaints of the overgrowth of that part of the population for the maintenance of which £ 0 ayear all ages included will suffice no complaint of the overgrowth of that part for the maintenance of which £ 00 ayear will not suffice on this occasion the brood of kings hatched by buonaparte and reared by the holy alliance cannot fail to present themselves the rationale of the operation is sufficiently manifest by the old brood nothing has been lost on the account of honour and dignity profit to an unlimited amount has been made in the account of money in dignity no loss for the great old monarchs are not confounded with the little new ones the distance is sufficiently wide to preserve them from misfortune in this shape on the contrary a contrast is visible and by this contrast they are raised by the power and for the support of the dignity a tax and that a perpetual one has been imposed on bavaria wirtemberg belgium saxony and hanover—a tax which though of the indirect kind is not the less burthensome such is the immediate effect but on the other hand in the train of it will come another all these are added to the number of the nations to whom the appellation king will be an object of abhorrence the emperors of germany and russia are now emperors because they were so before for the name of the empire austria is substituted to germany because in austria the emperor was as he is a despotic sovereign whereas in germany taken collectively he was but a titular one the king of england would not be emperor because the form of a concurrence by parliament would have been necessary and the delusion by which he is kept in his place of king might have been shaken by the discussion produced by the word emperor they would not make the king of france nor did he wish to be made emperor because that would have been copying the example of the usurper whose emperorship was the result not wholly of force and intimidation but in some measure of corruption and delusion and had the consent of no inconsiderable portion of the people for the cause of it conferred that is to say known or supposed or considered as being conferred by the publicopinion tribunal—adjudicating to the party in question the benefit designated by the words affection esteem and respect of the community at large—of the greatest number of those under whose cognizance the meritorious services have been rendered by him—the reward conferred is characterized and distinguished from the mass of benefit conferred by means of factitious honour by these peculiar properties— the application thus made is determined by the interest common to the greatest number of the members of the community in question at any rate by that which is in their eyes their common interest in the case where the honour is primarily seated the application made of the mass of benefit in question in the case of factitious honour is determined by the interest real or supposed of the individual by whom it is conferred  0 in the case where it is seated by extravasation on the ground of consanguinity it is determined as to the individual by blind chance by the natural character of the class to which the possessor of it in this its extravasated state appertains it is in his instance indicative of an interest and a state of the affections and the opinions adverse to the interest of the greatest number it marks him out as a man who was by birth an enemy to the interest and happiness of the greatest number a member of the privileged class namely of a class composed of those whose common interest is a particular and sinister interest opposite to the universal interest he who is at one time an enemy may at another time be a friend but he who is by birth an enemy cannot on any sufficient grounds be regarded as a friend unless and until and in so far as by such means as the nature of the case affords he has made known the change of this change one sufficient and conclusive proof the nature of the case affords and that is a surrender of the privilege in this way and no other can he render it manifest that by him his interest is identified with the universal interest his affections with the affections of the greatest number of the members of the community in question that in his eyes the affection esteem and respect which is the result of judgment unperverted by any delusion from any source is preferred to that respect which is the joint offspring of sinister interest caprice imposture and chance the effect with a view to its supposed usefulness upon which the greatest reliance seems likely to be placed is that supposed to be produced in the character of an inducement for the production of extraordinary meritorious public service service rendered to the community at large whether by being rendered to government or otherwise employed to this end that which will be expected of it is—the making known to the community at large the quality and quantity of the service rendered to the end that by the several members of it as occasion offers retribution may be made to their benefactor by suitable manifestations of affection and respect and in particular by good offices—by useful services employed in this character it is employed in the character of obtaining by purchase at the hands of such individuals in whom the power of rendering it may have place the greatest quantity of the service in the shape in question namely of extraordinary meritorious service upon the most advantageous terms that is to say of the greatest value possible quality and quantity considered and at the lowest price here then come two different ends the accomplishment of both which in so far as practicable requires to be aimed at   of the aggregate mass of service thus obtained to maximize the value   to minimize the expense in the instance of every such service the mass of reward in all its parts taken together must afford such a mass of benefit to the individual in question as shall be sufficient to outweigh in his mind the burthen sustained by the rendering of it in so far as public affection and respect enter into the composition of the means of purchase this relation between quantity of service and quantity of reward will require to be considered benefit of reward must outweigh burthen of service the greater the value of the service that is to say of the benefit the greater is the burthen which he on whom it depends in the instance in question will be disposed to take upon himself for the purpose of his rendering it the greater a service the greater the reward worth giving for it if on any occasion there be two services so circumstanced that by the individual or individuals in question either can be performed but not both any two masses of reward that shall appear capable of being earned by the performance of the two services respectively should be so apportioned that the receipt of the more valuable reward shall be attached to the rendering the more valuable service of two rival services offer greater reward for the more valuable not that the only shape in which remuneration belongs to the present subject is the honorary shape that it is not for service in every shape that reward in this shape will be sufficient or even so much as apposite is sufficiently manifest where in the course of action whereby meritorious service has been rendered loss has been suffered by money expended profit does not commence reward does not commence till compensation has been made for the full amount of the loss and in the account of money must be comprehended that which in the time in question would have been received by the individual in question in return for labour expended moreover if by the reward conferred it be intended to purchase at the hands of other individuals future contingent service not only actual loss but probable risk must be taken into the account by apt and adequate notification of past service rendered that is by honour thus conferred the maximum of future service may be obtained at the minimum of expense for the value of the reward thus rises with the value of the past service rewarded by it of this plan the principal feature consists in giving publicity to as great an extent as possible due regard being had to expense and with the utmost degree of clearness correctness and completeness possible to the nature of the service rendered the name of the individual by whom the service has been rendered and the circumstances by which the degree of meritoriousness possessed by it have been constituted the effect of it will be a sort of judgment    pronounced opposite in its effects but not the less analogous to a judgment by which on the ground of delinqency an individual is subjected to punishment the judgment thus pronounced ought to have evidence for its ground for public affection and respect ought not any more than public money to be bestowed without evidence of the sufficiency of the title on which it is claimed upon this plan the terms of the judgment with the evidence on which it has been grounded will form the matter or subject of a report to this document as to any other such a degree of publicity may in each individual case be given as the nature of the case is to warrant and to call for as time runs on of the several judgments here indicated an aggregate and continually increasing body will be formed to this aggregate some denomination will of course be given let it for example be the book of good desert or say the register of meritorious service in it the several individual services will of course be ranked under general and specific heads as likewise the names and other circumstances appertaining to the individuals thus distinguished the expense attendant on the process of conferring dignity in this its natural shape is it liable to the imputation of being excessive if at the expense of but a single individual reward in money to the amount of any the smallest denomination of coin were claimed the services of the judicial establishment for the purpose of giving effect to it or rejecting it are not grudged but in the shape in question reward cannot it will be seen be given but at the expense of all the members of the community how impalpable soever may in each instance be the amount of the expense where the value of the service shall appear not to be such as to warrant this expense no such expense will be incurred the individual by whom it is conceived that a service of this description has been rendered will take his own course for the giving publicity to it at the expense of the public at large and by a public functionary without sufficient and judicial evidence of extra good desert reward in the shape of honour ought not to be conferred honour conferred as above will be natural honour judicially conferred conferred as the french phrase is en connoissance de cause the effects of factitious honour in whatsoever shape it has or can have place have been shown to be allcomprehensively and preponderantly pernicious to give support to this sinister instrument of felicity itself and increase to the utmost to its sinister effects has at the same time been shown to be the common interest of all who share in it but in a still greater proportion than that in which it is beneficial to those privileged few it is burthensome to the unprivileged many every man therefore in whose instance the greatest happiness principle is at once an object of attachment and a guide to conduct will in proportion to his sympathy for that part of his species whose interest is deteriorated and happiness diminished by this irremediably sinister instrument employ his faculties in the endeavour to suppress it that its unchangeable nature is that of an instrument of corruptive as well as delusive influence in the hands of misrule has been shown above so likewise that it is an instrument of corruptive influence as applied to morals and the private intercourse of society moreover what on this occasion has been shown is—that in the nature of the case every token emblem evidence visible or otherwise perceptible instrument or cause of this factitious and mischievous product of bad government is a false certificate employed for the purpose of obtaining for the possessor a portion of respect which is not only not due but which if paid cannot but be in a preponderant degree mischievous to issue any such instrument is in effect to issue a general order to the several members of the community to be accomplices with the members of the bad government in all the several acts of depredation and oppression which by this and the other incorporeal instruments of misrule they are in the habit of committing in virtue of their respective offices acts whereby to pamper men by units they starve men and consign them to lingering deaths by thousands to make one in the payment of the tribute so demanded is to aid and abet those enemies of the community in the war they never cease to be carrying on against it if this be so on each occasion the fraud which by the voluntary bearing of any one of these titles the possessor is a principal in finds in every one who voluntarily pays the tribute thus called for in the shape of respect either an accomplice or a dupe if he refuses payment an opponent if he pays it being at the same time conscious of the deceptiousness and mischievousness of the demand an accomplice if he pays it for want of being really apprized of this its true nature a dupe in a word the case of him who concurs in the paying of undue tribute in this shape bears a close analogy to the case of him who receives and puts off base and counterfeit money as to the ways and means of counteracting this instrument of corruption they may be distinguished and the aggregate mass of them divided into such as are of a negative and quiescent nature and such as are of a positive and active nature negative the purposed omission or say forbearance to pay in any form the tribute of respect endeavoured to be exacted by the possessor of the symbol or evidence of pretended title positive by substituting to the tribute thus endeavoured to be exacted—the tribute that would be paid by the manifestation of the outward tokens of respect    tokens of the opposite sentiment tokens in a word of disrespect as to these same tokens the present is not a place for the enumeration or exemplification of them in any detail of one single one it may here be not amiss to give an intimation among the most impressive and at the same time perfectly unexceptionable ways and means one is to present to the eyes and ears of every man by whom this unwarranted order for respect is presented the demonstration of the invalidity of his pretensions and this may be by words or other signs in the grave style or in the gay style in prose or verse accompanied or not accompanied with music how annoying soever these demonstrations may be to the delinquent so long as corporeal annoyance is not added to them they will even if they be all of them added together be nothing more than means of selfdefence against systematic and studiously elaborated injury into the treasury of the means of selfdefence no individual so poor but that he may be able to cast his mite it was by the voluntary contribution of passengers a stone from each that those ancient monuments in which social sympathy found its expression in times long since past and which are still visible to the eyes of travellers were raised already the weakening of the force of these instruments of mischief in a perceptible degree is by no means without example it may be seen in france names are not necessary to indicate to the friends of mankind either there or elsewhere those who have given proof of their being so by the manifested aversion with which any salutation expressive of these instruments of deception has been habitually received everywhere the people have been in the habit of suffering to be filched from them tokens of respect in various degrees upon false pretences the remedy is in their own hands it depends upon them to cease the manifestation of these tokens of respect and if necessary to substitute to them tokens of disrespect it is by so many adjudications of the aristocratical section of the publicopinion tribunal that the several portions of respect are conferred above the aristocratical in the scale of power whensoever it thinks fit to exercise its power stands the democratical section of that same tribunal let the judgments of the subordinate section be quashed and overruled by the democratical or superordinate in both tribunals every member is an executive functionary as well as a judge chapter xiv established religion—none no power of government ought to be employed in the endeavour to establish any system or article of belief on the subject of religion if any such power be thus employed it will be in respect of the immediate application made of it to the purpose of producing or confirming belief to the effect in question by furnishing appropriate inducement of the nature of remunerative power or of the nature of punitive power or a conjunction of both in a word power thus employed will be either remunerative or punitive or both the belief thus endeavoured to be inculcated will be either true or false the observation applies to the whole system taken in the aggregate and to each distinguishable article consider in the first place every application that can be made of remunerative power to this purpose let the system be supposed true on this supposition the application of remunerative power is needless say establishment needless but it is only by coercion applied in the way of taxation that the matter of reward whatever it be that is applied to this purpose can be collected such application is therefore burthensome and as such pernicious say establishment pernicious viz by needless and useless burthen imposed in a pecuniary shape let the supposition of the truth be still continued the system say is true as before but by a number more or less considerable it will not be believed to be true and by another number more or less considerable it will be believed to be false for if this were not the case the application made of the matter of reward to this purpose would be needless and thence as above pernicious an effect of the production of which by means of the matter of reward no assurance can by any possibility be obtained is the existence of the act of judgment termed belief to any subject whatsoever but an effect of the production of which the fullest assurance may be obtained is in relation to such belief an allegation of the party affirming the existence of it in his own mind this allegation may with equal ease and safety be made whether it be true or false so far as such allegation if made would be true so far the application thus made of the matter of reward is to the effect in question needless and useless so far as the allegation would if made be false so far the application thus made is an act of subornation applied to the procurement of false and mendacious assertions in a word subornation of falsehood wanting nothing but the ceremony called an oath to be subornation of perjury say establishment pernicious by corruption of morals viz by production of insincerity and mendacity the manner in which belief is thus endeavoured or pretended to be endeavoured to be produced is exactly that in which for the purpose of procuring a judicial decision false witnesses are hired declare what you saw    and whatever it be you will be paid so much this is the way in which witnesses are hired to give true testimony declare that you saw so and so and you shall be paid so much this is the language by which witnesses are hired to give false testimony the language by which the matter of reward is applied to the purpose of producing allegation of belief in the case here in question is exactly the language by which in a judicial case as above false witnesses are hired the matter of reward is capable of being applied to this purpose in either or both of two modes mode the first to each individual in relation to whom it is your desire that the belief in question should be professed offer and give so much money—say one shilling—immediately upon and after his pronouncing or signing a declaration to the effect required call this the direct mode or mode by hiring believers mode the second to certain individuals to the purpose of causing that same belief to be entertained or professed pay at stated periods so much money on their entering into an engagement to use endeavours at times stated or not stated to cause by means of argument others to entertain or profess a belief to the effect required call this the indirect mode or mode by hiring teachers this too is subornation of insincerity and mendacity if the direct mode of procuring profession of belief is bad the indirect mode is much worse in the direct mode the only part of the mental frame vitiated and corrupted is the moral part in this indirect mode the moral part is much more thoroughly vitiated and corrupted and the intellectual part is vitiated likewise in the direct mode the formulary is pronounced or signed and the next moment it has fled out of the mind in the indirect mode the individual hired to teach must if he earns his hire be continually brooding over the falsehood he has committed perpetually engaged in the endeavour to cause others to believe to be true that which he himself does not believe to be true but believes to be false continually occupied in the endeavour to deceive to the character of liar for hire he adds the character of deceiver for hire—or at least would—be deceiver for hire in this case in so far as his consciousness of the falsehood of the belief he advocates extends his case is the same with that of the professional lawyer in the situation of advocate but the advocate is sure for a great part of his professional life to be on the right side on the average about half not so the priest to him it may happen not to have been for any one moment of his professional life on any other than the wrong side this is what by each of two sets of priests priests of the christian religion and priests of the mahometan religion for example is universally and constantly said of the other now as to the intellectual corruption and first as to the teacher of that which in his eyes is falsehood so long as he believes to be false that which he asserts to be true the poison remains in his moral frame and goes no further but what may happen and to a certain extent probably does happen is—that finding this state of mind more or less irksome he uses his endeavours to get out of it that which he believes to be false he endeavours to believe to be true for this purpose there is one and but one course this is on every occasion to call off his attention from all considerations tending to cause the belief in question to be regarded as false and at the same time to apply his attention to all considerations tending to cause it to be believed to be true not omitting to set and keep his invention at work in the search after new ones call this the selfdeceptive process in the here supposed case the system is supposed to be true therefore no vitiation of the intellectual frame is among the consequences of this process but in the meantime in this endeavour to believe to be true that which is believed to be false a habit has been acquired by him by which the intellectual frame is vitiated in its application to all subjects the habit of partiality the habit of wilful blindness the habit from which a man derives a propensity to embrace falsehood and error in preference to truth whatsoever be the subject look again to the westminster hall witness with the straw in his shoe the side on which he has been engaged has happened to be the right side in this there is nothing extraordinary for a fact which in itself is true is not rendered false by the death of a witness who if alive would have proved it the side in favour of which he has given his testimony is the right side but the act by which his moral character has been stained is not the less gross so in the case of the true system in regard to religion is it with the priest who when hired believed it to be false meantime by those by whose power the religion has been thus established or continues to be thus supported a virtual certificate has been given and continues to be given that in their eyes the system thus supported is false the side on which the witness with the straw in his shoe has been hired is the right side but subornation of perjury is not less the act by which the hiring has been performed nor are the actors the less suborners of perjury moreover of such subornation the natural tendency and natural effect is to cause the side though by the supposition the right one to be looked upon in the eyes of those to whom    the fact of the hiring is known as the wrong one in vain would the hirers exclaim—our side is the right one—we know it to be so the answer in every mouth would be—were this allowed the wrong side if it had money enough on its side would in every case be the gainer of no direct assurance given by the hiring individual would the probative force given of his belief be rendered so great as the disprobative force of the circumstantial evidence of unbelief afforded by this hiring by no protestations oral or written public or private in no case in which it is a mans interest that the truth on whatever side it be should be embraced does he take this method for the discovery of it for causing discovery to be made of it and the belief of it when discovered entertained in no case if it really be a mans desire that a true and correct map of a country should be made and purchased does he without having ever seen the country draw a map of his own and say—copy and publish this map you will have so much money make and publish a map of the country from an actual survey of it made by yourself you shall have nothing in vain would any one say—of such importance is the subject in our eyes and such the sad probability that notwithstanding its importance it will unless the course in question be taken be unattended to or unbelief or false belief in relation to it be inculcated and embraced—that to avoid so great an evil it is in our eyes necessary to take this course happiness you yourselves insist upon is at stake happiness not in this life only but in another—the difference between the extreme of felicity and the extreme of misery not of this or that individual only but of all without exception what—and are we then to believe one and all that there are so many individuals to no one of whom is his own happiness so dear to himself as it is to you—his own happiness in this life and in another oh but he will be deceived if the matter be not laid before him in the manner we prescribe no notion on the subject will he entertain or if he does his notions will be erroneous and in such sort erroneous as to be noxious noxious to himself and in an indefinite number to others no notions—what on a subject on which in your own eyes or at least according to your own lips the difference between the extreme of happiness and the extreme of misery in every mans case depends—not only will he himself be indifferent but so will every one else is it then to be supposed that in this case no one will rise up to state to him the peril he is in and with or without pay offer to show him how he may deliver himself from it all this notwithstanding—notwithstanding the proof thus afforded of your own disbelief of that which you inculcate you pay to a set of men under the notion of their inculcating it money in so immense a mass imposing on the whole community poor as well as rich the correspondent burthen of all this vast mass of the matter of wealth you yourselves have the patronage they the immediate use the hope of deriving benefit from such patronage is in vain would you deny it an inducement and that a most powerful one on their part to do your will in all things and give their support to your power under these circumstances can any reasonable man look for the cause of the hire you pay in any other circumstance than the profit which in the shape of power and money you and yours derive from it and not in any belief on your part that that which you so cause to be inculcated is true or useful another proof given to the world that you yourselves believe that it has no truth or usefulness is that it is no object of your care or your endeavour that the benefit of it should be reaped what is the course you take the alleged service of which you would have it thought the benefit is so great is anything effectual done by you to cause it to be performed the connexion between the alleged service and the reward is any care taken to keep it up—the obvious course no service no pay is it in any way applied by you to practice when it is really among your wishes that the alleged service should be performed effectual care on your part is not wanting witness the arrangement in regard to soldiers but in truth in no instance has a system in regard to religion been ever established but for the purpose as well as with the effect of its being made an instrument of intimidation corruption and delusion for the support of depredation and oppression in the hands of governments if it be so clearly contrary to the greatest happiness of the greatest number even in the present life that a system of opinions on the subject of religion admitting it to be true be thus established as clearly is it true in regard to the religion of jesus in particular that the affording such establishment to the religion of jesus is inconsistent with his will as evidenced by his own declarations as well as by his own practice nowhere is he stated to have directed that to the religion delivered by himself any such establishment should be given nowhere either in terms or in substance has he said—give money to those who say they believe in what i have said or give money to those who teach others to believe what i have said nowhere has he said—apply punishment to those who will not say they believe what i have said or to those who say they believe that what i have said is false and yet repugnant to the known will of the then constituted authorities was everything done and said that was done and said by him by argument so irresistible as to carry with it the effect of ridicule he opposed    the sanctity of the sabbath as taught by those same constituted authorities by the sidmouths and the castlereaghs of the time were set on him the olivers and castles by whom he was at length entrapped the corruptive effect of opulence as herein above displayed was neither unperceived by him nor unproclaimed no denunciations more severe than those made by him against those who put their trust in riches wallowers in wealth and luxury greater than any to which he could ever have been witness are now to be seen—men who pretending to be preachers of his doctrine and enjoying their wealth and luxury on that false pretence never cease to say—take from our order any of the wealth it enjoys or may enjoy—set limits to our riches and the religion of jesus is at an end if such be the mischief where the religion is true what must it be where it is false happily the supposition is not necessary chapter xv supreme constitutive section i means of government the powers by the exercise of which government is carried on cannot be exercised by all in the same manner at the same time any such proposition as this that the best government is that in which the powers of government are all of them exercised by all the members of the community at the same time would be a selfcontradictory proposition by it would be asserted the existence of a government and at the same time in the same community the nonexistence of any government the exercise of the powers of government consists in the giving of directions or commands positive and prohibitive and incidentally in securing compliance through the application of rewards and punishments in and by every such exercise is implied a separation of the whole members of the community into two classes namely the governors and the governed—the rulers and those over whom rule is exercised but though consistently with the continued existence of government it is impossible that the separation should as to the two classes themselves be otherwise than perpetual not so is the existence of the same individual in both those classes so it be at different points of time of each class the whole population might migrate into the other those who are governors at one moment may be all of them governed and not governors during the second moment while those who are governed during the first moment may be governors during the second moment in comparison with the governed the governors must in every community be a small number for those by whom the operations of government are carried on cannot during that time be carrying on operations of any other sort the greatest portion of the labouring time of the greatest number must at all times be employed in the securing of the means of subsistence to the whole by whom then and how shall this distinction be made by what cause or causes shall it be determined who at each moment shall be the governor and who the governed the greatesthappiness principle requires that be the governors who they may—be the powers of government exercised by them what they may—it is of the will of the governed that during each moment their existence in that situation should be the result that is to say that after having been placed they should at certain intervals of no great length be displaceable by the governed the governed cannot all of them be exercising the immediate powers of government but at stated times they may all of them exercise the function of declaring who the individuals shall be by whom those same immediate powers shall be exercised the happiness of the governed will at all times it is manifest be in a great degree dependent on the conduct maintained by the governors in the exercise of those powers of government as on every occasion his own greatest happiness is the object or end towards which the exercise of the active faculties of every individual will be directed so will they be on this occasion he will therefore cause those individuals to be in the situation of the governors or ruling few by whose conduct in such their situation his own happiness will according to his judgment be most effectually promoted if there were any other individual or set of individuals by whose conduct the only right and proper end of government were likely to be in a greater degree promoted than by the greatest number as above—such other individual or individuals would be those in whose hands the greatesthappiness principle would require that the exercise of those same powers should be lodged but there are not nor in the nature of man can be any such other individual or set of individuals the powers of government in the hands of any such individuals would be necessarily directed to the giving every possible increase to their own happiness whatever became of the happiness of others and in proportion as their happiness received increase would the aggregate happiness of all the governed be diminished true it is that as in the case of the supposed individuals not chosen by the governed nor by any portion of them so by every individual chosen by them would his own happiness in the same way be endeavoured to be increased whatsoever became of their happiness    but as each such member of the ruling few not only was placed but at a short interval is displaceable by the subject many what he sees from first to last is that any considerable and lasting sacrifice of their happiness to his own is impracticable and that for every attempt to effect it he would be liable to be punished he will not therefore encounter any such risk section ii authorities in a state for embracing at the same time the case in which the supreme power in the state is in the hands of some single person and that in which it is according to any scheme of division divided among persons more than one a collective term is necessary for this purpose the word authority is here employed accordant with this locution is the french phrase les autorités constituées whence in english the constituted authorities the supreme authority in a state is that on the will of which the exercise of all other authorities depends insomuch that if and in so far as by any other authority the will of the supreme authority is contravened the constitution by which the several powers are allotted to the several authorities is violated and what is done is contrary to law between authority and authority dependence is effectual in proportion to the exactness and constancy with which the act of the inferior corresponds with the last expressed will of the superior in the same manner as the action of any individual corresponds with the last formed will of that same individual in this as well as other senses as a synonym to the word authority the word power is commonly employed but transparency is more or less disturbed as often as for designating objects so distinct and different as the person possessing and the thing possessed the same denomination is employed the mode of locating an authority is either simple or composite simple when it is the result of the will of an individual or of the wills of a set of individuals all operating at the same time and with equal effect composite when expression having been given to the will of an individual or set of individuals as above—thereafter for the completion of it expression given to the will of a different individual or set of individuals is necessary thus in regard to certain offices in the official establishment of the united states by the federal constitution the president     shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint     all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for here the mode of location is composite the president says the next paragraph shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate here the mode of location is simple the constitutive is supreme or say superordinate with reference to every other authority it resides in the whole body of active citizens throughout the state the legislative is superordinate with reference to every authority other than the constitutive subordinate to the legislative in the exercise of the legislative function are the several sublegislatures by which that function is exercised in each of the districts in the administrative department the direction of all other functionaries belonging to the same department is in a single hand subordinate are all of them with reference to the supreme constitutive and the supreme legislative in each of them the chief is with reference to all the other functionaries in his own department superordinate and supreme so in the judiciary the supreme executive or operative authority though in all its branches subordinate to the supreme legislative is not subordinate to any of the sublegislatures at the head of the executive is a single functionary the executive chief in his hands is the direction in chief of the whole of the business of the administrative department and with relation to all the several functionaries employed in it he is superordinate at the head of the judiciary is a single functionary—the justice minister with relation to him the executive chief is superordinate but the direction of the business of the justice ministers department is not in the executive chiefs hands section iii sovereignty in whom by the sovereignty is meant the supreme constitutive authority in virtue of which immediately or unimmediately the people exercise as will be seen the locative and eventually the dislocative function in relation to the possessors of all the several other authorities in the state this function the people not only are in the nature of the case capable of exercising but in divers states are in use to exercise as to any other functions legislative administrative or judicial—a state of things in which the people should endeavour to exercise them would if government in name be anarchy in fact all those several functions however they are capable of exercising and with unquestionable advantage do exercise by proxy namely by their agents and subagents in the several departments just mentioned in those states alone in which the sovereignty or a share in it is in the hands of the people or a portion more or less considerable of the people can any such authority as the supreme    constitutive in a distinct set of hands have place in an hereditary monarchy by no choice made by any human being is any succeeding monarch placed in the situation left vacant by a preceding one so neither in any aristocracy unless it is by the surviving members that the vacancies having place in that body are filled up in this case there is indeed a constitutive but not in hands distinct from those in which the other functions of the highest grade are lodged by the term the people is meant the whole number of persons existing in any part of the territory of the state—such as are at the moment of the time in question admitted to act in the capacity of electors the term people though so far from being in its import determinate is on account of its familiarity deemed for the present preferable for prevention of uncertainty reference must be made to the election code where the requisite determinateness is given to it in the year      for toasting the sovereignty of the people at a public dinner the duke of norfolk and the hon charles fox were by george the third struck out of the list of privy councillors if by this toast what was meant to be declared was a matter of fact actually in existence the fact thus declared was enormously wide of the truth if what was meant by the toast was a declaration that in the opinion of those who joined in it that form of government in which the sovereignty is in the people is the most desirable the meaning of it is—that a form purely democratical is the most desirable one why give the sovereign power to the largest possible portion of those whose greatest happiness is the proper and chosen object because in all points or elements of appropriate aptitude taken together be the political community in question what it may this proportion is more apt than any other that can be proposed in competition with it in particular than any single one of that same number or than any number smaller than that same number thus absolutely speaking and as to proportions the greater the difference between this largest number and any smaller the greater is the comparative inaptitude of such smaller number in all points taken together as above considered by itself and without reference to any other this greatest number say for shortness the people cannot on any just grounds be considered as deficient in respect of aggregate appropriate aptitude comparatively deficient will be seen to be any one individual taken from that same number or from among the members of any other political community that is to say any person placed in the situation and invested with the power of a monarch so any comparatively small number of individuals placed in the situation and invested with the power of a sovereign aristocracy so any aggregate of partners in the sovereignty composed of the people as above or their chosen agents a monarch an aristocracy or any two of these authorities in whatsoever proportions the powers were shared between the two or among the three as in the case of any other task so in the case of this the aggregate of relative or say appropriate aptitude will on examination be seen to be composed of four elementary portions and no more to wit moral aptitude cognoscitive aptitude judicative aptitude and active aptitude understand in regard to each of them appropriate relation had to the task or work in hand by cognoscitive aptitude understand that which consists in the possession of appropriate knowledge by judicative aptitude that which consists in the possession of the faculty of judgment in a sufficient degree of perfection cognoscitive and judicative aptitude taken together constitute intellectual aptitude and in so far as they are united in the same person the appellative intellectual aptitude may for shortness be employed instead of employing those same two appellatives add all these elements each in adequate degrees together and the aggregate of appropriate aptitude will be obtained let any one of them be wanting it will not be obtained and appropriate moral aptitude it will be seen is that element by the absence of which the greatest gap in the adequate complement of appropriate aptitude will be constituted with relation to this task or say—function by appropriate moral aptitude understand the being in an adequate degree actuated and guided by the desire of securing to the greatest number in question at all times the greatest quantity or say the maximum of happiness where there is adequate power as there is here by the supposition correspondent to desires will be endeavours desiring their own greatest happiness the persons in question will in the exercise of the power thus possessed by them endeavour in so far as they know how i e are possessed of appropriate intellectual aptitude—at the securing to themselves and those who are dear to them the maximum of happiness by sovereign power understand the power of locating those functionaries by whom the functions belonging to the legislative authority shall be exercised coupled with the power of dislocation exercisible—not only in relation to the persons so located but also in relation to all those by them located to wit whether    immediately or through a chain of any length composed of intermediate locators as to the power of location why notwithstanding in this case desires and endeavours will of course be exactly the same—why with a few exceptions that will be mentioned it cannot with advantage go lower in the official scale will be shown in the proper place in the exercise of political power whatsoever is done by the possessors of the supreme power must be done through agents for as to actual governing for this it is admitted the people are essentially unapt and on this inaptitude proceeds the proposition that for the exercise of the operative functions of government in the highest degree they should choose agents who will naturally be some among themselves on the part of these possessors of the supreme power moral aptitude can of itself avail little except in so far as it contributes to the choice of morally apt agents here the aptitude of the people will be seen to be at a maximum not only does the moral aptitude of the people dispose them to look out for and choose morally apt agents but it disposes all men who are or who wish to be such agents to become morally apt the only interest of his which an elector can expect to serve by the choice of an agent for this purpose is that which he has in common with all the rest the only way in which in quality of agent for this purpose a man can expect to recommend himself to the good opinion and choice of the people in their quality of electors is by appearing disposed to serve to his utmost this practically universal interest and the only sure way of appearing disposed to serve it is to be actually conspicuous in his endeavours to serve it some among them there cannot but be whose aptitude in this shape is in comparison with that of the rest at the highest point of the scale by these men such their aptitude if it has not already been displayed will of course on this occasion be endeavoured to be displayed of their pretensions he who in his own eyes is a competent judge will form his judgment and vote accordingly he who in his own eyes is not a competent judge will ask for information and advice of some one or more who in his eyes are competent judges and so on in such their choice of advisers some will be more fortunate others less fortunate but if in respect of the majority of agents so elected they are not fortunate the cause of the failure lies in the nature of the case by no other course could a better chance for being fortunate have been obtained the same inquiry which leads them to the obtainment of appropriate moral leads them to the obtainment of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude in their agents they find men qualified at the same time with inclination and accordant intellectual power suited to the purpose of obtaining for them in the aggregate the maximum of happiness in favour of this theory all experience testifies the evidence is of so bulky a nature that room cannot in such a work as this be found negative proof will be found to concur with positive in the case of no people by whom agents for this purpose have been freely chosen will any reason be found for the belief that agents in any considerable degree more apt in this particular than those actually chosen could have been had meantime the uninterrupted and most notorious experience of the united states may be appealed to as rendering superfluous all other proofs section iv constitutive—why in the people by instituting the power of locating and eventually dislocating and applying it to all official situations and placing the whole of it in the hands of the people a pure representative democracy is instituted and this form of government and this alone as has been already shown can have the greatest happiness of the greatest number for its effect for the exercise of those two connected functions namely the locative and the dislocative in relation to all the several other functions by the exercise of which government is carried on the people are naturally endowed with the requisite degree of appropriate aptitude absolute and comparative absolute with reference to the end in view simply namely the production of the greatest happiness of the greatest number comparative with reference to every imaginable authority that is to say person or set of persons in whose hands it is possible to lodge those several functions by what considerations can it be made to appear that the people as above absolutely considered possess the requisite degree of appropriate aptitude for the exercise of those same functions by general reason and by particular experience what in this case is to be understood by general reason considerations deduced from the nature of man as exemplified in the feelings interests affections passions motives inducements propensities and actions common to all individuals in all situations by particular experience understand in private situations in the case of persons taken separately and in political situations in the case of persons collectively taken with respect to particular experience in private situations look to the situation of a person having need of an agent for the management of certain of his affairs namely any affairs be they what they may which his time or his faculties of all kinds natural and acquired    do not in his judgment admit of his managing in his own person in a manner equally beneficial to himself certain classes excepted a position which every person will be ready to accede to upon the very first mention of it is—that every person possesses appropriate aptitude with reference to the choice of his own agent or agents or say his own trustee or trustees for the management of all such affairs as it suits him to consign over to the management of any other person or persons it being therefore undenied and undeniable that for the management of affairs peculiar to himself every man is thus apt to choose his agent it will therefore rest with gainsayers to show what if any the circumstances are by which it is that a person stands precluded from taking his part in the choice of persons to be employed in the management of those affairs which are his as well as those of all the other members of the community in question whatever it be in this case be it as it may in regard to absolute aptitude there will be among all men but one voice in regard to comparative aptitude and it is comparative aptitude that is here in question to positions such as the following no man is there who will show any disposition to embrace every mans affairs will be better managed by agents not chosen or removeable by himself than by agents chosen and removeable by himself or generally speaking a mans affairs will not be so well managed by agents chosen and removeable by himself as by agents chosen by other persons who are strangers to him and those agents not removeable by himself a slave is one for the conduct of whose affairs an agent in the choice of whom he has no part is employed and what is the consequence let the annals of slavery—let the state of the slaves in those governments in which it is established—declare that which a slaveholding proprietor is with relation to those whom he calls his slaves an absolute monarch is in relation to those whom he calls his subjects in the one case as in the other in the exercise given to their power more or less of harshness or of mildness may be manifested habitually or casually by different masters in different countries or in the same country but in the two cases the power claimed is the same if there be a difference it is in the disfavour of the slaves of the monarch for in the case of the slaves who are styled slaves there is almost universally something or other in the state of the laws by which a restraint is imposed upon the faculty of putting the slaves to death whereas in the case of the master whose slaves are styled subjects there is no such restraint putting them to death in case of displeasure is not only practised but avowed as to political experience look at the situation occupied by the people in states in which the form of government is a pure representative democracy for example the american united states united together in respect of certain functions and arrangements of government if it be denied that the people possess appropriate moral aptitude in a comparative sense it must be assumed that with reference to the end in view there exist some person or persons by whom it is possessed in a degree superior to that in which it is possessed by the people such other person or persons will either be persons belonging to some foreign state or persons belonging to the state here in question suppose it a single person and he belonging not to the state in question but to a foreign state thence if so it be that in comparison with him the people do not possess the branch of appropriate aptitude the case will be that in the breast of this foreigner—say of this foreign monarch—the desire of seeing produced the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the people in the state in question is greater than in the breasts of those same people themselves and so in the case of the one or the few belonging in both cases to the state in question hence we have three positions differing little from one another in absurdity   a foreign monarch will as such have a stronger desire to see the greatest number of the people of this state possessed of the maximum of happiness than they themselves will have   a native monarch will as such have a stronger desire to see the greatest number of the people possessed of the maximum of happiness than they themselves will have   a set of men more or less numerous constituting an aristocratic body small at any rate in comparison with the greatest number of the people will have a stronger desire to see the people possessed of the maximum of happiness than they themselves will have as to intellectual aptitude if it be admitted on the part of the people individually and separately taken in the case where an agent is to be chosen for the management of this or that portion of the affairs of each that there will be no deficiency absolute or comparative of appropriate aptitude in this shape in so much as that the aptitude of the choice made would not be likely to be increased by lodging the power of making it in any other hands—it will appear that in the case of a choice to be made by each for the affairs common to all the deficiency so far from being greater is not likely to be so great whatever deficiency would have had place on the part of the people themselves for the affairs of government will thus be supplied by their elected agents in the legislature  00 in respect of the aggregate of appropriate aptitude on the part of the people and their agents it will by the effect of and in proportion to time and experience be continually on the increase for in them moral aptitude is always at a maximum and by time and experience intellectual and active aptitude will except so far as repressed by misrule be in all men in a state of increase for the same reasons aggregate aptitude will in the monarch and his agents in proportion to time and experience be either at a stand or on the decrease for in him the inaptitude opposite to appropriate moral aptitude being always consummate any increase that takes place in intellectual aptitude will be employed in the endeavour to give increase to his own happiness to the diminution of that of the people so in the case of an aristocracy in a monarchy the desire of making the sinister sacrifice is accompanied by adequate power in the hands of the monarch but in the instance of each individual in any community though the same sinister desire has place the power has no place to this purpose the incorporeal instruments requisite are wanting and these being wanting the corporeal instruments are so too in his endeavours to secure himself against depredation and oppression each man finds all others in general disposed to become cooperators and supporters for against depredation and oppression to his own prejudice no man can find any means of security but such as cannot but afford the like security to other individuals in general accordingly in this case the power being added to the desire the corresponding good effect has place but in any endeavours he might use to exercise depredation and oppression at the expense of others in large multitudes no man who not having the incorporeal instruments has not at his command the corporeal ones will find cooperators and supporters in number and form adequate to the purpose accordingly in this case the power not being added to the desire the corresponding evil effect does not take place though in all men these same propensities must be acknowledged to have place and in all men the correspondent desires have place accordingly—and upon occasion to a greater or less extent they become productive of correspondent acts—yet the difference between the strength of the desire in the one situation and the strength of the desire in the other situation is prodigious in the case of those desires which have for their object corporeal gratification or exemption from corporeal suffering the force of the desire is not taken away by the absence of hope or say by the absence of the expectation of the power of gratifying them witness the desires of hunger and thirst but in the case of those desires which have for their object any such complex good as is denoted by the appellations power or money in the quantities attached to political situations the absence of the corresponding expectation is capable of keeping the desire in a state in which it is altogether void of efficiency and even to the individual himself for want of attention to what passes in his own mind imperceptible thus it is that the existence not only of gratification but even of desire itself may depend upon a union with power in the angloamerican united states buonaparte might have been a washington in france washington might have been no more than a buonaparte in the breast of washington—he being a man—it cannot have been but that the desire of depredation or oppression or both to be exercised on the large scale must at times have had place and been more or less troublesome why because the power of affording gratification to a greater or less extent to such desire could not have been wholly unaccompanied by hope but of by far the greater number of those by whose suffrages washington was located in the situation which give him the power of being what he became take any one at random no probability of his having ever been actuated or even troubled by any such desire will be found in his instance why because in his breast there cannot have been any hope of gratifying it in a representative democracy take any one member of the community acting in the exercise of the supreme constitutive power his desire is to afford to himself security against depredation and oppression such being his ultimate desire his intermediate desire is—to see located in the situation of his representative a man who desire and power in all shapes included appears to him likely to contribute in a degree more than any other man would to his possession of that same security such is his desire and such accordingly is his act—the act by which he gives his vote for the gratification of any sinister desire at the expense of the universal interest he cannot hope to find cooperation and support from any considerable number of his followcitizens by colonel burr who had been vicepresident and if he was to be believed had the option of being president the representative democracy of the united states was to have been improved into an absolute monarchy absolute monarch colonel burr improved yes but how by free votes by the free votes of those by whom he had been freely made vicepresident oh no in how great a degree soever conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number by any such means the change was hopeless even in that breast in which the desire was strongest and as the subsequent endeavour proved not altogether without hope oh no to the throne of the angloamerican united states the road he had pitched upon passed through the throne of mexico in his view mexicans were sheep his own countrymen lions first he was to have been emperor of mexico on the back of these  0  sheep he was to have been brought home to subdue and tame the lions section v constitutire—why not in one next as to the hands in which by the institution of a supreme constitutive authority in the hands of the many the power in question is saved from being placed these are those of a monarch seated otherwise than by location by other hands and those of an aristocracy seated otherwise than by location by other hands these two authorities agree in this—that not being located by other hands neither are they dislocable by other hands and being actuated in common with all mankind by the principle of selfpreference they pursue their own particular and sinister interest at the expense and by the sacrifice of the interest of the subject many without any restraint in the condition of a subject in the breast of every individual the selfpreferring principle feels restraint imposed upon it in its endeavours to effect the sinister sacrifice not only by legal but by moral obligation not only by the power of the law but by the power of the publicopinion tribunal but in the situation of monarch the single ruling functionary feels himself exempt from the tutelary control not only of the political sanction but from the control of the popular or moral sanction having for its judicial executive the publicopinion tribunal from that of the political sanction altogether in virtue of the irresponsible situation in which he is placed by law from the publicopinion tribunal in great measure by means of the influence which his situation gives him on the judgments pronounced by that unofficial judicatory at first blush unwise would the proposition be apt to appear which should propose that the successor of the monarch for the time being should be determined by pure chance by chance without any determinate political situation by which the range of its dominion would be limited take for example the mode of election that in this case would be prescribed by the principle of equality a lottery in which the crown shall be the prize and in which every member of the community shall have a ticket but in comparison with chance and education which has everywhere determined the order of succession in a monarchy absolute chance acting through the medium of a lottery so far from a comparatively inefficient course would be an eminently and incontestably beneficial and wise one understand by education those qualities which are the result of those circumstances in which in respect to power money factitious dignity habitual desires habitual means employed in gratifying them and associates of all classes a mans political situation has placed him in all this what belongs to nature is the result of chance in the case of the lottery the majority of the tickets being in the hands of the majority of the inhabitants and all sinister influence being excluded by the supposition the odds would be in favour of an individual belonging to the lower that is to say the more numerous order an individual whose interest down to the moment of the drawing had always been and thence his affections in alliance with and in favour of that of the greatest number by his elevation his mind would there can be no doubt he in a greater or less degree deteriorated in the moral branch on which the other branches depend for their usefulness but at the worst it would not be to any such degree deteriorated as to reduce him in the scale of appropriate aptitude to a level with the man by whom in the other case the situation is occupied sympathy of affection—that sympathy which corresponds with moral aptitude would in a greater or less degree be extinguished but that branch of aptitude which could not be extinguished is the sympathy of conception if to whatsoever degree the feelings of those whose condition is similar to what his own had been come to be the objects of his neglect no part of the neglect could in this case as in that have been produced from the want of knowing what on each occasion those feelings are if there be any person by whom it can be seriously contended that for the locating—the choice of agents by whom the business of government shall be conducted the hand of the monarch is fitter than that of the people it must be on one or other of these grounds   that the happiness or unhappiness of the people has on this occasion no title to regard for that the question receives an unanswerable decision by the observation that the title of the monarch to make such choice is the only legitimate one provided that the race to which he belongs has for a certain length of time been in possession of the throne   that the happiness and unhappiness of the people has indeed a title to regard—a title perhaps to as great regard as the happiness and unhappiness of the monarch himself but that on their part so consummate is the want of appropriate intellectual aptitude on his part so consummate the abundance of it—and at the same time so intimate is the connexion between their happiness and his that by leaving the choice exclusively to him more effectual provision will be made for their happiness than if the choice of the agents for this part of their business were altogether in themselves the first of these is so flagrantly and palpably absurd that it baffles all the power of intellect to make answer to it in fact it has nothing to do with intellect all that it denotes is a mere expression of will and nothing else and for giving expression to it as well  0  might any other word as the word legitimacy be employed with respect to the second altogether groundless and untenable is the notion of any such unity of interests between individual and individual in a democracy everywhere yes between monarch and subjects in a monarchy nowhere instead of unity repugnancy between every animal of prey on the one part and the animals preyed upon on the other a certain community of interests has place it is the interest of the wolf that the sheep should be fat and abundant and that pasture to render them so should abound at all times it is the interest of the commander of an invading army that not only subsistence but abundance should have place in the greatest possible quantity wherever he makes his inroads it is the interest of all pirates that wealth should be abundant in all seas and on all coasts to which their piracies are to be directed it is the interest of all highwaymen not only that travellers should be numerous but that their purses should be welllined exactly of the same sort is the interest which the monarch has in common with his subjects take for example the case of ireland of every the most indigent daylabourer it is the wish that of the matter of subsistence and abundance the aggregate of the quantity in the whole country may be at its maximum and to this wish there is no conditional or restrictive clause for that by any addition to the aggregate any diminution should be effected in his share is a result which true or false is not of a nature to find its way into his conception this same wish has place in the breasts of the body composed of the ruling one and influential few but here comes in a sort of proviso or restrictive clause provided my share of the produce of the taxes be not diminished by it says the taxfed placeman provided my tithes be not diminished by it says in like manner the tithefed priest provided our fees be not diminished by it say the feefed judge and advocate but abundance cannot be increased unless the taxes be diminished the tithes for which no service is rendered abolished and the services of the judge and those of the advocate placed within the reach of all who need them but to the doing of this what would be necessary is that after the extinction of the existing set of extortioners in all these several shapes extortion in these shapes should cease this however is what the extortioners even though the benefit of their own extortions were preserved to them would not endure to think of for of whatsoever sympathy they have every particle is engrossed by the comparatively few persons in the same condition in life as themselves antipathy not sympathy is the sentiment with which the whole class of those by whose labours they are pampered is regarded thus it is that in support of depredation oppression in all its shapes will in that country keep on its course until that suffering or the fear of it which when inflicted on those who suffer by irremediable injury would be called justice overtakes the authors and those who in that country now tyrannise in the name of christ share the fate now experiencing by some of those who tyrannise in the name of mahomet whatsoever be the difficulties which stand in the way of a good choice in the situation of elector in a democracy inconsiderable will they thus be in comparison with those that stand in the way of a good choice in the case of a monarch for preestimating the qualities absolute and comparative of each candidate the monarch will have no other guide than the whispers of a number of dependants all of them interested in deceiving him all of them constantly occupied in the endeavour so to do all of them in intention deceivers—all of them even in profession flatterers for the exercise of this same function how much more advantageous is the situation of an elector in a democracy into no company can he enter without seeing those who in relation to this subject are ready to communicate to him whatever they know have seen or heard or think the annals of the year the diaries of the day the pictures of all public functionaries and of all those who aspire to be so find a place on his table in company with his daily bread for nothing of all this has the monarch any time his time is engrossed by the gratification of sensual appetites and by the receipt of homage and flattery in all its forms objection in many countries for want of a publicopinion tribunal the people would not be ripe for receiving a representative democratical constitution they would be incapable of playing their part in it in such a state of things a mixed monarchy with or without two chambers is the only resource for training them of every dissension an appeal more or less explicit to the people would be among the results answer how small soever were the chance of success in the case of a democracy in such a state of things as the above it would be much less so under any mixed monarchy howsoever might the monarch and his coadjutors disagree one with another much sooner would they come to an agreement for a division of the power i e for the carrying on the business in a close partnership as in england—than consent to part with or suffer the least particle of power to be any longer than they could not help it in the hands of the people every body of men is governed altogether by its conception of what is its interest in the narrowest and most selfish sense of the word interest never by any regard for the interest of the people in that position none of those inducements any one of which may suffice to  0  cause a single man to make sacrifice of his private interest to the universal interest can have place viz desire of reputation pleasure of sympathy for the people pleasure of power in respect of the secret consciousness of having had so large a share in contributing to the happiness of the people yes perhaps for a moment under an excitation produced by a fine speech but for anything of a continuance never is any body of men determined by any other consideration than its conception of what is in the highest degree beneficial to its purely selfregarding interests in a monarchy be the conduct of the ruler ever so mischievous the difficulty of dislocating him is prodigious and scarcely ever can any change be effected without either a homicide or a war—which is an aggregate of homicides by hundreds and thousands whereas in a representative democracy the rulers may be and continually are all of them together though it be merely in the way of precaution and without evil actually experienced at their hands dislocated with as much facility as a servant is by his master in domestic life section vi dislocative function—why universal why give to the dislocative power an extent thus allcomprehensive because no extent less than this would suffice to prevent the constitution from being gradually changed into one of that sort which has for its object the promotion of the sinister interest of the ruling few and thence into one of that sort which has for its object the promotion of the sinister interest of the ruling one unless this power be instituted a transformation of this sort sooner or later is matter of certainty and even supposing it instituted the efficiency of it is not so complete as to exclude the need of adding to this security whatsoever others the nature of the case affords the sinister force against the effect of which this power is a necessary preservative is that of corruption or say anticonstitutional corruption anticonstitutional corruption is that which has place in so far as by the operation of a benefit to himself received or expected a functionary who as such is an agent and trustee for the people at large is made to violate such his trust unless this power be instituted the deputies of the people invested as such with the supreme legislative or operative power will sooner or later in a number sufficient for producing the sinister effect be sure to violate their trust and that in such sort and degree as to give commencement and continuance to an allcomprehensive system of extortion dissipation and oppression until by the continually augmenting sacrifice of the universal interest to that of the ruling few in respect of money and power the constitution is made to undergo one or other of the above two changes as to the dissipation so far as it has place not being attended with profit to the author it will be the work of negligence or incapacity rather than design of negative rather than positive agency not being attended with profit to the author the amount of it is not likely to approach in magnitude that which is the work of design on the present occasion it may therefore be dismissed without further consideration as to the extortion the mode in which it is made to increase is this the legislative power is in one set of hands the administrative in another to the legislative it belongs to distribute the aggregate business of the rest of government into a certain number of departments to determine the offices or say the official situations belonging to the several departments and the functions to be performed for the commonwealth in virtue of those same offices to exact the performance of these services at the hands of persons unwilling would in general neither be consistent with equality in respect of burthens as between individual and individual nor with policy in respect of appropriate aptitude on the part of the individuals in question with reference to the performance of the service in question in each case to procure acceptance of the office in question at the hands of apt individuals it will therefore be necessary to attach in addition to the power attached to it emolument of the pecuniary kind to an amount more or less considerable the fictitious entity termed an office is also styled a place the person on whom the obligation of performing the functions allotted to it is imposed is said to be in the office or the place the business performed by the exercise of these several functions being when taken in the aggregate a course of action directed to one common end namely the giving execution and effect to the will of the supreme legislative—it is material that unless for special cause of exception the determining by what persons respectively they should al be filled be lodged in the same hand here then lodged in this one hand and at the disposal of this one hand is this vast mass or stock of the instruments of felicity composed of money in various shapes and power in various shapes—with or without factitious dignity in various shapes for although that offspring of the fancy is neither necessary nor conducive to good government it has almost everywhere by the concurrent influence of various causes been added to the stock of the instruments of government patronage is the name given to  0  the power of disposing of the several elementary masses of which this aggregate mass is composed to create the power attached to the several offices and by its ordinances to provide the money employed in engaging mens acceptance of them belongs then to the supreme legislative the individual to whom the patronage of the various offices belongs has an interest in seeing the number of places at his disposal as well as the emolument attached to them increased as much as possible on the other hand to make any increase is not in his own power it is in the legislative authority and in that alone that the power of giving any such increase is reposed thus in relation to this same universally coveted matter are two authorities one of them having what there is of it at its disposal but not of itself able to make addition to it the other able to give increase to it and that to an unlimited amount but at the same time of itself not able to get for its own use so much as a single particle of it here then is a pair of mutually relative situations a certain profit which by the assistance of the other each can make without the assistance of the other neither between those in the one situation and those in the other the intercourse is continual to put them on both sides in possession of what cannot fail to be a constant object of their desire nothing more is necessary than a mutual understanding an agreement which to effect its every purpose need not so much as be expressed to the imagination of men on both sides an obvious contract pregnant with mutual advantage presents itself a tacit contract which if expressed in words would stand as follows—you says the head of the administration with his colleagues if he has any and if not with his most confidential subordinates—you give increase as far as you see convenient to the aggregate value of the good things we have at present and at any rate preserve it from decrease we on our part will from time to time and at all times let you into a share of them to the reader for conveying to his mind the idea of a contract to this effect some determinate set of words were necessary but to the production of a correspondent course of conduct on both sides no words at all would be necessary take for example the state of things under any constitutional code on the one part stands a supreme legislature composed of deputies located by the people on the other part a supreme administrative authority in the hands of a single functionary the course of government under the constitution commences by the majority of the legislature an administrative chief is elected his first business is to fill the several situations under him—all of them to a degree more or less considerable beneficial to the possessors or they would not give their acceptance whether it be without or notwithstanding opposition that he has been elected to be administrative chief it can be no secret who those individuals are who have been of the number of his benefactors as little is it likely to be a secret to him what are the connexions nearest and dearest to each thus at the very commencement of his administration the most obvious policy would join with gratitude in pointing out for the objects of his choice unless in case of some very decided and peremptory objection such persons as he sees reason to think it would be agreeable to his and their respective patrons to see thus provided for—the deputies themselves if the law admitted of it but the law not being stupid or corrupt enough to affect to expect that the same man will be at two different places occupied with two different businesses at the same time no such abomination does the law admit of given to a connexion of his money or moneys worth may be of the same value to a man as if given to himself and therefore have effect to the same amount in respect to the creation of corruptive dependence the effect will be exactly the same if by a benefit thus received by his connexion at the public expense he is relieved from the burthen of conferring a benefit to that same amount at his own expense pecuniary amount being the same in both cases a more effectually corruptive dependence may be created by the fear of losing a beneficial situation already in possession than by the hope of gaining one by the hope of receiving benefits in the shape of official situations through the medium of his connexions corruptive dependence may be made any number of times stronger than by the hope of benefit in the shape of office receivable by himself for to the number of offices possessible at the same time by himself there are limits whereas to the number of offices possessible at the same time by a mans connexions there are no limits by a benefit already received and without hope of any other obsequiousness as effectually corrupt may be created as by corruptive hope the sinistrously directed force of the publicopinion tribunal is in this case the power by which the corruptive obsequiousness is produced ingratitude and perfidy are in that case the words of condemnation by which the punitive power of that tribunal is applied to the thus created offence ingratitude in not making a correspondent return for the benefit received perfidy in the violation of a contract which though not expressed in words was not less clearly expressed by other signs in this case as in some others the direction given to the force of the publicopinion tribunal is exposed to two opposite impulses a right and proper impulse and a sinister impulse of the two the number of individuals  0  whose judgment is determined by the sinister impulse is in the present state of society incomparably greater than the number of those whose judgment is determined by the right and proper impulse for the occasions on which the exercise of the virtues of gratitude and fidelity to engagements and abstinence from the opposite vices of ingratitude and perfidy are called for—are happening to every individual every moment of his life whereas on the other hand of the occasions on which any man is called upon to exercise the virtue of incorruptibility as against the corruptive influence of the possessors of the supreme power in the state the number is limited and in comparison extremely small and moreover the number of persons to whom these occasions happen is also small in comparison with that of all the members of the political community whatever it be thus is corruption planted in the very vitals of the constitution and by the hand which is striving with its utmost force to preserve the constitution from the baleful effects of that disease as to prohibition and punishment by no such instruments can any remedy in any the smallest degree efficient be applied to the representatives themselves you may indeed prevent the good things in question from being given but in the instance of any one of them can you prevent these good things in any number from being given to persons connected with him in any number unless from himself how is it possible for you to know who are and who are not dear to him the law with the help of his pedigree if he has one will show who in the several degrees of consanguinity and affinity are near to him but neither of them will show you who in any degree are dear to him consanguinity though so obviously fallacious suppose it for argument sake unfallacious and sufficiently conclusive evidence on this account shall it be placed in the power of a set of electors by electing a man to a seat and the individual elected by accepting it to strike the whole of his kindred with the political incapacity in question you cannot punish a man for entertaining expectations you cannot punish another man for gratifying or for raising expectations you cannot punish a man for doing kind offices—for conferring benefits you cannot punish one man because benefits in any shape have been conferred on another you cannot by any punishment inflicted or threatened to be inflicted on one man prevent or undertake to prevent another man from receiving benefit in any shape contract having for its object the rendering of sinister service you may prohibit in all cases and in here and there an instance by means of accident or by means of treachery you may actually inflict punishment for it but though you were to inflict the punishment in every case in which the prohibition is infringed and the offence committed you would be no nearer the mark—if prevention of corruption was your mark—than if no such prohibition had been issued why because without any such contract corruption as effectual and as great in extent as by means of contract may have and will be sure to have place if this be so and if to every eye that will turn to it this be visible everybody will know what to think of laws enacted or proposed for the prevention of contract in such cases or for the exclusion of the practice of holding offices by men having seats in the legislative body—if such laws are said to be designed as a means of preventing corruption the proposers and eulogists of such laws have for their real object the producing on the part of the people both or either of two persuasions one is that the public men in question have sincerely at heart the diminution and if it were possible the extinction of the evil the other is that the applying to its evil effects such limitation as shall prevent the fruits of it viz depredation oppression and dissipation from coming to maturity is not by any means possible in both or either of these persuasions is seen a source of satisfaction and acquiescence on the part of the people the impossibility of putting exclusion on the evil they will refer to the will of the almighty the exertions fruitless as they are of the public men in question they will ascribe to the excellence of the individuals and the excellence of the constitution of the peoples thus looking for a remedy to the authors sure supporters of because constant profiters by the disease what is the consequence that so long as they do so so long do they forbear to lend an ear to the surely efficacious and only possible efficacious remedy—the changing the government from a form in which such corruption is certain constant and universal to the one only form in which the exclusion of corruption is certain the existence of it in a practical sense impossible not that even without this remedy distributed as hereby are the powers of government and effective as is the power given to the people at large under the name of the supreme constitutive could any considerable evil be produced otherwise than as above by sinister confederacy between the leaders of the legislature and the executive chief by this means conjoined with the like power given to the legislature all dangerous tendency is taken away from the power given to the executive chief to dislocate all functionaries whatsoever belonging to the administrative without this power exerciseable with relation to such his subordinates the executive chief could not possess sufficiently assured means of giving execution and effect to the will of the constitutive as indicated by the ordinances of the legislative without this power exerciseable  0  with relation to and over the executive chief the supreme legislative could not stand assured of giving execution and effect to its own ordinances and arrangements made in pursuance of its endeavours to give execution and effect to the will of the supreme constitutive and thence increase to the greatest felicity of the greatest number by keeping out of the hands of the constitutive all locative power with relation to any office that of member of the legislature excepted all danger of abuse from the allcomprehensiveness of the dislocation is obviated unless accompanied and followed by the exercise of the power of location with relation to the office no question no sinister interest could any partyleader have in bringing about an exercise of the dislocative power with relation to that same office for by dislocating an individual where could be his profit not having the power of putting either himself or any confederate or dependant of his in his place the power thus given to the supreme constitutive the power of thus dislocating all its agents without exception is nothing more than what in private life in relation to the private affairs of each particular individual is given to that same individual and in this latter case so far from all objection is this power that not to give it would be regarded as one of the grossest of all absurdities should it be said that in the case of this vast aggregate the exercise of the power is liable to have caprice or passion or thoughtlessness for its cause better reason on all these several grounds might be given for the refusing it to each individual with relation to his own particular affairs for in the case of the vast body how great would be the public discussion consequently what an intensity and continuity of attention that would be necessary to the production of the effect in question while in the case of the individual it may be the work of a single thoughtless moment in vain would it be to say in this state of things the wisest and most virtuous of men might be turned out by a mob violence and disorder being their means of operating signing a petition is not the work of a mob is not the work of violence as little is the silent and secret delivery of a vote where the exercise of locative power in the same hands follows not upon that of the dislocative no adequate inducement has place except the persuasion of the existence of the functionarys inaptitude suppose the functionary on whom the power is exercised be a member of the legislature the exercise of it on a particular occasion would be nothing more than an accelerated anticipation of that exercise which at the end of the year would take place of course if the functionary or functionaries were any other than the members of the legislature the exercise could not take place but on the supposition of a neglect or connivance on the part of the legislature it would betoken a want of confidence in the legislature as a body and the members would naturally be on the watch and take measures for saving themselves from the expression of such want of confidence in regard to the exercise of the power of the supreme constitutive either in the dislocation or the punition of its supposed offending agents what is desirable is that the actual application of it be as rare as possible and at the same time in the breasts of those same agents the expectation of its eventual application as strong as possible the first thing to be desired is that on the part of those same agents no such act of transgression be ever committed to this end what is desirable is that in the event of any such transgression the probability of such dislocation and punition should in the eyes of the several members of the legislature at all times be as great as possible to the accomplishment of all these several desirable purposes are the several subsidiary arrangements here provided directed namely the legislators inaugural declaration and those by which the quantity of appropriate information with which the members of the publicopinion tribunal are supplied and the frequency and intensity of the attention respectively bestowed upon that same information are all endeavoured to be maximized thus then in regard to the power here reserved to the people exerciseable over all their servants and at all times these things may be noted   the exercise of it if ever is very rarely likely to take place   the possession of it is not the less likely to be effectual   in no shape is evil likely to result from the exercise of it   by no other means could the effects aimed at be so surely if at all produced section vii means of execution in the case of a representative democracy the means and the only means by which this form of government may be rendered conducive in the highest degree to the only legitimate end of government are no less obvious and natural than they are simple order matters so that the persons by whom the immediately acting powers of government are exercised shall at stated times and at short intervals be removeable all of them without exception by the persons possessed of the original and originative powers of government trustees by principals ruling few by subject many i say subject many for by the exercise of the right or power of election with reference to those by whom the powers of government are exercised subjection is not excluded—no nor under this form of government even by the exercise or possession of those powers themselves misrule is the thing to be as far as may be  0  excluded by the very nature of man misrule as far as any balance on the side of advantage to the ruler is expected by him is necessitated by the assurance of eventual removal—by this and not without this that expectation of advantage may be excluded in election at stated times the effect of the power of appointment and that of the power of removal is included if having at the time immediately preceding the day of election occupied the situation in question a man is reelected the power of appointment is exercised in his favour the power of removal with relation to him is forborne to be exercised if he be not reelected the power of removal with reference to him is exercised the power of appointment with relation to him is forborne to be exercised this indirect and as it were covert mode of removal is much more efficient and salutary than that direct mode which would be the most apt to be presented by this appellation to the person over whom the power is exercised it is much less harsh and galling on the part of the person by whom it is exercised the exercise of it will therefore naturally experience much less reluctance in the case of the direct mode if there be any other candidate the inaptitude the opinion of which is expressed by the forbearance to elect the person in question is not positive and absolute it is only comparative the opinion that it declares is—not that the person thus set aside is less apt than an average man—not that he is positively unapt only that he is less apt than the person for whom the vote is given now as regards the mode of election of the agents of the people universality secrecy equality and annuality of suffrage—is an expression preferable to that of universal suffrage annual elections and vote by ballot why by the advocates for radical reform the phrase as yet most commonly employed for characterizing the system which they advocate is—universal suffrage annual parliaments and vote by ballot compared with universality secrecy equality and annuality of suffrage the following are the imperfections under which that hitherto most commonly used expression seems to labour in the first place of a very material feature of the system no mention is thus made a feature of the importance of which no person by whom the three others are advocated fails it is believed of being fully sensible to regard it as being immaterial would be to regard the arrangement by which in the case of old sarum the appointment to a seat in the house of commons was given to a single individual in the character of an elector and the arrangement by which the appointment to no more than two seats were given as in the case of yorkshire to a population of probably not less than a million of individuals—as being both of them unexceptionable in the next place to the expression the import of which is understood by every individual without exception viz the word secrecy is substituted the words—by ballot an expression to which no very determinate idea is attached in the mind of any man nor except by means of the word secrecy any idea whatsoever in the third place of the four features that are indispensably necessary the three which without the fourth are thus presented are presented without any common bond of connexion they are presented by three separate forms of expression between which no intimation of any connexion is conveyed whereas by the phrase universality secrecy equality and annuality of suffrage the connexion which has place between the things themselves is at once concisely and significantly expressed i universality if a man who calls for the right of suffrage to be given to any one human being calls for its being refused to any other human being it lies upon him to give a particular reason for such refusal for the refusal of it to persons of both sexes under age two plain reasons can be given first that a person who is not yet competent to the management of his own affairs cannot have much reason to complain of being debarred from interfering in the management of the affairs of others and second that the exclusion thus put on the ground of age is not like the exclusion put upon the ground of sex perpetual but temporary only and upon the arrival of the person at the age at which he is generally regarded as competent to the management of his own affairs this exclusion is sure to cease various classes of persons might be mentioned who if the result of the election could depend upon the direction given to their votes might on the ground of this or that disqualifying circumstance with reason be excluded but for justification of such exclusion sufficient proof of the existence of such disqualifying circumstances would require to be given hence to an indefinite amount litiscontestation expense vexation and delay must have place evils which ought not to be admitted unless their admission be made up for by some assignable preponderant good on this occasion look to the several cases of persons insane convicted delinquents of various descriptions and persons by whom but for the protection afforded by secrecy of suffrage coercive influence might to an indefinite extent be exercised on the votes of others the happiness of the most helpless pauper constitutes as large a portion of the universal happiness as does that of the most powerful the most opulent member of the community therefore the happiness of the most helpless and indigent has as much title to regard at the hands of the legislator as that of the most powerful and opulent if the possession of a share in the supreme  0  constitutive power is a means of or security for happiness there is as much reason why a share in that means of security should be in the hands of the most helpless and the most indigent as why it should be in the hands of the most powerful and the most opulent why exclude the whole female sex from all participation in the constitutive power because the prepossession against their admission is at present too general and too intense to afford any chance in favour of a proposal for their admission on the ground of the greatest happiness principle the claim of this sex is if not still better at least altogether as good as that of the other the happiness and interest of a person of the female sex constitutes as large a portion of the universal happiness and interest as does that of a person of the male sex no reason can be assigned why a person of the one sex should as such have less happiness than a person of the other sex nor therefore whatsoever be the external means of happiness why a female should have a less portion of those same means if in this respect there were a difference the principle of equality would require that it should be rather in favour of the female than of the male sex inasmuch as there are so many causes of suffering which do not attach upon the male and do attach upon the female sex such as pains of gestation of parturition labour of nurturition periodical and casual weaknesses inferiority in all physical contests with the male sex and loss of reputation in cases where no such loss attaches upon the male if the possession of a share in the constitutive power be a means of securing such equal share of the external means of happiness the reason in favour of it is therefore at least as strong in the case of the female sex as in the case of the male it always being understood that the voting is in the secret mode the reciprocal seduction that would ensue in the case of a mixture of sexes in the composition of a legislative or executive body seems a conclusive reason against admitting the weaker sex into a share in those branches of power it would lead to nothing but confusion and ridicule but if this infringement on equality be considered as necessary regard for the principle of equality affords another reason not merely for admitting the female sex to an equal share in the constitutive but even to a greater share than in the case of the male again in domestic concerns males derive greater power from physical force here then is a means of injury for security against it if in respect of political power there be a difference it should rather be in their favour than in the favour of males admitting the comparative inaptitude of the female sex with reference to the legislative and executive functions no cause of inaptitude on their part applies to the exercise of a share in the constitutive function in this case no demand for any appropriate active aptitude has place as easily can a female give a piece of card to be put into a box as a male as easily can she receive advice as to the disposal of it as a male—as her father husband brother or son the custom by which the prepossession has been produced is a custom that had its rise in a state of society altogether opposite in this respect to the present the military power being necessarily in the hands of the male sex the political power followed it males were free to go everywhere females found full occupation at home and could seldom consistently with safety pass to any considerable distance from it except with males to protect them no reason has ever been assigned why in respect of intellectual aptitude this half of the species ought to be deemed inferior to the other as to intellectual aptitude considered as applied to the field of thought and action at large two points require to be considered in the first place in how small a degree the superiority is on the side of the male sex in the next place how small the number of the female sex whom laws and institutions have left unexcluded from the competition in comparison with those whom they have excluded this custom of exclusion has been departed from in the case where the power is of the highest grade in countries in which the sex is not admitted to the smallest share in the constitutive power it is admitted to the whole of the executive coupled with the largest share of the legislative and that without any constitutive power above it and of experience in england as far as it goes in this the highest rank of operative power the decision is more in favour of the female sex than of the male in intellectual aptitude elizabeth of england showed herself in an incontestable degree superior to her immediate successor and even to the nearest of her male and adult predecessors if anne was weak she was not more so than her two immediate successors both males if mary put men to death for what was called religion so did her father and so did her next male successor if queen mary put people to death for what was called religion so did lord chiefjustice hale the hero of english lawyers for what was called witchcraft in no two male reigns was england as prosperous as in the two female reigns of elizabeth and anne as to anne whatever was the cause it was more prosperous than that of her immediate male predecessor—a man as unamiable as she was amiable thus has england been governed by female monarchs three russia four austria one sweden one portugal one france though  0  not once by a female monarch whose reign continued during life has been governed by several female monarchs whose reigns under the name of regencies have lasted for a long course of years england also gives the example of a case in which in the choice of a sublegislature of twentyfour members governing with absolute sway in subordination to the supreme legislature sixty millions of subjects in british india females have an equal share with males thus while gnats are strained at camels are swallowed can practical good in any form be mentioned as likely to be produced from the admitting the female sex into a participation of the supreme constitutive power yes the affording increased probability of the adoption of legislative arrangements placing sexual intercourse upon a footing less disadvantageous than the present to the weaker sex at the same time there is no political state that i know of in which on the occasion of any new constitution being framed i should think it at present expedient to propose a set of legislative arrangements directed to this end before the state of the legal system had been made on almost all other points contributory in the highest degree to the greatest happiness of the greatest number scarcely could any prospect be afforded of its being rendered so as to this the contest and confusion produced by the proposal of this improvement would entirely engross the public mind and throw improvement in all other shapes to a distance ii secrecy when suffrage is secret no man who wishes to give a vote and is not by want of time or length of distance debarred from giving it is debarred from giving it in favour of the person whom he prefers by fear of loss of money or friends no man is made to suffer or is exposed to suffer loss of money or friends on account of the vote he has given or any vote he has forborne to give in so far as the course taken by mens suffrages is known some men are by fear of loss of money or friends debarred from giving any votes at all some men who would otherwise have given their votes in favour of a certain person are by fear of loss of money or friends debarred from giving their votes in favour of that same person some men who otherwise would have given their votes in favour of a certain person and thereby against another person his rival are by fear of loss of money or friends not only debarred from giving their votes in favour of the person they approve but compelled to give their votes in favour of a rival of his whom they disapprove a man who being a candidate for a situation for the filling of which suffrages are given declines using his endeavours to cause them to be delivered in the secret mode proves thereby that the following wishes one or more of them have place in his breast—  to see men who have each of them a right to vote debarred in indefinite numbers from the exercise of that right   to see men who if free would have voted for a rival of his debarred from doing so   to see men who if free would have voted for a rival of his whom they approve not only debarred from doing so but by fear as above compelled to vote in favour of himself in whatsoever degree he may have been the object of their disapprobation iii equality by equality of suffrage is meant equality of effect as between a suffrage given in this or that one electiondistrict and a suffrage given in this or that other electiondistrict understand here by equality nothing more than the absence of such degrees of inequality as would be productive of some one or more evils of the following description to a sensible amount—   in this or that electiondistrict the number of electors so small that by intimidation or corruption freedom of suffrage might be destroyed by secrecy of suffrage intimidation might be excluded but unless by the multitude of the electors as compared with the value of the situation filled and the quantity of the means of corruption in the hands of candidates to exclude corruption is impossible   in this or that electiondistrict the number of the electors so great that in comparison with a vote in this or that other electiondistrict a vote is in a sensible degree inferior in value this being the case all voters in such overpeopled district feel a sensation of injury from the comparison of their situation with that of the electors in an underpeopled or even in an adequately peopled district   proportioned to the smallness thus produced in the effect and value of a vote will be the probability of its being outweighed by the loss of time necessary to the delivering of it upon all in whose instance the advantage of voting is thus outweighed by the inconvenience a virtual exclusion is thus put   the greater the distance between the place at which the votes are delivered and the place of an electors abode the greater is the inconvenience in respect of time lost with or without concomitant expense evil   is common to town and country districts this evil is peculiar to country districts iv annuality by annuality of suffrage understand adequate frequency of recurrence on the part of the election process and thereby of the conjunct exercise of the right of removal and the function of appointment with relation to the situation in question but instead of adequate frequency of recurrence say annuality of recurrence instead of an indefinite expression a definite expression employed for the sake of   0 clearness of conception accuracy of expression to a certain degree sacrificed no one will undertake to say at any rate no one will be able to prove that by the addition of this or that short term say a day to the term of a year any sensible evil in this or that determinate shape could be produced and so in the case of this or that other small number of days to an indefinite amount no one will undertake to say or at least no one will be able to prove that by the subtraction of this or that short term say a day from the term of a year sensible evil in this or that determinate shape would be produced and so in regard to this or that other small number of days to an indefinite amount no one will undertake to say or at least no one will be able to prove that there cannot be any state of things in which it would not be for the advantage of the whole body of constituents that at the end of some shorter length of time than a year reckoning from the day of election the conjunct powers of removal and appointment should not by the act of some person or persons chosen for the purpose be called forth into exercise section viii moral aptitude is inversely as altitude in the scale of political influence education being supposed not deficient nor subsistence wanting aptitude with relation to the exercise of political power is inversely as the altitude of a mans place in the composite scale of political influence this composite scale is composed of three elementary scales—the scale of opulence the scale of power and the scale of factitious dignity in the scale of opulence language has not yet afforded as in the scale of temperature denominations designative here and there of the different degrees no precise station therefore can here be designated by the terms opulent and unopulent all that can be expressed is their relative stations viz that in the station marked by the term opulent the quantity of the matter of opulence is greater than in the station marked unopulent with relation to useful qualities in general and in particular with relation to those of which appropriate aptitude with relation to political functions in general is composed the following are the considerations by which on the part of the opulent inferiority in appropriate aptitude considered in all its branches stands indicated the greater the quantity in value of the services which at the hands of those on whom his comforts depend a man has at command without rendering any correspondent services in return services positive and negative together—positive consisting in the exercise of positive beneficence—negative consisting in the exercise of negative beneficence that is to say forbearance from injury and annoyance in all their shapes—the less the need he feels for the exercise of such beneficence on his part so much for moral aptitude now as to intellectual aptitude and active talent the greater the quantity in value a man has of those good things which are the fruits of the labour of others the less the need he has of labour on his own part the less therefore will his frame whichever part of it bodily or mental be in question be inured to labour but other circumstances equal intellectual aptitude will be in proportion to labour accordingly in every department in which the waste and corruption of government has furnished pay enough for both you will see two sorts of men in pairs viz the opulent man who bears the title and cuts the figure doing nothing of the business the unopulent man who bears no title cuts no figure and does all the business and so likewise in regard to active aptitude the greater the exercise given to the will the less the exercise given to the understanding the monarch is all will understanding is wanting to him will occupies itself about the end understanding about the means all the monarch has to do is to look out for ends for objects suited to his fancy and his taste to find out means for the obtainment of those objects belongs to others to the twolegged and featherless instruments of his pleasure in england of the right honourable house—of the honourable house the members are each of them a fraction of a monarch a monarch in miniature accordingly in neither situation has reason fruit of the labour of the understanding any effective place by collision of wills it is not by collision of understandings that every result is produced when argument or anything which has the semblance of it is exhibited it is only for appearance sake for any such delusion as it is thought there may be a convenience in propagating without doors the higher the degree of opulence the less the degree of sympathy in the breast of the opulent for the unopulent for that portion of mankind in behalf of whom the demand for such beneficence as it may be in his way to exercise is greatest correspondent to and intimately connected with sympathy of affection is sympathy of conception by and in proportion to sympathy of affection a man is disposed to add to the enjoyments and subtract from the sufferings of the objects of his sympathy proportioned to the correctness clearness and completeness of the conception a man has of those enjoyments and those sufferings his degree of sensibility being given is the strength of the sympathy of affection with relation to those same objects of his sympathy relative sensibility being wanting sympathy of affection may be equally wanting although     sympathy of conception be entire but in so far as sympathy of conception is wanting sympathy of affection has no place for all bodily pains sympathy of conception must on the part of the experienced surgeon be greater than on the part of an average man but if his sensibility and consequently if his sympathy of affection were so likewise he would not be fit for the exercise of his art want of sympathy of conception concurs with the feeling relative to independence in destroying in the breast of the opulent man sensibility and with it beneficence positive and negative with relation to the unopulent he has no need of their services—their free and gratuitous services he has no conception of their wants he has no feeling for their wants where at the first commencement of the habit of witnessing with or without the habit of producing sufferance sympathetic suffering has been produced by the sight of it—the continuance of the habit will sooner or later extinguish the sympathy it is thus extinguished for example as abovementioned in the surgeon or he would not be fit for the exercise of his beneficent art it is thus nearly if not altogether extinguished supposing it originally to have had place in the breast of the military conqueror or he would not be fit for the exercise of his maleficent art the mother who has lately lost a son in battle has some conception of what the miseries of war are and feels and grieves accordingly for those who are partakers of them under a monarchy absolute or limited among the functionaries in the higher ranks commencing with the monarch so confirmed is the habit of hearing of men by thousands and tens of thousands slaughtered or reduced from happiness to misery by the operations by the orders given by these their rulers for the purpose of giving further and further extension to their own power factitious dignity and opulence that no greater portion of sympathetic suffering is produced in such breasts by the tidings of any such catastrophe than has place in the breast of a gardener while he is setting his foot on a swarm of caterpillars the same monarch in whose breast the sight of a favourite suffering from a hurt experienced in the course of a frolic had in early youth produced an almost equal pain of sympathy will as ambition increases and sympathetic sensibility decreases receive with indifference the news of a limb lost by that same favourite in company with thousands of limbs and as many lives lost by others in the course of a battle from which the power of the wholesale manufacturer of human misery is regarded as receiving increase as it is with the universal superior so it is with the subordinates quantities and degrees being proportional to the place occupied by them respectively in the gorgeous scale remains to be shown how it is and whence it is that the state of moral appropriate aptitude with relation to the function in question being in the exalted situations in question such as has been described the conception commonly entertained in relation to it has been so opposite to the state of things as thus described and thereby so incorrect and opposite to truth the cause of this delusion may be seen in the influence exercised by the high alliance by the confederacy of power factitious dignity and excessive opulence partly through the medium of corruption partly through the medium of force and intimidation partly through those discourses written as well as oral particularly those presenting themselves constantly to view in the written form by which information is conveyed respecting this part of the field of thought and action in which instruction is sought and by which opinion and affections are moulded take in the first place opulence even in that minor degree of force with which it operates when the field of its operations is confined to private life proportioned to the quantity of the matter of opulence which a man has at his command will be the quantity in which those who are in habits with him or entertain a prospect of being in habits with him may expect to share proportioned to the intensity of their respective appetites for such share will naturally be their endeavours to procure for those appetites their appropriate gratification according to all such means as are safe and not disreputable as they see within their reach proportioned to the success of such their endeavours will be their own selfsatisfaction and their gratitude as towards the author of it can scarcely fail in some way or other to be the accompaniment of it in action as well as discourse more particularly in discourse as being the cheaper article will this gratitude real and feigned together find expression and give itself vent but as with the power of granting the power of refusing receive correspondent increase so with that love which produces gratitude will increase that fear which produces respect moreover in the hands of the opulent with the negative power of refusing favour to those who have not been and those who have ceased to be the objects of their regard is conjoined in no inconsiderable degree the power of doing positive evil to those who are the objects of their positive aversion by the operation of all these causes taken together thus intimate is the connexion between the idea presented by the word rich and the idea presented by the word respectable of the effect produced by this association on conduct discourse and to no inconsiderable degree on opinion and affection an exemplification may be seen in the picture of the parasite as drawn by the earliest of the dramatists whose works have reached us if such and so great be the ordinary influence and effect of the matter of wealth in the hands of individuals distributed in parcels of     an ordinary bulk what must it be when accumulated in an immense mass in company with supreme power and the highest lot of factitious honour together with the manufactory in which all inferior lots of these instruments of influence are fabricated—all placed in the same hand if such be the influence of wealth when reckoned by thousands what must it not be when reckoned by millions as long as wealth and government have had existence the powers of poetry and oratory have been employed in singing the praises of the powerful the dignified and the wealthy while the effusions of praise have thus had free scope with reward in every shape to pay for them those of censure have all along and everywhere been suppressed by every restraint which it was in the power of punishment to apply while the eulogies of virgil and horace were rewarded with lavish hand ovid for this or that little bedchamber anecdote was sent to pine in exile if the quantity of virtue practised were to be measured by the quantity of virtue attributed the most selfish and hardhearted tyrants would be the most virtuous of philanthropists where profusion alone and without cruelty marks the character of the despot gratitude and hope are the only brokers the exertions of which will be occupied in the filling the cornucopia of praise where to the influence of those agents that of fear is added praise extorted from enemies will add itself to the praise poured in by friends in the eyes of the undiscerning and unscrutinizing multitude it may now be seen how impossible it is that receipt of praise should fail of being considered as conclusive evidence of merit virtue excellence whatsoever be the name of the fictitious entity created by praise to represent the subject which it undertakes to magnify—whether it be merit for example or virtue or excellence—thus it is that in proportion to the quantity possessed by any man of this efficient cause and title to praise namely wealth will be the quantity of the fictitious entity in question supposed on that account to be in his possession on the part of those by whom any of those tokens of wealth by the appearance of which the existence and possession of it are generally regarded as being proved thus it is that an opinion will really be entertained that in the composition of his mind a proportionally preeminent quantity of this admirable and admired quality by whatsoever name it may be styled will be found it has now it is hoped been put sufficiently out of doubt how far any such opinion considered in the character of a general one is from being in any agreement with the truth and that the truth of the case lies not in this opinion but in the reverse of it that in so far as any such opinion is entertained delusion has place in the breast of him by whom it is entertained and in so far as for the propagating of this opinion endeavours are employed endeavours for the propagating of delusion are employed what is now moreover it is hoped sufficiently put out of doubt is that by every additional particle—not only of actual wealth of actual power and of actually existing factitious dignity—but of everything which in the character of a token can contribute to their increase in the hands of an individual possessing any considerable share of political power—the force and efficiency of all this stock of the instruments of delusion will be increased what at the same time is sufficiently out of dispute is—that in every such instrument of delusion may be seen and truly seen an instrument of misrule a means of exercising it and thereby an encouragement and incitement to exercise it to support the dignity of the crown to add splendour to the crown to add lustre to the crown—so many phrases upon the strength of which money wrung from a starving people by scarcely supportable taxation is day by day by the creatures and dependants of the monarch called for without measure and without shame called for and granted accordingly with what effect with the effect of labouring in vain to fill the everleaky cup of his personal gratification of giving perpetual increase to the delusion by which the seat of necessary depravity is converted into the seat of imaginary and fabled excellence and in making every day fresh and fresh advances towards the accomplishment of the constant object of all endeavours—the conversion of a scarce disguised into the more simple and convenient form of an undisguised and openly avowed despotism it has been seen to what inevitable necessity by the original and unchangeable nature of man an irremoveable chief magistrate call him duke call him consul call him king call him emperor call him what you will is an enemy to all that are subject to his rule with the exception of those who are sharers with him in the sinister profit what at the same time is no less manifest is that by every step by which any advance can be made towards dissolving the disastrous association by which the instruments of vice and misery are palmed upon mankind as the necessary instruments of security and universal happiness a real service and that a most important one will be rendered the notion therefore that in those who are possessed of the powers of government there is more virtue than in those who have no share at all in the government is an erroneous one so far is the position from being true that the very reverse is true in this statement there is nothing of exaggeration on the contrary it is matter of the strictest demonstration the mischievousness of an act whereby human suffering is produced is as the magnitude of     the suffering multiplied by the extent of it—by the number of the individuals to whom it extends in the case of a man who witnesses it and who is conscious of the part he has in the production of it the depravity the moral turpitude that has place in his mind increase in the same ratio as does the mischievousness of it as above of virtue of depravity of moral turpitude there exists not any other intelligible test or measure unless it be in the case of this mischievous act the degree of deliberation attendant on the commission of it compared with each other by this test and this measure in a country governed by corruption and delusion—the resistible and punishable malefactors who are styled criminals and treated as such with the irresistible and unpunishable malefactors styled rulers by whom they are treated as such the worst of criminals will in every intelligible sense of the word worst be found to be men of transcendant virtue in comparison with those on whom the praise of virtue is so unsparingly and indefatigably lavished another notion is that opulence is an antiseptic that in proportion to a mans opulence will be the improbability of his wishing to add to it by depredation to him who has lived all his life upon £ 00 ayear and no more £  0 ayear is opulence reduction to £ 0 ayear is ruin to him who has £ 0000 ayear it requires an addition of £ 000 ayear to produce a sensation equal in intensity to that produced in the case of him who has but £ 00 ayear by an accession of £ 0 ayear thus it is that instead of operating as a security against the propensity to depredation opulence accompanied with the habit of large expenditure operates as an incentive the greater the quantity of money which a man has been in use to expend the greater the quantity meaning always the absolute quantity of that which he craves cupidity does not sink but rise with opulence yet the common opinion—the vulgar error it may well be called in so far as the profession of it is sincere—is the reverse the notion is that the man whose habitual expenditure has been large is on that account so long as the means of it continue undiminished not so likely to seek to increase it by depredation to so large an amount as the man whose habitual expenditure has been small this notion whence comes it from this—from the natural tendency which in every situation man has to measure other men by his own measure to assume that in a different situation be it higher or be it lower a given quantity of money either in possession or in expectancy will produce in the breasts of men sensations the same in intensity as in that situation he himself occupies from this assumption one consequence deduced by the man of £ 0000 ayear is—that because reduction to a £ 00 ayear would to him be utter ruin and reduce his mind to a state of wretchedness restriction to £ 00 ayear would in the instance of a man whose expenditure had not been used to exceed that sum be productive of a sensation of distress as intense or not much less so another is—that because the rich man would not forfeit or risk his reputation for probity for the sake of £ 0 ayear being half of the amount of the others income therefore neither would he for £ 000 ayear being half the amount of his own income in conclusion—the plain truth of the matter is that in respect of the strength of propensity desire and endeavour there is not much difference between the man on the highest and the man on the lowest level in the scale of opulence but that in so far as any cause of difference can be found it is on the part of the most opulent that—in so far as the strength of it is measured by the absolute quantity of the money which at the expense of others a man will endeavour to acquire—the propensity desire and endeavour is likely to be most strenuous—to be less effectually repressed by any arrangements that can be devised that therefore in office so far as concerns abstinence from undue profit the chance of good behaviour on the part of the officebearer is the greater the less the quantity of emolument which he is content to accept in retribution for the burthen submitted to in respect of the obligation of discharging the functions of it if this reasoning be correct the rule in point of practice should accordingly be—if any man is found who is content to pay money for the privilege of performing the functions of it so much the better and unless for special reason to the contrary let him who will pay highest for it have it if no competent person can be found who will pay anything for it or who will serve in it gratis let him have it who requires the smallest quantity of emolument for performing the functions of it another reason for reducing all official emolument to a minimum is this that with the quantity of the emolument attached to the office the quantity of influence applicable to sinister purposes in general and in particular to the purpose of obtaining support in case of malversation increases of this bad effect from excessive emolument the mischief is exemplified in the most manifest and striking manner in the case of the monarch in a monarchy as in that highest stage so in each inferior stage in the scale of power and opulence thus it is that under the british government for example in all the superior offices responsibility in the penal sense is a perfect mockery a mere empty name     chapter xvi supreme legislative section i legislature—single or divided the hands in which the supreme legislative power is lodged ought to be located and dislocated by the great body of the people the hands in which this power is lodged ought to be not those of a single individual but those of a numerous body of this body the members ought to be located and dislocated by the electors of so many territorial districts into which for this purpose the whole territory of the state ought to be divided this position being considered as established comes now the question—whether the institution of one such numerous body being determined upon one other or any more than one other ought to be added the answer is—not so much as one other in which answer is included a negative upon every greater number if in addition to this first body there be a second this second will either be a body having an interest not in any way opposite to the interest of the great body of the people or a body having an interest opposite in this or that way to the interest of the people under the greatesthappiness principle to say that among the functionaries sharing in the supreme legislative power a body having an interest opposite to that of the people ought not to have place is as much as to say that it is against the interest of the people to be under the government of men having an interest opposed to theirs and in a condition to give effect to that particular interest at the expense and by the sacrifice of that universal interest why not give to a permanent aristocratical body kept up by hereditary succession and increasable by the monarch a negative on all laws with or without an initiative why not as in english practice and language two houses because the evil effects are many—the good effects none because in every member of such a body the elements of relative inaptitude are the same in kind as in the situation of the monarch and howsoever in comparison of that situation inferior in degree yet at all times sufficient to secure for the joint benefit of king lords and commons at the expense of the people the consummation of the sinister sacrifice whatsoever tends to give increase to the amount of that sacrifice will be sure of their assent whatsoever tends to apply restriction to it will be sure of their dissent against the just resentment of the people this body will serve as a screen to the monarch to the splendour played off by the monarch upon the imagination of the people the members of this aristocratical body will add whatsoever factitious splendour their persons are encompassed with no advantage bearing reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number—no such advantage did man ever attempt to bring to view in the character of a reason for a house of lords for an assembly composed of members of the privileged order sitting by hereditary succession or for life benefit to the monarch yes benefit to the aristocracy yes to the monarchy it gives stability to the aristocracy in all its parts profit by increase of power profit by a share more or less considerable in legalized depredation the house will not let the king come in for a share unless the king will let the house come in for a share as to the greatest number—as to the great body of the people greater would be the advantage to them if wolves in equal number or in a number by ever so much greater were imported from a wolf country and turned out loose the wolves would in process of time be killed and for every wolf killed there would be a wolf skin which would be good for something the lords though each of them would do more mischief than many wolves would not be killed and if they were killed their skins could not be put to any use there remains therefore as the sole subject of the question a second body having an interest the same as that of the people—the identity or coincidence between the two interests being provided for in the case of this second body upon the same principles as in the case of the first first comes loss of time the delay between the passing of a project by one house and the definitive passing of it by both in a constitution which has two houses evil in this shape is susceptible of actual measurement the journals of the two houses will show it waste of the official time of various functionaries engaged in the debate expense to wit of remuneration for the members of the second house this in so far as it has place belongs to the list of sensible evils more plainly sensible than the above this however is no place to enlarge upon it for it is not essential to the twohouse system if attached to it it is attached only by accident suppose the second house to wave acceptance of all remuneration in a direct shape and not to seek any in an indirect shape this evil is extinguished prevalence given to the will of the minority over that of the majority to wit in both houses taken together in this case the particular evil effects are not matter of certainty they are but presumable however well grounded the presumption unless some special probable cause of error be assigned applying to the majority and not applying at all or not in equal force to the minority—the probability of right judgment     will in every instance be in the exact ratio of the number of the majority to that of the minority on this supposition it is that in every instance in which the act of the whole is made to consist of the act of the majority the act of the majority is acted upon as if it were the act of the whole say for example number of members in the one house  00 in the other  0    in the smaller house suffice to overrule the will of    in that same house added to the  00 in the other house in every case if there be any reason for giving the preference to the judgment and will of the few to that of the many it lies upon those who are for thus departing from the general rule to assign special and preponderant reason for such departure against it the strength of presumption is considerable of the members of the first house the choice will of course be made upon such principles as are regarded as calculated to send in the aptest members aptest in the aggregate of all the parts of appropriate aptitude they are regarded as those in whom in consideration of that plan of location more confidence may with propriety be placed than upon members located upon any other plan add now a second house either the location is performed upon the same plan or upon a different one if upon the same plan then comes the incongruity of giving to the minority the prevalence over the majority and without any reason to show for it if upon a different plan then by the supposition it is either worse or at best no more than equal but if no more than equal the whole trouble attendant upon it is thrown away another evil is the prevalence of a particular and sinister interest on the part of the second house whatever it be here too the sensible evils are but matter of presumption as in the former case but whether the presumption be not here also a strong one will be seen be the two houses what they may in the course of practice one or other of them will acquire and preserve the lead to that leading house will application in general be made to that house will every person who has a project to bring forward look in preference comparatively speaking the other house will remain in a state of nullity to the house of greater activity will the merit of all measures looked upon as beneficial be ascribed in proportion as the scheme of election is favourable to the universal interest the measures proposed and approved by the larger efficient house will be beneficial if there are any that are otherwise on this supposition the smaller house the scheme of election being the same is altogether useless but be the acts of the larger house ever so beneficial to the community the majority of the smaller house will not naturally be content to remain in a state of disregard to acquire and maintain a certain degree of respect they will take the only course which according to the supposition is within their reach they will set themselves to oppose and clog and delay on every occasion those good measures in the glory of which they cannot share reasonable arguments not being furnished by the nature of the case they would betake themselves to unreasonable ones against each measure as it came into the house they would play off the whole artillery of fallacies hence arise the evils following in the case of every good law thus opposed delay vexation and on the part of individuals interested more or less expense substituted for that time to the expected benefit in proportion to the number of instances in which the bad arguments thus prevail the good that would have been produced by the good law thus rejected excluded altogether the next evil is the complication of the art and science of legislation the matter even supposing the simplicity of it is maximized would still be more complicated than could be wished—complicated enough to be productive of evil in no inconsiderable abundance even supposing sinister interest out of the question the more complicated the matter the greater the number of those who are unable to see clearly into it and even to those who do see into it with the utmost possible degree of clearness the greater the mass of time and labour expended on it but the more complicated it is the more easy will it be for those who apply themselves to seek a sinister profit to themselves at the expense of the rest of the community to succeed in such their endeavour to wit by reason of the inability of those whose interests are thus sacrificed—the inability of seeing into and opposing those same mischievous designs there will also be an increased facility afforded to corruption the susceptibility as to corruption has been already stated as inherent in the constitution of a representative democracy as well as in that of every other form of government in every state there must be an administrative authority and in every state the members of the legislative authority will be able and inclined to exchange favours with those of the administrative and to join with them in a system of depredation and oppression at the expense of the people true the aggregate value of these favours is here minimized but minimization is not extinction the aggregate value of these favours being given and also the condition in life of the persons to be operated upon by them their corruptive power will be inversely as the number of those persons and in the ratio of the population of the two houses in the smaller house the number will be less than in the larger of itself the second house cannot establish anything but there is not anything which it cannot keep excluded the efficient causes of corruption being continually in action and     the effect of them continually on the increase—sooner or later unless obviated they cannot fail to destroy the constitution and substitute to it a corrupt despotism but whatsoever be the remedies by which the evil is capable of being averted that which the second house cannot but have in its power is to prevent the application of them if it be established that there are to be two chambers out of this single circumstance spring a swarm of questions pregnant all of them with doubts and difficulties with respect to the whole field of legislation taken together shall each have the initiative or shall one of them alone and which have the initiative and the other have the negative or with relation to certain parts of that field shall the initiative be possessed exclusively by one and which of them here then comes the necessity of lines of demarcation and thence not only certain complication but probably continual contest and dissension in the french constitution of      the sole initiative is in the monarch of course he will never originate any measure the effect or tendency of which will be to diminish his power however detrimental it may be to the happiness of the nation on the contrary his constant endeavour will be to give increase to his share in the various instruments of felicity lest the additional chamber should be regarded as useless some special reason must be found for the institution of it accordingly for this purpose a division of the branches of appropriate aptitude is brought to view and assumed to be applicable both chambers being assumed to be provided in sufficient amount with appropriate moral aptitude the advantage in respect of active aptitude is the supposed attribute of the one in respect of intellectual aptitude of the other in which latter case to render it the more imposing the varnish of antiquity will be spread over it and it will be called wisdom meantime for rendering wisdom whatever is meant by it more abundant in one chamber than in another the contrivance is to require that in that which is to be the wisest the members shall not any of them be of less than a certain age only in so far as moral aptitude has place is intellectual contributory or otherwise than detrimental to the aggregate of appropriate aptitude in so far as his object is particular and sinister interest at the expense of universal interest the more knowledge and judgment a man has the more mischievous will he be but in so far as there is any difference youth has much better pretensions to the being regarded as the seat of appropriate moral aptitude—of virtue to speak in rhetorical language—than a more advanced age has in a ratio which is the inverse of the degree of altitude in the scale of age the mind is susceptible of that degree of excitation in french exaltation of which selfsacrifice sacrifice of immediate selfregarding to social interest is the result in so far as regards intellectual aptitude needless with reference to this its professed purpose is in the present case this supposed security take any age for the age short of which deficiency in the article of wisdom is to be regarded as preponderantly probable say for example twentyone years of age by no such deficiency can any sensible evil be produced otherwise than in the case in which the individuals labouring under it compose a majority but that in any number approaching to a majority these supposed unripe minds should have place in any body constituted as that in question is here proposed to be is altogether improbable were it even life at large that were in question the longer a mans life has been the more numerous will have been the opportunities which his appropriate aptitude whatever it be has had of making itself generally manifest but if this is true as applied to life in general more particularly true will it be as applied to political life in the united states of america the legislature is divided into two houses viz the house of representatives and the senate to this clog upon the proceedings of the representatives of the people another objection may be seen in the mode of election or in other words in the source of location had this second house been elected by the same electors as the first the delay and expense would have constituted the most material if not the only material evils but the electors or locators are not the members of the constitutive body but a comparatively very small body—not more than one thirtyfivethousandth part of the members the senators are located by the members of the local legislatures so that instead of location by one stage of suffrages here is location by two stages of suffrages the members of the senate are moreover fixed in their situations for no less than six years and in all that time neither by the locators of the first stage nor by the locators of the second stage nor in a word by any authority whatsoever can they be dislocated thus in no hands is there any efficient control over their conduct in addition to all this to make the complication more complete the senate has a share in the supreme executive authority here then is a sort of aristocracy organized and in virtue of the doublestage principle an aristocracy over which the members of the constitutive have no direct influence it may indeed be said scarcely any influence at all the good effects ascribed or ascribable to the twohouse system may be resolved into this namely its acting as a remedy against precipitation in this case as in the case of the articles on the evil side the alleged good is mere matter of presumption of actually existing good not a particle does the observation adduce but the ground of this persuasion what is     it—where is it to be found in the principal house the members are by the former supposition so apt that none more apt are to be found anywhere along with this aptitude is the precipitation in question whatsoever it be in a state of dependence on the good opinion of their constituents they are all of them on every occasion they stand exposed to the censure of the publicopinion tribunal the electors would on every occasion in numbers as great as they themselves chose to make them apply their veto or their drag in a direction conformable to the universal interest the members of the other the smaller house would be on every occasion acting under the temptation to apply it in furtherance of their particular interest for avoidance of evil in this and all other shapes to afford facility and thereby encouragement to the interference of the people at large would have been the direct and most promising course the other of a veto and a drag in the hands of a smaller assembly has no presumption to recommend it under this code therefore the supreme legislative authority is undivided it is lodged the whole of it in one body composed of representatives located by the supreme constitutive section ii legislative authority—why not in the supreme constitutive why place the supreme legislative authority not in the hands in which the supreme constitutive is placed but in those of agents chosen by the supreme constitutive the reasons for this arrangement are such as must present themselves to every eye they are not less obvious than conclusive—only for the sake of symmetry if at all can they be worth mentioning for themselves the members of the constitutive authority the great majority cannot in point of physical possibility find time for the performance of this part of their business they are those on whose labours on whose disposal of their time in other ways the national stock of the matter of subsistence and abundance depends this necessary matter on which the members of the community depend for their existence by agents therefore must they perform this part of their respective businesses or leave it unperformed which is as much as to say leave political society unformed to bestow according to each ones leisure an occasional glance on the conduct of such their agents in the execution of their trust this is what they can do and this as experience shows is sufficient if to the performance of business for which by the nature of their situation the greater portion of the members of the community were excluded the whole were in form and by the terms of the law to be invited the system would by this circumstance be rendered deceptious power in profession to the greatest number it would be given in effect to the thus surreptitiously favoured few section iii election—why immediate why render the mode of location immediate not unimmediate because from unimmediateness no benefits can be shown to result while the evils increase with the number of the stages or degrees of election interposed between the members of the supreme constitutive and the functionaries here in question in this composite mode of location these evils are   want of responsibility as towards their constituents of responsibility by punibility and of responsibility by dislocability these functionaries once located no control over them do their constituents preserve no means of preventing them from becoming corrupt and occupied upon the sinister sacrifice—in the commission of depredation and oppression   the intermediate locators the immediate locators of the functionaries in question being of course less numerous than the members of the correspondent electoral body stand proportionally exposed to the influence of the mass of corruptive matter in the hands of the executive as likewise to the influence of corruptive matter in whatsoever other hands lodged the smaller the number of persons exposed to corruption the quality of the persons being set aside the greater the corruptive force with which they are acted upon by a given quantity of the matter of corruptive influence the greater the number of intermediate ranks of electors the smaller the number of electors in each rank and thence the greater the corruptive force with which they are acted upon by the matter of corruptive influence under the spanish constitution the number of stages of election is three or four the number of ranks of electors interposed between the immediate members of the constitutive body and the members of the legislative in the location of whom they bear a part is one or two a consideration of a local and temporary nature was the cause of the complication resorted to and produced in this case to such a degree were the most numerous orders under the sinister influence of the clergy that had they been the immediate locators of the members of the legislature these members would in large proportion have been persons recommended by the clergy and thence of course implacable enemies to reform in every     shape reform in the particular shape contemplated whatever it was included section iv duties peculiar and not peculiar of cases in which for want of due discrimination between the duties peculiar to itself and those not peculiar to itself the supreme legislature stands exposed to the danger of wasteful application of its time examples are the following— inquiry and decision as to a case in which property belonging to an individual is required to be transferred to government for some supposed preponderantly beneficial national purpose and thence as to the quality and quantity of the compensation due in this case the appropriate authority would be not the supreme legislative but the judicial taxation for the expense of works the benefit of which is confined within the limits of particular portions of territory say of peculiar districts in this case a more apt authority would be that of the sublegislature of the district so if for any local purpose common to some district so a transfer for a merely private purpose the arrangement being clearly conducive to the mutual benefit of all parties and the transfer capable of being made without detriment to the general sense of security in respect of property here the appropriate authority would be the judicial authority of the district of waste committed in the above shapes exemplification to a vast extent may at all times be seen in english practice and by the magnitude and uncertainty of the number of members present added to the irresponsibility of their situation this judicatory being as to all points of appropriate aptitude rendered notoriously in the highest degree unapt and in particular in respect of moral aptitude—in one word by corruption a constant waste of legislative time is frequently accompanied by the evil of misjudication english practice affords another example which is somewhat remarkable namely the grant or refusal by parliament of the dissolution of the contract as between husband and wife here the waste of legislative strength if not perhaps so extensive is much more palpable the principal efficient cause is the conjunction of the particular interest of the lawyer tribe with that of the aristocratical tribe the lawyer tribe in respect of the enormous professional profit of which a suit in this preeminently illconstituted judicatory has been made the source the aristocratical tribe in respect of the distinction it confers upon them—the capacity of defraying the inordinate expense being of the number of the exclusive privileges confined to the hands of preeminent opulence and the superior importance thus ascribed to their family connexions while a single tribunal suffices for seduction the time of the legislature at the heels of two judicial tribunals is occupied by a divorce thus in england and ireland in scotland an ordinary judicatory suffices but in england the government having for one of the maxims of its policy the minimization of the time employed by this compound body in the performance of its appropriate duties and accordingly to maximize the waste of it waste upon this small scale passes unobserved section v dislocability and punibility the legislature being the seat of supreme operative power for stemming the torrent of corruption the first quarter to which the remedial arrangement should be applied must obviously be the legislature and with or without the additional expedient of preventing the reelection of members the assigning to their power no more than a short duration may be apt to appear at first sight at least sufficient this however it will not be for short as in that department the term of service may be such it cannot conveniently be in the executive department even if the objection on that account were got over and the length of the service in that department as in the other minimized still at the head of that department some person or persons there must be and on both sides the parties having the same interests and the same means of pursuing them and pursuing them with effect the same results would follow in their individual capacity the members of the legislature would have the same desire of providing for their families and friends they would have the same means of gratifying that desire the chief or chiefs of the executive being necessarily subject to the power of the legislative exposed not only to the having the duration of their power how short soever made still shorter but to be punished and in the meantime vexed in an infinite variety of ways without the form of punishment would never cease to feel themselves under the obligation of keeping on fair terms with the members of the legislative in other words of admitting them to a share in the sweets of corruption by locating them or their friends in lucrative and other desirable offices unless by a revolution and consequent change in the constitution this state of things could never be made to cease in their corporate capacity the members of the legislature would administer the wages of corruption in the gross to the executive chief or chiefs in the shape of desirable offices and other shapes and the executive chief or chiefs would administer     them in detail to the members of the legislature in their several individual capacities in their corporate capacity they would give—in their individual capacity they would receive the members of the supreme legislative must therefore be rendered punishable—as for the production of the effect intended namely subordination dislocability alone will not be sufficient it fails in two cases—  if in consequence of the taste and situation in other respects of the individual in question it is a matter of indifference to him whether he continues in such his office or passes out of it   if in consequence of possessing what to him appears an adequate assurance of obtaining by some breach of his official duty a benefit the value of which is in his eyes preponderant over the value of the office taste and situation considered as above such is his relative moral inaptitude and such the strength of the temptation to which his probity stands exposed that he determines to break the duty accordingly and possess himself of the benefit notwithstanding the height of the situation in the scale of power neither does difficulty in any shape nor danger in any shape attach upon the application of either of the two bridles in question namely dislocation and punishment divested of his brief authority—divested by that means and at the same time of all sinister influence—a member of the supreme legislative body that is to say he who had once been a member—would be just as easily tried convicted and punished as any the meanest citizen yes if by the constitutive the functionary were undislocable and unpunishable in either case the difficulty of the operation would be extreme and the danger of the attempt proportionable this is as much as to say in a monarchy in every sort of monarchy a conception not less erroneous than at first sight it is natural would be the supposing that because by the care of the law punishment is provided to be in case of necessity applied to functionaries of the class in question—either the actual application of it or the endeavour to make application of it would be in any degree probable by the very provision by which the eventual possibility of it is established the probability of it is dispelled by the angloamerican constitution all functionaries—the highest and most powerful not excepted—are made punishable for these forty years during which these states have been in a state of independence where has been the high legislative or executive functionary punished—where has been the high functionary whom any man wished to see punished why has there never been that high functionary whom any man wished to see punished because there has never been one who has offended and no high functionary has offended because there has never been one who ever saw either any profit to be made by offending or prospect of escaping punishment if he were to offend in that country delinquency and punishment are twin sisters for there not only is infamy the punishment but efficient and abundantly sufficient punishment section vi omnicompetence why render the legislature omnicompetent because it will the better enable it to give effect to the will of the supreme constitutive and advancement to the interest and security of the members of the state because the practice upon which it puts an exclusion is in a constitution such as the present pregnant with evil in all imaginable shapes—any limitation is in contradiction to the greatest happiness principle an arrangement suppose is proposed which in the unanimous opinion of the whole legislative with the addition of the unanimous opinion of the whole constitutive would be immediately contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number for a certain length of time it cannot be carried into effect why because it is repugnant to that which was the will of the constitutive at the moment at which this restrictive arrangement was established on one supposition alone can it be supported namely that on the part of the constitutive and legislative at the time at which it received its establishment appropriate aptitude had place in a greater degree than it can have place at any succeeding point of time in particular than at any point of time at which a proposition would be brought forward for some change of the number of those on which the restrictive arrangement in question would put a negative the untenableness of this supposition has been already exposed to be employed in giving support and stability to evil in every shape is the characteristic property of an arrangement of this sort to put an exclusion upon a good law—upon a law by which if established evil in some shape or other would be excluded upon a law so plainly good that this same restrictive arrangement is the only bar that with any colour of reason can be opposed to the enactment of it—for suppose the proposed law a bad one the worse it is the stronger will be the objection opposed by its badness and for this objection there cannot be any need in the institution of this veto upon remedy and improvement moral inaptitude—the fruit of sinister interest and intellectual inaptitude in the shape of selfsufficiency wilful blindness and obstinacy act with conjunct influence had their predecessors acted with like endeavour and with correspondent effect—these wouldbe tyrants over futurity whoever they are—what place would have been left for the power of which they are making such exercise   0 power thus unlimited is it not too dangerous to be trusted to any body of men in the state no it would be if of the power thus confided the existence were not in the instance of every individual made dependent on the will of the greater number and in case of an abuse in the exercise of it the functionaries in question rendered eventually punishable as above with power thus unlimited might not the legislative body exercise their power upon the members of the constitutive body individually taken in such sort as to prevent the exercise of the dislocative power in question over the members of the legislative body no for in the case here supposed the members of the constitutive body on whose cooperation the giving execution and effect to the supposed ordinances of the legislative body depend would forbear to give it if some used their endeavours on that side a greater number would use theirs on the opposite side upon their compliance or noncompliance all power as has been seen necessarily depends on any occasion towards producing on their part noncompliance all that can be done by a constitutional code is to give them the invitation if by such invitation power is not limited by nothing else can it be limited in every case of every such restriction the tendency is to produce evil to an unlimited amount in every case of every such restriction the tendency is to produce more evil than good in no case is it in the nature of it to produce any positive good in relation to the subjectmatter in question what it does is under the notion of excluding evil to exclude evil and good at the same time in no case is it likely to exclude any evil that would not have been excluded without it against all evil effects from want of appropriate aptitude on the part of the legislature of the future time in question which is the only reason that can be adduced in favour of the restriction the community is secured by the power herein given to the constitutive body as above so obvious and incontestable are the absurdity and mischievousness of such a restriction that a palliative has been employed for lessening the mischievous effects of it this consists in setting limits to the time during which no change shall be attempted in this case the absurdity is not quite so flagrant but it is not the less unquestionable by being varied in shape neither is the absurdity removed nor the mischief materially lessened the case in which this dilatory system has been employed is that in which a new constitution has been instituted in this case an acknowledgment has been made that the makers of the constitution are not infallible and thus the system has been in a considerable degree cleared of its absurdity or at any rate its absurdity of its flagrance but as to mischievousness whatsoever may have been the object the tendency is still the same a door is left for the admission of the remedy but at what time at a time at which it is either needless or hopeless the time at which application is made of the remedy is the very time at which the constitution of which it makes a part receives its commencement a time at which experience is not yet born if there be a time at which the probable need of alteration is at its highest pitch this is that time if notwithstanding whatsoever imperfection may have place in it the constitution is at that time capable of maintaining its ground and answering not to say fulfilling the purposes of its institution much more assuredly will it at any succeeding point of time and as to remedies howsoever the direct and most essential ones are thus inhibited from being applied yet to all such as are not included in the inhibition the door by the supposition remains open not that it follows that even any such palliative will be applied for the case may be that there are not any such as will in any degree apply to the purpose be this as it may if no subversive effect takes place at this earliest period no reason is there for supposing that any such mischief will take place at any posterior period insomuch that if with this limitation to it the restriction is justifiable equally justifiable would it be were the limitation omitted so much as to the needlessness of the restriction restriction in respect of extent of competence and limitation in point of time applied to that restriction—the two arrangements taken together now as to the article of hopelessness whatsoever under the newly instituted constitution may be the influence and effective power of the newly constituted rulers the more effectually it is regarded as answering its purposes—or to come more to the point the better the people are satisfied with it—the firmer and firmer will be their hold on the affections fear and love taken together of that same people suppose now that in company with the arrangements which have really had for their object the felicity of all others have place which have for their object not the felicity of all but the particular felicity of those same rulers pursued at the expense of that of the people what is the consequence the longer the time is during which they have been in possession of the sinister advantage the more and more confirmed the habit of enjoyment is the stronger the hold as it were they have taken of it the more strenuously opposed will they be to part with it and by means of the circumstances just mentioned during all this time and in correspondent proportion their assurance of being suffered to keep possession of it has been receiving increase     by this unincompetence by this negation of all limits this also is to be understood namely that let the legislature do what it will nothing that it does is to be regarded as null and void in other words it belongs not to any judge so to pronounce concerning it for to give such powers to any judge would be to give to the judge—to the locatee of the minister of justice who himself is but a locatee of this same legislature—a power superior to that of the legislature itself but the case of an abuse of power on the part of the legislature is not therefore as has been seen left without remedy one remedy is—the shortness of the duration allowed to the power of its several members in the aggregate a year or two years at the utmost another remedy is afforded by the speedier dislocation of any or all of those who have been seen concurring in the obnoxious measure dislocation namely by those by whom he or they had been located operose is this remedy it is true but were it ever so inadequate it should not be rejected for it is the only one the nature of the case admits of and if the facility of it were to a certain degree great the remedy might even be worse than the disease little does it seem in danger of being inoperative for of the very first commencement of its preparation a natural result would be—no inconsiderable uneasiness on the part of the members who were the object of it supposing no instance of its being applied ever to have place no proof of its inutility would be the result if to the authority of the legislature limits are regarded as being applied it will be in one or other of the following ways—   by the authority of the supreme constitutive if on any occasion in the opinion of the supreme constitutive the legislative has by any ordinance trenched upon the authority given by this same constitution to the supreme constitutive—a natural consequence will be that on the part of the members of the supreme constitutive in their separate capacity no regard will be paid to it in which case as power on the one part is constituted by and is in exact proportion to obedience on the other part thus it is that the supposed anticonstitutional ordinance of the legislature will remain without effect on the disposition on the part of the members of the supreme constitutive to pay obedience to the ordinances of the supreme legislative is the legislature dependent at all times for the power which it exercises by the supposition on the individual occasion in question this same disposition is diminished or altogether vanishes and this being supposed so on that same occasion will the power of the legislature by the judiciary that is to say by any judge in whose judicatory a member of the supreme constitutive is prosecuted for the alleged offence committed by the supposed act of disobedience—by the judiciary it may be said the punishment thus called for may be inflicted true so it may be but that it should be is not likely were it only for this—namely that the judge is dislocable by a majority of the electors of the district true it is that on this occasion as on any other it may happen and is likely to happen to the suffrages of the supreme constitutive authority to be divided but this is an inconvenience the existence of which is in the very nature of the case to produce the effect here endeavoured to be produced by the promptly applied dislocative power given to the supreme constitutive over the members of the legislature it is not necessary that any application should in fact be made of it in any case in which it appears likely that by the proposed ordinance in question the members of the supreme constitutive will in any considerable number be likely to regard it as a violation of their rights—rights naturally so valuable in their eyes the great probability seems to be that a majority of the legislature will not hazard the enterprise that they will not even though no considerable apprehension of any such strong measure as that of dislocating them were entertained by them for from a degree of unpopularity much less than would suffice for their dislocation no inconsiderable personal inconvenience would naturally be produced   by the authority of the supreme legislative itself composed of the same members this case is brought to view for no other reason than because not only the possibility but the actuality of a limitation produced by such a law seems commonly to be assumed but by a little reflection the impossibility of it will be made apparent in the case of this body as in that of every other body and every individual its will is as much its will at one time as at another to suppose that its will on the first of two days can render of no effect its will on the second of those same two days is a selfcontradictory supposition it supposes that on such second day its will will be and at the same time will not be to the effect in question   by the authority of the supreme legislature itself at a time when the members of it are in a greater or less proportion or are all of them altogether different for simplicity of conception suppose them in their whole number without exception different by the supposition it is their desire to render of no effect the will declared by their predecessors by what consideration should they be prevented from carrying such their desire into effect at the anterior time in question of the will of the then existing members was the authority in question composed at the posterior time in question of the will of the then existing members it is that that same authority is composed altogether the work of imagination must be any bar by which in preference to the will of the anterior set of functionaries the will of     the posterior set of functionaries is regarded as prevented from taking effect not by any wellconsidered regard for the greatest happiness of the greatest number can any such scruple have been produced nor by any well grounded supposition of superior intellectual aptitude on the part of the earlier set of functionaries appropriate intellectual aptitude is either appropriate knowledge or appropriate judgment to the knowledge possessed by the anterior set the posterior adds the whole stock of knowledge which the interval of time has brought to view and all appropriate judgment being the fruit of appropriate knowledge proportioned to the addition to knowledge will of course be the addition to judgment unless some reason can be shown why it should be otherwise thus then with reference to the time of action in both cases will the posterior set as compared with the anterior possess an unquestionable advantage each of them possessing a knowledge of and in relation to the facts of its own time but the time here in question is the time of the posterior set of functionaries the time when in pursuance of the knowledge and judgment possessed by them an ordinance to a certain effect in relation to a certain subject is proposed to be framed and issued but of none of the intervening facts—in a word of none of the facts immediately belonging to the case could the functionaries of the anterior time have had any knowledge nor therefore be capable of forming any appropriately grounded judgment whatsoever can anything therefore be more absurd than the supposition which with reference to the proposed ordinance in question attributes to those same anterior functionaries in comparison with these their successors any superiority in the shape of appropriate intellectual aptitude in so far as the proposition has knowledge and judgment for its subjects in the instance of any other branch of art and science it is too palpably absurd to find a defender anywhere if in the instance of the branch of art and science here in question there is a just cause of exception it lies on him by whom the existence of such exception is asserted to prove it   by the authority of the functionaries belonging to the several other departments namely the executive or say the administrative and the judiciary manifestly selfcontradictory and absurd would be the supposition that by either of those authorities limits ought to be or could be set to the power of this of their institution the declared and sole declared end and purpose is the giving execution and effect to the will formed and declared by the members of the legislative but is it possible that by them or either of them it should be better known what is the will of the legislative than by the legislative itself these things considered all endeavour to restrain the power of the supreme legislative by words of inhibition or restriction in a constitutional code will be seen to be incongruous and tending to lessen instead of increasing the regard paid to it by the authorities and people of succeeding times that the restrictive system is capable of being of use is undeniable for that it has been of use is equally so under a form of government bad in principle it is capable of being of use and under every such government in so far as it has been applied it has probably been more or less of use if in any government it has been of use a more conclusive proof of the badness of the government cannot be given than that such a system has been of use under it to this head belong the sorts of instruments called in english and thence in french charters and also in english bills of rights this sort of restrictive arrangement is of use because the government is in principle a despotism the end in view is not the only true end but a false one not the greatest happiness of the greatest number but the greatest happiness of the ruling one with or without that of a comparatively few in the character either of his instruments or his partners on an occasion of this sort selection is made of some of the grossest and most palpable of the forms in which depredation and oppression are wont to show themselves and by one mean or other the depredator and oppressorgeneral has been engaged to promise that from depredation and oppression in these particular forms he will be graciously pleased to abstain in future not that to him any right to the exercise of depredation and oppression in these any more than any other forms is wanting but that in these particular instances such is his mercy and condescension he will in so far as he is pleased to continue in the same mood be pleased to abstain from the exercise of them in every instance the probability seems to be that the engagement such as it is has not been altogether without its use is it then that in any instance even in those forms in particular the career of despotism has ever altogether ceased no but in every instance the probability is that the exercise has not been either so frequent or so flagrant as but for this engagement it would have been at any rate an intimatelyconnected yet distinguishable use has been the drawing the attention of the publicopinion tribunal to the several points in question and by means of the exercise thus given to it thus giving strength to it in proportion as it gives strength to the publicopinion tribunal—that is to the members of it the great body of the people—it gives weakness to the government and where such is the principle and character of the government everything that adds to its weakness is of use and the price given for any such addition cannot easily be too great for in exact proportion as the rulers have grown weaker and weaker the people have been     growing stronger and stronger insomuch that where the ruler has been carrying on the business of government for his own benefit the people are ready to step into it and carry it on for their own benefit objection if as towards the executive and the judicial omnicompetence on the part of the legislative has place all these authorities will be united in the hands of the legislative and in that case according to montesquieus definition the government will be a despotism the division of power meaning between these three several authorities is generally acknowledged as the best security and as an indispensable security against despotism answer this definition being destitute of all reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number the authority of montesquieu has no title to regard he threw into the field of legislation a few unconnected lights but he had no clear conception of any one spot in it his fundamental division of the principle of a government—fear honour and virtue has been for these sixty years shown to be mere nonsense but for the reference made to this aphorism of his in the debates relative to the united states constitution and incidentally in discussions relative to the english government his book would not on this occasion any more than on any other at this time of day have any claim to notice vain would be the pursuit to keep hunting for a distinct meaning in a work in which no such thing is to be found of happiness he says nothing instead of security for the people against their rulers he talks of liberty and assumes without directly saying so that to establish the most perfect liberty is the proper object of all government whereas government cannot operate but at the expense of liberty and then and there only is liberty perfect where no government has place the work which contains by far the greatest quantity of sound reasoning and useful instruction on the subject of government is an american work called the federalist but even there the passages in which there is a want of clearness in the ideas attached to the words and phrases employed are but too frequent and the work being in the form of letters the reasoning is desultory and unmethodical at the end of fifty pages and not before comes a phrase the business of which is to lay down a definition of the end of government justice is the end of government then immediately after it is the end of civil society but justice what is it that we are to understand by justice and why not happiness but justice what happiness is every man knows because what pleasure is every man knows and what pain is every man knows but what justice is—this is what on every occasion is the subjectmatter of dispute be the meaning of the word justice what it will what regard is it entitled to otherwise than as a means of happiness by justice did the writer mean equality instead of justice he should then have said equality but of the four subordinate ends of government equality is but one and of that the importance is neither so great nor so clearly visible as the three others or at any rate as two of the three namely subsistence and security for the happiness of the people every security that can be given is reducible to this one—the supremacy or say the sovereignty of the people the sovereignty of the people not nominal merely but effective and brought into action or rather capable of being brought into action as frequently as the exigency of the case requires and the nature of the case renders possible altogether inadequate—and with reference to the only justifiable and proper end of government unconducive—is the sort of arrangement expressed by the phrases division of power and balance of power the phrase—balance of power supposes division of power and expresses a modification of it it means that the shares which are the result of the division should be equal or as near to equality as possible to say of the power in question that there should be a division of it is simply to say of it that it should be divided into shares to speak of the balance of power as a thing that ought to be maintained in a state is to say that these shares should be all of them equal to one another for in a pair of scales with equal arms either the weights in the two scales are equal or what is called a balance between them has no place one of them falls the other rises by those by whom the phrase—division of power is employed of the subjectmatter of the proposed division no precise determination is given is it the aggregate mass of power exercised by all the functionaries of the state of all grades put together or is it no more than the whole mass of the power exercised by those who occupy the highest grade in the several departments but in no sense unless and in so far as depredation and oppression in other shapes are excluded by it can division of power be of any use because into whatsoever portions separation of the power and corresponding interest may have been made corruption may unite them and cause them to cooperate in the work of depredation and oppression and not only may unite them but to a certainty will unless for the prevention of these evils arrangements of a very different nature be made thus it is in england thus it is and ever will be in all mixed governments into the mixture of which an alleged representation of the people is admitted in fact no such separation of power as is pretended to have place has place nor if it had place would it be of any use by keeping the three powers separate and independent—namely the legislative the executive and the judicial the use of the executive and of the judicial would be taken away namely the giving execution and effect     to the ordinances issued by the legislative to government anarchy would be substituted if in case of disobedience on the part of those subordinate functionaries the legislature had it not in its power to dislocate them and substitute to them others by whom the services they were designed and expected to render would be performed but although the subordinates ought not in any case to take upon themselves the functions of the legislative there are cases in which the legislative may and should take upon itself the functions as well of the executive as of the judicial for there are cases in which were it not to do so its own authority would be without execution and effect—it would itself be without efficiency or use of these cases there are two   where the will of the functionaries in the subordinate department opposes itself to the will of the functionaries in the superordinate department   where the exigency of the case in respect of time or appositeness of appropriate information will not admit of its operating by the intervention of the agency of these same subordinates to the executive it belongs suppose as by the here proposed constitution it does to command in chief the military force of the state and where he does not command it in person he locates him who shall command it to the executive chief and not to the legislature good in all ordinary cases but suppose the executive chief or such his deputy possessed as he thinks of the affections of the military and setting up for the sovereignty the legislature must dislocate him or either civil war or instead of representative democracy despotic monarchy ensues so in the case of the judiciary if in any district the judge wilfully forbears to give execution and effect to the declared will of the legislature and to such wilful forbearance a certain degree of continuance is given the power of the legislature in that same district is at an end and thus by the waywardness of a single functionary the will of the whole people as signified by their agents chosen by them for that purpose may in so far be frustrated to remedy this what is there that will suffice this and nothing less—decree of the legislature dislocating the insubordinate judge and in the event of his continuing in the exercise of his functions notwithstanding arrestation and confinement of his person that except in the two cases above pointed out this sort of arrangement ought not to be employed may without difficulty be admitted and except in these cases the employment of it is here accordingly disrecommended without any such limitation it has by every government been without any scruple employed for the forming a sufficiently instructive ground for its proceedings the legislature be the subjectmatter what it may calls for information at the hands of every person whom it regards as competent to the furnishing it and if the individual be refractory declining to present himself or declining to answer questions it consigns him to confinement till his wayward pertinacity gives way to the sense of political duty and due obedience takes its place here is one of those functions exercised in the exercise of which the judicial authority is continually employing itself and of which for giving execution and effect to the law it has such perfect need it is done moreover not only by the whole legislature by a bill of attainder but with much less of formality and discussion it is done by every branch how small soever which under the name of a committee is detached from itself for this purpose section vii inaugural declaration—why for what reasons employ this declaration the reasons will appear in the following uses use   to appropriate moral aptitude it contributes in the several ways following as a security for aptitude in that shape it brings to bear upon the conduct of the functionary throughout the field of his authority the force of the popular or moral sanction as applied by the publicopinion tribunal it being among the characteristics of this unofficial judicatory to act—and without injustice or mischief in any shape upon evidence of a sort upon which no proceeding could without palpable injustice be grounded in any official judicatory many are the cases in which but for the sort of check thus applied misdeeds of the most mischievous nature would be practised in full security among them is corruption on the part of a public functionary in those cases in which it would not be exposed to punishment—punishment such as that denounced by penal law for instance where by the corruptor or some connexion of his the service is rendered—not to the functionary himself but to some connexion of his in whose prosperity he has an interest more or less considerable of a tie of this sort the efficiency will be in proportion to the degree of particularity which can be given to the wording of it if the wording of it be to a certain degree general and loose so far from being conducive it is in a high degree adverse to the end which it professes to have in view the effect of it is to cause the unthinking multitude to regard as if bound by a most efficient tie a functionary on whom neither the tie in question nor any other tie of the sort ever exercises any the smallest restraining influence it has the effect of a certificate of public probity where the quality itself is ever so completely wanting england may on this head afford a useful example to all other nations what may be called the system of oaths is one of the most     extensively employed and most efficient instruments in which a government depending as that does upon corruption and delusion for its existence finds its support scarce an office of any importance on his entrance into which the functionary does not pronounce the words of an engagement to which in order that the influence of religion may be enlisted in the service of corruption the term oath is employed of the use thus made of this instrument delusion and corruption are the continually associated effects   a use of secondary importance is the security it affords the functionary against the uneasiness producible by solicitation on the part of this or that person with whom it happens to him to stand connected whether by the ties of selfregarding interest or by the ties of sympathy in this way but for a safeguard of this kind he may be annoyed by tormentors in any number and even on two opposite sides at once on the other hand let the law give him this safeguard under the semblance of coercion it gives him real liberty and thus it is that in the breast of a public man shelter may be afforded to probity against the tyranny of private sinister influence this use of the declaration or engagement is of no light importance self is but one connexions are infinite the danger which the probity of a public man is exposed to from the suggestions of his own immediate interest is trifling in comparison with the attacks it has to sustain from the interest of all sorts which surround him amongst these local and professional interests are particularly dangerous individual ones venture not beyond a whisper the others by their clamour counterfeit the public voice and clothe themselves impudently in the garb of virtue strengthened by secret inclination and entrenched behind the rampart of a solemn engagement probity may bid defiance to all its adversaries   while thus subservient to the main point namely appropriate moral aptitude the instrument may be found not altogether useless with reference to appropriate intellectual aptitude it will serve in some sort as a guide over the field of government in this character that part of the code in which an indication is given of the subjects which respectively belong to the field of duty of the several ministers belonging to the administrative branch of the executive department together with the engagements of the various functionaries to perform their duty—may serve as a supplement of all the several offices which belong to the official establishment the two in regard to which it affords the most considerable promise of being of use are the legislative and the judicial in the case of the people at large in their quality of members of the supreme constitutive authority no engagement of this sort seems to afford much promise of being of use in the character of a curb it would be altogether useless having no sinister interest—the universal interest being but the aggregate of their several particular interests it would in their instance be needless acting as they are supposed to do on a system of perfect liberty with perfect secrecy for its security it would in their case needless or needful be inapplicable in the character of instruments of appropriate intellectual aptitude—instruments for the conveyance of appropriate knowledge and for the guidance of appropriate judgment the two declarations allotted to the situation of legislator and that of judge will serve at the same time for their constitutional supervisors and masters—the members of the supreme constitutive section viii sittings unintermitted why at the hands of these public functionaries exact an attendance thus unintermitted because to the amount of irremediable mischief which may at any time be the result of nonattendance there are no assignable limits of the evil which actually has place in the several governments there is no saying how large a proportion may have been produced by the want of it in the situation in question to an excess of business or in short to any cause but the true one may in the instance of each such functionary have been at all times attributed that which in truth had for its sole cause his indolence or negligence the more completely the time of a man thus placed in the very thickest of moral contagion is occupied in the discharge of his duty the less is the time during which he stands exposed to the solicitations of corruptive influence to visits from persons of all classes whose interest and consequently whose endeavour will be to ply him with temptation in all its shapes for the purpose of engaging him to concur with them in the sacrifice of the public to their own particular interest whatever be the occupation good or evil among its purposes is the putting an exclusion upon all incompatible ones john said a careful housewife to her servant when she sent him into the cellar keep whistling all the while you are drawing the ale drinking and whistling cannot go on at the same time objection   no man of worth will submit to restrictions so irksome and so degrading answer to render the objection relevant put aside all such vague phrases as men of worth and employ instead the only relevant     phrase—no man endowed with adequate appropriate aptitude in all its several branches this done the true answer is—no man endowed with adequate appropriate aptitude will decline submitting to these same restrictions or regard them as being in any degree degrading or in comparison with other occupations so much as irksome a mans doing so would be conclusive proof of want of aptitude the occupation of the medical practitioner consists in the removing or endeavouring to remove or exclude evil—in thus doing good upon an individual scale the occupation of the legislative functionary consists in the excluding or endeavouring to exclude evil—and thus in doing good upon a national scale the legislative functionary shall it is proposed have one day of repose and relaxation out of every seven on no one day of the three hundred and sixtyfive can the medical practitioner be assured of so much as a single hour of repose and relaxation to the occupation of the medical practitioner no power in any shape is attached to the occupation of the legislative functionary power the highest in the scale of operative power is attached for the occupation of the medical practitioner never is there any want of candidates still less for the occupation of the legislative functionary would there be any want of candidates in the offices belonging to the various departments of the executive in the case of no individual in the order of clerks would this same degree of assiduity in attendance be regarded as excessive for no one of these situations is there ever any want of candidates that which a man would not decline doing for a less sum without power he would not decline doing for a larger sum and with the highest power objection   any such degree of strictness is in any such high situations altogether without a precedent answer nothing can be more natural than that it should be its being so may at any rate for the purpose of the argument be admitted without difficulty in the case of the medical practitioner the degree of closeness of attendance is determined on the part of the functionary partly by the nature of the case partly by the patient in the case of the legislative functionary it is determined by himself in conjunction with others in the instance of every one of whom the same sinister interest has place with the same power of fulfilling its dictates it is determined by a set of men who feel themselves completely at liberty to sacrifice the aggregate interest of all their fellow countrymen to any the smallest portion of personal and selfregarding interest and who are in the constant habit of making this sacrifice in the case of the medical practitioner if any evil results from the want of adequate promptitude in such sort that the patient suffers the functionary by whose fault it is produced suffers along with him for he cannot avoid doing so in the case of the legislative functionary whatsoever evil befalls the patient—perhaps the whole population of the country the patient suffers alone the person in whose misconduct the evil has its cause does not suffer along with him for it has been in his power to exempt himself from all suffering and so accordingly he has done what is the situation in which the efficiency of this bar to a seat in the legislature would be felt in its highest force it is that situation which is composed of power without obligation it is that for example of a member of the english parliament take either house of the majority all illdisposed of the minority some welldisposed on the part of the welldisposed in the scale of duties first comes amusement in all its shapes then serving the particular interests of self and connexions lastly ministering to the public interest on many occasions there have not been a sufficient number of members present in the house of commons namely forty when the fate of a proposed law was to be decided which had for its object to provide a remedy to an immense mass of misery under which the people were suffering if when a man says no man of worth would accept of the situation on such terms what he means is—neither i myself nor any who have a place in my esteem would and this man belongs to either of those bodies he delivers an aphorism which assuredly has more or less truth in it from the society in which he has been bred all sense of positive obligation has stood excluded negative obligation yes of that he has all along had the sense by the fear of being annoyed in return he has felt himself bound not to annoy others but as to the doing anything he does not like for individuals or even for himself it is a thing unusual to him and for the public at large unprecedented but from an exclusion put upon such men of worth would the public interest in any shape be a sufferer no in every shape it would be a gainer by habitual opulence men with scarcely one exception out of a thousand are rendered irremediably unapt for legislative business unapt in respect of every element of appropriate aptitude this objection supposing it regarded as peremptory and conclusive in this instance would be so in the instance of every measure almost without exception that had for its object the augmentation of the happiness of the greatest number perfect is the accordance between this arrangement for constancy of attendance and the     anterior one for the shortness of continuance in office so far as regards the members of the supreme legislative the shorter the time of a mans confinement the less irksome to him will it be chapter xvii supreme operative section i appointment in the people in a political state all power is either operative or constitutive operative is that by the immediate exercise of which obsequiousness and obedience are called for at the hands of individuals constitutive as we have seen is that by the exercise of which operative power is created and conferred in every form of government in which the possessors of the supreme operative power have not the great body of the people for their constituents the situation of every possessor of a share in the supreme operative power is that of an enemy of the people in an absolute monarchy the situation of the monarch is at all times that of an enemy to the people in a limited monarchy limited by representatives of the people spurious or genuine the situation of the monarch is at all times that of an enemy to the people in a limited monarchy limited by a representation of the people spurious or genuine the tituation of a representative of the people is that of an enemy to the people in a limited monarchy limited by two bodies one composed of the representatives of the people spurious or genuine the other of a set of men succeeding to one another upon the principle of genealogical succession rendered thereby a perpetually existing aristocratical body the situation of every member of that body is at all times that of an enemy to the people a people governed in any one of all these ways is a people governed by its enemies in comparison with that of a people governed by its own delegates the condition of a people governed in any of those ways will of necessity be at all times an infelicitous one willingly to contribute to the support of or even to submit to a government constituted in any of these ways so long as any better is in prospect in conjunction with a probability of its accomplishment—is willingly to act in the character of an enemy to the people in no instance at no time has any attempt been made to show that by the substitution or by the addition made of the office of monarch to the office of member of a body of delegates chosen by the great body of the people any addition has been made or can be made to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in no instance can any such attempt have ever been taken into consideration but the impossibility of success must have manifested itself be the community what it may to every member of it belongs two opposite and continually conflicting interests   his share in the universal interest—that interest which is common to himself and every other member of the community   that interest which is particular and peculiar to himself with or without some comparatively small number of associates in the ordinary state of things of a mans particular interest the value will generally in his eyes at least be greater than the value of his share in the universal interest only in times of extraordinary public danger will the value of his social interest have the ascendant in his breast hence in so far as between the two interests a competition has place the social will yield and be made a sacrifice to the selfregarding interest proportioned to the magnitude of his power will be the facility with which a ruler will be enabled to make sacrifice of the less influential the social to the more influential and predominant interest the universal interest requires that in regard to subsistence abundance security and equality the aggregate mass in the community in question be maximized and that in particular the shares which are the result of the three first be as near to equality as consistently with security in all other shapes they can be and that against rulers in particular in quality of persons exposed to the temptation of acting as internal enemies to all the rest the security against such their enterprises should at all times be at a maximum on the other hand that which their particular interest as above requires is—that of the aggregate of abundance their own particular share be at all times a maximum of the fulfilment of this end and object of pursuit an example may be seen in the case of the quantity of the matter of subsistence and abundance sufficient for the subsistence of from  0000 to  00000 productive hands extorted from the community and placed in the hands of a single individual in the situation of monarch and the utter inability of those whose security is thus destroyed ever to obtain redress to the objects of general desire and pursuit rulers in virtue of their situation are enabled to add three others namely under the names of honours and dignities a sort of factitious reputation of their own creation and altogether independent of good desert dignity and honours at the expense of the unhonoured vengeance at the expense of those at whose hands their will experiences resistance or their conduct disapprobation and in so far as compatible with the pursuit of those other objects and of pleasure in all other shapes ease at the expense of official duty     of official aptitude the several branches have been brought to view of the sinister interest just mentioned one effect is the diminution if not the destruction of the appropriate aptitude in all those several branches the universal interest requires that it be a maximum this sinister interest that it be a minimum as to appropriate moral aptitude in regard to this branch the universal tendency and almost everywhere the universal effect of the sinister interest in question is to prove the utter destruction by appropriate moral aptitude is meant the disposition to contribute to the utmost to the universal interest in spite and to the sacrifice of all particular and opposing interests but in the situation in question to the desire is added the power of sacrificing to the particular interest on every occasion on which a competition has place the universal interest in regard to money and moneys worth matter of subsistence and abundance minimize says universal interest the quantity lying at each functionarys disposal and proportioned to the degree of power attached to his situation is the degree in which in the instance of each functionary the production of this effect should be aimed at so as to reward extra reward give none says universal interest without proof of correspondent extra service proof no less strict than that which is or ought to be given of delinquency with a view to punishment give it says rulers interest without pinch and without need of proof of extra service still better if without need of so much as an allegation even in the most general terms of extra service in any shape ever rendered as to appropriate intellectual and active aptitude establish throughout the whole field of office the most instructive preliminary and publiclyapplied tests and securities says universal interest establish no such tests says sinister interest the effect of any such tests would be to exclude a large proportion of rulers from office and to impose on the rest obligations by the burthen of which the value of the situation would be diminished maximize the efficiency and extent of the application given to each such test says universal interest if tests there must be or where they exist already minimize their efficiency says sinister interest minimize the sum of the pecuniary inducements for acceptance of the several offices says universal interest for the aptitude on the part of the individual being established as above the less the sum of those extraneous inducements the greater the degree of relish for the situation as proved by the acceptance maximize the pecuniary inducements says sinister interest in a word of every ruling functionary the natural and selfregarding particular interest is adverse to the national or universal interest of this sinister interest the constant tendency is to diminish not to say to minimize his appropriate moral aptitude by it he is continually urged to give the reins to antisocial and antinational appetite in all its shapes by it he is urged to maximize at the expense of the universal interest the quantity at his disposal of the several external instruments of felicity objects of general desire sweets of rule incentives to misrule of public money for his own use of power for the purchase of obsequiousness to his own will and of service in all its shapes for his own benefit of factitious honour and dignity for the purchase of respect to himself from all men and obsequiousness from all who look to receive it at his hands of vengeance at the expense of all who resist his will of ease at the expense of his official duty such are the national evils to the maximization of which every functionary is constantly urged by the pressure of his own selfregarding particular and sinister interest while the interest of the greatest number at all times requires that in every instance these same evils be minimized section ii monarchy—what why not give to the state chief possessor of the supreme executive power under the supreme legislative the supreme legislative power thus placing the whole operative power of the country in that one hand because in that case the inaptitude opposite to appropriate aptitude in all its several branches is at its maximum the inaptitude opposite to appropriate moral aptitude is in this state of things at its maximum in pursuance of the selfpreference inherent in human nature the end of his government will be the greatest possible happiness of his individual self this object according to whatever happens to be his notion of it he will pursue without regard to the happiness of the greatest number at the expense of that happiness and to the sacrifice of that happiness his sinister interest having no right and proper interest to serve as a check to it the force of his power having no counterforce to keep the action of it in a state of uniformity to the public interest his desire to make on all occasions the sinister sacrifice finding no power in a condition to oppose it will on every occasion find ample means for the gratification of it and the sacrifice will at all times under his government be consummated he will accumulate under his own grasp all the external instruments of felicity all the objects of general desire in the greatest quantity possible all at the expense of and by the sacrifice of the felicity of the other members of the community all around him being below him dependent all of them on his pleasure for whatsoever portion     of felicity they are suffered to enjoy he finds in none of them any desire to oppose his will in any of the above particulars in all of them the disposition and the endeavour to give accomplishment to it he finds them joining one and all in the assurance that his greatest happiness is the only right and proper end of government that if the happiness of any other individual is a fit object of regard to him or any one else it is only in so far as the happiness of the individual servant may chance to be an object of regard and sympathy to the universal master in the eyes of this one member of the community all the others will be objects of regard on the same footing as working cattle are in the eyes of the proprietor on the part of an illtempered monarch the treatment experienced by them will be that sort of treatment which is experienced by cattle at the hands of an illtempered master the best that can happen to them at the hands of the best tempered monarch is to be treated upon as good a footing as cattle are treated upon by a goodtempered master but at the hands of the best tempered monarch they never will in any instance be treated upon as good a footing as in the hands of a goodtempered master it is common for his cattle say for example his horses to be treated his horses will be continually in his presence in the event of their being illtreated by the negligence or malice of a servant the illtreatment they have suffered will generally manifest itself by visible signs and by the appearance of their suffering the sympathy of the master will be called into action knowing that the quantity of service he can obtain from them without prejudice to their appearance is limited and that so sure as he endeavours to obtain any more their appearance and their value will in his eyes be deteriorated he will not work them to excess no determined and permanent resistance to his will being ever opposed by them and the inferiority of their minds to his being manifest they will on no occasion be the objects of his illwill or of his anger among trained horses there is no such thing as a determinately and constantly rebellious horse on not near so good a footing are subjects in the eyes and hands of the best tempered monarch of the whole number of them no more than a very small part at the utmost are ever under his eye those who are worst treated those whose sufferings are greatest from the treatment they receive under his government are never especially while enduring that treatment under his eye among them there will always be a large portion by which his illwill and anger will continually be called forth by every obstruction afforded by any one of them to the fulfilment of his will his anger will be called forth and such obstructions howsoever kept under by fear and hope must notwithstanding be universal and continual whatsoever quantity of the external instruments of felicity he happens at any time to have in his hands or at his immediate command he is never satisfied with it he never can be satisfied with it so long as he sees around him any other of those instruments that are not equally at his command in his desires are included those of all the persons attached to his immediate service and of those desires there are not any that are or ever can be completely satisfied seeing that his gain in happiness never can have place but by means of loss to them and that of every such gain loss to them to a prodigiously greater amount is a neverfailing accompaniment what he cannot entirely avoid the perception of is—that of the suffering thus produced by him illwill to an amount more or less considerable in the instance of every such sufferer is liable to be the consequence among them in a large though not exactly determinate proportion he beholds so many enemies by the contemplation of enmity on their part enmity on his part is produced for the gratification of this enmity as well as for keeping down resistance and securing against nonpayment the continually increasing quantity of the instruments of felicity exacted by him at their expense the afflictiveness of the penal law is continually screwed up to the highest amount that is thought to be consistent with their efficiency thus it is that in the very best tempered monarch by far the greatest number of the rest of the community have an enemy and that enemy an essentially implacable one if under such a monarch such is there condition what must it be under an ordinary one as in their own monarch all subjects have an enemy so have they in every other monarchs it may be said are apt to go to war with each other and when with any two monarchs this happens to be the case the subjects of each should in that monarch who is the enemy of their monarch that is of their natural enemy have a friend but in practice this is not the case the war which one monarch carries on with another monarch is a war of rivalry but it is not a war of enmity every monarch is to every other monarch an object of respect and where there is respect on both sides no rooted no decided enmity can be said to have place on either side between monarch and monarch war is upon the largest scale that which between professed pugilist and professed pugilist is upon the smallest scale by one another monarchs are styled brothers and on that one occasion they are sincere for they have a common interest and that interest is paramount to every other interest many a monarch has given up to a brother monarch and freely too dominions which he might have kept if he had pleased no monarch ever gave up freely to his own subjects an atom of power which in his eyes could be retained with safety war is a game—a   0 game of backgammon between two players at the game of war there is no more enmity than between two players at backgammon in the breasts of the players at war there is no more feeling for the men of flesh and bone than during the game at backgammon there is on the part of the men of wood for one another or themselves while to one another all monarchs are objects of sympathy to all monarchs all subjects are objects of antipathy of a sort of compound sentiment made up of fear hatred and contempt something like that which women and children are apt to feel for a toad in the breasts of all monarchs there accordingly exists at all times a natural alliance defensive and offensive against all subjects as between injurer and injured the man on whose part antipathy towards the other is most apt to arise is he by whom the injury has been sustained the one on whose part it arises with greatest difficulty if ever it arises at all is he by whom the injury has been inflicted betwixt every monarch and every other there exists a powerful cause of sympathy in the instance of all of them on the same set of principles is grounded that obedience by which their power is constituted and in proportion to which it has place disposition the effect of habit habit the effect of force fear corruption delusion sinister interest interestbegotten and authoritybegotten prejudice by every other throne he sees shaking if the shock be from without he feels the shock communicated to his own not merely in the exercise of his political power—not merely in the public part of his life but in the private part of his life the natural tendency not to say the constant effect of the monarchs situation is to place him not at the top but at the bottom of the scale of moral worth and this whether the influence of the selfregarding principle or that of the social principle namely sympathy be considered by the selfregarding principle the more urgent the need a man feels himself to have of the kindness and good will of others the more strenuous and steady will be his exertion for the obtaining it the less the need the less strenuous the kindness and good will and thence on occasion the good offices the services of others are where and in so far as power of remuneration is wanting no otherwise to be obtained than by demonstration of the like kindness in effect and in endeavour on the mans own part towards them the stronger a mans need of the effective benevolence of others the stronger the inducement he has for the manifesting effective benevolence as towards them—an inducement which in this way selfregarding prudence suffices to afford the less the need the less strong the inducement but the monarch is of all men the man who by a vast amount has least need of kindness and free good will and good offices and services at the hands of others—of the fruits of effective benevolence unmixed with those of selfregarding prudence for whatsoever good things in other situations men are indebted for to effective benevolence it is in his power to command partly by punitive power partly by remuneration so the more extensively a man feels himself exposed to illtreatment at the hands of others the stronger is the inducement he has to bestow upon them good treatment for the purpose of averting from him the effects of such their illwill the less extensive the exposure the less the inducement but the monarch is of all men the one who stands the least extensively exposed to illtreatment at the hands of others he is in a more especial degree guarded against it by the punitive branch of his power and again by the remunerative by which he can obtain the good offices and support of others and without need of kindness on their parts of these circumstances belonging to his condition the result has been already stated to place not according to the vulgar mode of designation at the top but at the lowest point in the scale of moral worth him whose place in the scale of power is at the summit if the current mode of estimation is in so strange a degree erroneous where shall the cause of the error be looked for the reason may be given in two words—corruption and delusion thus it is that to every practical purpose in the situation of monarch inaptitude in that branch which stands opposed to appropriate moral aptitude should in all places and all times be regarded as consummate be the man who he may that thing whatever it be by the contemplation of which no uneasiness is produced in his mind that thing it is not possible he should have any desire to remove be the sufferers among his subjects ever so numerous—be their sufferings ever so intense ever so long protracted seen or unseen—no uneasiness capable of procuring a relaxation of those same sufferings can ever find entrance into a breast so situated why because experience being altogether wanting no conception of those same sufferings can ever have had place in any such highseated breast in a word to sympathy of affection correspondent sympathy of conception is indispensable next as to intellectual aptitude the inaptitude opposed to appropriate intellectual aptitude is also in this case at the maximum in respect of moral aptitude the condition of the monarch as such being that which has been described the consequence is that towards the greatest happiness of the greatest number all that in the situation in question could be done by intellectual aptitude if raised to its maximum would be the preserving that same greatest number from such unhappiness as should in the eyes of the monarch not be contributory to his own felicity but by the care taken of his own felicity at the expense     of theirs their infelicity on his part may be raised to a height to which no limit can be assignable but in comparison with other men who have had the advantages of what is called a liberal education intellectual aptitude is in the situation of monarch by unchangeable causes placed at the lowest pitch of the two branches of intellectual aptitude appropriate knowledge is that in respect of which the deficiency is less considerable and less uniformly exemplified in the situation of monarch as in every other situation man is necessarily for a length of time more or less considerable placed by the infirmity attached to immaturity of age in a state of subjection during his continuance in that state not only knowledge at large but knowledge in some sort and degree appropriate is injected into the infirm and unresisting mind knowledge—but of what sort the answer is—no matter of what sort in respect of moral aptitude the condition and situation of the royal pupil being what it is any infirmity in his mind even supposing it ever so perfect can scarcely be matter of regret the knowledge supposing him to have any or the judgment could not in that situation be applied to any other purpose than the giving extent and promptitude to the sinister sacrifice it being thus certain that with a receptacle so situated no sort of matter contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number could keep its place even if injected which is what it never would be it may therefore accordingly be stated as a matter not worth thinking about with what rubbish the receptacle may happen to be filled as no considerable good could be produced by any such injection so neither could evil take for example information concerning the most apt means for promoting the only interest which can be the object of regard—means for giving the maximum of extent and promptitude to the sinister sacrifice a scheme of instruction by which all such pernicious knowledge would be excluded would it not be preferable it may be asked to a scheme in which it were comprised the answer is—no for in this way the supply afforded by others the supply afforded by the minister whoever he happens to be who holds the seals of office while the royal pupil holds the sceptre—this supply will at all times be perfect to the situation of monarch it belongs to find will to the situation of minister it belongs to find knowledge to find judgment and if need be to find invention such as on each occasion shall be necessary and sufficient to give effect to that will but to do so requires a degree of exertion of mental labour much beyond the greatest quantity which in the situation of monarch it is consistent with human nature to bestow this being admitted it follows that from no stock of appropriate knowledge which in the situation of monarch the mind of man is capable of finding room for can the mass which will be applied to the business of government receive increase one thing of which the noninjection is matter of certainty is soon stated this is the axiom by which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is stated as the only justifiable end of government that no such position could by any preceptor be placed before the royal pupil in the character of a true one is sufficiently evident for in this position is included among others this namely that no such office as that which he is destined to fill ought to have place in any community and that the only good act which is capable of being done by any one who is invested with it is to suppress it to abolish the system of government of which it forms a part and substitute a representative democracy various are the inducements it need scarce be observed any one of which would abundantly suffice to produce this negative effect to the community the advice would be unavailing for in no case would the pupil follow it to the pupil it would be unpleasant to the prospects of the preceptor ruinous the only right and proper end of your government is your own greatest happiness suppose this commodious axiom substituted for the other incommodious one the two latter inconveniences are avoided while to the interest of the community at large no damage is done since by any advice to the opposite effect the minutes employed in giving expression to it would be so much time thrown away so necessarily and so intensely afflictive is the treatment which through system and cool reflection the results of sound judgment subjects are almost sure to receive at the hands of the most intelligent monarch that any ulterior suffering they may stand exposed to from mental derangement in the same quarter it may be thought scarce worth adding to the account but by the extraordinary proportion of the individuals known to have laboured under malady in this shape some clue may be afforded towards a right conception of the character of the class and the effect produced on the mind by power in excess in this extraordinary case if the mischief to which the community is exposed is not so great as in the ordinary one the absurdity of submitting to it is more flagrant and the depravity moral and intellectual taken together manifested on the part of a nation which submits to it at the same time but too incontestably demonstrated in every monarchical state the great probability always is that in the proportion of several to one at any given     period the fate of all its members will be in the hands of a madman look now to the electors of a president of the angloamerican united states of their placing a madman in the situation of chief functionary from this moment to the end of time by what numbers shall the degree of probability be represented the curious circumstance is that down to the moment when the condition of the sufferer is too manifest to be any longer concealed from the public eye the features of superhuman excellence in all its shapes in general and that of consummate wisdom in particular will still be his by the unanimous testimony of all who hope for any good thing or fear for any evil thing at his hands by the unanimous voice of all corruptionists and hypocrites echoed by the unanimous chorus of their dupes in him the priests will continue to behold the most religious the lawyers the most just the diplomatists the wisest the courtiers the most gracious—all these in chorus together with the hireling writers will proclaim him in one word the best of monarchs present past or future every monarch is a slaveholder upon the largest scale and in that relation each correlative is corrupted by the relation he bears to the other under a monarchy the population is composed of the insulters and the insulted of the corrupters and the corrupted of the deluders and the deluded of bullies and cowards of hypocrites and dupes when once the human race is rid of the two congenial plagues monarchy and slaveholding with how contemptuous a sympathy will not the present generation be regarded by all succeeding ones if where the monarch is a madman the people are not worse afflicted than they are seen to be it is because the operations of government are directed not by the determinations of the madman himself but by those of a knot of courtiers in his name whom accident has thrown in his way in such sort as to have become chosen by him to be made the instruments of his will in the several departments or rather and what is more simple some one of them who has had the good fortune to persuade him that by the choice of that one instrument his desires are likely to receive a more extensive gratification than by the choice of any other individual which individual is then prime minister exercising the powers of the monarch and easing him of the whole detail of the cares of government certain subjectmatters there are about which the nominal monarch and the operative submonarch are at all times and in all places agreed the accumulating in the hands of the monarch of the external instruments of felicity in as large a mass as possible in particular—power money and means of vengeance at whatever expense on each occasion the sacrifice is to be made whether at the expense of his own subjects or the members of a foreign state or of both together as in so far as war is the occasion cannot but be the case in this master and servant behold the common end and to the servant it belongs to provide the means in the shape and in the quantity necessary and sufficient for its purposes thus far they are sure to agree meantime the occasions for disagreement can never altogether be wanting with the monarch the first object is of course to provide for his personal gratifications but for this no funds which it is in the power of the minister to provide can ever be sufficient buildings suffice of themselves to create an appetite the satiation of which is impossible to decorate one single spot during a course of years cost france under louis the fourteenth a sum—recollection is not able to state in what degree above or below the whole expense of government during that time the allotment of all the situations attached to the official establishment is regarded by the minister as being at his disposal but the monarch has in both sexes his associates his instruments of pleasure in all its forms—in a word his favourites these favourites are not themselves men of business or women of business but each such favourite is himself or herself as the case may be connected with a number of dependents among whom men of business and men desiring to be men of business are abundant a vacancy takes place and now comes the contest the contest between the monarchs dependent and the ministers dependent meantime the process of depredation and oppression goes on its course the torment of the people goes on increasing increasing and in such sort that it finds its way even to the royal or imperial breast how so is it that in that breast there ever did exist or ever can exist any real sympathy for the misery of the people not until it has first existed in his bronze similitude but be the palace where it may the discontented are to be found in it next to none can have all they wish for and every one who cannot have all he wishes for is more or less discontented so many discontented persons so many eventual talebearers and accusers of the minister watching every occasion that affords a promise of being a favourable one a class of misdeeds the idea of which is in every state of things of a nature to create in the royal breast a sentiment of displeasure is every considerable depredation in the benefit of which he has not either in his own person or in that of a favourite any share a misdeed which in ordinary times in the ordinary state of things is not of a nature to produce any such displeasure is the production of human suffering from which whatsoever be the amount no disturbance to his own ease is apprehended—and which threatens not to be productive of anything worse than suffering on the part of the people     but by those by whom injury in all its forms is done day by day to millions and to many of them in its worst forms no certain assurance can ever be obtained but that among the millions whom oppression has wounded there may not be some one into whose hands despair may have put the dagger of an assassin but that of so many thousands who are throwing away their lives in the endeavour to destroy by thousands strangers none of whom have done them any injury some one may stand up and turn the instrument of death against an individual against whom there is no other mode of defence whose whole life from beginning to end is one continued act of injury to the millions whose lot has cast them under his feet fear of personal safety is therefore of necessity one among the attendants round every throne when therefore by the lips of an aspiring talebearer hints are given of the misery endured by the oppressed people fear of course presents itself to the imagination meantime whether sanity or insanity be the state of the monarch—whether in the acts to which the name of the monarch is affixed the judgment and the individually directed will have any or no part—be the whole tenor of the government more or less predatory more or less oppressive—the suffering of the people more or less intense—the conduct and frame of mind of the monarch is depicted in all statements which have any pretensions to the character of authenticity under the same aspect of unrivalled and unwearied excellence for the bodies of two monarchs two portraits both indeed beautiful but beautiful in two different forms are found necessary but for the minds of the two one and the same portrait is always found sufficient in england of the hundreds of laws passed every year not one is passed in and by which the king does not join with the sham representatives of the people and the but too real representatives of the lords in declaring himself to be the most excellent by the declaration of all who join in the devotion in a church of england church every english king is most gracious and most religious most gracious alike he who never smiles and he who sometimes does smile religious alike the bigot and the unbeliever the infidel with a mask and the infidel without a mask sunday after sunday charles the second while making his jokes of which religion was the standing object—charles the second who was really the most gracious of english kings heard himself proclaimed in the same breath by consecrated lips the most religious in compensation for all this evil it rests upon the advocates of monarchy to show if they are able in which way it is that by an individual with the title and power of king or emperor is produced a mass of good outweighing that evil being at the same time greater than that which would be produced by that same individual in the situation of chief of a republic that a greater addition is made to the stock of happiness in their respective communities by emperor alexander or king george than was by president maddison or is by president monroe in the angloamerican united states with respect to a pure monarchy though it may in any particular instance by accident be less bad yet an aristocracyridden monarchy of which corruption is the characteristic instrument and distinguishing feature may by accident and that an accident of no unfrequent occurrence be still worse folly next to idiotcy or tyranny next to raving madness may at any time be the condition of the one upon whom the condition of every other member of the community depends† and so long as this is the case either by the monarch himself or upon some one located by such a monarch are all official situations filled and in that case upon what footing the probability of official aptitude and official frugality stands may be left to be imagined but in a pure monarchy not only fear but a more generous sentiment might of itself suffice at any time to produce a felicitous change in an aristocracyridden monarchy fear is the only source of hope effective benevolence on this extensive scale why should it not take the place of playing at soldiers or field sports or games of skill or chance catherine the second and george the third differed about the dominion of the seas but agreed in turning buttons george kept to the buttons catherine quitted them for codification and though her patterns out of which she made her patchwork were inadequate they were the best that were to be had amongst other reasons in favour of a democracy is the absence of the great prize by the appetite for which private assassination and civil war are so apt to be produced in monarchies established by nicholas a free representative assembly would be a life insurance office the only one in which an autocrat can insure his own life pure monarchy is the rock which having been placed and poised by accident the push of a finger has sufficed to move broad at bottom pointed at top a representative democracy is a pyramid what the aristocrats aim at is security for themselves as against the monarch with the largest possible share in his power and without any security for the millions against that depredation in the profit of which they are sharers sharers in his power together with the money and the exaltation attached to both and for the exaltation at the expense of the millions there is no humiliation they will not submit to as towards the monarch for they     receive in return the humiliation of the millions therefore the greater his exaltation the greater is theirs they are thus gainers by the humiliation they submit to as to security what they would wish is that for the people against themselves in union with the monarch there should be none while against the people for themselves and the monarch it should be entire in the view taken of the field of legislation by the scribe of the absolute monarch it swarms in every part with rebels to afford security to him against the enterprises of adversaries in this shape is the most anxious of his cares he is encompassed with enemies on all sides and at all times the very form of his government the objects and designs so undisguisedly evidenced by it suffices to convert into adversaries to him all men who are not so to their fellowcountrymen and themselves of their hatred he assures himself of the justness of it as well as of the impossibility of keeping it from coming into existence he is fully conscious the utmost he can hope for is to guard himself against that part of its effects which is most formidable to him in this view he scruples not to appoint punishment for the manifestation of it punishment for all those who seeing what he is make known to others what they see punishing all who on any occasion on which their sentiments are other than favourable to him make known those sentiments if there be any sure methods of creating hatred this is one of them but seeing love hopeless seeing every affection better than hatred inconsistent with every rational view of the case he is content thus to draw upon himself hatred for the additional chance which he thus thinks to give himself of escaping from the effects of it thus in the case of the absolute monarch and in this respect the case of the limited monarch is not materially different turn now to the case of representative democracy in the representative democracy there are no rebels in the penal code of the representative democracy there is no such crime as rebellion in the representative democracy there is government there may therefore be resistance to government in the representative democracy there are rulers there may therefore be resistance to rulers under one government as well as under another resistance to rule must be punished or there is no rule but it is punished as such and only as such and not as rebellion suppose even a conspiracy to overturn the government and substitute to it an absolute monarchy for under every such democracy the supposition may be made though under the only established democracy as yet exemplified the fact is morally impossible suppose then a conspiracy thus to destroy the government the conspirators are enemies but they are not rebels the state they have placed themselves in with relation to the rulers and the rest of the community is a state of war being enemies the case of selfdefence renders it necessary they should be treated as such they must be opposed and by any means disabled from giving effect to their mischievous endeavours but as in the case of external enemies so in the case of these internal ones such means of selfdefence as are least mischievous to both parties taken together are the only means suitable or justifiable as to hatred—hatred fixed on one fixed object here there is no such thing pure monarchy was the original because the simplest form of government it had its origin in the necessity men were under of putting themselves under the command of a single chief in the wars between one savage or barbarous tribe and another thus came on the one part the habit of obedience on the other part the habit of command and by the frequency of actual war and the constancy of preparation for a state of war the habit of obedience and command was preserved from interruption the children and next relations of the monarch being naturally most frequently in his company and in the largest proportion sharers in his confidence hence it was that the elective monarchy naturally passed into an hereditary one but though this was the natural and in early times the inevitable state of things it follows not that it was the state of things in the highest degree contributory to the greatest happiness of the greatest number monarchy comes to have place now by its being established almost all men are born under it all men are used to it few men are used to anything else till of late years nobody ever dispraised it every body praised it nobody saw anything better nobody knew of anything better few had heard of anything better men were reconciled to mixed monarchy in england by the same causes by which they were reconciled to pure monarchy in morocco turkey and hindostan no state of things so bad but that acquiescence under it may be produced by ignorance of better in a word by habit by authority and by the instruments of corruption and delusion by which it became surrounded it was not by any experience or supposition of its advantages that it became established or has been continued meaning its advantages to the many by whose obedience and acquiescence the power belonging to it is constituted section iii monarchy—its instruments—corporeal and incorporeal the frame of mind given to man by this situation has been seen above behold him now in action in the field of political life action cannot be without instruments his instruments real and corporeal are three the soldier the lawyer and the priest     his fictitious and incorporeal are four force fear corruption and delusion with these incorporeal instruments he by the hands of his corporeal instruments works for the sake of an always questionable and at the utmost comparatively inconsiderable addition to his own felicity to give unquestionable existence to human suffering in all its shapes and infinite in quantity—this is the course of action which at every moment of his life the sinister interest inseparably attached to his situation urges him to and power being in adequate quantity always in his hands the result as has been mentioned is correspondent vain would it be to say evil in all these shapes is the effect of man in general of government in general not of monarchy in the persons of the monarch and his instruments no they are not the effects of government they are only the effects of misgovernment they are not the effects of government for a representative democracy is a government the angloamerican united states are a representative democracy and in the united states no such evil effects have place archforciant archterrorist archcorruptor archdeluder—this a monarch is by the mere virtue of his situation without need of action on his part without need of so much as volition without any such interruption to his ease his instruments in their several situations are subforciant subterrorist subcorruptor and subdeluder as to the corporeal instruments each of them contributes in his own particular way to the common end the fulfilment of the constantly sinister will of the public enemy in one way or other on one occasion or other all the several incorporeal instruments of misrule operate in their hands by this or that corporeal this or that incorporeal instrument is made most use of by this or that other corporeal this or that other incorporeal as to the soldier force and intimidation are the incorporeal instruments which in the more direct and intentional way under a monarchy he is occupied in applying to the allembracing and constantly pursued purpose but by his pay and privileges he is made to belong to the monarchs stock of the instruments of corruption while by the place he occupies in the vast machine of which he is one of the puppets and the glitter with which he is environed he contributes at the same time to the amusement of his owner and to the delusion of the subject many—setting to work their imagination perverting their judgment and from the power and splendour which they see causing them to infer the existence of the excellence moral and intellectual which they imagine next as to the lawyer external are the enemies against whom the force and intimidation by which the soldier operates are principally and most avowedly prepared but incidentally as often as occasion calls the force has for its destination the being employed against the subjectcitizens in their character of most natural most constant and nearest enemies the force which it is his destination to apply is in each instance applied upon the largest scale the enemies to which that force is applied which is at the command of the lawyer are no other than those same internal enemies and in its application to them it operates upon the smallest scale force and intimidation are the only instruments to the use of which the operations of the soldier are properly directed of corruptive influence he sees no need of delusive influence as little delusion is the instrument for the application of which the faculties of the lawyer are principally applied with most constancy and most energy by the force of his imagination he creates a sort of god or goddess upon earth a sort of divinity which he calls common law of this goddess the principal occupation is the finding pretences for giving fulfilment to the monarchs sinister will as evidenced by his sinister interest to lodge in the hands of the monarch the external instruments of felicity in the largest quantity and to exercise for that purpose the arts of depredation and oppression all for the benefit of the monarch his subordinate occupation subordinate in profession principal of course in fact is to exercise the same arts for his own benefit the common law not having any existence cannot serve as a justification for any thing in the face of the whole community who in so far as they have courage and energy to open their eyes see that it has no existence—in the face of the whole community the existence of this goddess is on every occasion asserted and to this goddess are ascribed the two wills to which execution and effect are to be given the will of the monarch and the will of the judge what for the benefit of the monarch the judge has been inflicting on the people to a certain superior degree the monarch connives at his inflicting for his own benefit in a certain inferior degree now as to the priest in him may be seen another of the monarchs corporeal instruments of whom delusion is the principally employed incorporeal instrument physical force belongs not to his province intimidation yes but it is by delusion that the intimidation is produced the business of the lawyer is to do in the first place the will of the monarch in the next place his own in this the business of the lawyer and that of the priest agree what difference has place between them lies in the means in the different forms and degrees of the intimidation they employ     in respect of moral frame of mind widely different are the effects which under a monarchy are produced in the three professions the soldier stands by himself force and intimidation the instruments he applies are no other than those without the eventual application of which the best government could no more have existence than the worst neither corruption nor delusion does it belong to his province to apply neither of the one nor the other instrument is the application expected at his hands neither the one nor the other is it natural for him to seek to apply delusion in particular is much more likely to find in him a contemner than an approver between the lawyer and the priest the similarity of situation and thence of frame of mind is close and intimate in governments in a state reputed semibarbarous they have been united in the same person in england priests were for a long time the only lawyers the coif over the covering of the priestly tonsure is still an ingredient in the composition of the masquerade dress with which the lawyer bears evidence of the association to this day in the mahomedan religion the priest is the only judge in england the instances are at the present day abundant in which the subordinate judicial situation of the local judge called justice of the peace is added to the functions performed or not performed of the priest in so far as for relief from their sufferings the mind of the people can find a place for hope the situation and natural character of the soldier is the chief if not the only source that can be found for it the great instrument of democratical government the great support of the universal interest of the people against all particular and sinister interests—the force of the popular or moral sanction brought into action by the publicopinion tribunal—has everywhere and at all times found far more sensibility to it in the breast of the soldier than in the breasts of either of those functionaries who work with delusion for their instrument accordingly on those great occasions in which against oppression by monarchs the interest of subjects has found effectual supporters soldiers have been so by thousands lawyers and priests only by units in an army a standing army the monarch beholds the support to his power at home and abroad an instrument for the extension of it at the expense of the other members of his own community—his subjects as the phrase is a toy to play with a doll to dress up an instrument of delusion for producing to his own advantage erroneous conception on the part of the people and an instrument for the gratification of vanity on the occasion of his intercourse with the other members of the confraternity of monarchs of his personal gratification in all other shapes the more immediate instruments are his courtiers between his courtiers and his generals the benefit of whatsoever real sympathy the individual nature of the monarch is susceptible of is shared with the contempt of which all who are beneath him are essentially objects a mixture of sympathy and affection for those who are about him is not impossible in the case of no others does the contempt admit of any other admixture than that of antipathy and hatred in the lawyer he is not likely to find a favourite neither in the idea of an intellect replete with absurdity of morals distinguished by harshness exercised in the production of suffering and by an intensity of reflection that seems to put an exclusion upon gaiety as well as sincerity is there much to attract sympathy or promise amusement in the priest he is not likely to find a favourite neither in the repulsive aspect of melancholy nor in that of imposture assumed for its own benefit is there anything to attract sympathy or promise amusement regarded in the character of necessary instruments men in their situations will naturally be treated with more or less of condescension and marks of kindness and esteem by a man in his but unless they are and in so far as they are willing and able to divest themselves of their distinctive professional characters their company will not naturally be very acceptable section iv monarchs interest—how far opposite to how far coincident with the universal interest a community of interest it may be said has place between a monarch and his subjects and this community of interest will suffice for securing them against ill treatment at his hands for securing to them the best treatment in his power true there is a community of interest between a postmaster and his posthorses but this community of interest suffices not for saving them from an untimely death at the end of a life of torment the interest which a monarch has in common with his subjects is not sufficient to render him in general so well disposed towards his subjects as a postmaster is to his posthorses spite of whatsoever there is in common between the two interests in the breast of every monarch the tendency of his disposition is at all times and in all places to produce the greatest infelicity of the greatest number such is everywhere the tendency necessarily produced by his situation and such everywhere except in so far as accidental circumstances have risen up in opposition to such tendency has been and so long as a monarchy exists upon the face of the earth will be the effect the more particularly the several shapes in which interest has place in the two situations are examined into—the more particularly the     several departments in the field of legislation to which it applies are examined into the less numerous the points of coincidence the more numerous the points of opposition as between the two interests will be seen to be take in the first place the two immediately subordinate ends of the constitutional code—maximization of appropriate aptitude on the part of functionaries and minimization of the expense attached to the employment of them as to expense with relation to the interest of the monarch the aggregate of the expense may be distinguished into two portions that in respect to which his profit is equal to the expense—the whole being to him so much profit and that in respect of which his profit though not equal to the expense is in proportion to it increasing as it increases next as to appropriate aptitude in a republic appropriate aptitude means aptitude with reference to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in a monarchy appropriate aptitude means aptitude with reference to the supposed greatest happiness of number one but on the imagination and judgment of this same number one the greatest happiness of this same number one will consist in the subserviency of all other wills and of the conduct of all other persons on each occasion to the will of this same number one but what may happen and has continually been happening is that while in the breasts of the greatest number of his subjects infelicity has been continually on the increase the will of number one has been continually obeyed by all take in the next place the four immediately subordinate ends of the nonpenal or distributive branch of law subsistence abundance security and equality maximized in so far as the less important are compatible with the more important   subsistence this it is true it is his interest they should have that is to say such of them as are in a condition to work and can be made to work but it is the interest of the greatest number that whether able or not able to work they should live which is as much as to say that they should have subsistence   abundance this also it is his interest they should have and the greater the quantity they produce and thence have the greater the quantity which it will be in his power as it cannot fail to be in his inclination to get out of them for himself but so long as by any act of his any addition how small soever which would otherwise be made to the stock of the matter of abundance passes into and through his hands—how great soever may be the quantity which by the same act is taken out of their hands or prevented from finding its way into them will with reference to his interest be matter of indifference   security security is for body mind reputation pecuniary property power condition in life it is against injury at the hands of external evildoers internal evildoers not being functionaries and internal evildoers being functionaries security against external evildoers i e against foreign enemies his personal interest prompts him to maximize so long as no expectation of profit presents itself from the diminution or destruction of it but that which he is continually upon the watch to get is an augmentation of the mass of the external instruments of felicity in his hands at the expense of other communities and by means of war—that is murder upon the largest scale—he never can get it but by the diminution of the security of his subjects as to security against misdeeds on the part of functionaries security against the abuse of their own power—the very idea of it is intolerable as if in their hands power were capable of being abused—as if wrong could be done by him by whom no wrong can be done—by him for whose benefit that which if done by another would be wrong is by the mere circumstance of its being by him that it is done converted into right   equality in a republic the instrument of felicity thus denominated is watched and guarded with peculiarly anxious care it is prized not only as being in its own character an instrument of felicity but an instrument of security for security itself in particular for securing all the several instruments of felicity to all the members of the community against invasion on the part of such of them as are in the situation of public functionaries but to the monarch the very word is an object of abhorrence to give admission to it in the list of fit ends of the distributive branch of law is at once to put an exclusion upon his office to shut the door of the official establishment against him of all the imaginable instruments of felicity that can be named not one is there in which he can endure the idea of seeing any other member of the community possessing an equal share in particular not so much as an equal share in the protection of the laws in the benefit derived from the services of the officers belonging to the judicial department directed as they are or ought to be to the securing to every member of the community his proper share in the aggregate stock of the external instruments of felicity against evil in the several shapes in which it is endeavoured to be excluded by prohibition and punishment attached to the several misdeeds by which it is liable to be produced in the next place take the penal branch of law immediately subordinate ends—beneficial effect of the distributive branch of law maximized punishment minimized with regard to the distributive branch of law taken in its several subbranches it has been seen how far in the situation of monarch his particular interest is accordant and coincident with the universal interest how far opposite to it first then as to the maximization of the     beneficial effect in question so far as the abovementioned coincidence has place it is his interest that the universally beneficial effect may by all imaginable means and by this principal means in particular be maximized but so far as instead of coincidence opposition has place this same particular interest of his requires that the amount of these same beneficial effects be minimized or in other words that none such should exist but that the opposite evils should have place next as to the minimization of punishment so far as by the infliction of punishment misdeeds on the part of any individual in or not in the situation of functionary tending to promote his particular interest—vengeance and ease included—would be repressed his interest requires that no punishment at all be inflicted or if any none beyond the least possible so far as by the infliction of punishment acts tending to the security of individuals against misdeeds the commission of which as above is required by his particular interest would be prevented and thence his power of evildoing restricted or any gratification afforded to his appetite for vengeance or any security afforded him against disturbance to his ease his particular interest requires that punishment be minimized so much as to the several external instruments of felicity and proper subordinate ends of government as to moral virtue or speaking with relation to felicity moral aptitude this his interest prompts him to maximize on the part of his subjects viz so far and so far only as by the possession of it they are disposed to do his will and contribute to the advancement of his particular interest but at the same time his interest renders him desirous to minimize it in so far as by the possession of it men are disposed to thwart his personal interest in all its several branches preferring their own interests respectively to his as to intellectual virtue or say intellectual aptitude in proportion as useful knowledge and sound judgment as applied to the field of legislation increase the opposition of the interest of the monarch to the rest of the community will become more manifest and with it the want of virtue moral as well as intellectual betrayed by the nation by which any such office in the official establishment is suffered to have existence an office which may be styled that of malefactorgeneral section v cause of monarchical misrule—sinister interest not upright prejudice the amount of misrule and its effects being given a standing question a question that on each occasion presents itself is—as to how much of it is owing to moral inaptitude how much to intellectual how much to sinister interest how much to prejudice whether interestbegotten or derived from other causes the question however is a matter rather of curiosity than of use of use to the purpose of affording guidance to practice take this or that antipopular arrangement at pleasure if not its creation its preservation is at any rate the work of the sinister interest independently of the sinister interest be the institution be the arrangement be the phantasm of the imagination ever so absurd go back far enough you may always find honest absurdity honest intellectual weakness sufficient for the creation of it how can it be otherwise—since among the people at large notions fraught with absurdity are not without example notions which being adverse to the interest of those by whom they are entertained cannot have had for their cause sinister interest at any rate cannot have had correct perception of particular interest but so long as it is by the sinister interest that the causes of evil are supported and maintained whether it was in the moral part or in the intellectual part of the mental frame that the evil had originally its rise makes nothing to any practical purpose many are the instances in which that which at first sight will present itself as the result of intellectual weakness will on scrutiny be seen to have been the genuine fruit of sinister interest and the more closely the mechanism of misrule is scrutinized into the more extensively will this genealogy be seen to have had place one universally applying maxim the genuine fruit of the sinister interest serves as a means of preservation to absurdity in every imaginable shape though the absurd institution or arrangement is not productive of any immediate advantage to yourself says the modern machiavel to his patron preserve it notwithstanding for though the existence of it does not serve the abolition of it would disserve your own particular interest to justify the abolition it would be necessary to bring into action some position conformable to reason and bearing a reference more or less obvious to the allcomprehensive and universallyapplying principle—the greatesthappiness principle but by homage paid to that principle you put arms into the hands of the adversary when the absurd arrangement from which you derive no advantage is disposed of presently after comes the adversary and proposes the abolition of an absurd institution and arrangement from which you do derive advantage and as a ground for the proposition out comes this position which you yourself having made use of and paid homage to you cannot oppose or elude the force of without rendering your insincerity and the corruptness of your disposition manifest let this then be the general rule acted upon in all cases—whatsoever institution or arrangement is adverse to the universal interest     is the result of the particular and thence sinister interest of the ruling class in few instances indeed if in any will the position be wrong in theory where it is wrong the error will not be productive of any evil consequence in practice not so if the cause being sinister interest the effect is ascribed to a mere error of the understanding in this case it is to the curing men of their error that all your exertions will be directed—to the changing into converts the opponents you have to deal with full of this conception you will keep labouring and labouring on till you are tired while you are labouring the adversary is laughing in his sleeve another bad consequence so much for your adversaries the corruptionists now for the bystanders in the character of members of the publicopinion tribunal seeing that even in your opinion all its hostility notwithstanding the fault if any is in the understanding of your adversary not in his will—in the intellectual part of his frame not in the moral—they in their impartial situation cannot think less favourably of him than you do in your hostilely partial situation along with you they will keep looking for the time when in consequence of the rectification of his judgment his conduct will be rectified which time the cause of the wrong not being in that place will never come all this while had the real seat of the wrong been known to them they might have acted accordingly seeing the adversary in his true colours they might have joined with you in acting upon him in the only quarter in which from this time to the end of time he can be acted upon with effect—they might have acted upon his fears whatsoever talent and whatsoever industry there is being employed in keeping the sinister interest covered by a veil as impenetrable as possible no wonder if it should escape from the observation of most eyes behold an example of the mischief to the people from the imputing to error the result of sinister interest true cause of the excess in military establishments kings sinister interest erroneously ascribed as being necessary to defence against foreign aggression when in this way rulers have at such vast expense done each of them his utmost then will they be all of them with their respective masses of force bearing one to another a certain proportion keeping thus the same proportion they might divide each of them his force by the same divisor—say two say ten say a hundred and the quotient being in the same proportion the security would on the part of each of them be the same some number of years ago did the idea occur to me—i know not how many except that it must have been before my eyes had applied themselves with any closeness to the constitutional part of the field of law my good fortune—i know not exactly in what way—saved me from the disappointment and loss of time which a proposition of so utopian a cast would have had for its fruit yes were it merely as instruments for the defence of the community and the territory against foreign aggression that an army is kept up but besides that it is kept up for the defence of the country against its inhabitants—for the defence of the monarch his instruments his favourites and his dependents against resistance to legalized depredation oppression and vengeance it is kept up as a toy for the great baby to play with and as an instrument for the gratification of his vanity and how ill any of these purposes would be served by retrenchment is sufficiently obvious while the sinister interest continues on its present footing to propose anything that would be beneficial to the community upon a sufficiently extensive scale to be worth thinking of is not simply useless—it is positively pernicious it operates as a certificate that on the part of those on whom acceptance depends a disposition to act in conformity to the universal interest has place—a certificate which neither is nor by possibility can be true the persons to whom it is addressed are those on whose exertion depends the only state of things in which anything good that depends on government can ever be brought into effect in this same certificate therefore is contained the implied assurance that such exertions are not needed of the existence of this persuasion on the part of the projector a proof is thus given much more conclusive and impressive than could be given by any positive and direct assurance given in words in this case the existence of the persuasion is indubitable for it is upon the ground of it that the man himself has acted in england this hopelessness of everything good has never been a secret to the whigs accordingly show them anything good their answer is of course—under the present administration your plan is hopeless it is a good one and by them no good proposal will ever be adopted by us all good proposals will be adopted if you wish anything good to be done look to us what is true is—that there is not any ground for hope from their antagonists what is not true is—that there is ground of hope from themselves in them there would no more be either power or will to do good than in their more fortunate and prosperous adversaries section vi inaptitude attached to the situation of monarch in a mixed or say limited monarchy—his power having for its instrument of limitation the   0 power of a body acting as a representation of the people inaptitude opposite to moral aptitude in this situation the causes of enmity are more active of resistance the symptoms are continually obtruding themselves on observation though on every occasion the issue is out of hazard on every occasion a contest with circumstances of irritation has place to moral inaptitude in the shape of cruelty is in this situation necessarily added immorality in the shape of insincerity and deception the representation of the people is in a state of corruption the people themselves are in a state of delusion if the representation were not in this state of corruption no such office as the kingly office would continue if the people in a vast proportion were not in a state of delusion no such office as the kingly office would continue of that portion of the external instruments of felicity which otherwise might be and in the situation of absolute monarch would be employed by him in the endeavour how vain soever to make an addition to his own personal felicity—a portion more or less considerable must be employed in the keeping in a state of perpetual corruption and perpetual subserviency to his sinister interest the delegates real or pretended of the people in securing on their part a constant breach of such their trust in the majority of these men the people in as far as they see clearly behold their determined and implacable enemies subordinate depredators who under the orders of the supreme depredator concur with him in the work of depredation at their charge in the eyes of a monarch they are at the same time his enemies partly because the quantity of the matter of depredation seized by them is not adequate to his desires and partly on account of the vast share which he finds himself under the necessity of abandoning to them in consideration of the work which in fulfilment of the sinister contract it it is necessary should be performed on their part at all times until the old man of the sea has been shaken off from the shoulders of sinbad—in every monarchy one and the same option and that in both parts a disastrous one will be presenting itself to the monarchs choice the option between magnitude and stability in some eyes increase of stability may be seen provided for in the expedient of imparting a share of power either to a representation of the people alone or to a selfrepresenting aristocratical body or to both together under a limited monarchy while the subject many have everything to fear from that immorality which in company with a convenient mixture of religious hypocrisy and religious bigotry has its seat in the bosom of the ruling one with the subruling and influential few life property and liberty have everything to fear from the subject many such are they as to morality—such are they as to religion—the ruling one with the subruling few and such of the opulent and influential few as make common cause with him have nothing to fear witness on the one part the manchester massacre men women and children killed by units wounded by hundreds for coming together unarmed to make communication of their sufferings and hold converse on the hope and means of relief a priest ordering the slaughter and receiving at the hands of a servant of the monarch by an act followed by words of general approbation pronounced in the most solemn ceremony by the monarch a benefice of £  00 ayear value for having ordered it witness on the one part this manchester massacre witness on the other part the patience of the subject many under it on the one part slaughtered by wholesale with an avowed readiness on any similar occasion to repeat it—the slaughter upon a general view of it thus avowed while for any such purpose as that of regular and impartial judicature no particular view of it suffered to be taken on the one part slaughter by wholesale thus committed rewarded avowed on the other part no such slaughter by wholesale or so much as by retail executed attempted or so much as recommended on the one part all injury on the other part all patience but when injury has spread to a certain extent and reigned for a certain length of time patience may in the event of its continuing longer on the same spot with injury begin to regard itself as an accomplice and taking counsel of desperation rather than act in that character yield its place to retaliation coming forth under the name of justice section vii in a limited or say rather a mixed monarchy the aristocracy are not in practice coequal with but dependent on and instruments of the monarchy it is by force and intimidation that the conduct of the people at large is determined in england it is by corruptive influence that the conduct of the majority in each of the two houses of parliament is determined in the house of commons in the first instance and then in the house of lords the matter of corruption so far as the monarch is concerned on whose will does the application of it depend on that of the minister and the minister on whose will does his existence in that situation depend on the king let the king give to what man he will the disposal of the matter of corruptive influence the will of that individual is sure to be done by the majority in both houses events may happen events which for a time may make the king see a convenience in substituting to a minister more agreeable to him     a minister less agreeable to him but in this temporary exception there is nothing that detracts from the truth to all practical purposes of the general rule in this there is nothing more than what is every now and then happening in the most absolute governments that of turkey not excepted but the fact is that whatsoever is done it is with the kings will that it is done in each instance it may or may not have originated in the kings will but in whose will soever what is proposed is originated if it be against the kings will it is not done of the absoluteness of the kings power a conclusive proof is that which was brought to view in a house of commons debate in the session of      motion by mr brougham object of it holding up to view what is called the influence of the crown that is to say the absoluteness of the kings power in respect of giving determination to the proceedings of the two sets of functionaries who are sharers with him in the supreme operative proof this—when a man has been appointed to the situation of prime minister a majority of the commons house will vote according to his will after having but a few days before namely when he was not minister but in opposition voted against it instances have happened in which the king has discarded a minister whom he had rather have kept and appointed a minister whom he had rather not have appointed true but the minister who was not agreeable to him never for any considerable length of time has been kept in office in the year   0  lord grenville mr fox and mr addington were in office together lord grenville and mr fox were men disagreeable to the then king lord grenville on one account mr fox on another lord grenville from his personal demeanour mr fox from the too great popularity of the principles professed by him it was the desire of lord grenville that the oppression under which the catholics had so long been suffering should be removed this was also the desire of mr fox but the will of the king was opposite and inflexible he refused to adopt the measure found a favourable opportunity for getting rid of them and dismissed them mr addington was a man found to be agreeable to a king whoever the king were so mr addington was retained section viii monarch—folly of regarding the personal deportment of as a pattern for subjects geo iii if as above in every intelligible and useful sense of the words bad and good so far from being the best the monarch is naturally the very worst—the most maleficent member of the whole community—judge from him of the consequence of taking him and his conduct as a pattern for others—his conduct for their conduct by beneficence positive or even negative on a small scale he obtains a reputation by which he is enabled to practise without reproach maleficence on the largest scale curse on his virtues they have destroyed his country george the third because he behaved well to his wife was proclaimed the best of kings hereupon whatever good conduct has place in domestic life on the part of the other members of the community this one has the credit of it now mind the evil consequence of what is good and bad in private and in particular in domestic life men in all situations are competent judges and in the habit of regarding themselves as being so and taking cognizance of the conduct of others in consequence on the other hand of what is good and bad in public life the greatest number are not as yet competent judges yet in some monarchies—england for example—scarce an individual to whom it is not matter of habit to speak occasionally of the monarch and hear him spoken of and with some adjunct of general approbation or disapprobation such as good and bad attached to his official or personal name but for a comparatively rare occurrence this epithet will be of the approbative kind the reason has been already mentioned note then the consequence so it be but through the ordinary causes namely war and selfish indulgence in the shape of what is called magnificence there is no quantity of mischief so great in shape of waste and depredation and murder so it be upon a national scale that a man in that situation may not be the author of still remaining the object of general love and admiration meantime what shall we say of those who seeing before them and set over them a man whose conduct is stained with these atrocities gives to them the sunshine of his approbation by thus adding the word good or its equivalent to the name official or personal of the author of evil on this largest scale whatever he may be in intention in fact and in effect he is an accessory to all the atrocities by which the object of his illplaced eulogy has been making an incontrovertible title to universal abhorrence if in the course of a war for the gratification of the monarchs rapacity or antipathy—a war in a word without necessity—a million of human beings have been consigned to untimely death here are a million of murders committed and he who thus pours forth benedictions on the head of the author is accessory before or after the fact to all these murders     nine times in the course of his sixty years reign did george the third with his everready accomplices force the people to pay his debts the trader who by inevitable misfortune—mere misfortune without the smallest cause of reproach even on the score of imprudence is rendered insolvent—is thereby rendered in a greater or less degree an object of disrespect still more and in an increasing ratio if the like misfortune comes upon him a second time the insolvencies of george the third were in every instance the result of his own profusion without the smallest admixture of misfortune no money could be issued without his signature and he was notoriously attentive as well as punctual in the giving of it he made immense profit by his wars—profit to himself and family witness the droits of admiralty and he took care to exempt himself from loss witness the exemption from the incometax given to his private property in government annuities—or the funds as the phrase is in spain about the year      the avowed expenditure upon the persons of the king and his family amounted to onefourth of the whole expenditure of government and to this avowed unavowed expenditure was known to be added to a vast though necessarily unascertainable amount of this expenditure be it what it may not a particle is of any real use to the people in any shape not a particle that besides the suffering produced by the loss by the forced contribution is not productive of evil to an immense amount for of the matter of wealth thus extorted and wasted every particle operates as matter of corruption it would be a calculation no less curious than instructive how many of the people by the support thus given to the lustre of the crown are every year consigned to lingering death for want of sufficient food how many prevented from coming into existence the result is—that in all branches the inaptitude is on all occasions not in the individual but in the situation not in the particular nature of the individual in question but in the general nature of the situation that the situation being what it is the inaptitude is absolutely irremediable and that therefore whatsoever be the political state the existence of any such situation in the official establishment is utterly incompatible with the greatest happiness of the greatest number—utterly incompatible with everything to which the appellation of good government can with any propriety be applied that if by a good king is meant a king by whose existence more happiness would have place in the community than would have place if neither he nor any other individual having the same powers were in existence—there never has been nor ever can be any such person as a good king and that every man who is a king is by the mere circumstance of his being a king rendered of necessity a bad one to talk of a good king is to talk of white ink or black snow in conjunction with external circumstances idiosyncrasy may have rendered and in fact to a certain degree always does render this or that king less bad than this or that other but to the practical purpose of the question every such inquiry into the character of this or that individual in that same situation is needless and useless indeed worse than useless the tendency of it being to lead men to suppose that from a substitution of one individual to another in that situation the evil may be capable of receiving a remedy which as already shown is not true what in this case is the measure of the quality of bandess or say depravity in the human mind is it the quantity of human misery produced is it the degree of steadiness with which the probability of its being produced is contemplated and the fixedness of the determination to persevere in the endeavour to give existence to it is it the absence of that distress which in some cases is by general acknowledgment sufficient to render depredation and even intentional homicide justifiable with these considerations in mind compare the best of monarchs with the worst of private and punishable malefactors—see whether as in the scale of political so in the scale of moral depravity the place of the unpunishable malefactor is not above that of the punishable malefactor as it is in the case of that situation by which the largest mass of political power is conferred so is it in every inferior one the probable quantity of virtue in a man is not in the direct but as will be seen in the inverse ratio of his altitude in the composite scale composed of power opulence and factitious dignity section ix influence of monarchy on the state of judicature in a monarchy on the part of the judges corruption has place universally on the part of almost all judges at all places at all times corruption practised upon the largest scale and with impunity and assurance of impunity impunity perfect as against punishment at the hands of the legal sanction and to a vast extent as against punishment at the hands even of the social sanction at the hands of the monarch and those who are in favour with him every man for himself and all those with whom he is connected in the way of interest or sympathy—every man and the judge whoever he is as much as any man—has everything to gain and so has he to     no inconsiderable amount to lose or otherwise suffer in the track of partiality and injustice thus produced by corruptive influence there are certain lengths which under the fear of the publicopinion tribunal this or that judge will restrict himself from going but in that same track there are certain lengths which no judge will ever restrict himself from going what should make him from yielding he has everything to gain from not yielding he has more or less to fear on the alleged incorruption of english judicature eulogy is indefatigable and of this as of every other alleged efficient cause of felicity matchless constitution gets of course the credit this alleged incorruption what does it amount to in fact—incorruption on the part of a certain class of judges as against the matter of corruption in a certain form incorruption for small profit and upon a small scale coupled as above with corruption for unlimited profit upon a national scale in this country perhaps for two centuries no example has ever been known or commonly believed of one of the twelve judges taking a bribe on behalf of a suitor not improbably none such has had place by this circumstance is any proof afforded of incorruptibility—of any aversion to the being corrupted on the part of any judge by no means in no instance could a judge receive in the shape of money or other article of marketable value a bribe without putting his reputation completely in the power of at least one individual—namely the one by whom or on whose account the bribe was afforded seldom without putting himself in the power of individuals more than one what should be a mans inducement thus to expose himself to infamy not altogether without danger of legal punishment for profit on a retail scale while on a wholesale scale it is to be had to an amount altogether unlimited and without any the smallest risk you who give them the praise of incorruption as thus proved add to it the praise of abstaining from picking the pockets of passengers of their handkerchiefs in the streets section x the few—enemies of the many—the many not of the few everywhere it has been seen with the single exception of an aptly organized representative democracy the ruling and influential few are enemies of the subject many enemies in mind as well as in act—and by the very nature of man until the government whatever it be has given way to a representative democracy perpetual and unchangeable enemies not so the subject many to the ruling and influential few the enmity is not reciprocal it is all of it on one side—on that one side only the subject many have neither expectation nor desire of oppressing or plundering the wealthy oppress them they could not without plundering them of all they have for without any factitious power their wealth cannot but protect them and protect them most effectually against oppression in every shape plunder the wealthy few the subject many could not by any general resumption and new division of property for by any such attempt everything valuable and all property in it would be destroyed that of the poorest as well as that of the most wealthy as little could they in the way of taxation taking this or that part instead of the whole for between wealthy and not wealthy there being no line of separation actual or practicable the more rich could not be taxed without taxing the less rich likewise in the angloamerican united states the class who with relation to the purpose in question are without property—that is to say without property sufficient for their maintenance—have for upwards of fifty years by means of the right of electing the possessors of the supreme operative power had the property of the wealthy within the compass of their legal power in what instance has any infringement of property ever been made the worst that could happen to the ruling and influential few from power if vested in the hands of the many or say rather of all themselves the ruling few included—is to see themselves brought down to an equality with the many in all things wealth excepted in respect of power to the having no more than an equal chance for power in respect of factitious honour to be divested of it the many being at the same time unpossessed of it while the triumvirate of the wealthy the powerful and the factitiously dignified reigns—injustice to the prejudice of the greatest number reigns in every part of the field of government injustice for the benefit of those few at the expense and to the burthening of the many suppose that portion of the aggregate mass of power which they are capable of holding—suppose the constitutive power—in the hands of the greatest number what in respect of justice and injustice would be the consequence not the reverse of the present state of things not injustice to the benefit of the many at the expense of the few but justice to all alike take england for example by the factitious expenses imposed on judicial proceedings ninetenths of the population to say the least are excluded from the benefit of justice as well in the situation of defendants as in that of plaintiffs a line is thus drawn between the wealthy and the nonwealthy the wealthy all those who are capable of demanding the assistance of the judicial office or resisting the demand when made by others the nonwealthy those who are incapable all those whose situation is below the line of separation are at the     mercy of all those whose situation is above it now suppose this factitious burthen completely removed what would be the consequence that the wealthy would be at the mercy of the nonwealthy no only that they would cease to see the many lying absolutely at their mercy insomuch that the two parties would have to contend upon terms less unequal than at present i say less unequal for as to absolute equality this is what the very nature of the case completely forbids for it is upon evidence that the fate of every cause depends and evidence is not in any case to be had altogether without expense and to the necessary amount of the expense even when all factitious expense is struck off no determinate limits can be assigned section xi english parliamentary reform—its inadequacy in the opinion of a considerable and gradually increasing number of the people the system of government as carried on in england is so bad—so adverse to the greatest happiness of the greatest number that a man desirous of contributing his endeavours to that same greatest happiness cannot without inconsistency fail of being desirous of seeing brought about a change a change of a nature to add to that greatest happiness by substituting good to what is evil in the form of government as it exists at present for this purpose two changes are continually brought to view one under the name of parliamentary reform the other under the name of revolution by parliamentary reform is meant a change in the mode in which the people are said to be represented by causing the men who under the name of representatives of the people exercise a principal share of the powers of government to be located and dislocable by the great body whom they are said to represent instead of a comparatively minute portion of it by revolution is meant locating in the situation of monarch an individual different from him by whom it is at present filled parliamentary reform has been proposed in two modes—one styled radical the other styling itself sometimes moderate—sometimes temperate by radical reform is meant the substituting to the house of commons as at present organized a house of commons organized upon the principle of a representative democracy but leaving in full possession of their power the monarch and the house of lords by moderate reform is meant the taking the power of the house of commons out of the hands of the present oligarchy and placing it in a regular and equal sort of aristocracy leaving monarch and lords in possession of their power as in the former case if no good worth contending for—no permanent and adequate remedy to the existing evils could be brought about by radical reform still less could it by moderate reform note now the change that would be brought about by radical reform supposing no other change effected than that which is expressed the king would remain therefore so long as he retained his power no change would be effected that were adverse to his interests but every change that would be beneficial to the interest of the people—contributing to the greatest happiness of the greatest number of them would it has been seen be adverse to his interest therefore the king alone would suffice to prevent any considerable good from being done any effectual remedy from being applied take in hand the whole catalogue of abuses look over it from beginning to end not one is there in the continuance of which he has not an interest not one of them is there which it would not be against his interest to part with not one of them is there which on any reasonable ground he could be expected to part with if he could help it the house of lords would remain but of all the members of that house there is not one who so long as he is one will not be a sharer in that sinister interest which as has been seen stands irremoveably attached to the situation of monarch the house of lords alone would therefore suffice to shut an everlasting door against all remedy but if for this purpose the king alone by his single force and also the house of lords alone by its single force would either of them suffice much less can they fail to suffice by their conjunct force yes it may be said reform if radical will suffice it will suffice without further change not in any shape and in particular not in this shape can parliamentary reform have been brought about unless and until both lords and king have been brought into acquiescence but the use and only use of this reform is to remove the existing abuses in this one point is concentrated all that is looked to from it the power sufficient to produce the cause will be sufficient to produce the effect no it will not suffice by the supposition the office of king will remain the power of the king will remain untouched the power of the lords with their veto will remain untouched but from the office of king a quantity of the matter of wealth all of it operating upon the representatives of the people in the character of matter of corruptive influence is inseparable in a large proportion it will suffice to prevent the abolition of the mass of depredation and oppression at present established and whatsoever it is not able to prevent the amendment or abolition of it will suffice to bring back in a longer or shorter course of time to produce this effect not so much as a single act that can with propriety be called an act of corruption it has been shown is necessary not so much as a single act on either part     to confirm the existence of the kingly office would be to sanction a principle opposite to the only justifiable end of government it would be to continue in the hands of a functionary the hostility of whose interest to the universal interest has been shown to be necessary and unchangeable the power of giving effect to that same sinister interest you who propose the continuance of the state of things by which the mischief has been done by what means is it your expectation that the good you propose should be effected you who propose the accomplishment of an end how is it that you can avoid the adoption of the means the only means by which it can be effected parliamentary reform or any reform you can make or think of will it change mans nature finding in every official an appetite for power—as in dogs an appetite for bones will the word reform extirpate it no such reform can be carried into effect but by a power sufficient to go further and abolish the office of him with whose means of happiness the greatest happiness of the greatest number is incompatible and the power of that unelected assembly whose interest is not less at variance with the universal interest than the particular and sinister interest of the monarch leave the two offices untouched—you leave an injured king and an injured house of lords you leave where you find him a man enraged with the sense of that which in his view is injury and you leave him with the means of selfreinstatement and vengeance in his hands easier much easier is the whole of the work than this same half the whole is eminently simple the half is eminently complicated leave the half in existence you leave unremoved all the moral pollution and all the intellectual absurdity which defiles it the same system of shameless and indefatigable lying and the same practical inferences which have been at all times deduced from them will continue to be deduced you cannot have a king but you have in office a functionary who cannot do wrong that is to say who has by the universal declaration of all who have at any time thus spoken of him possessed and exercised the power of converting into right whatsoever wrong his sinister interest and vices ever prompt him to commit you cannot continue the office in existence without endeavouring to give perpetuity to by far the foulest system of immorality as well as the grossest system of absurdity that the wit of man ever engendered when on the part of kings and lords acquiesence has in any way been produced to leave them in possession of their power would be to leave them with arms in their hands in a condition to fight the matter over again very generous this indeed but to whom to the one and his few hundreds to these hundreds generous but to the many millions still more ungenerous the sources of waste and corruption have all been indicated and enumerated dry them up all dry them up without exception to all this vast mass of evil you may substitute the opposite and correspondent good with a sacrifice comparatively inconsiderable of existing interests and expectations keep any one of these sources untouched to produce the same retrenchment you must make a sacrifice to the same amount elsewhere at the expense of existing possessions and expectations on revolution considered as a remedy against misrule a syllable is almost too much suppose it effected what good would be effected by it or with it suppose the present king removed where should we find a better revolution proposed in the character of a remedy supposes the cause of the evil is in the individual but it does not lie in the individual it lies in the species it lies in the nature of all man not in the one man who is king as well might you think of doing away the mischief of the inquisition system by removing one grand inquisitor and substituting another in his place think not that because the bringing the present system of corruption to the present degree of perfection has taken up     years reckoning from the revolution it would take up the same time to reproduce the quantity of evil removed by a second revolution now small and inadequate would be the amount of saving or defalcation from the mass of abuse that could be effected by parliamentary reform alone during any such continuance at the revolution taking the requisite time for it there existed the possibility of screwing up the amount of the depredation to eight hundred millions but in addition to these eight hundred millions could another eight hundred millions be added in the same time or in any time oh no all that stock has been expended     book ii preface to the original edition of book ii of the three volumes of which the proposed constitutional code will consist the first makes thus its appearance by itself without waiting for the two others to their completion however very little is now wanting they are both of them in such a state of forwardness that were the author to drop into his last sleep while occupied in the tracing of these lines able hands are not wanting from which the task of laying the work before the public would receive its completion of the various concurrent causes of the retardation—one has been—the desire of the author to attach to this first volume an introductory dissertation having for its subjectmatter the various forms of which the supreme authority in a state is susceptible and for its object by bringing to view the advantages and disadvantages of each to exhibit their respective degrees of elgiibility meaning always by eligibility conduciveness to the maximum of the aggregate of happiness taking for the source of distinction and partition the relative numbers of the ruling and influential one or few on the one part and the subjectmany on the other—are therein brought to view—in the first place the three simple forms of government—monarchy aristocracy and democracy in the next place the several compounds actual and possible capable of being formed by their admixture for this discussion matter—in quantity adequate or little short of it—has this long time been in existence but as to form that which presented itself as the best adapted has not yet been given to it† under these circumstances it seems to me that for the chance of giving to the work at a point of time not likely ever to arrive the degree of supposed perfection the phantasmagoric image of which has like a new jerusalem been always in view—good economy could not now advise the foregoing the advantage of making application of this same matter to such measures as are already on the carpet placed thereon by the authority of government itself on this consideration it is that this first volume makes its appearance without waiting for either of the two next the political communities whose benefit this foremost part of my allcomprehensive code or say in one word of my pannomion has had principally in view—these communities have been for the time present those more particularly which have grown out of the wreck of the spanish monarchy not to speak as yet of the portuguese in the american hemisphere to time future—whether before the present generation has passed away or not till a length of time after and what length i cannot take upon me to pronounce—was all along referred the applicability of the work to the use of the british empire in saying the work i meant the whole of it considered as a whole for as to parts of it in no small quantity if applicable to any one form of government so are they to every other and this without any diminution of the proportions of power at present possessed by the several constituted authorities as to this part and some others of the fruits of my unremitted labours—the cause of their thus meeting the public eye in an unmatured state is this—what occurs to me at this moment is—that if so it be that they afford any promise of being in any way or degree beneficial to mankind—it behoves me to make the most of the short remainder of my life for the purpose of causing them to be brought into the world under my own eye on this consideration accordingly it is that i have added to this volume a sort of skeleton of the contents of the two others in the form of a table of the titles of the chapters and their several sections continuing the preference thus given to real usefulness over appearances to this volume or a subsequent one i have or shall have added similar skeletons of such of the parts of my proposed pannomion as regard what in contradistinction to international may be designated by the appellation of internal law these are—  the rightconferring commonly called the civil code—  the wrongrepressing commonly called the penal code both belonging to what i call the substantive branch of law—  the procedure code constituting what i call the adjective branch‡ growing—the whole of it     together—and in my view of the matter without need of distinction—out of those two subbranches of the substantive branch to a student in the art of legislation it might be a sort of pastime—taking in hand any one of these same skeletons to guess all along what may be the composition of the flesh and blood—the muscular and vascular system destined to be attached to it as from the protuberances in the cranium phrenologists undertake to determine the moral and intellectual contents of the cerebrum and cerebellum—a sort of puzzle not calling for more labour than does a game of chess and assuredly standing somewhat above it in the scale of usefulness state of  its constitutional code chapter i territory of this state name situation boundaries divisions enactive article    is the denomination of this state its constitution is that which stands expressed in this present code enactive art   the territory appertaining to it is as follows  ☞ here insert its situation on the globe in latitude and longitude with a designation of its boundaries natural and conventional enactive art   the whole territory is divided into districts each district is an election district as to which see ch vi legislature sending one deputy to serve as a member of the legislature subject to alteration by the legislature by union or division of entire districts each district is moreover the territory of a sublegislature as per ch xxix sublegislatures also subject in like manner to alteration it is the territory of an appellate judicatory as per ch xii judiciary and ch xxii appellate judicatories of these districts the denominations are as follows ☞ here insert the list enactive art   each district is divided into subdistricts each subdistrict is as per election code see ch vi legislature section   a vote receiving or say voting district each voting district sends one deputy to the sublegislature of the district subject to union and division as above each subdistrict is the territory of an immediate judicatory as per ch xii judiciary and ch xiii judges immediate of these subdistricts the denominations are as follows ☞ here insert the list enactive art   each subdistrict is divided into bissubdistricts each bissubdistrict is the territory of a local headman as to whom see ch xxv in case of need—for example by change in populousness or condition in other respects—bissubdistricts may come to be united or divided as above of a bissubdistrict if divided the sections will be trissubdistricts and so on enactive instructional art   in this scheme of territorial division the legislature will at all times make any such alteration as in its judgment the exigencies or convenience of the time shall have required of the districts originally marked out it will make any two or more into one it will divide any one or more each of them into two or more reserving to each the name and attributes of a district so likewise as to subdistricts and bissubdistricts but seeing the complication and confusion that might ensue—it will not but in a case of urgency at any of these three stages in the course of division proceed upon any plan which shall not be as above commensurable with the one originally employed instructional dissertation the several portions of territory for the denomination of which the abovementioned appellations are respectively employed are the supposed results of so many supposed sectional operations having for their subjectmatter the entire or aggregate of the dominions of the state in question whatever it be—distant dependencies not being taken into account so many of these denominations so many grades or stages in the process of division—a process the effect of which is to multiply the subjectmatter of the division by a number equal to that of the     divisor employed thus for simplicity of conception suppose the same divisor  0 employed at each operation divide the whole territory of the state by  0 you have  0 of the portions above denominated districts divide the districts each by  0 you have in each district  0 subdistricts in the whole territory  00 subdistricts divide the subdistricts each by  0 you have in each subdistrict  0 bissubdistricts in each district  00 bissubdistricts in the whole state  000 bissubdistricts divide the bissubdistricts each by  0 you have in each bissubdistrict  0 trissubdistricts in each subdistrict  00 trissubdistricts in each district  000 trissubdistricts in the whole state   0000 trissubdistricts for any such divisional operation it appears not that any practical use can be assigned other than that of its being employed in furnishing stations for functionaries for functionaries of some sort or other one or more in the several sections of territory which taken together exhibit the result of it if in any state application be made of the principles of the present proposed code the number of the sectional operations performed and thence of the stages or say grades of division produced and employed as above will naturally be influenced by the magnitude of the aggregate territory of such state combined with that of the population it will not however increase in any regular proportion for after a certain number of these grades or stages every good effect contemplated by addition to the aggregate number may be produced by augmenting the divisor and thence the number of the sections of territory at one or more stages thus avoiding the production of the bad effect to wit the complication which would be the necessary result of every addition made to the number of these same stages on the above grounds and others which will appear presently the number of stages represented by the denomination trissubdistricts is the number here regarded as the greatest number for which in the most extensive state there can be any use while on the other hand as for example in a swiss canton the smallness of the aggregate territory may have the effect of reducing the number of these stages or grades to one or even rendering any such divisional operation with its results altogether needless in ch xxv of this proposed code the existence is assumed of a demand for a public functionary in every portion of territory which according to the above explanation comes under the denomination of a bissubdistrict—a portion of territory resulting from the division of the aboveexplained portion called subdistrict as that does from the division of the portion styled a district as above explained both of them susceptible of different denominations according to the different purposes to which they are respectively made applicable this same least portion of territory is the portion employed as the seat or station of a sort of functionary who in ch xxv will be found designated by the appellation of a local headman a functionary of whose situation and proposed functions some conception though very rough and subject to great amendment particularly in the way of addition may be conveyed by the word maire in the sense in which it is universally employed in france the word mayor in the sense in which it is in some instances employed in england and the word alcalde in the sense in which it is employed in spain and the dominions still or of late belonging to spain in america and elsewhere a further though tacitly made assumption is—that in each territory belonging to an immediate judicatory so called in contradistinction to an appellate judicatory there will be a demand for local headmen number indetermined because on the present occasion impossible to be determined each with his appropriate territory—constituting his local field of service a state of things which might perhaps come to be found exemplified is—that in which in the instance of this or that territory of an immediate judicatory territory and population considered together the extent might be so small that a single local headmans station having for its limits the same as those of the territory of the judicatory would be found sufficient but by this circumstance no demand would be produced for any change in the arrangement here grounded on the supposition of an indefinite number of local headmens territories included in every immediate judges territory of a demand for a sort of territory of a still inferior grade—of a sort of territory which would come under the denomination of a trissubdistrict the notion may naturally enough be presented in english by the word parish in the several other european languages by the several words derived in those languages respectively from the same root that is to say the greek word which signifies a cluster of neighbouring habitations and which in latin characters is expressed by the word paroecia or in greek παϱοιϰὶα but supposing the existence of a peremptory demand for a class of territories of a grade so low as the one expressed by this same word trissubdistrict—no sufficient reason will it is believed be found for the allotment of anything more than an extremely limited logical field of action to the corresponding functionary no reason for any such field of action comparable in extent to that which will here be seen allotted to the local headman in his territory only as above observed for simplicity of conception—has the same division to wit twenty been assumed on the instance of every stage or grade brought to view in practice the diversities incident to magnitude of territory and population considered together with     the evervariable magnitude of population in each territory—whatsoever be the state in question divisions of very different magnitudes in the several grades or stages compared with one another will be found requisite and by means of all these diversities taken together the same number of stages or grades will be found applicable to different states the aggregate portions of which are of the most widely differing magnitudes what is plain is—that to no state whatsoever can application be made of this code without its finding such state already subjected to some allcomprehensive scheme or other of territorial division as above explained but by no such existing scheme will any naturally insuperable impediment be opposed to the scheme here proposed in so far as by the adoption of it a promise may be thought to be afforded of any specific and assignable advantageous effects by separation or aggregation or both together the existing portions of territorial divisions whatsoever they may be and howsoever denominated may be made applicable to all the several purposes which will here be seen proposed and thus may they be made the seats of functionaries invested with the functions herein respectively defined as to the names herein given to the results of the several successive divisional operations some conception of the peculiar use of them can scarcely fail to have presented itself to view for thus it is that the order of which the numerationtable gives the expression may be given to any scheme of division established or proposed which otherwise by the total want of all indication of the relation between one elementary part and another—in a word by the perfect arbitrariness of the import of every denomination employed must impose so heavy and needless a task on the conception and memory of every person to whose cognizance it comes to be presented to the forming of an adequate idea of the disadvantages attendant on the existing system of denomination for this class of objects and thence of the advantage producible by the adoption of the here proposed one—it would be necessary to look over the list of them as they stand exemplified in some one or more political state and that of the british dominions compared and contrasted with those of france will perhaps be deemed sufficient in the case of france as regenerated by the revolution simplicity and uniformity will be found observable natural expressiveness not in the case of england scotland and ireland natural expressiveness equally wanting and instead of simplicity and uniformity a chaos† in france the whole kingdom distant dependencies out of the question is divided into departments each department into arrondissements each arrondissement into cantons each canton into communes of paroisses in english parishes no mention is made in the here proposed plan of nomenclature they would be thus denominated   departments—districts   arrondissements—subdistricts   cantons—bissubdistricts   communes—trissubdistricts from the example of england no instruction—equivalent to the time space and labour requisite for the extraction and communication of it—could be obtained so great the diversification so thick the complication and confusion in which it is involved if a county be taken as corresponding to district the number of grades of division is in some counties different from what it is in others and in two counties in which the number of these stages is the same the denominations given to the results are different see mr rickmans highly instructive preface prefixed to the population returns made to the english house of commons and printed for different purposes two schemes of division have place—the one called civil or temporal instituted for the purpose of security against adversaries internal and external the other called ecclesiastical or spiritual instituted in a dark age by a foreign potentate—foreign with reference to the british isles—for the purpose of extracting money on pretence of saving souls on the temporal plan the result of the division made in the ultimate grade is called a township village or hamlet in the spiritual a parish in some instances the two results are coincident in others not for a multitude of important purposes in particular for taxation and registration the spiritual plan has in the case of this ultimate result been adopted into the temporal and by this adoption vast and various is the confusion and mischief that   0 has been produced see ch xxvi local registrars in a political state the territory of which distant dependencies out of the question were not much different from that of france england scotland or even ireland—the result of the ultimate sectional operation might perhaps be of a magnitude between that of the french arrondissement and that of the french commune with a view to the present purpose all these integers of territory are put upon a level for great as is the difference between the largest of them and the smallest—between france and scotland—still it is not it is believed so great as not to be capable of being made up for by a difference in number that is to say by giving to a country resembling france in magnitude a greater number—to a country resembling scotland a lesser number of these same atoms of territory if such they may be called for atom is from the correspondent greek word which means that which is not susceptible of ulterior division or at least has not been subjected to it note here as to economy and the effect produced in relation to it by the number of grades of territorial divisions on one account the greater this number the greater the aggregate mass of expense on another account the greater this same number the less the mass of expense the circumstance by which the increase is effected in the expense is this—that by each grade of divisional operation are produced a set of subterritories each of them with a set of officers and official residences to be provided for the circumstance by which diminution is effected in the expense is—that in proportion to the increase in the number of those same sets of officers and official residences is the diminution in the magnitude of each such subterritory and thence supposing them rendered as equal as may be in magnitude the less is their magnitude and the less the journeys which those inhabitants whose habitations are at the greatest distance from the seat of business—the official residence—will have to make in passing to and from it with the intervening demurrage too apt to be overlooked but not the less real and important is this latter item of expense in the case of the vast majority expense in time is expense in money the expense in officers pay and official residences is borne proportionably by the opulent few and the unopulent many the expense in time employed as above in journeys is borne almost exclusively by the unopulent many by those to whom their time affords no profit no loss is sustained from the unprofitable expenditure of it chapter ii ends and means enactive instructional art   of this constitution the allcomprehensive object or end in view is from first to last the greatest happiness of the greatest number namely of the individuals of whom the political community or state of which it is the constitution is composed strict regard being all along had to what is due to every other—as to which see ch vii legislators inaugural declaration correspondent fundamental principle the greatest happiness principle correspondent allcomprehensive and alldirecting rule—maximize happiness enactive instructional art   means employed two—aptitude maximized expense minimized correspondent principles—  the officialaptitudemaximization principle   the expenseminimization principle correspondent rules rule   maximize appropriate official aptitude rule   minimize official expense for the manner in which these rules second one another see ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration section    locable who section    located how expositive art   included in the matter of expenditure is the matter of punishment as well as the matter of reward expositive art   the matter of punishment is evil applied to a particular purpose expositive art   the matter of evil is composed of pain and loss of pleasure expositive art   the matter of reward is the matter of good applied to a particular purpose expositive art   the matter of good is composed of pleasure and exemption from pain enactive instructional art   consistently with the greatest happiness principle evil cannot be employed otherwise than as a means as a means of producing in the character of punishment or otherwise more than equivalent pleasure or excluding more than equivalent pain or producing the one as well as excluding the other enactive instructional art   employed in the character of punishment it cannot according to the greatest happiness principle be employed otherwise than as an instrument of coercion coercion by fear of future punishment in case of future delinquency coercion for the production as above of more than equivalent good     instructional art  0 according to this same principle pleasure is at once an end and a means as an end aimed at on every occasion as a means employed on particular occasions to wit when the matter of it is employed as a matter of reward enactive instructional art    employed as the matter of reward the matter of good cannot according to the greatest happiness principle be employed otherwise than as an instrument of inducement instructional art    of the matter of reward necessary to be employed as an instrument or say a means of government it is but in small proportion that it can be obtained otherwise than by the help of evil employed in the way of punishment and otherways as a means witness taxation hence under the greatest happiness principle the necessity of minimizing expenditure in the case of reward as well as in the case of punishment instructional art    to render the conduct of rulers conducive to the maximization of happiness it is not less necessary to employ in their case the instrument of coercion than in the case of rulees but the instrument of coercion being composed of the matter of evil and the instrument of inducement of the matter of good—rulers are by the unalterable constitution of human nature disposed to maximize the application of the matter of good to themselves of the matter of evil to rulees instructional art    appropriate aptitude may be considered as having place in the case of rulees as well as in the case of rulers in both cases according to the greatest happiness principle it is aptitude for the maximization of happiness but in the case of rulers it has a more particular signification it is aptitude for the maximization of happiness in a particular way namely by a system of operations performed on rulees expositive art    of appropriate official aptitude elements or say branches three—moral intellectual and active of intellectual again two—cognitional and judicial knowledge and judgment ratiocinative enactive instructional art    rules for maximization of appropriate moral aptitude rule i the sovereign power give to those whose interest it is that happiness be maximized rule ii of the possessors of subordinate power maximize the responsibility—namely as towards the aforesaid possessors of the sovereign power note that only by expectation of eventual evil punishment included can responsibility be established neither by expectation of eventual good nor by the possession of good reward included can it be established     ratiocinative enactive instructional art

see ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration section    locable who section    located how ch xii judiciary section    locable who enactive instructional art    for the functions exercised by the several functionaries in the exercise of their several powers and the fulfilment of their respective trusts see the indication given in the chapters headed by the denomination of the several classes of functionaries as per table of chapters and sections hereunto annexed enactive instructional art    in relation to every official situation a recapitulatory indication will be found given of the securities herein provided for the maximization of appropriate aptitude in all its abovementioned branches on the part of the functionary by whom it is filled see in the several chapters the several sections entituled securities for appropriate aptitude expositive art  0 considered in respect of its immediate effects responsibility is distinguishable into punitional satisfactional and dislocational in respect of its source into legal and moral—legal produced by the legal sanction moral by the moral sanction as applied by the publicopinion tribunal as per ch v constitutive section   publicopinion tribunal—its composition of the satisfactional mode the only generally applicable submode is the     pecuniarilycompensational—say for shortness the compensational instructional art    compensational responsibility has the effect of punitional in the ratio of the sum parted with to the remainder left by it wounds inflicted by the wrong are curable it is on this account preferable as far as it goes to simply punitional by which though employed for the hope of preventing greater future evil pain is the only effect produced with certainty expositive instructional art    legal responsibility is distinguishable into judicial and administrational judicial where in the shape of punishment the effect is produced by the judicial authority on the ground of moral inaptitude administrational where by superordinate authority dislocation is applied on the ground of inaptitude intellectual or active pure of moral by dislocational evil from the like inaptitude on the part of the dislocatee is prevented with certainty of punishment except in the singular case of physically disabilitative punishment in the instance of the individual offender the preventive effect is clouded in uncertainty instructional art    to pecuniary compensation pecuniary responsibility to a corresponding extent is necessary but beyond that extent in proportion to its extent obstruction is afforded by it to its own efficiency as well as to that of punitional and dislocational in other words up to the amount of his debts a mans responsibility to the purpose of his being made to afford compensation in a pecuniary shape is indeed in the direct ratio of his opulence but when a mans opulence exceeds the amount of his debts this effective responsibility is rather in the inverse than in the direct ratio of it this even under a system legislative and judicial which has for its end the maximization of the happiness of the maximum number much more under a system by which to the happiness of the ruling one in conjunction with that of the ruling and otherwise influential few that of the subjectmany is in intention and effect constantly sacrificed in the monarch in whose situation opulential responsibility is maximized effective responsibility punitional satisfactional and dislocational is nihilized instructional art    as to moral responsibility imperfect as it is this species of security against misconduct is the more necessary to be brought to view inasmuch as in monarchies in general were it not for this there would be no responsibility at all and in other words the monarch would be altogether without motives for compliance with the laws even with those of his own making which are at all times all such as and no other than such as it is agreeable to him to make it is by this source of restraint alone that the english form of government—a mixture composed of monarchicoaristocratical despotism with a spice of anarchy—has been preserved from passing through the condition of france russia and austria into that of spain and portugal even without the assistance of a posse of his own creatures acting under the name of a parliament he may kill any person he pleases violate any woman he pleases take to himself or destroy anything he pleases every person who resists him while in any such way occupied is by law killable and every person who so much as tells of it is punishable yet without the form of an act of parliament he does nothing of all this why because by the power of the publicopinion tribunal though he could not be either punished or effectually resisted he might be and would be more or less annoyed chapter iii sovereignty in whom enactive art   the sovereignty is in the people it is reserved by and to them it is exercised by the exercise of the constitutive authority as per ch iv chapter iv authorities enactive art   the authorities which have place in this state are these—     the constitutive     the legislative     the administrative     the judiciary their relations to one another are as follows— enactive art   to the constitutive authority it belongs amongst other things to depute and locate as per ch vi legislature the members composing the legislative and eventually as per ch v constitutive section     to dislocate them but not to give direction either individual or specific to their measures nor therefore to reward or punish them except in so far as relocation may operate as reward and dislocation as punishment or in so far as at the instance of the constitutive punishment may come to be eventually applied to them by the hands of succeeding legislatures as per ch v     constitutive section     ch vi legislature section    legislation penal judicatory enactive art   to the legislative it belongs amongst other things to locate the chiefs of the two other departments and eventually to dislocate them to give—not general only but upon occasion individual direction to their conduct as well as to that of all the several functionaries respectively subordinate to them eventually also to punish them in case of noncompliance with its directions enactive art   to the administrative it belongs amongst other things to give execution and effect to the ordinances of the legislative in so far as regards the persons and things placed under its special direction by the legislative to wit in so far as litiscontestation has not place enactive art   to the judiciary it belongs amongst other things to give execution and effect to the ordinances of the legislative in so far as litiscontestation has place to wit either as to the question of law or as to the question of fact enactive expositive art   taken together the legislative and the administrative compose the government the administrative and the judiciary the executive the legislative and the executive what may be termed the operative as contradistinguished from the constitutive expositive art   note as to the word supreme if attached anywhere to the name of any authority—to no other authority than those in the same department can it be understood to bear reference thus may be spoken of a supreme administrative and a supreme judiciary although with reference to supreme legislature they are both of them subordinate as is the legislative itself to the constitutive enactive art   so many of these supreme authorities the constitutive included which is supreme over all the others so many departments to each authority a department enactive art   the legislature has under it as many sublegislatures as in the territory of the state here are districts to each district a sublegislature enactive art  0 within the administrative department are subdepartments thirteen in number for their appellations see ch ix section   enactive instructional art    in the case of the legislative department the source of distinction and division is as will be seen furnished partly by the local partly by the logical field of service in the case of the supreme legislature both fields being without limit in the case of the sublegislatures both of them limited as per ch xxix sublegislatures in the case of the administrative department this same source is furnished by the logical field alone as for instance election legislation army c as per ch xi ministers severally in each of the subdepartments so denominated the authority of the head functionary extends over the whole territory of the state enactive expositive art    in the legislative department and subdepartments the official situation is necessarily manyseated the power accordingly fractionized in the legislature seats as many as in the territory there are districts in each sublegislature seats as many as in the district there are subdistricts enactive art    in both the other departments the official situation is in every instance singleseated prime minister one for each administrative subdepartment or union of subdepartments minister one in each immediate and each appellate judicatory judge but one over all these judicatories justice minister one in each district immediately under its sublegislature subprime minister one in each subdepartment of the district under the sublegislature and the subprime minister minister one in each ultimate section of the territory of the state headman one enactive ratiocinative art    in each of these situations—with and under each principal functionary serve as many auxiliaries as he finds it necessary to depute as to which in the several chapters headed by the names of the several functionaries see the section intituled selfsuppletive function thus at all times whatsoever be the quantity of business to be done there are hands for it in sufficient number without need of retardation and thus is promptitude maximized nor yet is any door thus opened to abuse for for no such effect are adequate causes—adequate motives—to be found for the conduct of these his instruments the principal is effectually responsible and thus in their instance remuneration having place in no other shape than that of power in possession—with the power dignity and pay of their respective principals in expectancy only frugality is not by the establishment of those suppletive situations or any of them diminished     chapter v constitutive authority section i constitutive what—in whom expositive art   the constitutive authority is that by which at all times the holders of the several other authorities in this state are what they are by it immediately or interventionally they have been in such their situations located and therefrom are eventually dislocable enactive art   the constitutive authority is in the whole body of electors belonging to this state that is to say in the whole body of the inhabitants who on the several days respectively appointed for the several elections and the operations thereunto preparatory are resident on the territory of the state deduction made of certain classes mode of exercise as per election code as to which see ch vi legislature section   to    enactive art   classes thus deducted are—  females   males nonadult that is to say who have not attained the age of    years   nonreaders that is to say those who have not as per ch vi legislature section   electors who by reading given proof of appropriate aptitude   passengers section ii powers enactive art   subordinate to the constitutive authority as per section   are all other authorities and thereby all other public functionaries belonging to the state those whom it cannot dislocate in an immediate it can in an unimmediate or say interventional way to wit by dislocating those who having the power have failed to dislocate them in conformity to its sufficiently understood desire enactive expositive art   exercisible by the constitutive in relation to them respectively are the several functions following with the power therein essentially included these are— i locative function exercised by locating in the official situation in question the individual in question ii dislocative function exercised by dislocating out of the situation in question the functionary therein located iii punifactive function exercised by putting at the time of dislocation in a way to be punished but by a different authority the functionary so dislocated enactive art   i locative function functionaries in relation to whom this function is exercised by the members of the constitutive authority are as follows— i their deputies deputed by them to the legislature to act as members of the supreme legislature styled collectively the legislature in relation to all these this power is exercised by the members of the whole constitutive body as divided into the bodies belonging to the several election districts in each district the members of the constitutive electing for that district a member of the legislature     enactive art   ii the members of the several sublegislatures in relation to each sublegislative body this power is exercised by the members of the constitutive body belonging to its district as divided into the bodies belonging to the several subdistricts therein contained the body belonging to each such subdistrict electing a member of the sublegislature enactive art   ii dislocative function functionaries in relation to whom this function may upon occasion be exercised are the following   the several members of the legislature   the prime minister   the several ministers belonging to the administrative department as per ch ix section     the justice minister   in each judicatory appellate as well as immediate the judge and the several other magisterial functionaries as per ch xii judiciary collectively section   judiciary functionaries   in every such situation as above every depute   the several local headmen and local registrars   the several members of the several sublegislative bodies enactive art   exercisible upon occasion in like manner by the constitutive authority belonging to each district is the dislocative function in relation to the several functionaries following—   the several members of the legislative body belonging to that same district   the several district prime ministers or say premiers serving under the several sublegislatures   the several district ministers serving under the several sublegislatures and their several district prime ministers section iii powers exercised how enactive art   i locative function exercised in relation to the several members of the legislative body is the locative function of the constitutive in the several election districts and subdistricts in the election code as per ch vi legislature section   to    enactive art   exercised is this same function in relation to the several members of the several sublegislative bodies—in the same manner as there delineated with reference to the several members of the legislature enactive instructional art   in each subdistrict immediately after he has voted for a deputy to act as a member of the legislature for the district each member of the constitutive body will at the same place and in the same manner vote for another deputy to act as a member of the sublegislature of that same district the arrangements of detail—necessary to adapt upon the same principles the mode of ascertaining the election of a member of the legislature to the case of a member of a sublegislature—are upon the face of the election code obvious they will be settled in terminis by the legislature enactive art   ii dislocative function  —how exercised by the entire constitutive on the receipt of a requisition signed by one fourth of the whole number of the electors of any election district requiring the dislocation of any functionary in section   powers art   the hereinaftermentioned election minister will appoint a day or days as near as may be—on which in the several districts the electors shall meet at the several voting offices of the several subdistricts therein respectively contained in the same manner as on the occasion of an election the voting cards of those who are for the proposed dislocation will on the concealed surface as per ch vi legislature section   election apparatus art   bear the words dislocate him of those who are against the proposed dislocation the words retain him in each district the votation finished the votingbox will by the vote clerk be forthwith transmitted to the election ministers office by the election minister as soon as all are received or the time for receiving them is elapsed they will in concert with the legislation minister be opened in the legislation chamber at the next sitting of the legislature the numbers will thereupon be immediately cast up and the result declared in case of dislocation the vacancy produced on this extraordinary occasion will thereupon be     forthwith filled up in the same manner as on any ordinary one enactive art    —how by the constitutive of a district proportion of the requisitionists the same in this case as in that of the entire constitutive as above voting boxes transmitted to the election clerk of the district as soon as all have been received or the time for receiving them has elapsed he at the next sitting of the sublegislature opens them in concert with the legislation minister of the district in the sublegislation chamber casts them up and declares the result as above the vacancy if any is thereupon filled up as above instructional art   by such requisitionists as per art     will be seen the propriety of making the ground of the requisition as particular and determinate as well as concise as the nature of the case will admit that is to say the description of the alleged misconduct with the intimation of the manner in which it has diminished or tended to diminish the aggregate happiness of the greatest number referring to written evidence if any such there be but not repeating it or commenting on it much less employing appellatives dyslogistic or eulogistic or addresses to the passions in any other shape or fallacies in any shape as to which see the book of fallacies the less their regard for these cautions the less they will understand will be the probability that their requisition will be productive of the effect desired by it enactive art   iii punifactive function—how exercised if in addition to dislocation in the case mentioned in art   punification be required—in this case together with the pair of voting cards bearing respectively the words dislocate him and retain him will be delivered by the vote clerk another pair bearing in like manner the words accuse him and absolve him thereupon in regard to accusation and absolution the result will be ascertained and declared in the same manner as in regard to dislocation and retention as above enactive art   if the majority be as above in favour of accusation the election minister will as per art   make declaration to that effect in which case by that same declaration the function and duty of conducting legal pursuit to that effect devolves at the instant upon the hereinaftermentioned government advocategeneral as to whom see ch xix government advocategeneral enactive art   the judicatory in which such pursuit will be carried on will be the legislation penal judicatory as per ch vi legislature section    legislation penal judicatory enactive art  0 but should it ever happen that the functionary in whose instance in addition to dislocation punishment is required is at that same time a member of the legislature—in such case for avoidance of partiality and the imputation of partiality on the part of the legislature the requisitioners may take their choice as between that year and the three several years next ensuing section iv publicopinion tribunal—composition enactive expositive ratiocinative art   this constitution recognises the publicopinion tribunal as an authority essentially belonging to it its power is judicial a functionary belonging to the judiciary exercises his functions by express location—by commission a member of the publicopinion tribunal exercises his functions without commission he needs none dislocability and puniability of members excepted the publicopinion tribunal is to the supreme constitutive what the judiciary is to the supreme legislative enactive expositive art   of the following members may this judicatory be considered as being composed   all individuals of whom the constitutive body of this state is composed   all those classes which under section   art   stand excluded from all participation in such supreme power   of all other political communities all such members to whom it happens to take cognizance of the question whatever it may be enactive expositive art   of this judicatory different classes or assemblages of persons may be considered as constituting so many committees or subcommittees examples are as follows—   the auditory at the several sittings of the supreme legislature   the auditory at the several sittings of the several sublegislatures   the auditory at the several sittings of the several judicatories see ch xii judiciary collectively section   actors in the judicial theatre   persons having business with the several functionaries belonging to the administrative department such business excepted as for special reasons shall by law have been consigned to temporary secrecy   at meetings publicly held for the consideration     of any political question the several individuals present   the auditory at any dramatic entertainment at which objects of a political or moral nature are brought upon the stage   all persons taking for the subject of their speeches writings or reflections any act or discourse of any public functionary or body of public functionaries belonging to this state instructional art   public opinion may be considered as a system of law emanating from the body of the people if there be no individually assignable form of words in and by which it stands expressed it is but upon a par in this particular with that rule of action which emanating as it does from lawyers official and professional and not sanctioned by the legislative authority otherwise than by tacit sufferance is in england designated by the appellation of common law to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check to the beneficial an indispensable supplement able rulers lead it prudent rulers lead or follow it foolish rulers disregard it even at the present stage in the career of civilisation its dictates coincide on most points with those of the greatesthappiness principle on some however it still deviates from them but as its deviations have all along been less and less numerous and less wide sooner or later they will cease to be discernible aberration will vanish coincidence will be complete section v publicopinion tribunal functions enactive expositive art   to the several members of the publicopinion tribunal as such belong the distinguishable functions following namely—   statistic or say evidencefurnishing function exercise is given to it in so far as indication is afforded of facts of a nature to operate as grounds for judgment of approbation or disapprobation in relation to any public institution ordinance arrangement proceeding or measure past present or supposed future contingent or to any mode of conduct on the part of any person functionary or nonfunctionary by which the interests of the public at large may be affected expositive art   censorial function—exercise is given to it in so far as expression is given to any judgment of approbation or disapprobation in relation to any such object as above expositive art   executive function—exercise is given to it in so far as by the performing or withholding of good offices such as a man is by law warranted in withholding or by the performing of evil offices such as a man is by law allowed to perform addition—whether in consequence of such indication as above or otherwise—is made to or defalcation made from the happiness of the person in question as above and as by the thus withholding of good offices the effect of punishment so by the rendering of them may the effect of reward be produced expositive art   meliorationsuggestive function—exercise is given to it in so far as from the observation of what is amiss or wanting a conception of something better having been formed has as such been held up to the view of those whom it may concern to the end that if approved it may be brought into practice enactive ratiocinative art   on functionaries the exercise of the statistic function is not only morally but legally obligatory for the rendering of this service the mass of benefit which in whatever shape pay included stands attached to their respective offices is their reward on nonfunctionaries morally only factitious reward none is provided for them none is needed for them natural appropriate and exactly proportionate reward in proportion as his service is known and the nature of it understood each man will receive in and by means of the esteem produced by the contemplation of it expositive instructional art   of the heads to which imperfections ascribed to the law by amendments may be referrible examples are as follows— i as to matter want of conduciveness to the general end the arrangement as supposed not so conformable to the greatest happiness principle as it might be ii for examples of want of completeness as to matter see any of the lists of exceptions in this code and suppose any one of those same exceptions omitted iii for examples of want of completeness as to form in any one of the lists of examples suppose this or that example not inserted iv as to form want of clearness to wit in such or such a clause or assemblage of clauses as to the effect obscurity or ambiguity as to the cause that is to say the words—redundancy deficiency inappositeness or miscollocation v as to matter or form want of completeness this or that case as supposed not being provided for because as supposed not contemplated vi in the adjective code in particular—or say the procedure code on the part of this or that arrangement want of conduciveness to the general end to wit by reason of want of conduciveness to this or that one of the ends of justice direct and collateral the direct end     being the giving execution and effect to the correspondent portion of the substantive code the collateral end the keeping the practice clear of needless delay vexation and expense—evils correspondent and opposite to so many specific collateral ends of justice note that in speaking of ends instead of one the number of direct ends may be stated as being two in which case the opposite evils will be misdecision and nondecision for by nondecision may be produced the effect of misdecision to wit in disfavour of the pursuers side enactive art   when a supposed amendment as above is suggested the two forms in either of which for the preservation of symmetry it may be expressed may be seen in ch vi legislature section    members motions of the nonpreservation of symmetry the consequences may be seen in ch xi section   legislation minister instructional art   in support of his amendment the proposer will do well to subjoin under the following heads concise indications of the reasons by the consideration of which he was induced to propose it these will be— i evil effects regarded as flowing from the law as it stands or ii good effects expected to result from the proposed amendment if adopted the more condensed and compact his reasons the greater will be their chance of being attended to by every attempt to move the passions it will be lessened instructional art   on the tutelary influence of the publicopinion tribunal this constitution relies in a more especial manner for the efficiency of the securities which it provides for good conduct on the part of the several functionaries belonging to the judiciary department see in the several chapters the several sections headed by the words securities for apropriate aptitude section vi securities against legislative and judiciary enactive art   to every person elector inhabitant or foreigner—to every individual of the human species belongs the right of exercising in relation to the condition of every department of this government and the conduct of every functionary thereto belonging the statistic executive and meliorationsuggestive functions abovementioned enactive ratiocinative art   so likewise the censorial how strong soever the terms in which the approbation or disapprobation stands expressed vituperation if indecorous will receive its proportionate punishment at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal defamation if mendacious or temeracious at the hands of the penal code defamation there is none without intimation given of some illegal or immoral act—intimation individually or at least specifically determinate if being false the intimation is temeracious only and not mendacious the official situation of the party defamed is a ground—not of aggravation but of extenuation the military functionary is paid for being shot at the civil functionary is paid for being spoken and written at the soldier who will not face musquetry is one sort of coward the civilian who will not endure obloquy is another better he be defamed though it be ever so unjustly than that by a breach of official duty any sinister profit sought should be reaped to him who has power opulence or reputation selfdefence is in proportion to his power opulence or reputation more easy than if he had none defenders cannot be wanting to him so long as he has patrons colleagues or dependents enactive expositive art   by prohibition restriction or taxation to throw obstruction in the way of production or diffusion of political tracts especially newspapers and other periodical ones would on the part of the legislature be a breach of trust a violation of its duty to the constitutive an act of insubordination obstructing their constitutional superordinates in the exercise of their authority by depriving them of the means of forming correct judgments an act of partiality and oppression withholding from one class of men documents not withholden from another withholding from the many benefits not withholden from the more wealthy few withholding instruction from those by whom it is most needed it would be an anticonstitutional act as such it would call for marks of disapprobation at the hands of the members of the supreme constitutive namely as well in their character of electors as in their character of members of the publicopinion tribunal enactive expositive art   no such act of insubordination is committed by punishment judicially inflicted or demanded for defamation when effected or endeavoured at by falsehood accompanied by criminal evilconsciousness or culpable temerity of assertion as to which see the penal code instructional art   every act whereby in the above or any other way a man seeks to weaken the effective power of the publicopinion tribunal or by falsehood or what comes to the same thing by suppression of truth to misdirect it is evidence of hostility on his part to the   0 greatest happiness of the greatest number evidence of the worst intentions generated by the worst motives evidence which though but tacit and circumstantial and though it be ever so unwilling is not the less conclusive every act whereby a man seeks to diminish the circulation of opinions opposite to those which he professes is evidence of his consciousness of the rectitude of those which he is combating and thereby of the insincerity hypocrisy tyrannicalness and selfishness which have taken possession of his mind sincere or insincere he may without fear of injustice be numbered among the enemies of the human species chapter vi legislature section i powers—and duties enactive art i the supreme legislature is omnicompetent coextensive with the territory of the state is its local field of service coextensive with the field of human action is its logical field of service—to its power there are no limits in place of limits it has checks these checks are applied by the securities provided for good conduct on the part of the several members individually operated upon as per section    securities for appropriate aptitude enactive ratiocinative art   the power thus unlimited is that of the legislature for the time being to no anterior legislature belongs any power otherwise than by confirmation given to it by the legislature for the time being dead men can neither fine nor imprison nor banish living ones enactive art   but in so far as nothing appears to the contrary confirmation of the acts of all anterior legislatures and of all authorities subordinate to them takes place of course enactive art   for the means employed for preserving government engagements against violation see section   responsibility enactive art   the supreme legislative authority has for its immediate instrument the supreme executive composed of the administrative and the judiciary acting within their respective spheres on the will of the supreme constitutive the supreme legislative is dependent as per ch v section   powers absolute and allcomprehensive is this dependence so also on the will of the legislature the will of the executive and the wills of the sublegislatures enactive ratiocinative art   only by unalterable physical impotence is the supreme legislature prevented from being its own executive or from being the sole legislature the supreme legislature will not to the neglect of its own duties take upon itself any of those functions for the apt exercise of which when taken in the aggregate those subordinate authorities alone can in respect of disposable time appropriate knowledge judgment and active aptitude have been provided with sufficient means but in case of nonperformance or unapt performance or wellgrounded apprehension of either—to the exercise of no function of the executive or the sublegislative authority can the supreme legislature be incompetent—unfaithfulness yes but to the supreme legislature neither can usurpation nor encroachment be imputed enactive expositive art   to those functions which belong exclusively to itself the legislature accordingly adds in case of necessity those which belong respectively to all those its several subordinates as per the several ensuing chapters enactive expositive art   in those same chapters may moreover be seen so many exemplifications of the subjects to which the attention and proceedings of the legislature will constantly or occasionally be directed enactive art   separately or collectively the constituents of a member of the legislature will at all times as such make to such their deputy what communication they think fit to his cognitive faculty to his judicative faculty or even to his will it may be addressed but in so far as the good of the community taken in the aggregate is the paramount object of his care no obedience will he pay to any such particular will to the detriment of what appears to him the universal interest paramount to his duty to a part is on every occasion his duty to the whole an engagement exacted of him by a part would be an act of insubordination as towards the whole it belongs not to him to judge until he has seen or heard his will is commanded by his judgment not his judgment by his will such contrariety may have place without detriment to moral aptitude on either side they may have good reason for dislocating him he for exposing himself to be so dislocated instructional ratiocinative art  0 if on this or that particular occasion in the opinion of constituents or in the     opinion of their deputy a conflict should have place between their particular aggregate interest and the national interest he will not be considered as violating his duty to the public by giving his vote in favour of that same particular interest for the national interest being nothing more than an aggregate of the several particular interests if against that which has been regarded as being the national interest there be a majority this result will prove that in the so declared opinion of that same majority that which had been spoken of as if it were the national interest was not so if in support of that which by a majority of his constituents is regarded as being their interest there be not a majority in the legislature his vote will be of no effect and to the national interest no evil will have been done by it on the other hand a practice which in every case is evil is insincerity and in this case by the supposition no good at all therefore no preponderant good would be produced by it instructional ratiocinative art    accordingly if so it should happen that after speaking in support of an arrangement which in the opinion of his constituents is contrary to their particular interest he gives his vote against that same arrangement—in such conduct there is not any real inconsistency by his speech his duty to the public is fulfilled by his vote his duty to his constituents instructional ratiocinative art    moreover what on an occasion of this sort may very well happen is—that an arrangement which in the eyes of constituents is detrimental to their interest is not so and vice versâ and in this case his speech in support of the opposite arrangement may have the effect of working a change in their opinion and on a succeeding occasion causing them to concur with the arrangement supported by him instead of opposing it enactive ratiocinative art    variable at all times—variable at the pleasure of the legislature for the time being—is every article in this and every other code for every moment of its duration on its reasonableness first in the eyes of the legislative then in the eyes of the constitutive is its sole dependence not to speak of years if for any one day error could prudently be exempted from correction so might it for every other if the wisdom of today is superior to that of tomorrow so may it be to that of every day to the end of time blinded by prejudice must that man be who assured that he is wiser today than he was yesterday holds himself not equally assured that tomorrow he may be wiser than today blinded by vanity or selfishness must that man be who assured that in knowledge and judgment he is beyond those who are gone before him holds not himself equally assured that in those same endowments those who come after him may be beyond him by individual responsibility as per section   responsibility sufficient is the security afforded against inconsiderate and groundless changes a degree of security far superior to any which can be afforded by any constitution by which correction of error is inhibited to or by the legislature section ii responsibility enactive ratiocinative art   of the constitutive authority the constant will for such it cannot but be presumed to be is that the national felicity—the happiness of the greatest number—be maximized to this will on each occasion it is the duty of the supreme legislature according to the measure of its ability to give execution and effect enactive art   if on any occasion any ordinance which to some shall appear repugnant to the principles of this constitution shall come to have been enacted by the legislature such ordinance is not on that account to be by any judge treated or spoken of as being null and void not even although its tendency intended as well as actual were to appear to him to be to diminish the mass of power hereby reserved to the constitutive authority but if of any such act the tendency be anticonstitutional as above it may form an apt ground for an exercise to be given by the electors to their incidental dislocative and punifactive functions applying them respectively to such members of the legislature by whom motion speech or vote shall have been given in favour of the supposed anticonstitutional arrangement and in any judicatory such by the judge principal may any such act on its coming regularly before him be in his opinion declared to be enactive ratiocinative art   to the constitutive authority and that alone it belongs to enforce the observance of contracts entered into by the legislature and in one word to afford such redress as can be afforded to misdeeds in whatever shape perseveringly committed by the legislature a law ordaining that in no case a contract entered into by the legislature shall remain in any part unperformed by it would be alike inefficient to good purposes—efficient to bad ones ratiocinative art   a contract if fit to be performed was made for increase of felicity not for lessening it be the contract what it may prove that by nonobservance of it more felicity all     items taken into account would be produced than by observance you prove that it ought not to be observed if all contracts were to be observed all misdeeds would be to be committed for there is no misdeed the committal of which may not be made the subject of a contract and to establish in favour of themselves or of any other person or persons an absolute despotism a set of legislators would have no more to do than to enter into an engagement—say with a foreign despot say with a member of their own community—for that purpose a monarch that he may persevere in a course of depredation and oppression with the less disturbance binds himself suppose to perpetuate it an instrument has been contrived for this purpose it is called an oath—a coronation oath propose to him to assuage the misrule alas my oath he cries my oath and all who share or look to share in the profit of the misrule join with him in chorus enactive art   in the case of a contract entered into by the government with any person or persons belonging to this state it will rest with the judiciary to take cognizance of it as in a case between individual and individual yet to a decision pronounced thereupon by the competent judicial authority should the legislature by any ordinance act in declared repugnance such ordinance is not on that account to be regarded as null and void enactive art   so in the case of a contract with the government of any foreign state enactive art   so in the case of a contract with a subject of any foreign state enactive art   but in all three cases apt grounds may have place for the exercise of the incidental dislocative function on the part of the constitutive authority as per ch v constitutive section   powers at the charge of the members who have concurred in the breach of public faith the dislocative function with or without the punifactive enactive art   for wrong in any shape alleged to have been done to any foreign government whether by breach of contract or otherwise such government may have judicial remedy by suit in the immediate judicatory of the metropolis of the state defendant the government advocategeneral of this state enactive art  0 yet on any such occasion should any ordinance have been issued by the legislature in relation to the matter of such suit after the commencement thereof it belongs not to any judge to omit giving execution and effect to that same ordinance enactive art    but here likewise apt grounds may have place for the exercise of the remedial functions of the constitutive authority as above section iii powers as to sublegislatures enactive art   in relation to the hereinaftermentioned sublegislatures the supreme legislature exercises the several functions directive corrective arbitrative enactive art   i directive function in the exercise of this function it gives as often as it sees convenient antecedent and preparatory direction to their several proceedings enactive art   ii corrective function in the exercise of this function it in like manner abolishes reverses amends or causes to be amended any of their ordinances or other proceedings enactive art   iii arbitrative function in the exercise of this function as often as between one sublegislature and another contestation has place it gives termination thereto by an appropriate arrangement instructional art   in the case of a federal government here may be the place for appropriate alteration the sublegislatures would be the legislatures of the

a domestic servant is a servant of one a legislator is a servant of all no domestic servant absents himself at pleasure and without leave the masters of the legislator give no such leave from nonattendance of a domestic servant the evil is upon a domestic scale of a legislator on a national scale a legislator is a physician of the body politic no physician receives pay but in proportion to attendance the physician has no vacation days section xix remuneration enactive art   of a member of the legislature the pecuniary remuneration is  per day added to this are the power and dignity inseparable from the office of ulterior emolument receipt if from unwilling hands is extortion if from willing ones corruption as to which see penal code for principles as to official remuneration see ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration section xx attendance and remuneration—how connected enactive art   into the assembly chamber there is but one entrance the retiring rooms are behind and above committee rooms have other entrances enactive art   each day on entrance into the assembly chamber each member receives that days pay at the hands of the doorkeeper in his view and in that of the company in the assembly chamber is a clock on delivery of the pay the doorkeeper stamps in the entrance and departure book on the page of that day the members name adding the hour and minute enactive art   no member departs without leave of the president who on a sign made by the departer rings by a string within his reach a bell hanging near the doorkeeper who after stamping in the entrance and departure book on the page of that day the members name with the hour and minute lets him out a retiring place opening only into the chamber is of course supposed enactive art   sick or well for no day on which he does not attend vacation days excepted does any legislator receive his pay enactive art   under the direction of the hereinaftermentioned legislation minister is kept the nonattendance or say absentation book in it from the entrance and departure book entry is made of the days on which the several absenting members have respectively absented themselves and for the information of their respective constituents he causes the result to be published in the government newspaper on the next day as also at the beginning of each month and at the time when the election minister issues his mandates for the general election a summary of all the absentations of the last preceding session under the names of the several absentees enactive art   if by sickness a member has been prevented from attending he on the first day of his reattendance presents to the doorkeeper a sickness ticket on which are marked the day or days of nonattendance with an intimation of the nature of the sickness authenticated by his name in his own handwriting and the attestation of a physician enactive art   to clear a member from the suspicion of employing sickness as a pretence for avoiding to give his vote or speech questions may be put to him and others in the face of the assembly and observations made for ulterior securities against nonattendance see section    selfsuppletive function     ratiocinative art   a soldier if he fails in his attendance is punished as a deserter punished with corporeal punishment in england with flogging or perhaps with death under this code or any that is in consonance with it in the case of no man military or nonmilitary will punishment in either of those shapes be employed for in neither is it needed but in this case as in every other whatever is needed why should it not be applied—and what can be milder than the simple withholding of reward in proportion as the service remains unperformed ratiocinative art   if how severe soever such means as are regarded as efficacious and necessary are employed for securing the service exacted whether with or without his previous consent to the engagement from a common soldier in what higher situation were they ever so severe should measures equally efficacious supposing them necessary be grudged and should not they be the less grudged the higher the duties of the situation in the scale of importance ratiocinative art  0 as between individual and individual where it is by the quantity of time employed in service that the quantum of remuneration is measured—payment being made by the day as in the case of a common labourer or artisan or by the hour as in the case of a professional instructor—in what case unless on the score of pure charity does any person think of paying or asking payment for any quantity of time during which no service has been performed why then as between an individual and the public ratiocinative instructional art    by usage intermission of legislative business has hitherto been everywhere established but by such usage were it ever so many times as extensive as it is the need of uninterrupted attendance would not be disproved whatsoever is anywhere the proportion of attendance actually given the presumption indeed is of course that it is sufficient—sufficient for all purposes but for this presumption there exists not anywhere any the smallest ground from the bare consideration of the nature of the case the assurance may be entire that in the state in question whatsoever it be evil effects of the most serious kind have been continually taking place and in almost any proportion such effect may have had place without its being possible to trace them or at any rate without their having in general been traced to their cause instructional art    in political states other than the angloamerican states—that is to say in all mixed monarchies nonattendance has had for its obvious cause the sinister interest of rulers instructional art    these rulers are—  the monarch with his more especial dependants   his junior partners in the concern—the members of the aristocracy and in particular those who have seats in any legislative chamber instructional art    by the monarch and his dependants more especially it is that those vast gaps have been made which have had place between session and session and which have for their efficient cause the operations called prorogation and adjournment prorogation avowedly the act of the monarch himself adjournment that of the monarch by the hands of those his agents instructional art    in england for example by the act of the monarch alone about the half of the year is habitually taken from the public service in this case the act is called a prorogation and to this defalcation is added that of a month or more taken at various times by the house of commons not to speak of the house of lords in this case the act is called an adjournment instructional art    the original object was of course as history shows to extinguish the existence of these troublesome concurrents and sharers in the sweets of government that being found impracticable the next object of wish and endeavour was is and will be to minimize their action of the whole quantity of the time employed by them a certain portion must of necessity for the purpose and under the direction of the monarch be employed in going through the forms necessary to the extraction of money and in such other business as the conjunct interest of the monarch and the aristocracy requires to be performed for this purpose whatsoever quantity of time is necessary is by law always at his command upon all measures whatsoever coming from any other quarter and in particular all measures tending to the melioration of the constitution an exclusion is put of course in whatever way may be most commodious and the most commodious because the least exposed to observation is the making such disposal of the time as shall either prevent anything troublesome from being brought on the carpet or when on from being finished as to this see parliamentary reform catechism vol iii p    —introduction instructional art    in addition to power which together with ease is thus obtained in the wholesale way comes the ease which is obtained in the retail way by nonattendance at businesstimes     on the part of particular individuals hence comes the curious phenomenon in the principal house for business seats     number necessary to be filled to give validity to the proceedings  0 every session several times does it happen that for want of this necessary number the day is lost to the public service the president excepted by whom under the name of speaker the business must be directed—on no session by any one member has attendance on every day perhaps been ever paid out of the     not one by whom under this head that has been done which ought to have been done by every one in addition to those who are paid by the overpaid offices by which they are kept in a state of corruption—chance having of late produced an individual by whom the public service for which he was engaged has for years been made his principal and gratuitous occupation at the observation of such a phenomenon every body continues lost in amazement but power without obligation is the very definition of despotism slavery the condition of those who are subject to it here then is a form of government under which by those who should be servants those who should be masters are kept in a state which is by law a state of slavery howsoever by the healing hand of public opinion the rigour of the despotism may be softened instructional art    in the angloamerican united states although power is not eased of obligation still in this same form is breach of constitutional duty suffered to have place of each year on an average not so much as twofifths are occupied in fulfilment of this neglect what can be the cause answer—unreflecting imitation imitation too of an original the general inaptitude of which affords to those who have rid themselves of it matter of such just and unceasing selfcongratulation true it is that in the copy the individual and retail idleness is not because for various reasons it cannot be anything near so flagrant as in the original but the aggregate and wholesale idleness is little less enormous ratiocinative instructional art    when in all situations in which the business is of subordinate importance the attendance is so unintermitted—why should it be less so in those in which the business is allcomprehensive and the importance of it supreme instructional art  0 every year in a tone of exultation assuredly by no means ungrounded the president in his message to congress reminds the people of the good done in the course of the last one day may perhaps produce the opposite account the account of the good which by blindness and idleness has thus been left undone but by the phrase good left undone much too favourable is the representation given of the effect of the good left undone one portion—and that by far the most important—is composed of the exclusion that should have been put upon the evil—the extensive and positive afflictions which have thus been suffered to take place instructional art    amongst the accounts thus given by authority let there be one for example of the misery produced by tardiness on the occasion of the adjustment of the state of the insolvency laws as between the central government and the several states a matter which to this day   th jan      remains after all unadjusted instructional art    for the inefficiency here mentioned two more causes are visible one is that which belongs to the present head—the suffering so much to be unemployed the other is the suffering so much to be wasted in the commencement of businesses the time employed in which is by the conclusion of the session turned to waste for want of their being handed over by the outgoing to the incoming legislature as to this see section    continuation committee instructional art    as to the subsidiary obligations above provided the more efficient the less favourably of course will these chains be thought of and spoken of by those for whose wear they are designed but at no less price can the effect be accomplished instructional art    on architecture good government has more dependence than men have hitherto seemed to be aware of those who wish not for absentation or untimely departure from any seat of business must not admit of multiplied or unobserved entrances and exits those who wish to exclude abuse from prisons must not have a space in which either the behaviour of any prisoner or the treatment he experiences is not continually exposed to every desiring eye those judges whose wish it is to exclude inspectors from the seat of judicature and such of course have ever been all english judges know well how powerless every other veto is in comparison with that which the architect alone can issue and secure completely against nonobservance instructional art    nonattendance is not the only cause of frustration and retardation in the provision for public exigencies another is the want of a supply for the involuntary deficiency created by death or sickness for remedy see section    selfsuppletive function a third may be seen in the improvidence or sinister     providence by which each successive legislature is deprived of the benefit of all former work commenced and left unfinished by its predecessor for remedy see section    continuation committee section xxi sittings public and secret enactive art   special cause to the contrary excepted the sittings of this assembly are at all times public the auditory is a committee of the publicopinion tribunal hearing and reporting for the information of the constitutive enactive art   so far as is consistent with convenience in respect of health sight hearing minutation and necessary intercommunication between actor and actor on the legislation theatre together with lodgment for requisite and appropriate furniture this constitution requires that the number of the members of the publicopinion tribunal to whom access and appropriate accommodation is given be maximized enactive art   to the hereinaftermentioned legislation minister it belongs to keep a secret sittingbook in it in the case of a secret sitting are entries made as follows—   year month and day of the motion for secrecy   names of movers voters and speakers for and against the secrecy   names or initials in their own handwritings respectively   alleged cause of the demand for secrecy enactive art   if divulgation has not already had place cognizance is taken of course by the next succeeding legislature of the truth and sufficiency of the allegations if either be wanting censure is passed on the members by whom the secrecy was voted enactive art   then is the regular time for divulgation but if the cause for secrecy subsists divulgation may be referred to the same legislature on some succeeding day of that year or to the next succeeding legislature and so on from legislature to legislature enactive art   for other cases for secrecy as to the operation of public functionaries see ch viii prime minister section    publication system section xxii term of service—continuation ratiocinative instructional art   exceptions excepted the shorter the term of service in the legislative assembly can be rendered consistently with the avoidance of precipitation and performance of duty the better for reasons see section    selfsuppletive function section    continuation committee and section    relocable who instructional art   exception may be if in any part of the territory of the state there be districts one or more so situated in respect of remoteness from the seat of legislation and difficulty of travelling taken together that by the time consumed in the journey too great a difference would be made between those districts and the others in respect of means of giving information to and support to their interests in the legislative assembly instructional art   note that on this occasion the time necessarily expended in the giving and receiving information as between the legislature and the constituted authorities and individuals residing in the remote districts in relation to exigencies peculiar to these districts is the only time which in the nature of the case needs to this purpose to be taken into account for as to the regular time of election if as per section    relocable who the members who have sitten on any year are excluded from relocability in the next the day of universal vacancy being always foreseen and predetermined the first of the days occupied in the election process may without difficulty be appointed to be as many days anterior to that same day—as including the time occupied in the journey from the district to the seat of legislature shall be sufficient to secure the timely arrival of the elected deputy at the seat of legislature thus much as to the regularly recurring vacancies as to the accidental vacancies caused by death resignation or dislocation replenishment will be seen effectually secured by section    selfsuppletive function instructional art   supposing these arrangements thus settled—elections may just as well take place in virtue of a preestablished and continued general regulation as in virtue of a special mandate offered by an individual functionary such as the election minister as per election code and ch xi ministers severally section   election minister indeed much better for when the performance of a process or operation is made or left dependent upon the act of a public functionary or in a word on the act of any person whatever it is left     liable to be prevented by any one of a variety of accidents as also by sinister design on the part of that same functionary with or without concert with others instructional art   in monarchies it was that the representative or say the deputation system originated of course under such a form of government no such process as that of deputation to a common assembly could be commenced otherwise than in consequence of and in conformity to the will of the monarch as promulgated on some particular day by a known servant of his appointed for this purpose hence the need of election authorizingandcommencing mandates instructional art   in no one of the several angloamerican united states is the term of service in the legislative assembly more than one year in one of them connecticut it is or was no more than half a year in the general congress it is two years the difference has for its obvious cause the consideration of distance had the considerations mentioned and expedients referred to in art   occurred would or would not the length of the term of service have in that case been thus doubled section xxiii selfsuppletive function enactive expositive art   selfsuppletive function to every deputy is communicated by the act of election the power of locating and keeping located upon and for every occasion some person of his own choice to act in all things in his stead at what time soever he is incapable of acting for himself or does not act to every deputy accordingly belongs this power together with the obligation of keeping it in exercise enactive art   compensationally punitionally and dislocationally responsible is the deputy for the acts of this his substitute enactive ratiocinative art   exceptions excepted locable as a deputys substitute is every person who is locable as deputy exception   another member of the same legislature for to a person so situated though the power of giving a vote over and above his own might be communicated—the power of making a speech over and above his own or a motion over and above his own could not enactive art   by the legislation minister will be kept a set of blank substitution instruments on each occasion one of these instruments filled up and signed by the deputy and signed by the substitute is on his entrance into the assembly chamber delivered by him to the doorkeeper as to whom see section  0 attendance and remuneration c enactive art   to provide against casual inability on the part of the deputy as to the locating a substitute in time for the occasion—every deputy previously to his taking his seat in the assembly chamber lodges in the office of the legislation minister a substitution instrument in favour of some person appointed to act as his permanent substitute the instrument being filled up and signed by himself and signed by the substitute who thereby engages to keep himself within reach in readiness to attend on requisition but to such permanent substitute may on each occasion as above be substituted an occasional substitute enactive art   on timely information received that on the then next or any succeeding sitting day the deputy in question will certainly or probably not be able to pay attendance—the legislation minister will cause to be summoned the abovementioned substitute or the information may be given to the substitute immediately with or without its being given to the legislation minister if dated and signed by the person giving it it may be given either by the deputy himself or by any other member of the legislature or by any other person sufficiently known to the deputy ratiocinative art   question   why thus make provision of a substitute to each deputy answer reasons i whatsoever need or use there is for a deputy to act as member of the body in question on any one day of the session—the same there will be for anything that can be known to the contrary on every other ratiocinative art   ii whatsoever arrangements can as above be taken as per section  0 attendance c for securing plenitude of attendance on the part of the deputy—to render them completely effectual without provision made of an eventual substitute is not possible witness definitive vacancy by death incurable infirmity resignation or dislocation witness occasional vacancy or say nonattendance involuntary through sickness voluntary through any one of an inscrutable multitude of causes by the arrangements proposed in this section this plenitude would be rendered complete and neverfailing every seat having daily a member duly authorized to fill it ratiocinative expositive art   iii for want of this desirable     plenitude a mode of corruption has at all times been carried on to an indefinite extent corruption effectually safe not only as against punishment at the hands of legal tribunals but against scrutiny and censure at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal a man whom had he been in attendance the apprehension of that censure would have engaged to vote on the right side—absents himself and thereby though he does not give to the wrong side the whole benefit of his vote deprives the right side of it and this without any check to hinder him—gives thus on every occasion to the wrong side half the benefit of a vote given in favour of that same wrong side corruption where the purpose of it is thus executed may be distinguished by the name of semicorruption or say absentation corruption happily though in this form it cannot with certainty be punished—yet what is much better it may in the way that will be seen be with adequate certainty prevented ratiocinative art  0 iv prevention of fluctuation in legislative and other bodies instances are not uncommon where the same measure has by one and the same body without any change in the number or sentiments of the members been alternately adopted and rejected those who are in a majority one day finding themselves in a minority another day hence confusion and uncertainty in the minds and actions of all persons whose interests are thus disposed of where attendance is optional there are no assignable limits to the magnitude of the evil thus produced nor to the frequency of its recurrence by the plenitude here secured evil in this shape would altogether be excluded ratiocinative art    v saving of solicitations of attendance—solicitations with the accompanying vexation consumption of individuals time and sometimes even delay to public measures ratiocinative art    vi thus and for the first time will the aggregate will actually expressed be rendered constantly identical with the aggregate will which on the occasion of all elections of deputies to a legislative or other representative assembly is not only intended to be expressed and almost as generally howsoever erroneously regarded as being actually expressed thus will an undesirable and reproachful distinction be obliterated an imperfection hitherto submitted to as if it were inherent in the constitution of a body of the sort in question cleared away ratiocinative art    vii for want of this remedy—questions to the number and importance of which no limit can be assigned must for their decision have been dependent on accident on accident in an unlimited variety of shapes of which sickness though a principal one is but one apply this security the power of accident over this case is at an end ratiocinative art    question   why give the suppletive power to the deputy instead of reserving it to his constituents answer reasons i if the constituents are the only persons to whom the power of providing the supply is given the supply cannot ever be adequate and the mode of making it cannot but be productive of divers evil effects whereas if the power be given to the deputy the supply may be rendered surely adequate no such evil effects will be produced and divers positive good effects will be produced ratiocinative art    ii in this way the adequacy of the supply may be and by the here proposed arrangements naturally will be made perfectly sure the deputy in case of his nonattendance is made responsible for the attendance of a substitute this he may be without difficulty the seat of the legislature being naturally the metropolis of the state—its sittings as per section    attendance unintermitted and the metropolis the principle seat of business in the state—the influx into it on one account or other from all the districts naturally abundant and constant—and in particular the influx of men who in respect of condition in life will be among the most apt for the situation in question—and these very arrangements furnishing an additional inducement for such influx—all these things considered any want of apt persons ready for the sake of the benefit to take upon themselves the burthen seems not in any degree to be apprehended ratiocinative art    iii on the part of the eventual substitute if located by the deputy the attendance in case of temporary nonattendance on the part of the deputy is more effectually secure than if he were located by the constituents in an immediate way as above it could be the substitute being resident on the spot will on every occasion be within call of the deputy and the deputy being bound for attendance on that same occasion—thus between the one and the other adequate motives are accompanied by adequate means ratiocinative art    iv suppose the substitute located by the constituents—no such assurance of constancy in the supply can be obtained by whatsoever causes as above nonattendance on the part of the deputy is producible by these same so is it on the part of the substitute substitutes more than one could not     be proposed to be sent along with the deputy and whatsoever greater number could be proposed to be so sent still the assurance could not be entire true it is that the abovementioned course—of taking for the substitute a person resident at the seat of service would be open to their choice but it would not be likely to be uniformly adopted for if permanently resident at that same seat of service he would not be known to them and if in the case of this or that district there were any such known person—in the case of this or that other there would not be at the best the number that could be thus located—located to serve throughout the session—would be thus limited whereas to the number that could be located one after another as occasion called by the deputy there are no limits ratiocinative art    v suppose however an eventual substitute located by the constituents in the case of a vacancy on the part of either deputy or substitute here would be a demand for a fresh election but while the process of election was going on—here would be but one of the two on the spot and during that time there would be the same danger of want of attendance as if no such provision of an eventual substitute had been made ratiocinative art    vi on this supposition too comes the vexation and expense of the election loss of time on the part of all who attend expense of journey to and fro and demurrage on the part of many and from all this loss no assignable advantage in any shape obtained ratiocinative art  0 vii antecedent to the close of the session which under the here proposed annuality of election is the same thing with the death of the legislature—there would be a certain number of days occupied by the election process during this time the vacancy would of necessity remain unsupplied ratiocinative art    viii so likewise a greater number of days during which a still longer vacancy would be produced by another cause the utmost service that could be looked for at the hands of a new member or substitute in the course of so short a time would be regarded as not capable of compensating for the vexation and expense of the election process as above ratiocinative art    ix if the provision of a substitute be made by the electors it must be at an expense charged upon the public if by the deputy himself it may be made without expense in the metropolis for as many days in the year as can present the demand sufficiently apt men in sufficient number able and willing to serve for so many different portions of so short a length of time in so high a situation without pecuniary retribution—and taken together for the whole of it one after another—never can be wanting then as to pay—suppose the substitute paid and paid by the public his pay will require to be at least equal to that of his principal it will in truth require to be greater for to that same principal belongs the whole of the power to the substitute no part at all except such if any as the principal feels the desire or lies under the necessity of imparting to him which is what can no otherwise be done than by forbearing himself to exercise it this being the case if a substitute engaging for constancy of attendance can be had gratis much more can the principal—the deputy and whatsoever pay if any be necessary suffices for the substitute still less will suffice for that same principal ratiocinative art    x positive good effects that afford a promise of being produced by this arrangement are as follows—   increase given to appropriate aptitude in all its branches by admission given to persons who otherwise would have stood excluded a person who though in respect of such his aptitude is the object of universal confidence would through old age or infirmity have been incapacitated from or disinclined to the subjecting himself to any such constancy of attendance as is as above required under the notion of its being indispensable—may by the here proposed relief be disposed to take upon himself the trust ratiocinative art    xi so in like manner a person who though recommended to the notice and favour of the electors by preeminent pecuniary responsibility would otherwise by the indolence naturally attendant on opulence be deterred in this case as in the former the natural subject of the proposed deputys choice would be some person by whose appropriate aptitude in the situation of substitute honour would in the opinion of the depute be done to that same choice ratiocinative art    xii in both these cases an opening is made for new men in whose instance a special promise of appropriate aptitude is afforded afforded and by means and motives beyond such as are likely to have place on the part of a majority of the electors ratiocinative art    xiii attached to the situation of deputy here in both these cases would be patronage and from this patronage the value of the situation would in the eyes of candidates   0 and competitors receive increase true it is that in other cases patronage is a source and instrument of corruption not so in this case in no shape is any advantage given which is not altogether dependent upon the free will of the people in the quality of electors in the case of the approved and respected patron may be seen a promise of moral in that of the opulent patron of pecuniary responsibility in that of the subject of their choice a promise of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude instructional ratiocinative art    what is above considered—it may be worth further consideration whether it might not with advantage and safety be left at the option of every deputy whether to attend in his own person or by such his substitute attendance on the part either of the one or the other being unremittingly enforced as to the public it has been seen that it would be likely to be a gainer by this indulgence and it does not appear whence suffering or danger in any shape can come as to the individuals in question the advantage in various shapes to them is obvious and out of dispute instructional ratiocinative art    for distinctions sake that is to say for pointing in a more particular manner the eyes of the people upon the conduct of the substitutes and in this point of view upon that of their respective locators—might it not be of use that they should wear some conspicuous habiliment for example across the shoulders a broad ribbon on which are marked in universally conspicuous letters their official denominations instructional art    so also in the case of the members of the proposed continuation committee as to whom see section    continuation committee enactive art  0 on every day on which the seat of any member in the assembly shall have remained vacant neither the deputy nor any substitute of his being on service—notice of such absentation will by the registrar be entered in the register of the assembly and placards in sufficient number forthwith transmitted to the election clerk of the district by whom they will be posted up on the outside of his official edifice in conspicuous situations appropriated to the purpose enactive art    if within   days after such day of default no excuse paper stating the inevitable cause of such vacancy shall have been delivered in to the registrar—information of such further default will be transmitted by him to the election clerk in his district and at the same time to the election minister at the seat of the assembly on the receipt thereof the minister will forthwith transmit to the election clerk his mandate ordering for the district in question a fresh election for the excuses allowable on different occasions for failure of attendance and other compliances where and when due see the procedure code enactive art    if an excuse paper as above be delivered in—the assembly will in the first place pronounce as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the excuse in case of its insufficiency the legislature will give orders for a fresh election as above and as to the substitute who likewise will in this case have made default it will either content itself with rendering the default universally known by appropriate publication or in case of need proceed to punishment as per section    legislation penal judicatory section xxiv continuation committee enactive ratiocinative instructional art   lest by the exit of members by whom introduction or support has been given to useful arrangements any such arrangement should after proposal and acceptance be lost or deteriorated—as also lest the appropriate intellectual and active aptitude produced by experience should by such secession be rendered less than without prejudice to appropriate moral aptitude—to wit to length of exposure to corruption from the executive—it may thus be made to be—each legislature antecedently to its outgoing will elect a committee the members of which—to the number of from seven to twentyone or more—will under the name of the continuation committee under the direction of the legislature apply their endeavours collectively or individually in the next succeeding legislature to the carrying on of the designs and proceedings of the then next preceding legislature in an unbroken thread enactive art   locable in the continuation committee is in each year not only every member of the outgoing legislature but every member of the continuation committee serving in that same legislature thus may any person serve as a continuation committeeman for any number of successive years enactive ratiocinative art   a continuation committeeman has for the above purpose on every occasion right of argumentation and initiation or say of speech and motion but not having been elected by the people he has not a vote enactive art   subject to any such alteration as     the legislature may at any time think fit to make the pay of a continuation committeeman is the same as that of a deputy ratiocinative art   question   why make provision for the continuation of proceedings which having been commenced under one legislature would otherwise have been dropped for want of being continued under the next answer reasons i if for this purpose no provision were made useful arrangements to the importance extent or number of which no limits can be assigned may experience a delay to which also no limits can be assigned say time lost ratiocinative art   ii others of which at the time the need may in any degree have been or even may continue urgent may by some temporary accident be prevented from even being so much as proposed say good measures lost ratiocinative art   iii in whatever instance in the hope of consummation proceedings having been instituted have by the extinction of the legislature been left unfinished—here is so much of the time employed in them consumed in waste say functionaries time wasted ratiocinative art   iv true it is—that in this case though the legislative arrangements with a view to which the proceedings were commenced have not taken place—yet in the course of these same proceedings information more or less valuable will commonly have been obtained but on the other hand in so far as information elicited on behalf of a proposed arrangement has not been accompanied with such information as in case of completion would have been elicited in opposition to it—here comes a proportionable danger that the information thus obtained will be more or less delusive say delusive information probabilized ratiocinative art   v arrangements to the extent number and importance of which no limit can be assigned may—in consideration of the length of time that would be necessary to the bringing to maturity the body of information necessary to constitute an adequate ground—be precluded from being ever initiated proposed or so much as mentioned the more extensive and important the arrangements the more protracted the preparation will naturally be conceived to be and the more protracted it is conceived to be the more perfectly will all prospect of consummation be excluded say improvement prevented from being so much as conceived ratiocinative art  0 vi the shorter the life of the legislative body the greater the evil in its above several shapes under the present proposed code this life is limited to a single year or in case of necessity produced by distance of some parts of the territory from the seat of legislation to at the utmost two years and the greater this distance the greater will naturally be the length of time necessary to give completeness to the information ratiocinative art    vii as the same continuation committeeman may be relocated by successive legislatures in any number there will be no limit but that of his life to the quantity of experience thus placed at their command ratiocinative art    viii true it is—that in the practice of nations no instance of any such provision is adducible but the absence of it may without difficulty be accounted for by other suppositions than that of its needlessness to wit by the vis inertiæ of government by the natural blind continuance in the course continued in by predecessors and by sinister interest and interestbegotten prejudice on the part of rulers ratiocinative art    ix in the earliest ages printing being unknown writing—a jewel in the hands of the extremely few travelling moreover unsafe and tedious means of eliciting any such extensive body of information in a permanent shape were unattainable in succeeding ages when bodies having a sort of momentary and precarious share in legislation were brought together it was under the spur of temporary necessity for some one or two limited purposes—commonly for no other but the obtaining a pecuniary supply their convener a monarch who when once the purpose was accomplished felt no motives for continuing but the most irresistible ones for dismissing as quickly as possible such troublesome associates ratiocinative art    question   why not give to the members of these committees the right of voting answer reasons i to the purpose for which the institution is proposed that right is neither necessary nor subservient servants not fellow masters these functionaries stand in this respect on the same footing with ministers to whom speech and motion without vote is given as per ch ix ministers collectively section    legislation—regarding functions ratiocinative art    ii though for the year during     which they serve as deputies with votes they will have been chosen by their proper constituents—they will not have been chosen by those same or any other electors for any one of the succeeding years during which the need of their services in the character of continuation committeemen may come to have place ratiocinative art    iii for as much as to the purpose in question it may be necessary that the number of them should not be fixed—the consequence is—that if they had votes the power of keeping the number of the members of the legislature in continued fluctuation would be in case of such nonfixation possessed by whatsoever authority they were located by ratiocinative art    iv supposing as above the right of voting not imparted to them—they may without difficulty or ground of objection be located by their own colleagues who on this supposition are as will be seen their only apt locators ratiocinative art    question   why thus give to their colleagues the location of these functionaries answer reasons i in the possession of these their colleagues will be the best evidence whereon to pass judgment on their appropriate aptitude in all its branches and in particular in the intellectual and the active being those which in their instance are principally in demand while by their nonpossession of the right of voting will be obviated all danger and objection on the score of any such deficiencies of appropriate moral aptitude as might otherwise be the result of their length of continuance in office a length which after this precaution may without danger be maximized influence of will on will none influence of understanding on understanding will be their sole influence ratiocinative art    ii in the possession of these their colleagues alone will moreover be the evidence whereon to judge of the nature and probable quantity of the business for which their assistance will be needed and thence of the number of them which that business may require ratiocinative art  0 iii the choice of committeemen out of their own associates has by universal need been rendered the universal practice on the part of the legislative and other numerous bodies ratiocinative art    iv take here for emblem sisyphus and his stone sinister policy joins with ignorance and heedlessness in perpetuating the useless torment the continuation committee system applies to the stone a board which detains it at its maximum of elevation and the next impulse given to it lodges it on the desired eminence section xxv relocable who enactive art   no person who for any district has sitten as a member of the legislature can for that or any other district be in that situation relocated unless and thence until of the persons who have served as members there exists at the time a number thrice or twice as great as that of the whole number of the members of whom the legislative body is composed enactive art   for the ascertaining on each occasion the existence of this necessary number it will be among the functions of the legislation minister having before him the list of the members of the legislature to keep account and for the several years to mark off as the occurrences take place the several quondam members who by death or otherwise have become definitively unrelocable enactive art   for reasons for art   and for the locability of a member in the continuation committee of the next year see section    continuation committee ratiocinative instructional art   a position upon which the hereproposed arrangement is grounded is—that without nonrelocability—and that for a term sufficient to present to the electors two sets at least of competitors the number of whom when added together shall be little or nothing less than the double of that of the situations to be filled—any supposed opening for improvement or correction of abuse will be but illusory for that unless it be in a number insufficient to produce any effect the set of men located at the first election will to every practical purpose continue in place on all subsequent elections just as they would have done had there never been any elections by which they could be dislocated ratiocinative instructional art   if the number of persons capable of being competitors be short of this—all the effect produced by the elimination and election process will be—the adding to the original number of the acting managers a certain number of dormant ones who will be all along sharers in the latent profits of the power without being sharers in the responsibility attached to the open exercise of it     expositive instructional art   joint proprietors of a fund for whatever purpose established suppose an indefinite and everchanging number having for its limits the original number of the transferable shares number of original managers during the first year of the institution say for example twentyfour of these eighteen stay in without reelection six only go out and that of course the first year giving place consequently to six new ones and so in every succeeding year of this arrangement what is the result answer every year after the first—total number instead of twentyfour thirty whereof twentyfour in possession six others in expectancy only but that expectancy sure thus is the election no more than an empty show no proprietor besides the six managers in expectancy seeing any the least chance of his being elected should he offer himself accordingly no such offer is ever made whole number—thirty—revolve in a cycle consisting of a short arithmetical repetend in the form of a circulate exemplificational instructional art   in every instance in which the sort of arrangement in question has place the truth of this theory stands demonstrated by experience witness the case of the east india company witness that of the bank of england company witness that of the several minor companies too numerous for enumeration which have been organized upon the model of those two gigantic ones exemplificational instructional art   in the case of the city of london and its governing body the common council it stands exemplified and receives a still stronger confirmation in that case the seats—not merely in a small proportion as above but the whole number—are at all election times open and the elections have place in every year yet in the whole number rarely indeed except by death or resignation does any change take place of this stagnation what is the consequence answer—what it cannot fail to be anywhere imbecility corruption—inaptitude in a word in every shape comparison laid with the aptitude which might securely be substituted to it by the hereproposed allcomprehensive temporary nonrelocability system and assuredly not at any less price instructional art   for proof or disproof of this same position the case of the angloamerican united congress with its house of representatives and senate presents another obvious and proper object of reference but in that case circumstances occur which would render the examination tedious and the result undecisive the case is there a complicated one complicated with that of the general system of government and state of society in other particulars and where simple cases are sufficiently decisive it would be lost labour to dwell on complicated ones it would not have been mentioned but to show that it has not been overlooked instructional art  0 for the same reason nothing more is here said of the french chamber of deputies under the charter with its provision for the annual elimination of onefifth instructional art    the same reason will serve for similar silence on the present occasion as to the case of the english house of commons instructional art    in conclusion where for each situation there are not at least two candidates standing upon tolerably equal ground all appearance of choice is in a greater or less degree illusory instructional art    the contrivance has for its model that of the juggler holding up a pack of cards with the faces to the company—young gentleman says he to one of them fix upon which you please care being all the while taken that one and one alone shall be in such sort visible as to give determination to choice ratiocinative art    question   why during the time proposed or for so much as any one session exclude all persons who have served as deputies from serving again answer reasons i because from undiscontinued relocability evil effects naturally flow as will be seen in all shapes ratiocinative art    ii to the public whatever good could be expected from undiscontinued relocability and undiscontinued relocatedness in consequence is ensured with addition and without any evil by the continuation committee institution as above ratiocinative art    iii as to individual deputies no evil in any shape would be produced—no pain of privation—no disappointment since no sooner did any one of them look to the situation than the limits to his continuance in it would meet his eyes true it is that in the case of a person whom the commencement of the authority of this code might find in the possession of the situation in question the exemption from uneasiness would not have place and from this circumstance a proportionable obstruction to such commencement could not but reasonably be expected ratiocinative art    iv as to the evil effects from     undiscontinued relocability they have for their immediate cause the probabilization of relative inaptitude in all shapes on the part of the relocated functionary ratiocinative art    v first as to the inaptitude correspondent and opposite to appropriate aptitude in all shapes taken together under the circumstances in question the undiscontinued relocability wants very little scarce anything at all in effect and practice of being tantamount to location for life in the eyes of electors in general as well as their deputies nonreelection will have the effect of dislocation the deputy who has served his one year has at the election of the second year possession to plead and his services that have been performed in the course of that same first year be those services ever so slender no equal plea can be put in by a competitor who not having served at all has not had the possibility of rendering any such services ratiocinative art    vi next as to moral inaptitude in particular in the natural course of things this disqualification so far as it is constituted by corruptedness will be universal corruptees these same relocated members corruptors with or without design in the superior regions the two great givers of good gifts—the prime minister and the justice minister in the inferior regions the leading men among each deputys electors ratiocinative art  0 vii matter of corruption the aggregate of these same good gifts attached to the several official situations as to which they are locators elements of this aggregate—contents of this cornucopia money moneys worth power power of patronage included and reputation comprising whatsoever dignity or say distinction stands inseparably attached to these same situations the two other ingredients in the official cornucopia of a monarchy—to wit ease at the expense of duty and vengeance at the expense of justice being it is hoped excluded pretty effectually from that of the present proposed constitution by various appropriate arrangements pervading the whole texture of it ratiocinative art    viii efficient cause of corruption in this case expectation of the eventual receipt of some portion or portions of that same matter in case of compliance with the several wills declared or presumed of the corruptors here as elsewhere let it never be out of mind—it is not so much by the actual receipt of these objects of desire that the corruptedness is produced as by the eventual expectation of them for by the receipt in one instance it is not produced any otherwise than in so far as receipt is necessary to engender and keep alive expectation in other instances ratiocinative art    ix corruptees per contrà those same corruptors abovementioned elements of the matter of corruption in their situations—  increase of power   diminution of responsibility—restrictive or say refrenative responsibility ratiocinative art    x thus in the superior regions in the inferior regions corruptors the leading men among the electors matter of corruption the benefit of their influence with those their colleagues corruptees per contrà those same leading men elements of the matter of corruption in their situation   such portions of the matter of corruption as are of too little value to be objects of concupiscence to the deputies for themselves or their connexions   gratification from courtesy and flattery received and expected from their deputies in consideration of the support received or expected   benefit to the particular local interest or supposed interest of the district they belong to at the expense of the general interest of the state ratiocinative art    xi correspondent per contrà corruptees in this case these same corruptors matter of corruption in this case   at the hands of the eventually reelected deputy expectation of good things of minor value not good enough to be worth the acceptance of deputies or their connexions and thus obtainable from the favour of the abovementioned archcorruptors   expectation of courtesy and flattery at the hands of these same deputies in return for the favours looked for by them as above as to the good things just mentioned the original source from which they will in great part perhaps in most part be looked for is the favour of the archcorruptor abovementioned the channel through which they will be regarded as flowing being the favour of the several also abovementioned subcorruptors ratiocinative art    xii under the influence of this corruption the greater number of the members will naturally be found belonging to one or other of two classes those who have nothing but votes to sell and those who besides votes have talents to sell as to comparative prices of the voteseller the price will not deviate much from uniformity of the talentseller the price will not only rise above that of the voteseller but swell to an amount to which no determinate limit can be assigned no limit other than that which bounds the aggregate value of all that the abovementioned archgivers of good gifts have to bestow     and that which for himself and his connexions of all sorts the deputy in question is capable of receiving as to the talents they may be distinguished into talents for speaking and talents for management as between these the highest price will in general be obtained by the talents for speaking these being at once the more rare and by much the more conspicuous expositive instructional art    thus on this part of the moral world is the attraction of corruption not less universal than the attraction of gravity in the physical world and in the present case every year the cohesion of which the matter of corruption is the cement will be closer than in all former years expositive instructional art    as is the blood of man to the tiger who has once tasted of it so are the sweets of office to the functionary who has once tasted of them seldom by anything but hopelessness of reenjoyment will the appetite be extinguished instructional art    but though the power of the matter of corruption is naturally thus efficient some length of time different according to idiosyncrasy and other circumstances will be necessary to the production of the effect for though for the formation of the virtual contract converse and particular explanations between the parties may be unnecessary—not so such means of acquaintance with one anothers dispositions as are requisite to form a ground for practice and for the obtainment of this information a certain length of time is generally necessary hence in the antisceptic regimen one general rule in the case of every two functionaries whose situations operate upon each other with a corruptive influence minimize the time of contact but for this resource all endeavours to obviate the contagion might be hopeless but this resource being at command the case is by no means desperate expositive instructional art    emblem the red hot roller under which for smoothing a stuff is passed without injury allow to the time of contact a certain increase the stuff is in a flame instructional art  0 of the principle here in question ulterior application will be seen made in so far as the nature of the case admits and in particular in the judiciary department see ch xii judiciary collectively section    migration instructional art    though to the extent to which it is applicable with advantage the principle has not perhaps been applied in any country—there is not perhaps any in which more or less application has not been made of it instructional ratiocinative art    of the sole reason for the undiscontinued relocability system on the ground of utility the essence is contained in the word experience but on the occasion here in question the idea commonly attached to this word wants much of being clear or sufficiently comprehensive—experience is applicable to two different situations—  to that of the deputies   to that of the electors on this occasion that of the deputies seems to have been the only one commonly thought of moreover on the occasion of the application thus made of it the idea attached to it seems to have been vague and indeterminate to fix it the expression must be changed and to the indeterminate expression experience the so thoroughly determined expression appropriate aptitude substituted now to the most important branch of appropriate aptitude namely the moral the system in question has just been shown to be not only not favourable but positively and highly adverse remain the two other branches of the aptitude namely the intellectual and the active true it is then that considered apart from the moral to these it cannot but be acknowledged to be generally speaking favourable but in the moral branch suppose a deficiency any increase in these two branches so far from raising the degree of aptitude taken in the aggregate may as has been seen lower it instructional art    here then comes in one great use of the continuation committee to the members as such the right of speech and that of motion being alone given and that of voting being discarded thus it is—that by means of this engine a supply of intellectual and active aptitude may be kept up without any the least diminution of moral aptitude a supply and that susceptible of increase as long continued as any which by undiscontinued relocability and relocation could have been provided at the expense of moral aptitude instructional art    after all where on this occasion experience is ascribed to the situation of the functionary in question of what qualification on his part under that name can there be any reasonable assurance from his merely filling the situation if that be all nothing can be inferred and unless this or that individual be in view this is all that can on any sufficient grounds be affirmed upon the attention bestowed upon the business to which his situation puts it in his power to apply his mind will depend whatever aptitude he may possess in either of the two branches take away the     attention the experience amounts to very little that is to say to the present purpose for another there is as will be seen with reference to which this little will be considerably better than nothing exemplificational instructional art    for an example look to the english legislative assemblies and in particular to the house of lords here you may see beyond all doubt possession of the situation possession on the part of hundreds and on the part of each unit whatsoever experience the possession cannot fail to give look at this experience and then see what in the case of the vast majority is the produce in the shape of any one of the branches of appropriate aptitude instructional art    remains now the experience considered as desirable in the situation of the electors experience as to comparative aptitude as between candidate and candidate as to this see the next article ratiocinative art    question   why not render the nonrelocability perpetual answer reason that for the choice of the electors of each district there may be in a state capable of being and not unlikely to be competitors with each other two persons at least—of whose comparative appropriate aptitude in future as to the situation in question the electors have had the means of judging from observations made of their respective degrees of appropriate aptitude in and for that same situation as therein already manifested which men may accordingly relation had to that same situation be termed tried men and in respect of the interest which the observers have had in the accuracy of the observation the conduct of their deputies being thus the concern of the electors—the electors may thus in the words of the common phrase be said to have had experience of it suppose the relocability to have place from the first—they would as above vacancies by death resignation or the extremely rare case of dislocation excepted seldom have any to choose out of but the original stock in which case the election process would be of little or no use suppose no relocability to have place at any time they would have no tried men—in the above sense of the word tried—to choose out of instructional art    in the instance of each deputy after one year of service in that situation for how many years shall his nonrelocability therein continue the choice seems to be between two years and three years the country not being a given quantity materials constituting a sufficient ground for a decisive answer are not it should seem to be found the following considerations will present to view the difficulty and at the same time a circumstance which lessens it instructional art    make the interval of nonrelocability too long the danger is—  that the chance or even the assurance of repossessing the situation will not be sufficiently attractive the minds of those who would otherwise have been competitors will have been turned off to other pursuits   moreover the state will for so long have remained debarred from the benefit looked for from the giving to the electors the choice as between men called tried men as above note however that supposing no failure in the number of these peculiarly apt competitors—this effect extends not beyond the preparation period—the first year reckoning from the day of the adoption of the constitution here proposed instructional art  0 as to the circumstances by which the difficulty is lessened it consists in the multitude of situations which in the instance of each such temporarily dislocated deputy will under this constitution be open to his desires instructional art      in this one supreme legislature there will be seen as per ch v constitutive section   powers a multitude of sublegislatures exercising each of them though to less local extent most of the functions of that one in the supreme legislature suppose by the deputy in question no more than a moderate share of appropriate aptitude manifested and that for no more than one year—such manifestation made in such a place cannot but be expected by him and with reason to operate as a powerful recommendation particularly that body of appropriate information considered which even though no outward manifestation of his having received it shall have happened to be given cannot fail to have presented itself to his notice   ministerial situations immediately under the supreme legislature and thence under the prime minister true it is—that in these the openings will be so few—and the qualifications which will be found necessary so rare—that the number by whom for the present purpose their situations can be looked to as a resource will be proportionably small though the number of those same situations is thirteen—whether for the filling them so large a number of persons will be necessary will depend on local circumstances and in these same situations instead of temporary nonrelocability the nature of the case will be seen to require perpetual continuance saving special causes of dislocation as to these ministers see ch xi ministers severally   under each sublegislature a set of subministerial situations wanting little of being     equal in number to the abovementioned ministerial ones   situations in the judiciary in each immediate judicatory four situations—no one of them with reference to the exfunctionaries in question beneath acceptance so likewise the same number in each appellate judicatory true it is—that it will not be till a considerable time after the commencement of the constitution that this resource will be open to them nor then except on the supposition of their having passed through the appropriate probationary period and thereupon migrated for the time from the judiciary into this transitory situation as to this see ch xii judiciary collectively section    locable who instructional art    on the first establishment of a constitution which is as much as to say on the first formation of a new state—the people find themselves under a dilemma experience of the character of public men with a view to their location in the several efficient situations is at the same time preeminently desirable and necessarily deficient accordingly that is the state of things wherein arrangements for stocking the establishment with such appropriate experience are most needful but at that same period men in any tolerable degree possessed of appropriate aptitude will be most rare and at the same time the need of appropriate aptitude for these same situations the most pressing in this state of things if on the part of the set of men first located a degree of appropriate aptitude should chance to be possessed sufficient for carrying on in any way the business of government—the higher the degree of that aptitude the greater may be the risk incurred by the substituting to the men by whom such appropriate experience has been had other men by whom and of whom no appropriate experience at all has been had instructional art    exception made of the case of the new republican states sprung peaceably as if in the way of childbirth out of already established parent states under the angloamerican confederacy—new republics will not have been seen formed otherwise than by the complete subversion or dismemberment of monarchical aristocratical or monarchicoaristocratical governments but it is only in consequence of an excessive degree of palpable misgovernment the case of england and its emancipated colonies excepted that any such revolution has ever yet taken place and of such bad government one neverfailing effect has been—the rendering the people in a degree proportioned to the badness of it unapt for the business of government when the power has come into their hands appropriate aptitude intellectual and active sufficient for the throwing off the yoke of the old bad government and for the formation of a new government has indeed had place among them by the supposition but in conjunction with this necessary existing minimum of intellectual and active aptitude slight indeed is the degree of appropriate moral aptitude which as above can have had existence as to that which consists in the being desirous of giving to the people at large the benefit of such degree of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude as the individual in question possesses instead of giving that benefit exclusively to himself and his own particular connexions—the total absence of it may not be inconsistent with a degree of intellectual and active aptitude sufficient for the institution and even for the continuance of a government in the hands of the set of functionaries first located instructional art    of this state of things exemplifications are but too abundant and too notorious to need specifying instructional art    of this same state of things one consequence is that in regard to the points here in question scarcely can any arrangement be proposed which does not lie open to objections—and such objections as—if considered by themselves and without regard to the objections to which every arrangement differing from it stands exposed—might not unreasonably be regarded as decisive instructional ratiocinative art    under these circumstances of the two opposite risks one or other of which cannot but be incurred that incurred by undiscontinued relocability presents itself as the greatest that by temporarily discontinued locability as the least under undiscontinued locability relocation of by far the greater number has been seen to be highly probable thus would it be at the very next election after that by which they were seated for the first time and whatsoever were the degree of their firmness in their several seats on the first reelection at the time of every fresh election it will have received increase but in every situation with length of possession the appetite for power far from experiencing diminution experiences increase and in the situation here in question while the appetite is thus receiving increase so is the facility of gratifying it to wit from the strength so necessarily given by habitual intercourse to the connexion of those members of the supreme legislative assembly with the unavoidably so constituted arch corruptors—the givers of good gifts—the respective heads of the administrative and the judiciary departments more especially of the administrative the consequence if not absolutely certain at any rate but too highly probable is—a gradual but regular progression from a representative democracy to a monarchichoaristocratical     form of government working by fear and corruption and thence to a despotic monarchy with its standing army working by fear alone without need of corruption everything going on from comparatively good to bad and from bad to worse till the maximum of what is bad is reached and bating the chance of a violent revolution perpetuated instructional art    such for example was the course in which at the time of the english civil wars the parliament in conclusion called the rump parliament had at the time of its forced dissolution been running in consequence of the perpetual nondislocability which—with intentions probably at the outset as patriotic at least as any which in any such situation were ever entertained—the original members had succeeded in obtaining for themselves instructional art    on the other hand under the temporarily discontinued relocability system if with a legislature composed each year of an entire new set of members for three or even two years the government can but maintain itself in existence—appropriate experience on the part of deputies and electors will go on increasing corruption to an extent capable of producing evil in a tangible shape will by means of the securities here provided against it be excluded and what change there is will be from good to better and better for by this change in the composition of the supreme legislature no change as to the individual at the head of the executive will be necessitated or so much as probabilized and in him will be the powers of location and dislocation as to all the other official situations in which the business of government is carried on instructional art    as to the just mentioned securities—those which apply to the situation of the head of the administrative department—the prime minister—in this way will be seen to operate—not only those which are placed in the chapter denominated from that high functionary but those also which are placed in the chapter headed ministers collectively ch ix namely in section    remuneration section    locable who section    located how section    securities c for although in a more direct and manifest way they will be seen bearing upon the situations of those his several locatees immediate subordinates and dislocables—yet by the limits they apply to his choice when filling those several situations and the checks they apply to the powers exercised by these his instruments those securities the application of which may to a first glance appear confined to those situations may be seen moreover to apply all of them in effect to his but neither do these nor any others which could be added bear upon the situation of deputy commissioned by the electors to act in their behalf in that supreme legislative situation which as per ch iv authorities is the supreme operative all locators subordinate to the members of the legislature—and at the head of them the head of the administrative department—are responsible legally as well as morally as for all other exercises of their authority so for every choice it falls in their way to make upon the situation of the deputies of the people no legal responsibility can attach other than that which is constituted by the extraordinary and difficultly applicable though indispensable remedy applied should it ever be applied by dislocation exercised at their charge by their respective electors upon the situation of the electors themselves neither can any legal nor so much as any moral responsibility attach consistently with the altogether indispensable freedom of their choice instructional art  0 meantime in every situation moral aptitude will depend upon the influence exercised by the publicopinion tribunal as will the efficiency of that influence upon the degree of liberty possessed by the press and under the best possible form of government the sufficiency of that liberty will be in a lamentable degree dependent upon the particular structure of the minds of those in whose hands the reins of government happen at the outset to be placed the angloamerican states now so happily confirmed in the possession of a form of government the only as yet fully settled one which in an enlightened age deserves the name of a government—were for years within an ace of losing it from      to   0  a law was in force having for its object the saving the rulers wherever they were from the mortification of seeing any disapprobation of their conduct expressed in terms other than such as they themselves would approve of and by those who afterwards had the magnanimity to expose themselves to it a trial the severest perhaps that a man in power is capable of undergoing was submitted to instructional art    in england by a mixture of magnanimity and weakness—in what proportion cannot as yet be known—the example to a degree not less astonishing than laudable has been for some time copied in this as in all cases in which tyranny has been relaxed the danger is—lest by gratitude the people should be betrayed into a greater degree of confidence than even under the best possible form of government can find a sufficient warrant     ratiocinative art    objections to the temporary nonrelocability system with answers i objections   by the nonrelocability system temporary as it is freedom of choice is for the time taken away   to every irreproachable member dislocation from his situation—dislocation and for so long a term and without so much as any imputation of misbehaviour will be productive of suffering and that unmerited   power so small in respect of its duration no person endowed with adequate appropriate aptitude in all its several branches would vouchsafe to accept ii answers   of no use is freedom of choice otherwise than as a security for appropriate aptitude on the part of the object of the choice but until the proposed term of nonrelocability is expired freedom of choice is not it has been shown conducive in any degree to the location of appropriate aptitude it is on the contrary in a high degree conducive to the location of inaptitude of inaptitude as to every branch of appropriate aptitude when the nonrelocability ceases to operate as a bar to aptitude it is here removed   productive of suffering yes if unexpected and thence he unprepared for it to wit pain of disappointment but every one being completely prepared for it no such suffering can have place as his location cannot be effected without his own consent—if upon the whole the enjoyment were not expected by him to be preponderant over all suffering he could not be in the situation in which by the supposition he is   yes persons in abundance even supposing the situation of member of the legislature led to nothing else instances of situations which though much less desirable are objects of extensive competition may be seen in every state but over and above the facility for obtaining at the hands of ministers desirable situations for his friends an advantage the complete prevention of which how desirable soever is impossible is—that the seat in the legislature is a steppingstone into divers other seats to wit   in the continuationcommittee   in the next sublegislature   at the expiration of the nonrelocability term a seat in the legislature and thence again into a continuationcommittee instructional ratiocinative art    comparative view of the undiscontinued locability and the temporary nonrelocability system upon the whole as between the temporary nonrelocability system coupled with the continuationcommittee institution on the one part and the undiscontinued relocability system on the other the points of comparison may be summed up as follows— i temporary nonrelocability and continuationcommittee system   by the prospect of a situation in the committee—it secures on the part of all apt members together with the desire of that situation prospect of competition thence exertion and by exertion maximization of appropriate aptitude in all its branches   the term of nonrelocability expired it secures in a number proportioned to the length of the term tried men out of whom on the election of members of the legislature the electors will have their choice and at the same time opens the door to men as yet untried who under the other system would have regarded it as shut   it keeps on foot a select body of appropriate political watchmen without doors engaged by interest in their quality of leading members of the publicopinion tribunal to keep watch on the conduct of their rivals and future competitors—the members of the legislature in the several years   it secures for the sublegislatures a supply of appropriate aptitude such as they could not by any other means be provided with   it thereby affords to the legislature a probable supply more or less extensive of functionaries who to the stock of national knowledge and judgment acquired in the legislature have added a stock of local knowledge and judgment acquired in sublegislatures ii undiscontinued relocability system   no such prospect no such motive for exertion for the being reelected the negative merit of not having given offence to individuals will on the part of a great majority suffice   on no occasion unless by accident and that not likely to be frequent does it admit of the nonrelocation of the person once elected howsoever unapt nor accordingly does it lay open the choice   it provides no such security for appropriate aptitude in any shape on the part of the members of the legislature   it affords no such supply   no such supply   0 ratiocinative art    question   why to the security provided in section  0 attendance and remuneration for each days attendance by forfeiture of that days pay add the further securities in this present section provided answer reasons against nonattendance on particular days not only the mere loss of those days pay but even the utmost penal security applicable in a pecuniary shape would necessarily be insufficient inadequate would be not only the mere withdrawal of remuneration but any positive fixed mulct that could be applied to men of a certain elevation in the scale of opulence a pecuniary punishment that might generally even appear excessive would even operate as a licence to some even as an object of mockery in this case therefore as in every other for securing compliance no instrument other than punishment in such amount as to be sure of operating in that character and in such sort as to outweigh the utmost profit by the offence could have been sufficient applied to the principal alone or the substitute alone even this sort of security could not be sufficient by allegations the falsity of which could not be sufficiently made manifest either would be able to shift off the blame from himself and fasten it either upon the other or upon accident ratiocinative art    question   intending to provide additional securities so much more efficient and of themselves so sufficient why commence with a security the effect of which is thus precarious answer reasons i as far as it goes pecuniary punishment in this mildest of all forms is the most secure of execution that the nature of the case admits of and to a considerable extent efficiency would not be wanting to it ii in the case of the several subordinate situations it appeared indispensable and to have withholden the application of it to this would have been contributing to the propagation of mischievous delusion by attributing to all men to whom it shall have happened to be located in this situation a needless and delusive character of peculiar dignity independent of good desert section xxvi wrongful exclusion obviated instructional art   the case of partial exclusion by force or fraud or extraordinary accident excepted—against deficiency in respect of plenitude of attendance and thence risk of fluctuation in legislative arrangements provision such as appeared sufficient has been made in and by former sections viz section    attendance—section    remuneration—section  0 attendance and remuneration—section    selfsuppletive function—section    continuation committee—section    relocable who—remains as a case calling for provision that of a temporary deficiency produced by one or other of the three just mentioned causes enactive art   on each occasion the authority belongs to the majority of the members then present at the appropriate place of meeting     enactive art   if by force artifice or accident any member or members who would otherwise have been present have been prevented from being so the proceeding is not by any such impediment rendered null and void but supposing the fact of such impediment established and the case such that the number so excluded would had it been present have composed with the addition of that of the others a majority on the other side—a declaration to that effect will naturally be passed and things will be placed as near as may be on the same footing as if the members so excluded had been present enactive art   if the exclusion has had force or artifice for its cause all persons members and others intentionally concerned in the production of it will at the discretion of the majority be compensationally as well as punitionally and dislocationally responsible as to this see section    legislation penal judicatory enactive art   if in the bringing about any such fraudulent exclusion any member or other functionary dislocable by the constitutive authority has been purposely concerned here will be another occasion for the exercise of its incidental dislocative as per ch v constitutive section   section xxvii legislation inquiry judicatory expositive art   by a legislation inquiry judicatory understand a judicatory by which on any particular occasion by the hands or the authority of the legislature for the purpose of constituting a ground for its ulterior proceedings and in particular for the enactment of a new law evidence is elicited to no other purpose does this judicatory act by this circumstance it stands distinguished from a judicatory ordinarily so called and by this circumstance alone are the powers and mode of proceeding distinguished from those by which in an ordinary judicatory a ground is made for definitive judication as to these see arts              0 enactive instructional art   by its own or by other hands the supreme legislature will give exercise to this branch of its power according

shortness the elicitative function expositive art   principal or say effective call the purpose to which the imperative including the enactive function of the legislature is exercised preparatory or preparative that to which the elicitative is exercised instructional art   correspondent to the imperative function in the exercise of legislative is that same function when performed in the exercise of judicial authority in the one situation as in the other on every occasion it were as will be seen in art    desirable were it practicable that of both functions—the principal and the preparatory—the exercise were the work of the same hands but of this desirable purpose the accomplishment will in the one situation as in the other to a more or less considerable extent be found impracticable what remains is—to maximize the accomplishment of it in so far as may be without the introduction of preponderant evil from other sources instructional art   whether without preponderant evil in other shapes this preparatory function can be exercised by the hands of the legislature itself will depend—partly upon the quantity of its applicable time partly upon the importance of the occasion and the purpose on the occasion of each individual inquiry it will depend—partly upon the presumable importance of the result partly upon the quantity of time requisite for an adequate exercise of the elicitative function partly upon the quantity of applicable time which at the moment the legislature has at its disposal and not called for by other purposes of superior importance but rare in the extreme are as may have been seen the cases in which for this subordinate purpose any of the legislatures applicable time can be spared see section   powers and duties instructional

termed a testifier or say testificant so far as it is real the thing or things which are the sources of it whether they belong to the class of moveable or to that of immoveable objects will commonly be in the custody of some person spoken of with reference to the source of evidence so possessed by him this person will be an evidenceholder to a person in either of those characters or in both may an authoritative mandate issued for the obtainment of evidence—say an evidencerequiring mandate—be to be addressed instructional expositive art    in so far as it is by hands other than those of the

provision made under these several heads for the satisfaction of it enactive instructional expositive art    powers for procuring and securing attendance whether at the seat of legislation or elsewhere for the purpose of oral examination—the legislature will of course possess and upon occasion exercise all those which by this code and the procedure code connected with it are given to ordinary judges and to these it will add all such if any as being necessary to no other purpose than that of legislation will not have been instituted for the purpose of judicature as for instance the giving on this occasion and to this purpose unlimited exercise to the function of eliciting information through the hands of government envoys to foreign governments or government agents of all classes resident in the dominions of foreign governments so of functionaries belonging to the army and navy subdepartments and serving at the time in distant local fields of service     instructional art    in relation to power considered as applied for the purpose of legislation to the extraction of evidence or say appropriate information—note here a disadvantage under which legislation lies as compared with judicature the sort of negative information which is capable of being afforded by silence in return for interrogation actual or virtual being to a comparatively inconsiderable if any extent capable of being made subservient to the purpose of legislation—hence it is that the legislator finds himself destitute of the faculty of obtaining appropriate and requisite information in cases in which to a large extent and with no small advantage it is obtainable by the judge for as in domestic so in legal procedure as in a nonpenal so in a penal case highly instructive as in domestic procedure no person can have failed to experience is the information capable of being furnished by silence in the character of selfcondemning evidence instructional ratiocinative art    though in no case for the exclusion of deception—yet in all cases for the exclusion of delay vexation and expense where preponderant over the evil of definite misjudication or nonjudication does the procedure code connected with this present code interdict the extraction of evidence to the extraction of evidence for a legislative purpose the limit thus applied to the extraction of it for a judicial purpose will not of necessity apply for by the choice which the legislator has of places times and hands—delay to the public service and vexation and expense to individuals may on each occasion be minimized on the other hand to the evil producible by misjudication or nonjudication there are limits and by the authority of the legislature those limits are rendered narrow ones to the

securities against deception by falsehood is maximized these are— i for the security of testimonial evidence scriptitiously expressed wheresoever delivered and whether spontaneously or responsively—against falsehood as well temeracious as mendacious responsibility satisfactional as well as punitional in the same manner as if the evidence had been delivered in the justice chamber in the shape of responsion in the oral mode to interrogation in that same mode enactive instructional art  0 ii in explanation confirmation or invalidation of any such scriptitiously delivered evidence—the testifier at all times in case of need subject to examination in the oral mode see procedure code title evidence—see also in this present code ch xxi immediate judiciary registrars section   minutation how from neither of these securities will the legislature fail to derive such benefit as in each case the nature of the case affords ratiocinative art    for seldom can the sufficiency of the securities afforded against deception—whether by evidence or for want of evidence—be maximized without the benefit of instant answers or silence in return to questions arising instantly out of preceding answers or silence and the interpretation thereupon capable of being afforded—by tone countenance gesture and deportment enactive instructional art    on each occasion the legislature will constitute or distribute the inquiry in such manner as the exigency or convenience of the occasion shall be deemed to require it will conduct the whole by its own hand or the whole by other hands or part by its own other parts in any number by so many different hands or sets of hands instructional ratiocinative art    the hands which to the purpose here in question the legislature acts by may when any other than its own be spoken of as being the hands of a committee such committee is capable of being made to consist either of a single person or of persons in any number but to every even it will prefer any odd number for otherwise by the want of a casting voice the whole operation or any part of     it may at any time be stopped and the inquiry frustrated expositive instructional art    by the appellation legislationevidence elicitor or for shortness legislation elicitor or say legislational inquest man understand a committee man thus employed in english practice the grand inquest of the nation is an appellation by which the house of commons has on this occasion been designated inquisitor would have been more commodious but for the odious idea so indissolubly associated with it enactive expositive art    a legislational elicitor or say inquest man may be either a deputy or a person other than a deputy if a person other than a deputy either a person at large—or according to a common phrase say a person from without doors—or else a continuation committee man he being as such though not a deputy yet as per section    continuation committee a member of the assembly instructional art    an apt legislationevidence elicitor may be any judge ordinary immediate or appellative and in both cases the judge principal or a judge depute as to whom see ch xiv judge immediate depute permanent ch xv judge immediate depute occasional enactive instructional ratiocinative art    if the elector be a deputy—the elicitation process will not be carrying on at any time of the day at which the legislature is sitting on legislation business incompatible with the indispensable plenitude of attendence as per sections     0 and    would such exterior occupation be during the whole of the time so occupied the deputys constituents in particular and the state in general would be deprived of the benefit of his service on that part of the business which is of intrinsic and superior importance thus whether it were without or with his consent that the occupation were allotted to him moreover if without his consent the power of location so applied might in that case be employed as an instrument of virtual expulsion for any length of time and thereby as an engine of oppression and tyrannical dominion and so in the case of a continuation committee man instructional ratiocinative art    for obviating delay to the detriment of the public interest and vexation and expense to individuals by journeys to and fro and demurrage for the purpose of oral examination—the legislature will have at its option the carrying on the inquiry into different facts or classes of facts by any number of elicitation committees at any number of places at the same time instructional art    on this occasion for the maximization of publicity it will feel itself at liberty in the choice of an edifice for this purpose to exercise powers such as might not belong to a judge as for example taking any public or even in case of necessity any private edifice instructional art  0 only in so far as confrontation is necessary—necessary to wit to the discovery of relevant and relatively material truth will persons more than one be convened from mutually remote places to the seat of legislature or elsewhither to be orally examined at the same time expositive art    purposes for which confrontation may be requisite are explanation contradiction counterevidence by counterevidence understand such evidence of an opposite tendency as may be delivered without contradiction opposed to anterior assertions instructional art    in a case in which conflict has place between divers particular interests—an arrangement desirable in so far as practicable is—that the elicitation judicatory should consist either of a single person approved by all parties interested—or of divers persons in number the same as that of the conflicting interests and approved respectively by those several interests with the addition of a chairman approved alike by all interests instructional ratiocinative art    in the case of such conflict it will commonly be found conducive to justice to allow to each interest its professional advocate care being taken to prevent such needless addition as might otherwise be made by causing one and the same interest to be split in appearance into divers interests instructional ratiocinative art    so in case of a conflict between the public and this or that particular interest care being taken that such allowance be not employed as an instrument of needless delay enactive instructional ratiocinative art    exceptions excepted as per section    sittings public and secret as in an ordinary so in a legislative inquiry publicity will be maximized instructional ratiocinative art    the situation of judge being that in which men will be in use to make due and appropriate distinction between ordinary cases and the few extraordinary ones in which the     purposes of justice are best served by secrecy so it be but temporary—the legislature will on this consideration incline to employ as legislational elicitor if acting singly a judge in preference to a person at large instructional ratiocinative art    cases however may occur in which where the obligation of secrecy is deemed necessary to be imposed reason may be found for employing for this purpose a manyseated judicatory say a judicatory of three in preference to a singleseated judicatory filled by a judge for against the temptation to apply to purposes of depredation or oppression the power afforded by secrecy—the greater number will afford a security not afforded by the lesser each member of the secret tribunal thus formed being capable of giving eventual information against every other and any suspicion which might otherwise be entertained by the publicopinion tribunal of sinister design on the part of a majority in the legislature—may thus by means of the greater number be more effectually obviated instructional art    to the conduct of the legislature and the instruments employed by it in this business as above—will be seen applying the same checks as those which apply to it on the occasion of the exercise given by it to its peculiar legislative function as per section    securities for appropriate aptitude to the possessors of the constitutive authority in their character of members of the publicopinion tribunal it will belong—to keep an ever watchful eye on the conduct of these their servants in such sort as to give maximization to the efficiency of those several securities instructional expositive art    legislation inquiry report or for shortness say legislation report methodization condensation application—by these terms may denomination be given to functions by the exercise of which after completion given to the exercise of the elicitation function an instrument of the sort thus denominated is framed methodization that is to say placing one after another in the order best adapted to correctness completeness and clearness of conception the facts respectively sought in the character of conclusions from the aggregate body of the evidentiary matter elicited and in relation to each such conclusion the propositions expressive of the evidentiary facts or assemblages of evidentiary facts regarded as constituting respectively a ground for these several conclusions condensation that is to say collecting and expressing by one general proposition the propositions respectively expressive of a group of relatively particular facts application that is to say pointing out in what manner the abovementioned propositions general and particular contribute to the affording of the information sought by the whole inquiry a report is the appellation by which in english practice a written instrument occupied in the exercise of these functions is denominated in the present instance a report thus occupied may be termed as above a legislation inquiry report or for shortness a legislation report instructional art  0 the need of consistency and symmetry considered—seldom can such a report be aptly penned unless in the original concoction of it it has been the work of no more than a single hand such accordingly is commonly the english practice but on any occasion when once the instrument has been framed by some single hand others in any number may be occupied with advantage in the making or proposing of amendments and on the supposition of a case in which between two or more portions of the subjectmatter of an inquiry made for a given single purpose no other connexion has place—for despatch or alleviation of labour the drawing up of the report may of course without prejudice to the design be committed to that same number of different hands instructional expositive art    under this head not inconsiderable is the light derivable by any other nation from english practice regularity elicited and occasionally or say incidentally elicited or about to be elicited—to one or other of these heads may be referred whatsoever mass of evidence applicable to legislative purposes is employable at any given point of time regularly elicited those masses which are furnished by the occurrences and state of things registered of course in the several offices occasionally elicited those which for the purpose of some particular legislative measure have from time to time been respectively elicited by the act of so many elicitation judicatories on the several occasions constituted instructional exemplificational art    in english practice locators on this occasion have been each one of the three branches of the sovereign authority—king lords and commons such is the order in which the three authorities are in general mentioned but on the present occasion it requires to be reversed authority the most frequently thus exercised that of the house of commons next most frequently that of the house of lords lastly that of the monarch instructional ratiocinative art    first as to the house of commons and in this case first as to the quality of the particular object endeavoured at next     as to the mode in which the endeavour is carried on as to the quality of the object in view it may reasonably be regarded for the most part as being beneficial for the whole compages of government having been and being in so large a proportion still composed of the rubbish of the dark ages and thence so palpably ill adapted to its professed end—the maximization of public happiness—need of reform and improvement has always been and continues to be visible throughout the whole texture of it but seldom if ever otherwise than with the help of an inquiry of this sort can any adequate ground for any considerable reform or improvement be on any occasion made instructional exemplificational art    next as to the mode of carrying on the inquiry this is still more uniformly welladapted to the purpose whatever it be than the purpose itself is beneficial properties desirable in a mass of evidence for whichever purpose judicial or legislative elicited—appositeness clearness correctness impartiality allcomprehensiveness nonredundance—thence instructiveness and nondeceptiveness these are the properties with which the rules here laid down aim at investing all such masses of evidence as shall have been elicited in conformity to them these same are the rules which with such exceptions as will be mentioned appear to have been conformed to as far as powers sufficed in and by the mode in use in the house of commons instructional art    in the way of contrast the usefulness of these rules may be seen receiving additional illustration and confirmation from a comparison with rules devised and employed in this same process by the judicial establishment of these rules an exposition in detail may be seen in a work on evidence by the author of this code instructional art    of this contrast the efficient cause will not be found exposed to doubt it will be seen in the difference between the interests which have been in operation in the two different situations on the sort of occasion in question the interest of the house of commons including that of its elicitation committees has generally speaking been in alliance with that of the great majority of the people and on this same occasion by no other means could they have given support to that common interest so effectually as by pursuing rules conducive to appropriate instruction as above while by no set of rules subservient to deception and misinstruction could they have given equal support to that same rightly directed and directing interest instructional exemplificational art    diametrically opposite to that same exclusively rightly directed and rightly directing interest has at all times been the particular and thence sinister interest of those ruling members of the judiciary establishment by whom—on pretence of declaring it as if already made by others—the rule of action has over so vast a portion of the field of legislation and in particular over the department of evidence been made made that is to say in that undelineable crooked and evershaking form in which alone it could ever have been made by hands so situated creatures of the monarch—and till comparatively of late years arbitrarily dislocable creatures—instruments of the monarch and by the act of their location constituted members of the aristocracy—invested with powers to which there have never been any other legal limits than those which have been applied by the power of those their confederates—they have at all times found themselves in a condition to give effect to their own particular and sinister interest and this not only to an unbounded extent at the expense of the universal interest but to a considerable extent even at the expense of the interests of those their partners deriving remuneration from taxes imposed and levied by themselves to their own use upon suitors—they have thereby given to themselves an irresistible interest in the maximizing the number of those useless proceedings on which these taxes have been assessed and at the same time in maximizing uncertainty by maximizing the encouragement given to delinquent suitors on both sides to persevere in the track of injustice and maleficence at the same time giving to all who can come up to their price the faculty of gaining their ends to an extent more or less considerable at the expense of their adversaries by means of the pecuniary burthen thus imposed thus uniting sale to denial of justice and effectuation of injustice instructional exemplificational art    for the maintenance of the thus profitable system of uncertainty they accordingly laid down those exclusionary rules by the enforcement or relaxation of which they could admit or reject evidence and thus give success to the one or the other side at pleasure while by their diversified modes of illadapted elicitation they maximized the expense and with it their own profit out of the expense and by holding out success to mendacity maximized the quantity of it and thereby the number of evil deeds and evildoers thus far by their oppositeness the systems of rules pursued by these functionaries serve in a direct way for throwing light upon the system exemplified and recommended as above as to the allpervading practice of mendacity and in particular in a written state in their own persons in their several situations—and that of forcibly injecting the poison into the mouths or pens of all suitors by refusing all assistance to all who should refuse to taint themselves     with it—these practices with so many more of like complexion that might be mentioned belong to the present purpose no otherwise than by serving to characterize the source from which the system opposite to the one here recommended has derived itself instructional exemplificational art    as to the house of commons and the observations whereby it has so frequently been necessary to bring to view the corruptedness which in such abundance has place in that part of the government—between those general ones and the more particular ones which have just been seen no real inconsistency will be found to have place of all forms of government that ever were in existence till that of the angloamerican united states became visible—that of england with all its corruptions was beyond comparison the least adverse to the only defensible end of government and in no other source than the power and practice of the house of commons could any part of whatever is good in the form of the government have originated it is owing to what is good in the house of commons—in particular it is owing to the power of the publicopinion tribunal—that power which has been hatched under the wings of the house of commons—that that as well as the other authorities in the state may at length be thus spoken of without fear or danger in particular the judicial establishment the practice of which had it not been for the door left open to complaint in the house of commons would not in respect of the support given by it to arbitrary power have been surpassed by that of the spanish inquisition for not more hostile to the tutelary power of the publicopinion tribunal can the mind of a spanish inquisitor ever have been than that which even yet continues from time to time to be manifested by the most influential of the english judges instructional exemplificational art  0 thus far the good comes now the evil call it in one word impotence it consists in a deficiency under which the house of commons labours in respect of the appropirate powers necessary to the giving adequate exercise to this its evidenceelicitation function   neither for securing verity in responsion nor for securing responsion itself nor so much as for securing attendance for the purpose of responsion does the house of commons in the exercise of its share in the supreme legislative authority possess a power equal to that which is exercised by judges on the occasion of the most trivial contestation between individual and individual in their professedly subordinate sphere with relation to no one of these purposes does time oppose any limit to the power of judges to that of the house of commons it opposes limits which as long as the life of the house continues grow every day narrower and narrower till at last before that life is extinct this power is gone before seven years are at an end this body suffers that predestinated which may be termed its natural death—and before that time it commonly dies a violent one as to verity in particular—in so far as punishment for mendacity operates as a security for it the judges by means of a ceremony called an oath and the word perjury employed in connexion with it—a ceremony which they have contrived shall be performed where the performing of it—withholden where the withholding of it—best suits their sinister interest—subject a man to banishment with forced labour for as many as seven years or even to still more severe inflictions the utmost suffering to which in any case for any one of the abovementioned three purposes this of security for verity not excepted an individual can be subjected is—that of simple imprisonment and that for a time which as above depends—not on the demand for punishment but on the age of the house of commons and may find itself limited to less than as many days or hours as that which the judges have at command will last years upon the whole a considerable time before the end of the seven years this power amounts to nothing for by keeping out of the way in the first place of summonition in the next place of prehension a man may set it at defiance and from the weakness of this power suffers of course every measure of reform or improvement in the initiation of which the evidenceelicitation process is a necessary preliminary instructional art    so much as to the house of commons now as to the house of lords as to every purpose but that of giving support to its own particular and sinister interest in addition to that of the monarch with which it stands associated—this branch of the actually existing supreme authority of the state being so much worse than useless—if with reference to the purpose here in question not to speak of other purposes it were afflicted with the same debility as that which has just been seen in the case of the house of commons—the people if not the better would at any rate be little the worse as to shortness of life except that it stands assured of resurrection in the same persons its case is the same as that of the house of commons not so however as to the power of punishing for mendacity under the name of perjury and with the punishment attached to that name for that command over the almighty which as above—by the magic words so help you god and the kiss given to a book—king lords and commons have concurred in giving to judges the house of lords while it sees the house of commons destitute of it exercises by its own hands without reserve in a word the     house of commons is not in the practice of administering an oath the house of lords is instructional art    on each occasion whether an inquiry of the sort in question shall be entered upon by the body so highly superior in the scale of factitious dignity it belongs to accident to determine and this accident consists sometimes of an expectation of amusement in the breast of the member by whom the motion is made sometimes in the recurrence of the notion that lest the inutility of such a body to every interest but its own and that of the monarch should become too manifest a show of activity should from time to time be kept up instructional art    lastly as to the monarch when by his authority an evidenceelicitation judicatory is instituted commission not committee is the word i as to the object in view instituted by the house of commons seldom can the committee have had any other than the promotion—seldom the commission any other than the exclusion—of reform or improvement instructional ratiocinative art    ii as to appropriate powers by the instruments of the monarch neither could comprehensiveness nor impartiality be secured to the body of evidence elicited by them if such were really their desire by law neither for responsion for veracity nor so much as for attendance do they possess any such power as that possessed by the judges or even as that possessed as above by the house of commons consequence—the only persons at whose hands for any one of these purposes compliance is at their command are their own dislocable subordinates together with any such other person to whom it happens to stand subjected to their will by corruptive influence—quality of the information such as may be expected from packed witnesses speaking to packed judges instructional art    as to composition according to circumstances the commission is given to number one or to a greater number one is by reason of the comparative secrecy of the measure and the unostentatiousness of the expense best suited to the purposes of inspection visits to distant dependencies a manyseated sham judicatory of this kind is the resource when—on complaint made of some more than ordinarily scandalous system of abuse—ministers are prevented by shame from refusing inquiry and by fear from trusting to the house of commons by fear—for the corruption which would with certainty suffice to engage the house in a body to acquiesce in this or any other desired imposture—would not suffice to secure the excluding from a committee every member who would not concur in such suppression of evidence as the purpose might require in the case of a distant inspection visit forecast is exemplified and the object is—to forestall and avert all such sincere inquiries as are yet in no other than a futurecontingent state in the case of the manyseated elicitation judicatory acting at the seat of government—the object is—to make a pretence for refusing some inquiry actually called for in the house of commons when for example under the eye of king lords and commons—judges and other judicial functionaries of all classes have been in the notorious habit of practising extortion on false pretences—thereupon on pretence of paving the way for reform comes a commission under which the population of the judgmentseat as well as that of the witnesssbox is composed of accomplices with the principal for locator from a commission of this sort a collateral benefit is naturally and commonly if not constantly derived what is called a job is effected and in place of punishment criminals receive remuneration for their crimes instructional art    one feature familiar to if not constant in english practice requires here to be laid open to view it belongs to the form of the reports it consists in the suppression of the interrogatories by which the responses have been elicited and still more frequently of the names of the several interrogators of this suppression so far as regards the interrogatories a natural and not unfrequent consequence is—obscurity or misconceivedness so far as regards the powerclad interrogator—consequence and final cause subtraction of his conduct from that scrutiny of the publicopinion tribunal to which he has been subjecting the interrogatee the practice may be set down among the natural fruits of aristocratical oppression presumptive evidence of intentional abuse of power on the part of as many as give into it section xxviii legislation penal judicatory enactive instructional art   to any of the following chief functionaries should misconduct be imputed for the punishment of which dislocation with extra publicity shall not be deemed sufficient—it rests with the legislature to form an occasional special judicatory for the trial of them functionaries thus triable are— i any member of the then present legislature ii any member of any anterior legislature iii the prime minister of the then pressent or any preceding time iv the justice minister of the then present or any preceding time     enactive art   number of members of this judicatory three or five enactive art   judges either all of them members of the then present legislature or persons who—at the time when the decree for the prosecution is pronounced—are not any of them members—either of the legislature or of any part of the official establishment enactive art   mode of location secret suffrage enactive art   the legislature will at the same time appoint persons one or more to officiate as pursuers instructional art   i in relation to this extraordinary judicial function the legislature will on each occasion judge whether its time will admit of its taking upon itself this extra charge enactive instructional ratiocinative art   ii if all the members do not neither should any for it should not be in the power either of an individual or of the whole body in this or any other way to produce during the whole or any part of the time occupied in the inquiry a virtual vacancy in the particular seats in question as to the exercise of the legislational function thus depriving constituents of the service of their agents as to the principal and peculiar part of their duty ratiocinative art   iii though—more especially in the case of a member—nothing that can be done can exclude altogether so inevitable an imputation as that of partiality—still the transference of this temporary function to other hands will in no small degree lessen the ground of the imputation if men of generally acknowledged aptitude moral as well as intellectual are the persons located in the case where the prime minister or the minister of justice—located both of them by the legislature—being parties accused are guilty—much less difficulty will a man who has not than a man who has contributed to their location find in contributing to their punishment enactive art   neither in nonpenal nor in penal cases does the legislature act on any occasion as an appellate judicatory in that field of service it trusts altogether to the appropriate subordinate authorities only in case of punishable criminality as practised by them in the exercise of their functions does it take cognizance of the course taken in and by that exercise enactive ratiocinative art  0 but for as much as of necessity—in so far as the propriety of the conduct of any such judicial functionary on the occasion of a nonpenal suit comes in question—that which should on that occasion have been done cannot but come though as it were in a preliminary or collateral way under the cognizance of the legislature—any error which on that same occasion shall in the eyes of the legislature have manifested itself will not be left unredressed ratiocinative art    for knowingly and wilfully to leave a wrong in any shape unredressed would—on the part of those who without preponderant evil have full power to redress it be an open profession of injustice tending to the destruction of public confidence enactive instructional ratiocinative art    on every such occasion the legislature will at the same time be upon its guard lest by this means it should insensibly be led to constitute itself into an ordinarily officiating appellate judicatory an office as to the functions of which it is essentially incompetent to wit as well in respect of the multitude of the members of which it is composed as in respect of the vacancy which would thereby be created in the exercise of its appropriate and peculiar functions enactive instructional art    accordingly if on the face of the application no criminality in any shape be imputed to the functionary whose conduct is the subject of complaint—the legislature will uniformly refuse to take cognizance of it in a case in which such imputation is made—if no sufficient reason for imputing criminality is found the legislature may accordingly make declaration to that effect forbearing to accompany such declaration of acquittal with any decree imperative or opinative in relation to any such alleged wrong as above enactive instructional art    on every such occasion if in the eyes of the legislature the accusation has been not only insufficiently grounded or altogether ungrounded but accompanied with evil consciousness or temerity—it will if it see sufficient reason—on the same evidence and without the formality of a separate suit proceed—as in the case where compensation is given in the name of costs—to punish the wrongful accuser with such punishment as the case shall appear to demand instructional art    note that only in case of a decision—or where decision is due nondecision by an appellate judicatory—or by the justice   0 minister in the extraordinary and narrow field of the judicial service allotted to him as per ch xxiv section   judicative function—can any such nonpenal under the guise of a penal suit as above be apprehended for as much as for redress of wrong done by an immediate judicatory the correspondent appellate judicatory is constituted and its doors kept wide open—while as above those of the legislature are against all such applications shut instructional art    note also that for prevention of wrong otherwise about to be done or redress of wrong done by a judge without deficiency on his part in respect of appropriate moral aptitude—facilities may be seen afforded in and by ch xii judiciary collectively section    judges contested interpretation reporting function—section  0 judges eventually emendative function and section    judges sistitive or say executionstaying function and moreover by the general facility for amendment afforded by the meliorationsuggestive function allotted by this code throughout to individuals as well as to judiciary and other functionaries section xxix members motions instructional expositive art   in proposing an ordinance a member will do well to consider whether in the law as it then stands there be any article to the matter of which such his ordinance would if adopted be repugnant in such sort that if that article were thereafter to receive its execution the so proposed ordinance would thereby in some way or other be contravened in case of nonrepugnancy his new proposed ordinance is independent and nonemendative in the case of repugnancy it is to the extent of the repugnance emendative instructional ratiocinative art   if thus it be emendative in effect he will do well to render it declaredly so for thus only can the pannomion† be kept clear of that needless and useless voluminousness with obscurity confusedness and incomprehensibility for its effects by which in the nature of the case it cannot otherwise escape being more or less vitiated instructional expositive art   declaredly emendative an ordinance may be in either of two modes—the directive or the reeditive in the directive mode the draughtsman will proceed in the manner of an author in directing corrections to be made in and by a list of emendanda or corrigenda taking for the subject of his reference the pannomion as it stands—in such an article he will say referring to code chapter section and article omit so and so or between such and such words insert so and so or to such and such substitute such or such words or taking the article entire omit such or such an article or between such and such an article insert such or such an article or articles or to such or such an article or articles substitute the following instructional enactive

made hereupon follows the direction as above attestator the legislation minister each amendment if adopted being the work of the legislature—the proposer will not in penning his proposal scruple thus to speak in the name of the legislature instructional enactive art   in the reeditive mode the proposer proceeds in the manner of an author who is publishing a new edition of his work introductive formulary as follows—by the legislature—year month and day and place in the pannomion as above it is ordained as follows thereupon comes the new matter if in this ordinance there be anything which is in repugnance to any part of the pannomion as above—to minimize doubt and needless quantity of matter he will proceed in manner following repealed on this occasion are—then will follow the indication of the several articles on this occasion no alteration will he direct to be made in any article instead of giving any such direction he will repeal the entire article and substitute a new one instructional enactive art   in an emendative ordinance expressed in the reeditive mode indications will be given as follows— i indication made—by appropriate types and other means—of words omitted added or substituted as above in such sort that in the new edition if possible by a single glance the eye may be able to distinguish the new matter from the old ii indication made—of the proposer his seconder his other supporters and his opposers thus to all persons concerned will it in all times be made known—in what particulars at what times by what ordinances at whose instance and under whose opposition—effect     good or bad on the interest of the community has been produced enactive art   to every member it belongs of right to make whatsoever motion he thinks fit in whatsoever terms he thinks fit in relation to any matter he thinks fit on its being seconded by any other member—any such motion becomes a subject of discussion and is eventually capable of being converted into an ordinance of the legislature instructional art   in case of need should it happen to the legislature to find its time wasted by illconsidered motions it will for remedy instead of one such preliminary adopter require two or more instructional ratiocinative art   to obviate however the voluminousness and confusion liable to ensue from laws made at different times on the motion of different persons—on principles in respect of form as well as matter disparate or adverse—a member antecedently to any motion tending to the enactment of a new ordinance will do well to consider to the province of which of the several ministers if any the matter belongs thereupon to communicate on the subject with such minister or ministers—and in so far as they and he agree to consult with the legislation minister as to the bearings of the proposed ordinance on those already in existence and thence as to the form in which on its introduction the proposed ordinance may most conveniently stand expressed and in particular whether in the independent and nonemendative form as per art   or in the emendative and if in the emendative whether in the directive or in the reeditive as per art         instructional art  0 if to any such minister such communication shall have been omitted to be made—reasons for the omission will be expected to be given so in case of nonconcurrence on the ministers part reasons for and against such nonconcurrence no such minister is bound to concur in any such motion but to him the mover is expected to communicate it he to receive it and to attend to it and so

of the several ministers—to the several sublegislatures their members and subordinates—and with more especial solicitude to that of the several members of the judiciary establishment and lastly to the bissubdepartment occupied by the local headmen and local registrars whose logical fields of service in their respective smallest local fields of action lie in subordination to the directing

the system of securities here provided one branch but not the only one for security against abuse of power is but one branch though the principal one of security for appropriate moral aptitude and to this are added security for appropriate intellectual and security for appropriate active aptitude instructional art   for this purpose and on these several occasions confidence it cannot be denied may with truth be said to be minimized distrust and suspicion maximized principle acted upon say for shortness the confidenceminimization principle whence as to practical deductions the controlmaximization principle     instructional art   corresponding rules are the following—i to no official situation attach any more power than is necessary to enable the functionaries to exercise the functions of it with the most effectual subserviency to the dictates of the greatesthappiness principle instructional art   ii to every such situation apply such instrumentary arrangements as by means of appropriate selection restraint and constraint shall afford the efficient security for appropriate aptitude in all its branches instructional art   iii the arrangements for restraint are those which promise to afford the most effectual security against abuse of power to wit of the several powers respectively instituted and conferred instructional art   these principles and rules have for their bases certain axioms or say assumptions these are expressive of certain supposed matters of fact the existence of certain propensities in all human minds instructional art   i in all human minds in howsoever widely different proportions—selfregard and sympathy for others or say extraregard have place instructional art   ii but in selfregard even sympathy has its root and if in the general tenor of human conduct selfregard were not prevalent over sympathy—even over sympathy for all others put together—no such species as the human could have existence instructional expositive art   take any two persons a and b and suppose them the only persons in existence—call them for example adam and eve adam has no regard for himself the whole of his regard has for its object eve eve in like manner has no regard for herself the whole of her regard has for its object adam follow this supposition up introduce the occurrences which sooner or later are sure to happen and you will see that at the end of an assignable length of time greater or less according to accident but in no case so much as a twelvemonth both will unavoidably have perished instructional art  0 to give increase to the influence of sympathy at the expense of that of selfregard and of sympathy for the greater number at the expense of sympathy for the lesser number—is the constant and arduous task as of every moralist so of every legislator who deserves to be so but in regard to sympathy the less the proportion of it is the natural and actual existence of which he assumes as and for the basis of his arrangements the greater will be the success of whatever endeavours he uses to give increase to it instructional art    a consequence is—that whatsoever evil it is possible for man to do for the advancement of his own private and personal interest or what comes to the same thing what to him appears such at the expense of the public interest—that evil sooner or later he will do unless by some means or other intentional or otherwise he be prevented from doing it instructional art    to the above rule suppose there is this or that exception still with a view to practice there might as well be none forasmuch as by no criterion will it be possible to distinguish the individuals in whose instance the exception has place from those in whose instance the general rule has place more especially when as in the case of all legislative arrangements of a general nature the individuals in question are unassigned and unassignable instructional art    neither to the public service is it in the nature of the precautions in question to be hurtful nor yet so much as to the reputation or the feelings of the individuals to whom they apply not to the public service yes indeed if of the care thus taken to avoid giving to functionaries more power than as above is needful the effect were—to withhold from them any part of that which is needful but in proportion to the attention with which the arrangements in question are looked into by him and compared with others will be every mans assurance—that in no existing code is the scope given to the power of ruling functionaries so ample as in the present proposed code instructional art    not even to the reputation or the feelings of any individual functionary or nonfunctionary are these precautions hurtful yes if they applied to him to the exclusion of others or in a more particular manner than to others but no for without any exception they apply to all persons alike instructional art    to say—they ought not to apply to me is as much as to say—i am not of the human species or at the least with the pharisee i am not as other men are instructional art    as little can these precautions be said to be needless for wheresoever no obstacle—no bar to evil doing is opposed and     motives inciting to evil doing are at work evil doing will by the prevalence of selfregard over sympathy be sure to be let in suppose the probability of evil doing ever so faint still ought the obstacles in question to be opposed to it considering that by their being opposed to it evil may be excluded while as above shown from their being so opposed in no shape can evil public or private be introduced instructional art    accordingly on this supposition in respect of the treatment given by them to the subject many proceed on every occasion the ruling one and the ruling or subruling few no evil how atrociously and extensively mischievous soever do they speak of or deal by as too mischievous to be likely to be exercised no mischievous act in so far as the subject many are regarded as capable of being the actors and these rulers themselves as liable to be sufferers by it do they leave unnoticed or by force of restraint and punishment omit to use their endeavours for the prevention of it instructional art    in the estimates acted on by rulers the degree of propensity to evil in the minds of the subject many is commonly carried rather beyond than short of the truth in particular such is the estimate acted upon by all legislators such is the estimate acted upon by all judges especially by all judges who as in england are suffered to act and act accordingly as legislators except always in so far as the persons acted upon belong to those classes which are linked with theirs by a community of particular and sinister interest instructional art    widely different not to say opposite in relation to propensity to evil on their part is the estimate by these confederates acted upon is it the ruling one that is in question his estimate of himself as expressed in his own language is—i am not as other men are they are of the species composed of miserable sinners i am of the species between god and man thereupon from the lips and pens of those to whom he is an object of hope or fear comes the response in chorus—o yes sir so you are are they the ruling few of the like complexion here too is the estimate acted upon—and a certain theory on which it is grounded motives says this theory are of two sorts impure and pure with few or no exceptions the motives which give determination to the conduct of all whose situation in the conjunct scales of power and opulence is beneath a certain level are impure or pure as it may happen in all situations above that same level at all times supremely and invariably pure to suppose that on any occasion they do or can fail of being so is an affront and a gross injury an injury to which either at the hands of justice or at those of the party injured condign punishment is due instructional art  0 not that in this theory about purity and impurity there is anything better than stark nonsense not that any one who utters it knows what it is he means by it but if the theory wants so much the practical conclusions from it want not anything of being sufficiently intelligible—reserve all restraints for those others none are needful all are injurious if applied to ourselves instructional exemplificational art    in point of fact—unquestionable fact—how stands relative behaviour in correspondence with the condition of the two situations in the position supposed as above no but exactly the reverse the more dependent a man is for the comforts of life on his good behaviour to others the better is his behaviour to them the less dependent the worse the greater a mans power the stronger his propensity in all possible ways to abuse it of this fact all history is one continued proof ye who for examples fear to look near home—send your regards to a safe distance look to the twelve cæsars there you have distance in time look to all oriental despots there you may have distance in time and space instructional ratiocinative art    but if such were not the effect of power in all lesser masses neither could it have been so in those greatest possible masses not in the inverse but in the direct ratio of the quantity of power possessed is the degree of propensity to do evil in every shape the degree of the propensity and therefore the quantum of the demand for securities against the existence and the effects of it if to any one it appears that in any part of the scale this proportion fails to hold good let him say in what and wherefore but in this respect suppose high and low upon a par—suppose even that in the high situations the evil propensity is less strong than in the low ones—still so long as in the case of the mind in question the existence of it is in any degree admitted—the demand for the securities in question must be allowed to be indispensable     instructional art    if so it be that these securities for appropriate aptitude are thus incontestably beneficial and needful—the sort of reception a man gives to them when proposed may serve as a test of his own appropriate aptitude moral and intellectual regarding them as beneficial and needful does he contest their being so judge thence of his sincerity and probity regards he them as not beneficial or as not useful judge thence of his understanding instructional art    different will naturally be the reception experienced by these securities at the hands of rulers in different governments most favourable in a pure representative democracy less favourable in a pure and absolute monarchy most completely unfavourable in a mixed monarchy composed of a mixture of monarchy and aristocracy with or without a tinge of representative democracy instructional art    i look first to a pure representative democracy why in this case most favourable answer the reason is almost too obvious to bear mentioning every man is a gainer by the efficiency of these securities no man can entertain a hope of being a gainer from their absence or their inefficiency instructional art    one class and that the only one by which an unfavourable reception will naturally be given to it is the lawyer class and even in their case not to the whole system—but only to that part of it which applies to the judicial department instructional exemplificational art    for exemplification and instruction look to the angloamerican united states in that seat of good government—by that class and by that alone is a system of authorized depredation kept in exercise at the expense of all the other classes accordingly for no system of securities the tendency of which is to lessen the amount of evil from that source can any favourable reception be reasonably expected at such hands instructional exemplificational art    of the ascendancy of this class the cause is—that when the people cast off the other parts of the english yoke—neither time nor the state of appropriate intellectual aptitude on the part of leading men admitted of their casting off except in here and there an easily detached fragment that part which under the name of common law had by those of the kings creatures and instruments by whom were occupied the chief judicial situations been gradually imposed upon the rest of the community—for their own benefit in subserviency to and in conjunction with that of the monarch by whom they had been located and were at every moment dislocable in this same common law with its essential and most elaborately organized uncertainty its factitious delay vexation and expense did they behold an instrument which with more or less effect would in all such hands as could obtain a share in the use of it be applicable to the purposes for which as above it had been originally framed instructional art    true it is—that in that same fortunate region by the official class of lawyers no such share is reaped in the plunderage as by the professional class nor in the professional class are the largest lots nearly equal to those which are reaped by the same class in the mother country the magnitude being kept comparatively small by the multiplicity of the competitors but by this very multiplicity will their appetite for the golden fruit and their fear of losing any part of it be sharpened and their horror of everything that threatens to lessen it augmented and misrepresentation being the grand instrument of their trade—the use of it in a case of such vital importance cannot reasonably be expected to be spared instructional art  0 ii look next to a pure and absolute monarchy so as the power of depredation and oppression to the use of himself and such instruments and favourites as from time to time it may please him to let in for a participation in the benefit of that same power remains unchanged—security against abuse of power by all other functionaries so far from being to the monarch a sure object of displeasure will naturally enough be an object and source of satisfaction in his eyes depredation committed by them to their own profit will be to him so much loss for the greater the spoil taken by them the less remains for him and as to oppression as well as depredation—by whatsoever is committed by them in gratification of their own appetites discontent is produced and secret enmity from which he has never anything to hope and always more or less to apprehend considering as he cannot but now and then consider that his life is at the mercy of every man who will risk his own life for the hope of destroying that of the supposed author of his sufferings instructional art    in this case the misfortune is—that of the aggregate mass of securities against abuse of power in functionaries the greatest part as has been and will be further seen unavoidably depends upon the power of the publicopinion tribunal and a monarch will always be fully sensible to the difficulty which there cannot but be in allowing that authority     to oppose its force to abuse of power in the shapes in which it appears to him that he would be a sufferer by it—without seeing and feeling that same force acting against that same abuse in the shapes in which the whole or the greatest part of the profit from it is reaped by himself instructional art    to come to particulars security against abuse of power on the part of the legislative authority—no such monarch can of course be naturally expected to endure for his is the legislative authority not so as to his subordinates all or any in the administration department not so as to his subordinates even in the judiciary department for of appropriate aptitude in both those departments his absolute power enables him to reap for himself the full benefit while on every occasion on which in his view of the matter it threatens to oppose obstacles to his will—he can extinguish it or completely guard himself against the effects of it not altogether without reason therefore may he be expected to give acceptance—if not to all securities against abuse of power in those departments—at least to all such securities as can be employed without giving to the publicopinion tribunal an influence capable in his eyes of opposing obstacles to any such depredation and oppression as it may happen to him to feel disposed to see committed instructional art    iii look now to pure aristocracy look in a word to british india for though a controlling power is in the hands of the mixed monarchy to which the members of that same aristocracy are subject—yet it is by themselves that all the details of government in the way of legislation are carried on securities against abuse of power on the part of the legislative authority they cannot reasonably be expected to endure for they themselves are legislators so neither against abuse of power on the part of occupants of situations in the administrative department for by themselves or by those in providing for whom they provide for themselves are those same situations occupied accordingly ruin is the universally expected and most effectually denounced lot of all who should presume to bring to light or hold up to view within the field of their power any instance of such abuse all this under the eye and to the perfect satisfaction of the superior authority—the kings board of control—whose care it is to whatsoever else they apply this same control not to apply it to depredation to oppression or to that power by which complaint is stifled and misery thus maximized instructional art    thus irremediably adverse are they naturally rendered to the application of all such securities to the legislative and administrative departments not altogether so in regard to the judicial department for to such a degree on the part of their subjects for want of appropriate civil law judicature and procedure does security for property remain deficient—that by the deficiency the quantity of the matter of wealth capable of being extracted from them is manifestly diminished the consequence is—that supposing appropriate legislation and judicature capable of being established with such effect as to give increase to the quantity of wealth so extractible and at the same time without giving to the publicopinion tribunal any such power as would oppose a sensible check to the profitable and indispensable abuse of power in the other departments—a system of good judicature and correspondent legislation might not altogether without reason be expected to find at least among the most enlightened of that same body its advocates a circumstance that contributes to render such a result the less improbable is—that as to those situations in which in cases regarded as the most important judicial power is exercised—the power of location is in the hands—not of these same aristocrats but of the monarch and by the depredation exercised to so vast an amount by those creatures of their superior the subaristocratical creatures of the aristocratical rulers are sufferers without being gainers instructional art    iv look lastly to mixed monarchy composed as above of a mixture of monarchy and aristocracy the one and the few sharing between them the absolute power but in proportions at all times variable because at all times depending upon and varying with the degree of vigour in the monarchs mind and the direction taken by it in this case the horror of all such securities is naturally not to say necessarily universal on the part of both into no one department of government will the idea of any application made of them be endurable the monarch cannot abuse his power to his own benefit without their concurrence nor therefore without suffering and even upon occasion helping them to make abuse of power to their benefit they cannot abuse their power to their own benefit without his concurrence as above the ruling one cannot keep his subjects under a system of regulated plunderage without letting in the subruling or coruling few for a proportion of the plunder they cannot get in that same share but either through his hands or with his concurrence he cannot extort a million ayear for the gratification of his own appetites without keeping the official establishment filled with overpaid offices needless offices and sinecures to the amount of ulterior millions shared by them among themselves he cannot keep up a vast and needless     permanent military force on both elements without sharing among them the offices military and civil belonging to it instructional art    on the other hand legislative assemblies the proceedings of which cannot be carried on without a certain degree of publicity being of the essence of this form of government it cannot easily if at all be carried on without suffering the publicopinion tribunal to be in existence and to exercise with more or less effect and with much more than under a pure monarchy its abuserestraining and tutelary power for in every such assembly there will of course be at all times two parties contending against one another for such parts of the plunderage as are at the disposal of the monarch and for all such other power as is open to competition and their sole means of contending with one another is on all occasions a virtual appeal more or less explicit to the will and undefinable power of the people say to the publicopinion tribunal by which that same saving power is exercised instructional art    think now—whether under any such form of government for any efficient system of securities for appropriate aptitude on the part of the members of the official establishment in the several departments legislative administrative and judicial and in particular for that moral aptitude by which in proportion as it has place needless expense is excluded—anything like a favourable reception can on any reasonable grounds be expected can it in the legislative department no for between the monarch and the aristocracy all legislative power is shared can it in the administrative department no for there likewise through the same channels afforded by overpaid places needless places sinecure places pensions for retreat and pensions without even that pretence whatsoever portion of the matter of wealth can be extorted from those by whose labour it is produced is shared among these same selfstyled pure and too indisputably exalted hands instructional art    can it in the judiciary no for without any the least trouble or odium—by the hands of their necessary and dependent instruments—the higher class of judges the three superior classes of functionaries—king lords and commons—can carry on and reap the profit of abuse of power in cases to an indefinite extent in which by so operose a machine as that of parliament fear of shame of public discontent of resistance of the trouble of getting through the forms—would concur in preventing their carrying it on with their own hands in a chamber called a court of justice—half a minute—in some cases of four mens in others of one mans time—not only can do but is habitually employed in doing that which in the two chambers called houses of parliament if in those places it could be done at all would cost months not to say years to do in those forms without which validity might be questionable and disobedience not improbable so much for time then as to words issued from a bush of artificial hair a word or two such as conspiracy christianity blasphemy libel hurt to feelings bonos mores—can convert innoxious acts into crimes punish men at pleasure and without warning banish security from property substitute secret judicature to public stifle all complaint bar out all redress take children out of the hands of fathers engage booksellers to cheat printers—extinguish literary property in a book without looking at it banish security from property yes and not only from all property but from whatever else possesses value for wherever by the name of common law judgemade law reigns—security is an empty name instructional art    add to this the service rendered to legislators in their individual capacity by the impunity secured to them in the character of magistrates—conferred thereby and established by common law behold accordingly a power of oppression too enormous to be assumed and established by statute law instructional art  0 under this form of government—thus conveniently assistant not to say necessary to abuse of power in the legislative and administrative is an unrestrained and correspondent abuse of power in the judiciary department in this state of things whether in or for any one of the three departments any efficient securities against such abuse have under this same form of government any much better chance of finding acceptance than in or for any other must be left to experience to declare instructional art    securities here provided for appropriate     aptitude in the situation of members of the legislative body are these— instructional art    i for appropriate aptitude in all

candidate—any person—acting on his behalf with his consent and in proof thereof producing an exemplar thereof signed by the proposed member as above—will upon declaring on his responsibility the cause of such absentation be admitted to read the inaugural declaration in his stead saying immediately before the commencement of such his reading—i mentioning his name at the desire of a m mentioning the

which he means to state himself as dissenting—or to which he is desirous of seeing any proposed amendment made or explanation given—he will give indication of them by enclosing them respectively in brackets with a numerical figure letter or other mark of reference which will accordingly be repeated at the commencement of such his statement at the same time and in the same way he will if so minded declare the considerations which in the character of reasons have been the causes by which such his dissent or indication of supposed amendment or requisite explanation has been produced but to prevent confusion in the exemplar in which such his reasons are written he will not be at liberty to write more than  lines in any one page referring the overplus if any to a separate paper which paper if published will be published by himself and at his own expense instructional art   lest by any such exceptions amendments or explanations dissent to the essence of the declaration should under pretence of assent be virtually expressed—any other member of the legislative body may at the time that such supposed virtually dissenting member is taking his seat move that he may be considered as virtually refusing to officiate as member thereof whereupon if such be the judgment of the assembly his election will be declared of no avail and the appropriate arrangements will be taken for the election of another deputy in his stead section ii i ends aimed at i a l in testimony of my attachment to the principles of the constitution do hereby make the solemn declaration following   i recognise as the allcomprehensive and only right and proper end of government the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the members of the community of all without exception in so far as possible of the greatest number on every occasion on which the nature of the case renders it impossible by rendering it matter of necessity to make sacrifice of a portion of the happiness of a few to the greater happiness of the rest   i acknowledge as and for the specific and direct ends of government these which follow— i positive ends—maximization of subsistence abundance security against evil in every shape—against evil from every source against physical calamity against human hostility against hostility from external against hostility from internal adversaries against hostility from internal resistible adversaries against hostility from internal irresistible adversaries for such so long as they rule and in proportion as they rule ill are evil rulers such—unless by apt arrangements debarred from all hope of sinister success—are and ever will be all rulers everywhere ii the allcomprehensive negative and collateral end of government i acknowledge to be—avoidance or minimization of expense in every shape in the shape of money in the shape of unintended hardship in the shape of intended hardship intended for the purpose of punishment minimization of expense—as in the shape of punishment so in the shape of reward and the matter of reward seeing that without certain hardship and eventual punishment the matter of reward cannot be extracted from the grasp of individuals and placed at the disposal of government i acknowledge—that of all these indispensable ends no one can be compassed but by  00 and in proportion to appropriate aptitude on the part of the several functionaries of government more particularly on the part of those of the peoples upper servants of whom i am one appropriate aptitude in all its several shapes moral intellectual and active appropriate intellectual aptitude in its two several shapes—knowledge and judgment appropriate moral aptitude i acknowledge it will be my own fault if on any occasion i fail to invest myself with namely by taking for the guides of my conduct the several abovementioned ends appropriate intellectual and active aptitude it shall be my diligent endeavour to invest myself with according to the measure of my faculties these same uncontrovertible ends of all good government i once more acknowledge accordingly and in these few words bring together and recapitulate—greatest happiness of greatest number maximized national subsistence abundance security and equality maximized official aptitude maximized expense in all shapes minimized section iii ii appetites guarded against on my guard i will accordingly on every occasion keep myself against the power of all those appetites to the sinister influence of which the inalterable nature of my situation keeps me so constantly and perilously exposed appetite for power appetite for money appetite for factitious honour and dignity appetite for vengeance at the expense of opponents appetite for ease at the expense of duty constant in particular will be my endeavours to keep extinguished in my breast all appetite for respect in every shape in which it is factitious to preeminent respect at the hands of the community at large i acknowledge no other title than what is constituted by preeminent service—service proved and made universally manifest by appropriate evidence in the mass of those honours or as they are also called dignities which are factitious—i behold an instrument of unmerited triumph in the hands of those who share in them of unjust depression on the part of all besides the work of imposture on the part of him by whom the draught for respect is drawn of folly on the part of him by whom it is paid section iv iii economy and uncorruption promised unremitted shall on every occasion be my care and my exertions to keep the official establishment clear of all those drains by which in exorbitant excess the substance of the people is drawn into the coffers of selfseated rulers or unfaithful stewards clear of all needless offices of all useless offices of all overpay of overpaid offices of all dutiless offices of all accumulation of offices in one hand numbering among dutiless offices every case in which not serving in fact a man serves in words by deputy the deputy being thus the working functionary the principal an impostor by whom money is obtained on a false pretence nor moreover will i forget that he who accepts a second office holding at the same time one for the exercise of which the whole of his disposable time may eventually be requisite manifests thereby his intention of neglecting the duties of one or both on the subject of official pay—never will i cease to remember that all pay given to him who would serve equally well without pay is given in waste that the less a man is content to receive for taking upon himself the duties of an office the more conclusive is the evidence given of his relish for the functions of it that if instead of receiving he would be content to give money for the occupation the evidence would be still more conclusive—the more so the more he would be content to give for it that the higher the pay of an office is the greater the probability is that the functions of it may be the object of his abhorrence and every occasion embraced for avoiding the pain of exercising them that the higher the pay the stronger the temptation to substitute—and the more surely adequate the means of substituting—as far as possible to the services due to the public any such private occupations as to the individual are most agreeable that of the quantum of pay that will be satisfactory to a man no other man can be so good a judge as he that if a comparatively indigent man is exposed to the temptation of breaking his trust for money—so is the comparatively opulent man—who moreover with more expensive habits has proportionably augmented means of engaging accomplices and protectors and that as universal experience demonstrates the most extravagantly paid of all functionaries have everywhere and at all times been the most extravagant of prodigals and the most rapacious of depredators bearing in mind that no desirable office and in particular that no lucrative office can have place anywhere without being a source of corruption—of corruptingness in him by whom it is conferrible of corruptedness in him by whom it is receivable—bearing this in mind—i will were it only for this reason keep my attention steadily bent on the means of minimizing—as well the number as the pay of all such offices never ceasing to remember that as waste produces corruption so does corruption waste till thus by depredation oppression and dissipation the body politic is exhausted debilitated destroyed in particular in no act of waste in no act of corruption will i ever participate under any such cloak as that of a pension of retreat never ceasing to remember on how widely different a footing stands every such grant from  0  that of the compensation granted to military men for disablement incurred in military service knowing and duly considering that no such pay without service is ever received or looked for by him whose means of subsistence are composed of the retribution received by individuals for services rendered to individuals remembering that no physician has any pension of retreat from his patients handicraft from his employers or shopkeeper from his customers—nor yet is there any want of physicians handicrafts or shopkeepers as little under any such notion as that of affording honour to the nation dignity to its functionaries encouragement to piety to learning to arts to sciences and in particular to fine arts or merely curious sciences or literary pursuits—as little under any such delusive pretence will i concur in laying burthens on the comparatively indigent many for the amusement of the comparatively opulent few at their own expense will i leave them to pursue the gratification of their own tastes in the application made of punishments never will i concur in afflicting with factitious affliction a fellowcitizen for no other cause than that of his differing from myself or from others on a matter of opinion or on a matter of taste no such privilege will i arrogate to myself as that of deciding what things he shall or shall not believe or by what things he shall or shall not be pleased by no such means will i ever seek to constitute my opinion the standard of other mens opinions my taste the standard of other mens tastes never on the occasion of the treatment to be given to delinquents—never will i suffer myself to be guided by any other wish or rule than that by which a surgeon is guided in the treatment given to his patients no more will i be guided by anger in the one case than he is in the other never will i concur in administering to any such patient of mine pain in any quantity exceeding the least that in my eyes is sufficient for preserving the whole community himself included from pain in some greater quantity in my endeavours for the maximization of official appropriate aptitude on the part of the several functionaries of the state in their several situations—i will not forget the keeping all candidates for office subjected in the most public and universally satisfactory manner to the most demonstrative tests which in the case of each department and each function of that department the nature of the duty admits of nor on the occasion of whatever provision may be made for their appropriate instruction will i be unmindful of the incontestible truths—that the only effectual security for appropriate aptitude with relation to any office is the rendering such demonstration of it an indispensable condition to the attainment of that same office—and that in proportion as in addition to adequate means adequate inducements for the attainment of such aptitude are found by individuals at their own expense all provision for that purpose at the expense of the public is probable corruption as well as certain waste section v iv notoriety of law to all promised mindful that a portion of law in relation to which in proportion as it is known it is known that execution will not be given to it is no better than a dead letter and that a law in relation to which while by some it is known by others it is not known that execution will be given to it is so much worse than a dead letter as to be a cruel snare—my sincere endeavours shall at all times be directed to the keeping the field of government clear of all such snares to this end my anxious attention shall at all times be applied—not only to the securing to the text of the law at all times an extent corresponding and equal to that of the whole aggregate of the obligations to which the people stand subjected—but also to the keeping the whole mass of the law itself in such sort methodised and divided into parts as that each individual may have in hand every portion of law in which he has a special interest in any shape clear as possible of all matter in which he has not any such interest the whole in a form as clear correct complete concise and compact as possible those parts of it in which all persons have an immediate interest being under all the variations which it may happen to them to undergo kept in such a state as that they may without difficulty form the matter of the earliest instruction administered in schools section vi v justice accessible to all promised mindful i shall ever be—that the services of judicial functionaries are the only instruments by which execution can be given to the law and security or redress to the citizen against injury in any shape at the hands of internal adversaries mindful that upon this as upon any other sort of instruments to impose a tax is to deny the use of it to all who cannot pay the tax and in this case to sell to all who can and will pay it the power of employing the instrument in the destruction of those who cannot mindful that the effect of this denial is the same whatever be the pocket that receives the produce of the tax mindful that to impose any such injurypromoting and securitydenying prohibition is to sell to the rich the means of irresistible and unpunishable aggression—to deny to the poor the possibility of selfdefence—to establish oppression to join in depredation and to produce by law the evils of anarchy mindful that every particle of needless delay  0  and vexation introduced or left by the legislator or the judge in the proceedings produces the afflictive and prohibitive effect of a tax without the profit of it mindful that where no intention of injury has place on either side the effect of every such tax and of every such neglect is to heap affliction upon affliction on both sides sensible i am that a legislator is accessory to every injury against which he withholds protection as well as to every injury to which he gives or leaves facility—sensible that he is the accomplice of every oppressor and every depredator into whose hands he thus puts an instrument of injury or in whose power he places a victim by keeping the means of redress out of his reach bearing all these things in mind—i promise and declare that on no occasion shall my diligent endeavours be wanting to the keeping at all times excluded from the system of judicature not only every particle of expense purposely imposed but every particle of needless delay and vexation which for want of such attention may be liable to have place section vii vi impartiality in elections promised on the election of the several ministers in the filling of whose situations a member of the legislature has a vote—namely the prime minister the justice minister and the legislation minister—i will on each occasion after the fullest and most impartial inquiry and consideration in my power—with scrupulous fidelity give my vote in favour of that individual in whom in my judgment the aggregate of appropriate aptitude in all its several branches has place in the highest degree and who accordingly is in the corresponding degree able and willing to give execution and effect to the ordinances of the legislature in so far as guided by the principles in this my declaration manifested section viii vii in international dealings justice and beneficence promised on the occasion of the dealings of this our state with any other states—sincerely and constantly shall my endeavours be directed to the observance of the same strict justice and impartiality as on the occasion of the dealings of the legislature with its constituents and other its fellowcountrymen of this our state never will i seek to add to the opulence or power of this our state at the expense of the opulence or power of any other state any otherwise than in the competition between individual and individual each may without injury seek to advance his own prosperity in preference to that of the other all profit by conquest in every shape i acknowledge to be no other than robbery robbery having murder for its instrument both operating upon the largest possible scale robbery committed by the ruling few in the conquering nation on the subject many in both nations robbery of which by the expense of armament the people of the conquering nation are the first victims robbery and murder the guilt of which as much exceeds the guilt of the crimes commonly called by those names as the quantity of suffering produced in the one case exceeds the quantity produced in the other seeing that in all war it is only through the sides of the unoffending many that the guilty few can ever receive a wound—never will i for any other purpose than that of national selfdefence or receipt of compensation for pecuniary damage actually sustained consent to make war on any other state nor yet for pecuniary damage till all endeavours for the obtainment of compensation in the way of arbitration or other means less destructive than general war are hopeless nor unless if not prevented by war future injury from the same source as the past is actually apprehended by me never will i consent to the receiving under the dominion of this our state—even though it were at the desire of the inhabitants—any portion of territory situate at any such disstance from the territory of this state as to prevent any of the wants of the inhabitants of such other territory from receiving at the hands of the supreme legislature of this our state relief as effectual as that which they could receive were their places of habitation situated within the pristine limits of the territory of this our state regarding as i do all such dominion as no better than an instrument and device for the accumulation of patronage and oppressive power in the hands of the ruling few in the dominating state at the expense and by the sacrifice of the interest and felicity of the subject many in both states no recognition of superiority on the part of this our state in relation to any other state will i ever seek to procure or consent to receive no factitious honour or dignity will i seek to procure or consent to receive for this my own state or any of its citizens at the hands of any other state i acknowledge all honour to be false honour all glory to be false glory all dignity false dignity—which is sought to be advanced or maintained at the expense of justice probity selfregarding prudence or effective benevolence i acknowledge all such words to be words of delusion employed by rulers for the purpose of engaging subject citizens to consent or submit to be led for the purpose of depredation to the commission of murder upon the largest scale words which as often as they are employed will in proportion as the eyes of men are open to their true interests reflect dishonour more and more intense and extensive  0  on all those by whom they are thus employed on every favourable occasion—my endeavours shall be employed to the rendering to the subjects and for their sake to the constituted authorities of every foreign state all such positive good offices as can be rendered thereto without its being at the expense of some other state or states or against the rightly presumable inclination as well as at the expense of the majority of my fellowcountrymen in this our state never by force or intimidation never by prohibition or obstruction will i use any endeavour to prevent my fellowcountrymen or any of them from seeking to better their condition in any other part inhabited or uninhabited of this globe in the territory of this state i behold an asylum to all a prison to none section ix viii impartiality in the general exercise of power promised on every occasion in the exercise of this my vocation sincere and anxious shall be my endeavour to keep my mind as clear as may be of undue partiality in every sense of partiality in favour of any class or individual to the injury of any other of partiality through selfregarding interest of partiality through interest inspired by sympathy of partiality through interest inspired by antipathy more particularly will i be on my guard against partiality in favour of superiors to the prejudice of inferiors of superiors in whatsoever scale of comparison opulence power reputation talent—natural or acquired in my conduct towards my fellowcountrymen i will on every occasion in this my situation apply my closest attention to the observance of the same strict rules as if it were that of a judge acting as a legislator i acknowledge myself to be acting as a judge bound to the observance of the same inflexible impartiality in this case as in that bound—but by ties as much stronger as the number of the persons whose happiness is at stake is greater section x ix assiduity promised mindful that by absentation half the effect of a vote on the wrong side is produced i will not on any occasion by plea of sickness or other excuse seek to exempt myself from the obligation of attendance section xi x subordination to the constitutive authority promised never except for the avoidance of determinate and clearly preponderant evil—nor for that purpose but during the absolutely necessary time—never will i concur in withdrawing the proceedings of the legislature from the view and scrutiny of the people the people its constitutional superiors the people—the only legitimate source of power the people by whose authority for whose sake and at whose expense all power conferred by this our constitution has been created section xii xi encroachment on subordinate authorities abjured sensible that if duly fulfilled the duties specially attached to the situation of member of the supreme legislative never will or can cease to be sufficient to occupy the whole of a public mans disposable time—and that nothing but disobedience tardiness inaptitude or casual and momentary want of time on the part of subordinates can create on the part of the supreme legislative any such necessity as that of assuming to itself in the whole or in part business belonging to any one of their several departments—strictly and constantly will i keep myself on my guard against every such temptation as that of acting without necessity in any part of the field of service belonging to any one of those several subordinate authorities sensible how prone for want of such due caution man in authority is to afford in this way to the appetite for patronage and oppressive power an irregular and mischievous gratification saying this i have in mind in a particular and distinct manner the functions and branches of business belonging to the several departments subordinate to the legislature namely the administrative the judicial and the sublegislative section xiii xii insincerity abjured never by deception or delusion in any shape—never will i seek to compass any point either in the framing of legislative ordinances or other authoritative instruments or in debate in all such discourses my endeavours shall be constantly directed to the giving to them the greatest degree of transparency and thence of simplicity possible on every occasion it shall be among the objects of my endeavours to keep my own discourse and as far as depends upon myself the discourse of others as pure as may be from the taint of fallacy of fallacy in every shape and in particular in those shapes in which it is delineated in the table of fallacies which to this purpose is kept hung up to serve as a perpetual memento for the use of all hearers as well as of all speakers of all persons judging as well as of all functionaries judged  0  section xiv xiii arrogance abjured acknowledging that i am but an agent chosen by my constituents to bear a part in the managing of such of their concerns as the nature of the case places them under an incapacity of managing for themselves—i arrogate not to myself any superiority over them or any one of them on that score of no power or influence attached to my situation will i ever avail myself to any such personal and sinister purpose as that of creating dependence or exacting or receiving homage to avoid wounding by haughtiness of demeanour the sensibility of such of my fellowcitizens whose business brings them into communication with me shall be among my sincere and constant cares chapter viii prime minister section i fields of service art   coextensive with that of the legislative is the prime ministers local field of service enactive art   under the legislature to the prime ministers logical field of service belongs as per ch iv art   and   whatsoever portion of the legislatures logical field of service does not belong to the judiciary department headed by the justice minister for the particulars of the prime ministers service in this field see sections       expositive art   by the prime ministers logical field of service understand that ideal space within which is to be found the aggregate of the several persons and things constituting the subjectmatter of the operations performed and correspondent functions exercised by him—together with the aggregate of the operations which he is empowered to exercise in relation to those same persons and those same things expositive art   so also in the case of the several ministers as per ch ix ministers collectively section   ministers and subdepartments ratiocinative art   question prime minister why thus denominated answer reasons because by this denomination his situation is more appositely designated than by any other and by incorrect ideas—if associated with the denomination of the functionary occupying so important a situation—evil results in practice would to no inconsiderable amount be liable to be produced ratiocinative art   minister is from the latin and means servant all functionaries belonging to the administrative are as such servants—located and dislocable servants—of the legislature so much for the word minister in this same department of all other functionaries belonging to it this functionary is the superordinate so much for the adjunct prime he is to those immediative servants of the constitutive what in a monarchy the functionary of this same name is to the monarch thus it is that with reference to one of those different authorities his is subordinate with reference to the other superordinate ratiocinative art   for significance and adequacy no other denomination can compete with this by the spanish denomination gefe politico political chief employed in some cases superordination only is presented to view subordination not ratiocinative art   so as to the denomination president a denomination which from the precedent set in the angloamerican united states has been but too extensively adopted to this denomination that same objection of inadequateness that is to say of incompleteness from whence comes incorrectness applies with equal force ratiocinative art   in the case of these same united states—it is on another account inapposite to preside—from the latin præ and sedeo—is to sit before or above a number of other persons who in the same place are sitting at the same time now this is what the president of the united states never does nor ever can do he is on purpose and to a very wise purpose placed at a perpetual distance from congress the body with which he communicates and from which he receives mandates by message only—that is the word—are communications to them made by him thence comes the good consequence that never taking part in their debates never does he expose himself to those angry feelings and imputations of sinister conduct from which consistently with the nature of man and the nature of the case debates especially when on political subjects can seldom be altogether free instructional art  0 the conception naturally presented by the name president to foreigners is that of a person sitting in congress presiding over the proceedings of its two assemblies or one of them just as the sort of functionary called  0  in english the chairman does in all formal meetings private and nonofficial as well as public and official by men of the united states this misconception has every now and then been noted as a mark of relative ignorance on the part of the thus misled foreigners but the error such as it is lies it has been seen at the door—not of the foreigners but of the natives the foreigners take the word of the natives and by this confidence it is that they are led into the mistake the natives at the same time lose the credit of the arrangement and the foreigners the benefit of the instruction derivable from it they even receive misinstruction instead of it section ii functions enactive art   to the prime minister exercisable within his logical field of service belong the functions following namely i executive function exercise is given to it in so far as within that same field he gives execution and effect to any ordinances emanating whether immediately or unimmediately from the legislature thus giving corresponding execution and effect to the rightly presumed will of the constitutive enactive art   ii directive function in the exercise of this function—by him is the business of the administrative

the subdepartment should be at a stand located provided also that any person who is then officiating or has officiated in the situation of depute in that same office as per section   may be so located in such sort that his term of service as per section   in the situation of minister principal shall continue until the operations preliminary to location as per ch ix ministers collectively section

may at any time either locate or to any superior situation without exception promote so also to any coequal situation transfer so also suspend or subject to appeal as per art    dislocate instructional art    to be an apt possessor of this function it is not necessary that the functionary should be a military man in the united states constitutional code these same offices  0  are given to the president and since washingtons time no military man has borne that office the object is—to place the force in case of necessity at his disposal on any such occasion he would act of course by professional advice enactive art    so as to the stipendiary sea defensive force or in one word stipendiary navy enactive art    except it be in the actual presence of an enemy—every such act of location promotion transference dislocation and suspension must to be valid be evidenced by an instrument authenticated by his signature or if in the presence of an enemy as soon afterwards as may be enactive art    of every such instrument exemplars will in the way of manifold writing as per section   be written and disposed of as follows   kept in the prime ministers office one   kept by the

purpose of explanation he has been invited or ordered by the legislature to a personal conference enactive art   on the occasion of a message sent by him to the legislature functions exercisable by him are the following i the informative to wit when an occasion occurs on which the legislature has need of information concerning a state of things the particulars of which would not otherwise be so

minister—or through the instrumentality of a deputy in the name of the deputy enactive art   for any definite and serious evil which can be shown to have had place or to be in imminent danger of taking place for want of his having given exercise to any one of the above functions he is responsible instructional art   except where for release from this responsibility it may be advisable for him to  0  communicate by message—communication by the instrumentality of a minister in the name of the minister if consenting and approving will be the more eligible course to wit in respect of its leaving the freedom of the assembly less exposed to disturbance enactive instructional art  0 iv the statistic function in the exercise of this function at the commencement of every year—the prime minister will in the form of a message lay before the legislative assembly the general condition of the state according to his view of it pointing their attention in general terms to any measures which present themselves as conducing to the conservation or the melioration of it section iv selfsuppletive function enactive art   lest the business of his office should be at any time at a stand—to the prime minister belongs the power of selfsupply with the obligation of keeping it in exercise it is exercised by the location of an at all times dislocable depute expositive art   by a depute

the acts of the depute is the principal responsible by acceptance of the office—not simply for performance but for apt and complete performance of the functions does he contract irresponsible he might safely commit any breach of trust in any shape by the instrumentality of any person consenting to subject himself to the risk expositive art   punitionally that is to say to the purpose of being subjected to punishment—suffering under the name of punishment over and above the suffering produced by the exaction of compensation or in lieu of it in those cases in which compensation cannot have place for example where there is no individual specially wronged compensationally that is to say to the purpose of being compelled to yield compensation dislocationally that is to say to the effect of being dislocated art   within  days after his own location a prime minister is expected to locate such his depute and thereafter immediately upon the dislocation of a preceding a succeeding one

instrument has been signed by the principal an instrument signed on that same day by the depute is of no validity unless on the sudden incapacity or death of the principal in either of which events in case of urgency an instrument signed by the depute stating the event and declaring the urgency may be valid but in this case the principal cannot act on the same day as that on which by the act of his depute he has as above been declared incapable enactive art  0 on the decease of the principal the functions of the office the locative excepted as per art   are exercised by the depute until a

election is performed as to which see section   enactive art   if antecedently to the expiration of a prime ministers term of service the legislature has omitted to make a fresh election the omission is on the part of all by whose default it has had place an anticonstitutional offence tending to substitute a representative democracy monarchy or aristocracy and punitionally as per ch vi section    as well as dislocationally every offender is responsible section vi remuneration enactive ratiocinative instructional art   the prime ministers pay is  ayear paid quarterly in advance from unwilling hands receipt of ulterior emolument is extortion from willing corruption instructional art   as to this possessor of the supreme singleseated situation note that though he is at all times subordinate to the majority of the members of the legislature in their aggregate capacity yet is his power incomparably greater than that of any one taken apart inferior in respect of his dislocability—he is superior even to the whole legislature in respect of the agreeable and desirable nature of one part to wit the locative part of the power exercised by him—the extent to which and frequency with which the exercise of it is called forth and the longer duration as per section   of his term of service section vii locable who enactive art   exceptions excepted—in this office any person who in the judgment of the legislative authority is in respect of all points of appropriate aptitude taken together most apt is locable enactive art   excepted are i all monarchs and every person connected by

looked at or in any other manner any of them known—till after the result of the votation in the open mode has been declared enactive art   if of the two different modes the results be in favour of different persons he who has the majority in the open mode is located enactive art   if he who in the open mode has the comparative majority has not the absolute majority—he and the person whose number of votes comes next to his are thereupon voted for without the others on this latter occasion in case of equal numbers lot decides for the mode see ch ix ministers collectively section    located how instructional art   for the sake of instruction by experience is this double mode of election here proposed neither in the shape of delay vexation or expense nor in any other shape does evil present itself as likely to be produced at any rate in quantity capable of outweighing the good attached to whatsoever instruction may be the result of this instruction the particular nature seems not however very easy to be anticipated by the open mode each mans vote is subjected at the same time to the seductive influence of his codeputies and of the several candidates for the situation to be filled on the other hand so is it to the tutelary influence of the publicopinion tribunal—organ of the constitutive authority by the secret mode it is exempted from both these antagonizing influences on the other hand it is subjected to the seductive influence of the personal interests and affections sympathetic and antipathetic of each individual voter after a certain length of experience—the  0  legislature for the time being under the guidance of the public voice will be in a condition to pronounce on the ground of experience between the three competing modes to wit the two simple ones and the compound composed of both from the application of the same course of experiment to the prime ministers of the several sublegislatures the instruction obtainable from this source will in the proportion of their number receive diversification and increase section ix dislocable how enactive ratiocinative art   dislocable is this functionary at any time by that authority for the giving execution and effect to whose will he has been located he is dislocable by the legislature enactive ratiocinative art   so by the constitutive authority as per ch v section   enactive art   other efficient causes of dislocatedness in this case are the same as in the case of a member of the legislature as per ch vi legislature section  0 dislocable how no             section x registration system enactive ratiocinative art   for the more commodious correct prompt uniform and allcomprehensive performance of the process and function of registration in all the several departments and subdepartments—as likewise on the part of the prime minister for the correspondent receipt by him of all documents the receipt and as occasion calls the perusal of which may be necessary to the most apt exercise of the several functions belonging to his own office—he will as soon as may be cause to be established and employed in practice in the several offices of the several departments and their subdepartments the sublegislative included the mode of writing styled the manifold mode ratiocinative instructional art   particular uses of the manifold mode of writing are as follows— by the multitude of exemplars produced at an expense which with the exception of that of the paper is less than the expense of two in the ordinary mode it affords means for furnishing at that small expense to parties on both sides for themselves and assistants all such documents as they can stand in need of ratiocinative instructional art   every exemplar being to an iota exactly and necessarily the same as every other—the expense of revision by skill and labour is thereby saved as well as unintentional aberration rendered impossible ratiocinative instructional art   an exemplar kept in the registrars office will serve as a standard whereby a security will be afforded against all intentional falsification on the part of the possessor of any other exemplar ratiocinative instructional art   by the reduction thus effected in the expense of all judicial writings emaning from the judicatory—the protection afforded by judicature in its best form to wit that which has for its ground orally elicited and immediately minuted evidence will be brought within the reach of a vast proportion of the whole number of the people to whom it could not otherwise be afforded ratiocinative instructional art   a collateral benefit—a degree of security hitherto unexampled against destruction of judicial documents by calamity or delinquency may thus be afforded by the lodging of exemplars in divers offices in which they would be requisite for other purposes exemplars of documents from the immediate judicatories being at the appellate judicatory requisite for the exercise of its judicial functions and in the office of justice minister for the exercise of his inspective and meliorationsuggestive functions so also in the other departments instructional art   to save the expense of custody and prevent the useful from being drowned in the mass of useless matter—the legislature will make arrangements for the periodical destruction or elimination of such as shall appear useless care being at all times taken for the preservation of all such as can continue to be of use either eventually for a judicial purpose or for the exercise of the statistic and meliorationsuggestive functions as per ch ix ministers collectively sections         ch xi ministers severally section   legislation minister and ch xii judiciary collectively sections     0       section xi publication system expositive art   by the publication system understand   0 that by which the several matters of fact acquaintance wherewith is in any wise material to the business of the subdepartment or department in question are rendered or endeavoured to be rendered at all times present to the mind of every person in whose instance such presence is likely to be in any way of use the greater the number of the persons to whose minds at any given point of time it is actually made present the greater the extent given to the publication—to the publicity thus effected enactive instructional art   exceptions excepted—in every subdepartment and department and in every office belonging to each subdepartment and department publicity will at all times be maximized instructional art   exception   the evil produced by the unavoidable expense preponderant over the good produced by the extent proposed to be given in the instance in question to the publicity antagonize thus one with another the two principles and the rules respectively prescribed by them rule   maximize publicity rule   maximize frugality rule   by every deduction made from the amount of the expense the extent given to publicity may with clear advantage be increased hence one advantage of the manifold writing mode as per section  0 registration system instructional art   the good produced by publicity is of two sorts to wit   the general   the particular the general consists in the efficiency it gives to the force of the law and to that of the publicopinion tribunal to wit in the character of an instrument of security for appropriate aptitude on the part of all public functionaries the particular consists in the particular use derivable from the information afforded concerning each particular matter of fact to the several individuals whose happiness may be promoted or their conduct beneficially influenced by it instructional art   exception   where in this or that particular case in addition to the evil of expense if any the evil of the publicity would in the instance of this or that particular person or class of persons be preponderant over the good instructional art   of the subdepartments in which this preponderance is most apt to have place examples are the following   the constitutive department to wit in respect of the evil that would result from its being known which way the several voters or any of them gave their votes for the reasons for which the evil of publicity would in this instance be destructive of the constitution and not accompanied by good in any shape see election code preliminary explanations vol iii p     the thing requisite is—that of each voter the inward wish be expressed by his vote to wit on the presumption that in so far as by the direction given to it he sees no probability of advancing his own at the expense of the general interest he will give to it such direction as according to what he thinks or has heard will be most for the advantage of the general interest but in so far as this direction were known and he apprized of its being so the wish expressed by his vote would be—the wish of whatever person he had most to fear or hope from and as the number of the persons who have most to fear or hope from a man will be in the conjunct proportion of his legal power and his opulence—hence supposing votes public a constitution democratical in appearance may be aristocratical in effect and the happiness provided for—not that of the many but at the expense of the many that of the few   the army

collectively section    publicity c instructional ratiocinative art   in each several case in so far as secrecy is provided for the assumption is—that in that case publicity would be liable to become subservient to hostile purposes—to the support of this or that interest in hostility with the interest of the greatest number in this state in the case of the defensive force and preventive service subdepartments the effect of the publicity might if extended to certain persons be the giving aid to hostile designs already entertained and endeavoured to be carried into effect in the case of the foreign relation subdepartment it might be—either the giving aid to such designs if already     entertained or even the giving birth to the like designs instructional ratiocinative art   in each such case—a point of time will however be assignable after which the evil at first producible by publicity will have ceased to be thus producible but at no time can the good produced by publicity cease to exist or to operate for at no time can the operation of the tutelary power of the publicopinion tribunal—that judicial power to which the publicity furnishes its necessary evidence—cease to be needed if it be known that upon the cessation of the particular demand for the secrecy it will cease—the obstruction afforded by it to the operation of the legal as well as publicopinion tribunals and the evil produced by it will be minimized and the quantity much reduced instructional art   thus it is—that under this system to the extent of the publicity thus requisite and thus ordained—and thence to the correspondent and necessarily previous registration—there are no limits—other than those which are set to it by one or other of two considerations the one is—the expense necessitated by the operation a consideration which applies to all cases the other is—the demand for temporary secrecy—a demand the nature and extent of which are produced and regulated by various special causes depending on the nature of the business of the department or subdepartment ratiocinative instructional art  0 as there are not any limits other than as above to the extent of the demand for publication so neither are there to that of the good derivable from it as to this see the sections intituled securities c in ch vi legislature ch viii prime minister this present chapter ch ix

section   statistic function expositive art    considered in respect of its extent publication may be distinguished into internal and external understand by internal or say special that mode of publication the operation of which is confined to the particular official situation or the particular subdepartment in the course of the business of which the facts in question came into existence by external that produced by the conveyance of the information to persons other than those belonging to or having business with that same office department or subdepartment of external publicity the benefit therefore is not confined to any other limits than those which apply to the numbers of mankind at the time in question and all succeeding ones expositive instructional art    of internal publication the appropriate instrument will be the manifold writing apparatus as per section  0 of external the printing press by which to the degree that has been seen the expense is diminished instructional art    to both these modes and degrees of publication the registration system is not only subservient but necessary and in this subserviency may be seen its only uses over and above those which consist in the information which in the case of each official situation is afforded to the functionary by whom at the time in question it is occupied instructional art    rules for limitation of the exceptive rules by which secrecy is prescribed rule   the exemption from publication should not go beyond the reason for it the concealment beyond the demand for concealment that is to say beyond the extent of the evil liable to be produced by divulgation rule   the evil from divulgation depends partly upon the situation of the persons by whom the information is received partly upon the time at which it is received rule   limitation as to persons in the case of a department or subdepartment the business of which may present a demand for secrecy—the exclusion from information should not extend to any functionary in whose instance information is necessary to the due performance of his official service especially if at his hands no communication is likely to be made to any person who is likely to employ it in giving rise or existence to the evil apprehended rule   but as every addition made to the number of the persons possessed of the information adds to the probability of promiscuous or otherwise mischievous communication—by no person should the communication be suffered to be received other than him or them in whose instance the receipt of it is necessary to the due performance of the services in question as above instructional art    limitation as to time certain subdepartments there are in which the nature of the business seems scarcely to admit of any limitation to the time during which the good of the service may require the secrecy to be observed these are—  the defensive force subdepartment   the foreign relation subdepartment in these instances for preventing the concealment from being continued longer than the good of the     service requires two arrangements present themselves i let it be part of the business of the prime minister from time to time—say at the beginning of each year—to make a report to the legislature stating the instances in which in these several subdepartments the demand for secrecy has in his opinion ceased that divulgation may be made accordingly instructional art    ii in like manner and on the same principle let the legislature annually appoint a committee for the same purpose that its report may serve as a check to the prime ministers report for which purpose it should make known all instances if any in which continuance is given by him to any concealment which in their opinion is not necessary instructional art    on both occasions—instead of or along with the instances in which the concealment requires to be continued the report may have for its subjectmatter those in which it may without prejudice to the service be discontinued and divulgation substituted in every instance in which such continuance is recommended such mode of designation will of course be employed as shall suffice for preventing all such disclosure as is not intended instructional art    note that the greater the proportion of new members is in each successive legislature the less the probability is that concealment will be continued beyond the duration of the exigency section xii securities for appropriate aptitude art   for maximization of appropriate aptitude on the part of the prime

chapter ix ministers collectively section i ends in view instructional art   ends in view—as in every other department of the official establishment so in this are—  maximization of appropriate good   minimization of correspondent evil under these two heads may on this occasion be comprised the two allcomprehensive branches of the main universal end—the greatest happiness of the greatest number expositive art   by the appropriate good understand on this occasion the due and successful performance of the several operations by the performance of which the functions belonging to the several functionaries employed in the administration department are exercised and the business of their several offices carried on by the correspondent evil evil in its several shapes—to wit delay vexation and expense to functionaries and suitors main end maximization of the good collateral end or ends minimization of the evil instructional art   in these may be beheld two landmarks set up for the guidance of the legislator in his course the collateral end considered in these its several branches has the more need to be here noted the more apt it is to be overlooked in particular so far as regards suitors see this distinction farther developed in section   statistic function expositive art   by a suitor as in the case of the judiciary department as per ch xii judiciary collectively so in this understand any person considered as having business to transact with any functionary belonging to this department and acting or applied to in such his capacity for the arrangements having more particularly in view this same collateral end see section    oppression obviated and section    securities c section ii ministers and subdepartments enactive art   under the prime minister are the ministers following namely   the election minister as to whose functions see section   functions in all and ch xi section     the legislation minister as to whose functions see section   and ch xi

minister belongs a subdepartment of the corresponding denomination but under the authority of one and the same minister there may upon occasion be any number of these same subdepartments expositive art   collectively taken the functionaries who under the prime minister are respectively at the head of these subdepartments are denominated ministers severally they are denominated from the names of the respective subdepartments as thus—election minister legislation minister and so on expositive art   but though of each minister the logical field of service is styled a subdepartment his official name is—not subminister but simply minister expositive art   accordingly as often as in this code the word ministers occurs understand by that denomination—not the prime minister but only these same ministers enactive expositive art   subminister is the official name of a functionary who to a sublegislature bears the same relation as the abovementioned ministers bear to the legislature enactive expositive art   in like manner subprime minister is the official name of the functionary who to a sublegislature bears the same relation as the prime minister bears to the legislature enactive instructional art   at the commencement of the authority of this code and so on during the preparation period as per section    locable who the prime minister under the direction of the legislature will allot to each minister one or more of the abovementioned subdepartments on this occasion he will have regard—on the one hand to the avoidance of the waste and corruption produced by the paying of divers functionaries where one would suffice—on the other to the quantity of time requisite for the conduct of the several businesses and the faculty of finding individuals in whose instance the several branches of appropriate aptitude with relation to the respective businesses will be found united enactive ratiocinative art   where two or more subdepartments have been allotted to one and the same minister it belongs not to the prime minister without the concurrence of the legislature so to separate them as to add to the number of the ministers for by so doing scarcely could he avoid giving increase to the expense and thus whether to or for his own benefit or not imposing upon the people a correspondent tax expositive instructional art  0 examples of unions which antecedently to experience seem most likely to be effectible without detriment to the service are the following i the army navy and preventive service subdepartments ii the interiorcommunication and domain subdepartments iii the indigence relief and education subdepartments iv the trade and finance subdepartments section iii number in an office enactive art   in each official situation functionaries no more than one ratiocinative art   short reason here as elsewhere official aptitude maximized expense minimized reasons in detail the following—see moreover section    remuneration section    locable who section    located how ratiocinative art   i appropriate moral aptitude i the state of the law being given—for every practical purpose appropriate moral aptitude must be considered as exactly proportioned to the strictness of the functionarys dependence on public opinion understand thereby the general tenor of the exercise given by the publicopinion tribunal to its power exception made of any such aberrations from the path marked out by the greatest happiness principle as on the part of that body happens in the place and at the time in question to have been produced and maintained by deficiency in appropriate intellectual aptitude ii singlyseated a functionary finds not any person on whom he can shift off the whole or any part of the imputation of a mischievous exercise given to any of his functions not so when he has a colleague     iii no person does he find to share with him in the weight of that odium iv no person does he find in the same situation with himself engaged by the conjunct ties of selfregarding interest and sympathy to support him under the apprehension of it by the encouragement given by their countenance v he has it not in his power without committing himself to give to an indefensible exercise made of his functions half the effect of a vote—namely by purposed absentation and nonparticipation vi he finds not in the same situation with himself any person to share with him and in proportion draw off from him the whole or any part of any lot of approbation whether on the part of his superiors in office or the public at large that may come to be attached to extra merit in any shape manifested on the occasion of any exercise given to his functions vii his reputation stands altogether upon the ground of his actions he finds not in the same situation any person to help him as numbers help one another to raise a schism in the public—and by the mere force of prejudice—without evidence or in spite of evidence in relation to specific actions—to draw after them the suffrages of the unreflecting part of it ratiocinative art   ii appropriate intellectual aptitude cognitional and judicial viii by a single seated functionary intellectual aptitude is likely from the abovementioned causes to be acquired and maintained in a higher degree than by a conjunctly seated functionary in so far as aptitude in this shape is the fruit of exertion ratiocinative art   iii appropriate active aptitude ix on the part of a singlyseated functionary appropriate active aptitude is likely to be acquired and maintained in a higher degree than by a conjunctly seated functionary in so far as aptitude in this shape depends upon the joint power of intellectual aptitude and exertion ratiocinative expositive art   iv collateral end or ends of administration exclusion of delay vexation and expense x only in the case of a singlyseated functionary can promptitude or say despatch be maximized xi a singlyseated functionary has but one opinion and one set of reasons to give xii no persons opinion has he to wait for xiii no person has he to debate with to gain over or to quarrel with xiv no person has he to put unnecessary questions to him—to propose unnecessary steps—or to necessitate useless adjournments xv to suitors—that is to say to persons having business at the office—causes of delay are in a large proportion of the number of individual cases to a greater or lesser amount causes of expense ratiocinative art   the addition made as above to the abovementioned evils by plurality bears a pretty exact proportion to the number of the seats ratiocinative art   so many seats so many sets are there of persons who by community of sinister interest stand engaged to secure the possessor of the situation against responsibility in every shape for delinquency in every shape ratiocinative expositive art   in each set of persons thus linked together by a community of sinister interest distinguishable component members are the following— i all persons connected by any tie of selfregarding interest or sympathy with any of the several actual incumbents ii all persons having any prospect of succeeding to those same situations iii all persons connected as above with any such successor in expectancy ratiocinative art  0 the higher the situation in the scale of power the stronger of course the support given to delinquency by addition of sets of persons united as above in support of it expositive art    in english practice where in the administration department in an official situation members more than two have place the aggregate of them is commonly styled a board ratiocinative art    a board keeps concealed deficiency in any amount that can be desired in appropriate intellectual aptitude in both its shapes—with the addition of that of appropriate active aptitude ratiocinative instructional art    a board furnishes means and pretext for bestowing to the largest amounts in use the matter of remuneration on a number of persons equal to that of all its members except one—all of them in any degree destitute of appropriate aptitude in any or every one of its shapes ratiocinative art    by vacancy or temporary incapacity if effectual provision against it were not made a considerable objection to singleseatedness would indeed be afforded but by section   selfsuppletive function such provision is made and in that way without expense instead of being made as above with increase     of expense in exact proportion to the additional number of seats ratiocinative art    whatsoever beneficial effects can be expected from a multiplicity of functionaries in the same situation may and in a much greater degree be insured and in this code are accordingly insured by means of other agents namely by superordinates the publicopinion tribunal included for control by subordinates for information exemplificational instructional art    in the central government of the angloamerican united states the situations in the executive department are every one of them single seated of the thirteen here proposed subdepartments some have there no place the rest are consolidated into four each filled by a minister locable and dislocable by the president of the state whose power in so far is that of the here proposed prime minister denominations of these ministers in the case of the army subdepartment foreign relation subdepartment and finance subdepartment secretary in the case of the navy subdepartment commissioner denomination of the foreign relation minister secretary of state to whose office some other functions of a miscellaneous nature may perhaps also be found attached subdepartments conjointly in the hands of the functionary here named finance minister there secretary of the treasury department—those here denominated the finance subdepartment and the trade subdepartment subdepartments for which as not belonging to the logical field of service of the central government there is no place these which follow—i the election subdepartment ii the preventive service subdepartment iii the interior communication subdepartment iv the indigence relief subdepartment v the education subdepartment vi the domain subdepartment vii the health subdepartment—subdepartment not in the contemplation of that government the here proposed legislation subdepartment instructional exemplificational art    in the case of the relation between the president as above and his immediate subordinates—the power of the superordinate in relation to subordinates is not only as to location but as to dislocation absolute and at the accession of each president the power of dislocation is commonly exercised as to those whom he finds in office and that of location at the same time as to new ones in regard to each effectual responsibility is secured by the power expressly given to him to require of each of them an opinion in writing in relation to all points belonging to their respective offices and by this arrangement are produced all the good effects the production of which is professed to be expected from boards to this power the exercise thus given is as a matter of course and accordingly does not to the eye of the public at large convey any unfavourable imputation nor in the breasts of the functionaries thus eliminated produce any pain of disappointment instructional art    in this proposed code to both powers—that of location and that of dislocation—those limitations are attached which will be seen—to the power of location in section    locable who and section    located how to the power of dislocation in section    oppression obviated thus then a sort of competition for the preference may be seen having place in the case of this code in regard to location the limitations to the power of effecting it in the instance of these situations form part of an allcomprehensive system and are necessary to the exclusion of inaptitude as to dislocation the one arrangement may be best in some countries the other in others ratiocinative art    any beneficial effects that can by accident have resulted from any addition to number one will not be found attributable to anything but the chance it affords of an appeal formal or virtual to superordinate authority as just mentioned ratiocinative art  0 that which in the exercise of official functions constitutes arbitrary power is—not the unity of the functionary but his exemption from control including the obligation contemporary or eventual of assigning reasons for his acts ratiocinative art    the circumstances which render plurality indispensable in legislation apply not to the case of administration for the purpose of legislation it is not physically possible for the supreme authority—the constitutive—to act in one body and in concert and cooperation in the location and dislocation periodical and eventual of an immediate subordinate nor in this way were it physically possible so to act would it be possible so to act with advantage towards the proper ends of government but to its locators and representatives in the legislature this conjunctness of action is possible and is accordingly here ordained exemplificational ratiocinative art    in english practice this department swarms with boards and this practice—does it not it may be asked form a presumption in favour of manyseatedness answer a presumption yes but of this presumption the probative force is completely overborne overborne—by that of the above     reasons with the addition of the counter presumption afforded by the counter practice of the united states as per art    with or without the consideration of the ends to which the manyseatedness has been directed and the purposes which have accordingly been and continue to be served by it exemplificational ratiocinative art    end in view of the here proposed code the greatest happiness of the greatest number means or say subend so far as regards the whole official establishment maximization of official appropriate aptitude coupled with minimization of expense for the connexion between which two branches see section    remuneration section    locable who section    located how end in view in the case of the english form of government greatest happiness of the ruling one in conjunction with that of the subruling few means and subends on the part of the whole official establishment in relation to appropriate aptitude minimization of the quantity necessary to the possession of a situation in it in relation to expense maximization—for the sake of the profit to the one and the few extractible out of the expense of the truth of the position that the here assigned main end and subends are the real ones—the abovementioned ratiocinative matter as far as it goes operates in demonstration for further proof see whatsoever in the course of this code is said of that same form of government and in particular in the several sections just referred to exemplificational ratiocinative art    in practice in some of the above instances partition of the business would probably be found to have place and in the course of this partition more or less of the business would be found lodged in single hands but by no such instances of singleseatedness are the mischievous effects of manyseatedness as above particularized diminished on the contrary rather are they increased general result a mixture of responsibility and irresponsibility both contributing to misrule on the part of all subordinate boards responsibility—and that complete—as towards the cabinet ministers who are in the same way responsible dislocationally to wit to the completely irresponsible and thence arbitrarily ruling monarch irresponsibility as towards the publicopinion tribunal exemption from its influence being in so great a degree the result of the manyseatedness as above exemplificational ratiocinative instructional art    for manyseatedness in no one of all these several instances can there be any necessity or use so far as singleseatedness as above has place—for producing its good effects it has but to be rendered as here permanent and at the same time notorious so many exemplifications of it so many distinct official situations being established each with its appropriate denomination to the publicopinion tribunal each functionary would then be responsible for everything that he does on the present footing no one is responsible for anything that he does instructional art    rule be the situation what it may—if there be more business than a single functionary is sufficient for—according to the nature of the business keep for the principal member a certain portion of it establishing additional singleseated situations one or more either in coordination or in subordination with reference to the original one the distribution the declared existence of which forms the only alleged reason in support of the board system will thus be to a certainty effected whereas otherwise it may be pretended to be effected without being so in reality ratiocinative instructional art    in the case of the english boards what there is of irresponsibility as above—though in every instance it keeps the members in a great degree exempt from the authority of the publicopinion tribunal and in that same degree deprives the public of that security for appropriate aptitude and good conduct—does not exempt them in any degree from the absolute and arbitrary power of the monarch in the chief of each board under whatever name he beholds the sole and allsufficient instrument of his will and for the purpose of giving effect to it by the direction given to the proceedings of the board the object of his confidence by him every member of every board may at any time be dislocated at pleasure all but the chief in case of noncompliance with the direction of the chief the chief in case of noncompliance with the direction of the supreme board the cabinet the members of which are every one of them at every instant dislocable by that same universal master and for this purpose though to the public nothing is on any occasion known of the part taken by any one of them—yet by him through the medium of the chief everything is known of the part taken by every one of them under this form of government—a board though in so great a degree unapt as a security for good rule is as may be seen completely apt as a security for misrule what then is it that prevents the despotism from being in that one hand consummate the answer belongs not to this place see as to this matter ch xvi quasi jury     instructional ratiocinative art    correspondent and opposite to the case of the union of divers persons in one official situation is that of the union of divers official situations in one person cases in which a demand for this union may have place are the following— case i for the business of the several situations the applicable time of one individual sufficient of causes of demand in this case examples are—   on the part of all—need of the service of one and the same subordinate or set of subordinates at the same time   saving of the time necessary for conveyance of appropriate information from one to another in so far as information necessary to all is in the first instance received by any number less than all   saving of expense more particularly expense in remuneration for eventual instances of all these causes of demand see section   ministers and subdepartments instructional art    case ii by reason of the smallness of the local field of service and the logical field taken together—unfrequency of the individual instances of demand for the exercise of the functions belonging to the several situations for examples see ch xxv local headman ch xxvi local registrar in the situation of local headman number of functions belonging to the administrational department eleven to the judicial department five total sixteen many of them widely dissimilar ratiocinative instructional art  0 thus it is—that at the top and at the bottom of the official climax the greatest scope for the union of functions of different natures has place at the top because there the functions are chiefly of the directive kind and to the directive function exercise may in minute portions of time be given to the operations of functionaries in indefinite number at the bottom because for the performance of the functions though of the executive kind the demand for performance will generally be so unfrequent instructional art    at the first formation of the official establishment on no other ground than that of conjecture can any determination be formed as to the number of distinguishable sets of functions to which the service of one and the same individual will be sufficient to give exercise thereafter a more substantial and appropriate ground will be afforded by experience observation and experiment but in the nature of the case at one time the demand for augmentation at another time the demand for diminution will be presented by incidental occurrences suppose the maximum of frugality attained in the first instance yet thereafter increase of     population whether in the whole territory of the state or only in this or that section of it will naturally become productive of a demand for augmentation in the number of official situations—and this without any infringement of the expenseminimization rule exemplificational instructional art    in english practice in regard to the number of official situations the same official establishment exhibits in one department—the administrational—a vast redundancy—in another department—the judiciary—a vast deficiency of two systems in appearance so inconsistent a common efficient cause may be seen in the allruling sinister interest in the administrational department all functionaries being in every situation in effect dislocable as well as locable at the command of the supreme authority—and at the same time endowed with emolument mostly in vast excess—the greater the aggregate mass in number and value in the greater degree is the sinister interest on the part of locating rulers benefited and note that in this department the emolument is in general composed exclusively of salary without fees and is thence not increasible by any act on the part of incumbents—in the judiciary department on the contrary—the emolument being increasible and increased by fees exacted by locators for themselves and their locatees—the greater the number of judicatories of subordinate grades the incumbents of which would not be locable by them the greater would be the quantity of business intercepted and prevented from finding its way to their shops hence a compound composed of sale of what is called justice and denial of it denial to wit to all those who cannot afford to buy it and by both sale and denial the sinister interest benefited shape of the benefit in so far as the sale has place emolument in so far as denial ease instructional art    a memento for which on this occasion a demand might seem to have place—is a caution not to unite in the hands of one and the same person two or more offices termed for shortness incompatible an appellation by which have been designated offices the possessor of one of which is in any way subordinate or in any way immediately responsible to the possessor of the other reason the control would by any such arrangement be annihilated but an arrangement thus palpably absurd—scarcely could it be realized but in a more or less disguised form as where the two official situations are one or both of them manyseated and in the present code have been inserted even without any design directed to this end two arrangements either of which would so long as it lasted suffice to exclude all demand for any such caution one is—the nonexistence of any manyseated official situation under that of the legislature the other—the dislocability of the possessor of every official situation under the legislature by any one of several authorities instructional art    more obviously to the judiciary department than to the administrational belongs the caution here given and but for english practice scarcely could there have been any demand for it under this form of government an allruling although as may be imagined not a declared principle is—what may be termed the selfjudication principle—every man judge over himself examples follow exemplificational art    i in case of breach of official duty from the lowest to the highest degree of enormity in the highest situations—the cabinet for example—no penal judicatory but the house of lords no accuser but the house of commons and of the cabinet every member is so either of the house of lords or of the house of commons exemplificational art    ii anno      in the house of commons complaints after complaints during a long course of years grounds of complaint having existed during a much longer of inaptitude intellectual and active on the part of the head of the law complaints of moral inaptitude—conniving at and profiting by extortion practised to vast amount on false pretences though so much more flagrant as well as notorious being as usual studiously suppressed to stop the inquiry in the house of commons a fellow member of the cabinet proposes a board of commissioners to be named for inquiry into the aptitude of the system of procedure under which the judge in question is acting the proposal acquiesced in of course locator of these judges—in name the king in effect—sole locator—and by his countersignature even in name—the judge so complained of connected with this principle and constituting a ground for it is an article in the political creed not the less universally professed by not being subscribed to in the political creed—impeccability of all persons whose situations in the official establishment are of a certain altitude exemplifications and proofs might fill a volume for by these principles is practice—throughout—and in particular judicial practice as well as language determined section iv functions in all instructional expositive art   to the several sorts of operations which in every one of these subdepartments will need to be continually performed correspond so many functions which will need to be   0 exercised by the name of the function the name as well as nature of the operation will in general with the help of a short definition or exposition where necessary be sufficiently indicated where not it will be added instructional expositive art   previously to the enumeration of these functions note requires to be taken of the distinctions which have place in regard to the sorts of subjectmatters on or in relation to which these same functions and in particular the registrative as per section   will have to be exercised expositive art   only by their names or more ample descriptions can the subjectmatters of political functions be designated all names are in their grammatical appellation nounssubstantive expositive art   i names of real entities—names of fictitious entities—under one or other of these denominations will all names of the subjectmatters in question be found comprised expositive art   names of persons—names of things—under one or other of these denominations will all names of real entities be found comprised expositive art   names of fictitious persons—names of fictitious things—under one or other of these denominations will all names of fictitious entities be found comprised expositive art   ii on one class of fictitious entities is by lawyers bestowed the denomination of things incorporeal these are obligations and rights of which two correspondent fictitious entities rights alone are commonly spoken of though they are not explainable or intelligible otherwise than by reference to the respectively correspondent obligations while obligations are capable of having place without any correspondent right expositive art   by the absence of correspondent obligation right is in some instance constituted by the presence of obligation in other instances by the absence of obligation in one quarter coupled with the presence of it in another in another set of instances expositive art   by the absence of obligation to forbear meddling with it is constituted your simple or say natural or natred right to anything that is yours by the obligation imposed on your neighbour to forbear meddling with it and to forbear obstructing you in the use of it is constituted whatever factitious or say sanctional and exclusive right you have to it† for further exemplifications see the penal and procedure codes expositive art  0 iii immoveables and moveables—to one or other of these denominations will everything that is not a fictitious entity be found referrible clear and eminently useful is this distinction source of it romebred law source of endless confusion the denominations which come nearest to the above—the denominations—realty and personalty in englishbred law expositive art    iv moveables at large and money to one or other of these denominations will be found referrible everything that comes under the denomination of moveables what on the present occasion renders the division and distinction necessary is—that between money on the one part and all other things moveable on the other such will be found in several respects the diversity—that although between the sets of functions respectively exercisible in relation to them little if any difference will be found requisite to be made in name yet in the effects respectively produced upon the two sorts of subjectmatters by the exercise given to these same functions great difference will be seen to have place a difference which has for its cause the comparative simplicity of the sort of thing denominated money and the necessary diversifications which have place in the remaining part of the aggregate denominated things moveable expositive art    v occurrences—to this denomination will be found referrible all fictitious entities considered as presenting themselves to human notice that is to say in each instance the matter of fact consisting in their so presenting themselves expositive art    vi states understand quiescent states of persons or things and motions of the same—to one or other of these denominations will be found referrible every occurrence that requires to be taken for the subject of the hereinafter explained registrative function the exercise of which is composed of that of the hereinafter mentioned minutative and that of the conservative function and exceptions for special reasons excepted is followed by that     of the hereinafter explained publicative function expositive art    vii interior and exterior—to one or other of these denominations or both together will be found referrible every occurrence which to an eye placed in any office belonging to any department of the official establishment can present itself by interior understand those alone which have taken place in relation to some person or thing belonging to the department subdepartment or office in question by exterior every other occurrence and sort of occurrence whatsoever expositive art    viii important and unimportant—to one or other of these denominations will be found referrible every occurrence to which it can happen to be taken for the subject of registration as above by important understand of a nature to exercise an influence augmentative or diminutive on the net sum of happiness expositive art    ix relevant and irrelevant—understand to the purpose of registration as respectively applied to the service of the several abovementioned subdepartments and thence as presumed to the purpose of exercising an augmentative influence on the net sum of happiness as above instructional art    of such occurrences as are relevant an object of endeavour will be in the business of each subdepartment to maximize the number and value minimizing at the same time the number of such as are deemed irrelevant to the exercise given to the hereinafter mentioned statistic and registrative functions this distinction is more particularly applicable expositive art    x written including quasi written instruments by written instruments understand anythings immoveable or moveable which are distinguished from things at large by being applied to the purpose of giving expression to discourse real considered in themselves they are personal when considered in respect of the expression given by them to the thoughts of persons the information conveyed by them having thus the effect of personal information or say evidence expositive art    xi like the occurrences which they are capable of being employed in giving expression to those same instruments may be distinguished into interior and exterior important and unimportant and the important again into relevant and irrelevant distinguished in the same manner and for the same practical purposes expositive art  0 xii in so far as applied to the purposes of law and government they may be distinguished according to the departments and subdepartments to the service of which they are or ought to be respectively applied and in each individual case the person whose discourse they exhibit will be either a functionary or a nonfunctionary expositive art    xiii on the occasion of each such instrument there will be a person or set of persons by whom the discourse is addressed and a person or set of persons to whom the discourse is addressed expositive art    the instruments to which existence is given by an act of registration—by the exercise of the registrative function—might to a first glance present themselves as constituting an exception but on further observation being all of them destined for publication at a time either certain and immediate or eventual and more or less distant—these also will be seen to be addressed to a set of persons to wit those of whom the public at large is composed expositive art    xiv considered as addressed by or from a functionary in any department of the state to a functionary subordinate to himself or to a nonfunctionary subject on the occasion in question to his authority an instrument may be termed a mandate expositive art    transitory and naturally permanent—considered in respect of possible duration under one or other of these denominations will all mandates be found comprised expositive art    by transitory understand those in the case of which at the end of a certain length of time by some circumstance or other belonging to the nature of the act giving ulterior execution and effect to the mandate is rendered impossible as where the mandate having for its sole object the exercise of a certain act on a certain person or thing such exercise has been performed and the object of the mandate accomplished in this case the mandate may also be styled ephemeral expositive art    by naturally permanent mandates understand those the execution of which continues possible and bating revocation will continue actual for an indefinite length of time such are those which have for their     respective subjectmatters persons or things or the one and the other taken in classes of this kind for the most part are those mandates which emaning from the legislative authority are called laws expositive instructional art    note however that in case of necessity there is nothing to hinder the legislature from issuing mandates as above of the ephemeral kind as well as those of the naturally permanent kind bring hither forthwith this or that person or this or that thing of this transitory and ephemeral complexion will generally speaking be those mandates for example by the issuing of which exercise is given to the characteristic function of the legislative inquiry judicatory as per ch vi section    so again convey to this or that prison and cause to be enclosed and till further orders kept therein this or that person expositive instructional art    but in the ordinary course of things the situation of the person by whom utterance is given to a mandate of this ephemeral sort will be that of some functionary subordinate to the legislature say the prime minister say a minister especially the army minister the preventive service minister say lastly a judge expositive art    spontaneous and elicited considered in respect of its origin under one or other of these denominations will every mandate in and from whatsoever department issued be found comprised by spontaneous understand brought into existence without having been preceded and produced by application in any shape from any other quarter elicited when by such application ab extra brought into existence expositive art  0 when the mandate being elicited has been produced by an instrument composed of a portion of written discourse whether ready written or minuted down as uttered call the instrument an application instrument expositive art    ordinance this appellative is sometimes employed to designate any government mandate of the permanent kind but is most commonly the result of the exercise of legislative authority either in the supreme or in a subordinate grade in this case at any rate if in the supreme authority it is commonly considered as having for its synonym the word law in the present pannomion however need has been found for making exclusive application of the term law to a purpose in certain respects different to wit to the giving clearness to the idea designated by that word by employing it to designate exclusively a species of command and this in such sort as on no occasion to designate either more or less than the entire matter of one command whereas by the term ordinance is continually designated matter belonging to distinguishable commands in any number yet perhaps without embracing completely the whole matter of any one the employment thus given to the appellative law is in a word the designation of an abstract idea having for its object the marking out the distinction between the matter of a penal and that of a nonpenal code but for that detail this is not the proper place expositive art    rules regulations orders without any as yet settled distinction these words are commonly employed almost promiscuously to denote mandates emaning from any constitutional authority subordinate to that of the legislative—as also to mandates delivered by bodies incorporated and bodies or say associations unincorporated or even by ruling members of private families—for the designation of a set of mandates belonging to one and the same batch the word rules being employed sometimes in conjunction with the word regulations sometimes with the word orders thus confused and disorderly is as yet the phraseology of current practice expositive art    by the word rule a mandate of the permanent kind is more generally presented to view than a mandate of the ephemeral and transitory kind but in the confused language of english procedure it is equally and indiscriminately applied to both when employed to designate mandates of the permanent kind the word order is spliced on to it expositive instructional art    the distinction is not a mere speculative one in those established seats and sources of extortion and oppression in which what is called justice is sold to the relatively opulent few and denied to the relatively indigent many—no rule at the instance of an individual is ever issued gratis none but on payment of a price put upon it which price is called a fee and pocketed either by a judge or by some subordinate locatee of his whose profit is at the same time the profit of the judge elicited accordingly on the part of the judge not spontaneously issued is the mandate or other instrument in this case expositive art    rules and orders on the other hand are issued—not at the instance of any party to any suit but spontaneously by the judges themselves in whom the power of imposing without stint for their own benefit taxes on all suitors has lately been conferred     by the selfconstituted representatives of the people—trustees who on that same occasion thus officiated in such numbers in the two self conjoined characters of oppressors and depredators nevertheless intimate in this case is the connexion between the permanent sort of mandate and the ephemeral rules and orders are the remote and original instruments of the abuse rules the immediate and derivative expositive art    mandate it may be observed being a word not belonging to the vocabulary of english procedure—it has on the present occasion been taken from the body of the language for the purpose of infusing if possible a ray or two of light into the den of cacus on a particular occasion—and that rather a narrow one—a rule issuing from a common law judicatory is indeed called a mandamus but neither on that occasion nor any other is any employment given to the word mandate when issued under the notion of giving termination to a suit—a mandate receives in one sort of judicatory the name of a judgment in another that of a decree in any other stage of the cause a writ an order or else a rule in judicatories of other sorts it may perhaps be found to go by this or that other name nor yet without reason the more various the denomination the less intelligible instructional art    of the above explanations it will be seen that some part belongs more particularly to the judiciary than to this which is at present on the carpet—the administration department but in this place the subject being unavoidably begun upon—in this same place it was thought it might with some advantage be concluded instructional art    for giving expression to all these several mandates together with the responses expressive of the respectively appropriate answers or say returns—appropriate written forms will in the course of this pannomion as far as practicable be prepared to the whole of the generally applicable matter expression being given in printed forms while for the reception of the individually applying matter adequate spaces will of necessity be left in blank thus will uniformity and certainty be maximized expense minimized instructional art    in a more particular degree to the business of the judiciary department will the allcomprehensive formulary thus composed be found applicable and to the portion composed chiefly of mandates with their responses will therein be added that composed of conveyances and contracts instruments which while to the judge they serve in the character of eventual evidences serve in the meantime to the parties respectively interested in the character of so many particular laws the parties contributing the directive matter the legislature the sanctionative expositive art  0 by an arrangement understand the result whatever it be of any human act and consequently of any mandate emaning from the legislative or any other department of the state fictitious is the sort of entity of which this word is the name in so far as execution and effect have been given to any law or to any mandate of the prime minister—of a minister—or of a judge—an arrangement may be said to have been made by it the effects will as above be of the ephemeral or of the permanent kind according to the nature of the case expositive art    institutions and establishments both these fictitious entities are comprised under the generic appellative arrangement how far soever their respective imports may be from being determinate—most usually conveyed by the word institution seems to be the idea of an arrangement carried into effect without any concurrent operation on the part of government in any of its departments by the word establishment an arrangement carried into effect by government witness the allcomprehensive aggregate styled the official establishment with its several branches the official establishment—the vast fictitious receptacle in which are considered as included all functionaries instructional art    such are the subjectmatters which as will be seen require to be kept constantly in view on the occasion of the ordinances and mandates by the issuing of which those arrangements will be made by which the several functions will be created and at the same time allotted to the correspondent classes of persons thence denominated functionaries in section   statistic function exemplifications of the several different sorts of these subjectmatters will be found instructional art    uses looked to in and from this analysis are the following—   affording ground and invitation for judgments to be passed as to what if any portions of matter properly belonging to this part of the field of government have been omitted   by survey thus taken of the points of agreement and diversity between the several objects—maximizing on the part of the conceptions respectively formed and entertained in relation to them the desirable properties of clearness and correctness at the same time with comprehensiveness     enactive expositive art    first as to functions regarding persons these are— i the locative exercised by placing individuals in the several

the subjectmatters in question   minimization of the aggregate of evil producible by the disserviceable dispositions and accidents to which they stand respectively exposed instructional expositive art

other of those two intimately connected often undistinguishable ever beneficial     and so far as possible desirable purposes enactive expositive instructional art    of the sorts of things here in question some there are the need of which has place in every department and subdepartment whatsoever be the nature of the business of it others the description of which will be different according to the nature of the several branches of service carried on in the several subdepartments enactive expositive art    by the instruments of statistication and registration understand—the several portions of written discourse and other permanent signs if any employed in the exercise of those same functions they will be found distinguishable into—  the elementary to wit the several individual entries   the aggregate to wit the several register books in which the several entries are inserted enactive expositive art    of the sorts of things the need of which will have place in every department and subdepartment examples are as follows— i things unmoveable i the edifice or apartment in which the business of the department or subdepartment is carried on as to this see section    architectural arrangements ii the land if any attached to it ii things moveable iii   furniture and other such part of the moveable stock as are put to use otherwise than by rapid consumption iv   stationery ware that is to say instruments and materials employed in writing v   instruments and materials employed in lighting warming and cooling as to these several matters see section   statistic

require to be made by the appropriate functionary as to which of them exercise shall on that same occasion be given to expositive instructional art    of functions capable of thus coming into competition examples are the following— i under the procurative its several modes to wit the emptive the conductive the fabricative and the transreceptive expositive instructional art    of subjectmatters in relation to which such competition is most apt to have place examples are the following—  edifices and groundworks of various sorts   navigable vessels   shipstores of various sorts such as masts yards sails and cordage   arms and ammunition of various sorts in particular gunpowder expositive instructional art    ii—so likewise during the continuance of the custoditive will be apt to antagonize the applicative the reparative the transformative and the several modes of the eliminative to wit as above the venditive the leaseletting the transmissive and the ejective expositive instructional art    iii—so in the domain subdepartment in particular antagonizing functions will be the applicative and the leaseletting or say the mercedelocative expositive art  0 by the applicative understand in this case the function exercised by the keeping in hand the aggregate mass of the things which are the subjectmatters of the property in question—on account of the government and the public applying them to their respective uses—and on account of government and thereby of the public making in respect of money the appropriate expenditure and reaping therefrom the profits section v subordinationgrades instructional art i in the several administration subdepartments established by this code divers degrees or say grades in the scale of subordination will be found necessary necessary thereupon will be found expository matter under the subheads following—   subordination—its efficient causes   superordinateness and superiority—their difference   super and subordination—their grades   subordination—accountability—responsibility—their mutual relation   ulterior grades—efficient causes of demand for them   connexion between demand for grade and demand for pay expositive art   subordination supposes superordination subordinateness is a mode of inferiority superordinateness of superiority for the modes see art   expositive art   of subordination the efficient cause is—power viz of the superordinate in relation to the subordinate     instructional expositive art   modes of power necessary are the following—   power of direction corresponding function the directive   power of suspension corresponding function the suspensive   power of dislocation corresponding function the dislocative   power of punition corresponding function either the punitive or the punifactive   power of suppletion that is to say of fresh location in case of suspension or dislocation corresponding function the suppletive modes of power not necessarily but incidentally capable of being usefully employed are in this case powers transferential permanent or temporary to an equal or inferior grade and sistitive or say promotionstopping as to these see section  0 insubordination obviated and section    oppression obviated instructional art   in the hands in which the directive function is must be the suspensive and temporarily suppletive in the superordinates must be the permanently suppletive in the superordinates to a certain extent must be either the punitive or the punifactive in a judicial functionary must for this same purpose be the punitive to an ulterior extent instructional ratiocinative art   either with the directive the superordinate must have the suspensive function or he cannot be made responsible for misconduct on the part of the subordinate but the degree of the necessity will depend upon the nature of the work coupled with the distance between the grade of the directing functionary and that of his next superordinate instructional enactive art   in respect of punitive power the judiciary functionaries are superordinate to the administrational in all subdepartments not so in respect of directive suspensive dislocative transferential or suppletive expositive art   to the several grades in the scale of subordination one beneath another taking that of the minister for the highest and the common object of reference attach the several denominations following taken from the numeration table   ministers immediate subordinate call him prime subordinate correspondent grade of subordination grade the first   ministers immediate subordinates immediate subordinate call ministers bissubordinate grade the second   ministers immediate subordinates immediate subordinates immediate subordinate call ministers trissubordinate grade the third and so on through the numeration table instructional ratiocinative art   in the present case of necessity is the highest grade taken for the common object of reference in forming the scale of corresponding denominations for in every department the name of the highest will at all times be the same but the number of the grades—and consequently in this mode of denomination the name of the lowest—will continually be liable to be on the change expositive art  0 without and instead of the word superordinateness the word superiority would not on this occasion have answered the purpose superordinateness is not either identical or coextensive with superiority subordinateness with inferiority superordinateness is but one mode of superiority subordinateness of inferiority without superordinateness superiority may have place even by means of legal power as well as without being accompanied with legal power i by means of legal power to wit over a third person the third person being or not being in a state of subordinateness as to either or both the superiors having in relation to such third person more power than the inferior has expositive art    example if by directive and suspensive power a superordinate in the administrative department can produce more suffering on the part of a subordinate than in execution of a law bearing upon any part of his conduct the judge can—the superordinate member of the administrative will in so far be superior in power to the judge expositive art    so to an indefinite extent is superiority universally considered and spoken of as having place without being accompanied with legal power in any shape on the part of the superior over the inferior in this case the field and line of comparison may be the quantity possessed by the superior and inferior respectively of any desirable quality or possession examples of such qualities and possessions are as follows—   personal strength   personal beauty   moral accomplishments   intellectual accomplishments cognitional   intellectual accomplishments judicial   useful or graceful activity in any line   skill in pastimes of any sort   agreeableness in conversation and private intercourse say urbanity   opulence  0 factitious honour and dignity    influence of will on will    influence of understanding on understanding     instructional art    note here the distinction and difference between subordinateness with the attendant specific inferiority in respect of power on the one part and inferiority at large on the other part expositive art    example foreign relation department political missionary line scale of grades in rank beginning with the highest in no one of them correspondent subordinateness on the part of the inferior i rank   ambassador extraordinary   ambassador ordinary ii rank   envoy   minister plenipotentiary iii rank   minister   resident   chargé daffairs ratiocinative art    even in a representative democracy observance of these distinctions is necessary cause the need which under this as under every other form of government there is of keeping up communication with the governments of other states instructional expositive art    in the angloamerican union the highest grade for which provision is made in this line is that of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary it rests with those to whom it belongs to show why even the lowest grade might not as well suffice as under frederic styled the great of prussia an envoy or resident of the lowest grade the chevalier mitchel sufficed sufficed even at the court of london on which the monarch was dependent for his existence in that case the importance of the sending state and of its business to the state sent to was trusted to as a sufficient security for the requisite degree of attention with those to whom it belongs it rests to show why the case should be otherwise in the instance of the angloamerican democracy expositive ratiocinative art    correspondent and concomitant to subordinateness is accountableness by accountableness understand subjection to the obligation to exercise the statistic function as to which see section   as to operations performed by the subordinate in consequence of and compliance with the corresponding exercises given to the directive power of the superordinate for without such accountableness the directive power cannot be efficient expositive instructional art    such obligation on the part of the accountable subordinate supposes correspondent powers or rights on the part of the superordinate powers in so far as exercisable without recourse to a judge viz by means of suspensive power and punifactive power as per arts         right in so far as not exercisable but by means of recourse to a judge for the purpose of giving to the punifactive power the effect of punitive instructional art    of accountableness at large accountableness in respect of money is the mode most frequently brought to view instructional art  0 eventual obligation of making transfer of the subjectmatter is a natural and frequent but not necessary accompaniment of it expositive art    correspondent and concomitant to subordinateness and accountableness is responsibility efficient causes the same instructional ratiocinative art    by superordinateness no increase of pay is rendered

constant accountgiving need of subordinateness may have place on the part of     a functionary in whose instance there is no need of his taking constant direction from the superordinate to whom he is thus accountable uses of accountgiving in this case   securing constancy of supply—in respect of appropriate stock in all shapes and money necessary and sufficient for the branch of service under his

construction of fortifications   navy subdepartment appropriate operation construction of navigable vessels ships docks c   interior communication department appropriate operation construction of canals bridges tunnels c   domain subdepartment appropriate operation working of mines in all these cases the operations of planning and directing the execution will naturally be performed—not by the minister but by an appropriate skilled functionary not only to such his immediate superordinate will account be accordingly given by such his subordinate but also to the minister including a regular account of progress instructional art    by mere distance without need of any such determinate superiority as per art    in respect of appropriate skill a demand may be created for a grade in the scale of subordination for the purpose of direction expositive art    examples foreign relation department station of commercial state missionaries or say consuls for the service of two stations—at the same distance the one as the other from the foreign relation ministers official residence—no demand can have place for a consul at the one and a viceconsul at the other but between station and station suppose a certain distance—it may be necessary that under one such agent there may be one or more—taking direction from him and even eventually undergoing dislocation by him followed by temporary location of a substitute before those functions can respectively be exercised by the minister instructional expositive art  0 so perhaps it may happen in the case of the letterpost branch of the business of the interior communication ministers subdepartment examples   residence of the foreign relation minister in europe stations of consul and viceconsuls in america   residence of the foreign relation minister on the borders of the atlantic as in the angloamerican united states station of consul and viceconsuls on the borders of the pacific instructional ratiocinative art    to the finance minister in respect of his subdepartment in no other subdepartment is any one of its functionaries in a state of subordinateness but in relation to that same minister in every subdepartment all functionaries are in a state of accountableness of accountableness in regard to money and thence in regard to the state of receipts issues losses needs and expectancies as to money—that by his care in so far as depends upon him supply may at all times be at their command as to what is needed by them respectively in the shape of money in regard to appropriate stock in all shapes and thence in regard to the state of receipts issues losses needs and expectancies as to such appropriate stock—that by the same care supply may at all times be at their command as to what is needed by them respectively as to stock in those several appropriate shapes by means of money of money employed in the procurement of it instructional art    at the outset the legislature will in each subdepartment establish such grades of subordination as at that time appear needful adding to or subtracting from the number at all times in any such manner as experience or change of circumstances may indicate instructional expositive art    of subdepartments in which the number of grades needful will naturally be smallest examples are— i election minister—subordinates to him needful   election clerks at the several district election offices as per ch vi legislative section   election offices   votereceiving clerks at the several subdistrict election offices instructional expositive art    ii legislation minister what may happen is—that under him no class of functionaries may be needful other than that of writing clerks in addition to his own depute as per section   selfsuppletive function see art    instructional expositive art    of subdepartments in which the number of grades will necessarily be the greatest examples are— iii the army subdepartment for the efficient causes of the demand see ch x defensive force section   branches section   0   stipendaries who and section   promotion instructional art    where as to this matter the end of government is maximization of official expense coupled with indifference as to official aptitude—the number of the highestpaid grades will be maximized for maximization of the expense expositive art    example from the english army subdepartment   superordinate of the highest grade supreme commanderinchief—the king   subordinate of the highest grade the secretary for colonies and war professional functionaries   bissubordinate

this same matter the end of government is maximization of official aptitude coupled with minimization of expense the number of the highestpaid grades will be minimized for minimization of the expense

the form of a board accordingly no otherwise than conjunctly number   professional functionaries   subordinates of the highest grades captains titles when in the command of divers vessels composing a squadron—as in the english service commodores admirals of any grade not one instructional expositive art    the subdepartment in which the number of the grades will naturally be the least is the legislation ministers under him decidedly necessary it will perhaps be seen are no other functionaries than a registrar and under him writing clerks in indefinite number but for the assistance of this minister either in the capacity of deputes or immediate subordinates functionaries in any number may be found necessary necessary according to the magnitude of the state and the nature and quantity of the business allotted to that same subdepartment instructional ratiocinative art    to every considerable directive     situation an indispensable subordinate will be a registrar but in that office the mode and degree of subordination requires a mode of limitation that has not place in any other as to omission it must not be in the power of a registrars immediate superior whose acts he records to compel whether in a direct or indirect way the omission of any apt entry in an indirect way for example by so taking up his time with useless or needless entries as not to leave time sufficient for needful ones as to insertion—compelling the insertion of false or otherwise improper entries—the mischief cannot be near so great as that of compelling the omission of true and appropriate ones for in this case the misconduct presents to view its own evidence all that the registrar will have to prove is—the fact of the compulsion and of this fact the entry may accompany the other entries instructional art    wheresoever for the despatch of the business belonging to an official situation need has place for writing in greater quantity than the occupant of that situation can himself perform within the time requisite—need has place for a writing functionary styled a clerk by whom for this purpose direction cannot but be taken from the other and firstmentioned functionary in every subdepartment the grade of writingclerk will in this way be the lowest as will that of minister be the highest whatsoever be the number of intermediate grades instructional ratiocinative art    but it follows not that the pay of the directing must be greater than that of the writing functionary the reverse will generally be the case for without pay the writingclerk having no power can scarcely ever have any adequate inducement for bestowing his labour whereas the functionary to whom his office gives power may in many cases as per art    find in that same power alone an adequate inducement instructional art    note the distinction between the number of grades and the number of official situations necessary instructional expositive art    instance the finance subdepartment in that subdepartment for every office at which revenue is collected a subordinate with a correspondent registration system as per ch viii section  0 will naturally be indispensable while in all those instances the grade of these several functionaries in the scale of subordination may be the same instructional ratiocinative art    rule as to the proper number of grades in a subdepartment unless for special and preponderant need—between the grade occupied by the functionary by whom the course of operation is carried on and the minister of the subdepartment establish no intermediate grade reason of every such intermediate grade necessary concomitants are—complication delay vexation and expense section vi selfsuppletive function enactive art   lest the business of his office should at any time though it were but for a day be at a stand—to every minister as to the prime minister belongs the power of selfsupply with the obligation of keeping it in exercise it is exercised by the location of an atalltimesdislocable depute with powers and duties as per ch viii prime minister section   selfsuppletive function arts            0 enactive art   in so far as of the several ministerial situations as per section   ministers and subdepartments union shall have place—the minister will at his discretion locate one depute to serve in all or distribute them in such manner as he sees most convenient amongst deputes more than one enactive art   within  days after his own location a minister is expected to make such location as per art   and thereafter immediately upon the dislocation of any such depute to locate a succeeding one enactive art   the instrument of location with the year month and day of the month will be signed by the principal and in token of acceptance by the depute enactive art   of every such instrument exemplars as per ch viii prime minister section  0 registration system will be disposed of as follows   kept in the registrars office of the subdepartment one   transmitted to the prime ministers office one   kept by the locator one   delivered to and kept by the locatee one enactive art   in case of emergency—created for example by sudden calamity or hostility—lest time for acceptance be wanting a minister may by appropriate instruments constitute deputes occasional in any number without any such acceptance a second to serve in     default of the first a third in default of the first and second and so on but only in case of emergency will he execute any such instrument and on his responsibility he will cancel it having if issued called it in so soon as the emergency has ceased expositive art   examples of cases producing a demand for the service of a depute permanent or occasional are the following   a sudden influx of business with particular need of despatch   infirmity whether of body or mind on the part of the principal rendering him unapt either altogether or in part for the performance of the business   need of his attendance at a place where the business cannot accompany him without preponderant inconvenience for instance when absent from office on an inspection progress as per section   or when on attendance in the legislation chamber as per section   enactive art   locable in the situation of minister depute permanent are all those and those alone who are so in that of minister principal as per section    locable who enactive art   dislocable or suspendible at any time is the minister depute by the principal as likewise by any of the authorities by which the principal is dislocable as per section    dislocable how and this without the judicial forms such as those made requisite in and by section    oppression obviated enactive art  0 exceptions excepted this same power of selfsupply together with the obligation of exercising it and the dislocation and suspension powers as above attached to it—will be possessed—not only by the minister of every subdepartment but by the several functionaries occupying the several situations in the several grades subordinate to that of minister enactive instructional art    exceptions are—   in the army subdepartment the offices belonging to the military or say professional branch   so in the navy subdepartment   such offices if any such there should be in the case of which by special reasons it shall have been made appear to the legislature that this institution is unsuitable instructional ratiocinative art    beneficial effects resulting from the allotment of this function to functionaries belonging to the administrative department are the following—   number of functionaries at all times sufficient at no time redundant   frugality secured by exclusion of pay for superfluous and needless number of principal unpaid functionaries   frugality secured by the gratuitous obtainment of all but one of whatsoever number of functionaries may happen to be respectively needed for the several offices instructional ratiocinative art    no ground has place for any such apprehension as that of a deficiency in the number of apt persons ready and willing to serve as deputes in any office in which there are persons serving as principals reasons are—   of the offices to which either power or honour in any shape is attached—in few if in any would be found it is believed any deficiency in the number of individuals whose services remuneration in both these shapes or even in no more than one of them would be sufficient to engage without remuneration in a pecuniary shape either in possession or expectancy and proportioned in value to whatever remuneration there is in possession will be remuneration in expectancy always understood that because remuneration in these nonpecuniary shapes might suffice for official service with the laxity of attendance which under other systems is to a great extent tolerated it would not follow that remuneration in these shapes would suffice for procuring the closeness of attendance which under the present system is uniformly exacted   in point of experience generally speaking whatsoever profitseeking occupation persons of adult ages are engaged in in the situation of masters—other persons in adequate number are in a nonadult age ready and willing to learn and carry on in the situation of apprentices in every office the relation of a depute to the principal is analogous to that of an apprentice to a master in a nonofficial occupation section vii statistic function bissection the first all books together instructional art   this section has for its object the bringing together in the aggregate all the several operations which in the exercise given to the statistic and recordative functions as applied to the business of the administrative department     can require to be performed the operations themselves and thence the subjectmatters in relation to which the instruments by the help of which and the official places in which those same operations are carried on for any such purpose as that of original information many of the particulars which it will here be necessary to present to view will be apt to appear and indeed would be needless and useless none however are there to which incidentally it may not happen to be found needful and useful for the purpose of reminiscence this distinction should never be out of view moreover as to information between the needful and the needless the distinction will always be in great measure not absolute but relative that which is needless to one person being needful to another and to complete a whole and render every part intelligible particulars which taken each of them by itself would be altogether trivial may to a considerable extent be necessary instructional expositive art   in regard to this function and the exercise to be given to it topics for consideration are as follows—   objects or say ends in view uses and thence purposes of the several operations in this as in every other part of the business of this and the several other departments enumerated in section   art   expressed in the most general terms these objects may be distinguished into—  maximization of appropriate

produce and warrant censure or at least tutelary suspicion at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal and in this case as well as the other the publicity given to the past transgressions will

the burthen of the expense call it moreover the receptacleemploying or for shortness the receptacular or otherwise the mimetic mode receptacleemploying because in making the entries indication is given of the fixed receptacle say yard or building and in the case of the building the interior subreceptacles one within another—say apartment closet platform shelf chest of drawers and drawer into

of the outermost fixed receptacle as above with the several interior fixed receptacles and subreceptacles down to the innermost contained in it fixed in contradistinction to any such packages as it is enclosed in while in its passage to or from or while in the official warehouse use—presenting at all times and to any number of persons at once in any number of different places at once a more adequate conception of the state of the moveable stock in all its parts than could otherwise be obtained ratiocinative art   usefulness of this auxiliary mode of registration proportioned to the quantity variety and frequency of entrance and exit on the part of the aggregate of the articles composing the species of stock here in question—will to each directing functionary be the importance of his having at all times in his mind a conception and to that end before his eyes a display—of the quantity he has need of and of the correspondent supply he has at hand or at command the things themselves no such functionary can have always before his eyes still less can the whole number of such other persons by whom it would be of use that such information should be possessed but of the receptacles in which at each given point of time the articles are respectively stowed—every such functionary whose business has need of it may at all times have before his eyes an appropriate imitative substitute—superficial or solid draught or model and by reference therein made to the original a conception of the quantity and situation of the thing therein contained a conception in some

not so of those inmost and other interior fixed receptacles in which—whether unpacked or in their several appropriate packages or say moveable receptacles packed—the several moveable articles of the stock are lodged in present practice to the business of very few of the whole number of the hereproposed subdepartments does even the firstmentioned usage extend itself in no instance perhaps does it go beyond the area or exterior building in no instance does it extend to the suboffices of the subdepartment in question or to any offices belonging to any other subdepartment to no such office how intimate soever the connexion between subdepartment and subdepartment and how dependent soever for its success the business of one subdepartment may be on information respecting the stock possessed by this or that other instructional ratiocinative art    in the hereproposed mode—by the extension of the imitative mode in each instance to the inmost fixed receptacle—the places in which in their several sorts and quantities the moveable articles of stock are lodged are at all times presented to view in that same more vividly and promptly expressive mode while to the information thus afforded any degree of extent which the business is deemed to require may be given by the manifold system in this as in all other cases instructional ratiocinative art    thus far as to original disposition now as to changes in present practice—of the changes continually taking place in the quantity of the articles stowed in each building or apartment no otherwise than by verbal description is any conception ever conveyed in the hereproposed receptacular mode all such changes may at all times receive immediate exhibition and communication as per art   instructional art    subdepartments to the business of which this same auxiliary mode of registration and continual intercommunication is most obviously assistant examples—   army subdepartment   navy subdepartment   ordnance bissubdepartment respectively included in those subdepartments   finance subdepartment to wit on the occasion of the demands made on it by the abovementioned subdepartments   health subdepartment to wit in respect of the medical stock surgical apparatus included instructional ratiocinative art    moreover to every subdepartment will belong a continually increasing stock of written instruments styled in one word papers and in relation to these papers in each subdepartment to the minister seated in his headoffice there will be a convenience in possessing at all times by means of the hereproposed mode of indication the most perfect conception possible of the aggregate mass of these documents in the several suboffices under his direction instructional art    mode of adapting this receptacular mode of registration to the two distinguishable cases to which as above it presents itself as applicable case   by its bulk the article not exposed to ordinary theft and by its nature little exposed to spontaneous deterioration by weather receptacle in this case no other than an open area or say yard articles thus stowed examples—   navigable vessels   timber in readiness to be employed in the construction either of navigable vessels or edifices   stones and bricks for edifices and groundworks   cannon cannon balls mortars and bombs instructional art    modes of adapting to the purpose of appropriate delineation the draught of a yard thus employed the plan being delineated in the ordinary mode divide the whole surface into squares of the same size as often as any article or aggregate of articles is received into the yard—when entry of such receipt is made in the journal book show on the draught the squares in which the article is deposited so on issuing the squares left vacant instructional art    by any one of a variety of devices—the changes made in the stock of the yard might as soon as made be represented in such manner as to be intelligible without the help of words as in a map the portions of territory are by lines and colours the difference   0 is—that whereas in a map the picture is always the same in the appropriate draught it will be frequently varied and continually variable in the draught the squares will be left in blank the boundary lines alone expressed for the purpose of the registrative operation provide—for the covering of each such square or aggregate of squares a piece of card of a size exactly to cover it each card with a pin in the centre to lift it on and off by on each card the sort of article it is destined to express is expressed by its image and to the several different images may moreover be allotted so many different colours in this way for example may be distinguished from each other—cannon cannon balls mortars and bombs different calibres expressed by figures exhibiting in the usual mode the weight or diameter of the missiles in this way a deficiency or redundancy would be manifested in a more impressive manner than by words thus affording a correspondently greater probability of a timely remedy in the margin of the draught the change will be registered by verbal description as in the ordinary mode instructional art    case   the sort of article requiring an enclosed exterior fixed receptacle such as a warehouse with or without interior subreceptacles one within another for example apartments closets piles of shelves chests of drawers fixed boxes or platforms in this case the plans and elevations in the ordinary mode serve for the exterior of the building with its several apartments and for the closets if any within the several apartments for exhibition of the abovementioned innermost receptacles ulterior and appropriate sections and elevations will in this case require to be added in the draught in each such receptacle if large enough the name of the sort of article for the reception of which it is destined may be expressed in the appropriate compartment as above if not large enough instead of the name the figure or figures expressive of a number in the margin will in this case be given the name with that same number prefixed to it images and colours may be employed in this case as in the others as above instructional enactive art    note that on every change made in the number dimensions or mode of partition of the several interior fixed receptacles—platforms shelves drawers c—a fresh draught will require to be made to wit in the manifold mode exemplars transmitted in this as in other cases instructional art  0 things not capable of being stowed but in moveable receptacles in which they may be conveyed to deposited in and conveyed from the fixed receptacles to the reception of these same moveable receptacles will the several inmost fixed receptacles be to be adapted examples—   drinks and other matters in a liquid state   provisions and other matters in a solid state stowed with liquids for preservation and conveyance   matter in the shape of grain or powder   articles natural or artificial so circumstanced as to be usually stowed and indicated in an aggregated way by number weight or measure as gunflints nails belts locks and keys c   piece goods of all sorts   medicines and most of the ingredients employed in the composition of medicines instructional art    particular case in which this receptacular mode of registration as applied to articles kept in warehouses may perhaps be employed to advantage example— for all the offices belonging to all the several subdepartments materials of writing and delineation as well in the ordinary mode as in the manifold mode will at all times be needed exceptions excepted a stock for use whether procured by fabrication or purchase will need to be kept in a central office naturally under the direction of the finance minister exception may be—where by reason of vicinity to the several places of manufacture the expense of conveyance from them to the central office and from the central office to the several offices in which supply is needed may in part be saved the article being conveyed from the place of manufacture to the office where the need is without passing through the central office instructional art    materials requiring registration in the mode in question in this case examples—   for ordinary writing—paper pens and ink   for manifold writing—  appropriate paper   appropriate silk

greater than one answer into the custody of one person and no more reasons   as the number of coresponsibles increases the effective force and efficiency of the responsibility decreases as to this see

many who are incapable of participating in the benefit productions of the fine arts for instance and books the uselessness of which is demonstrated by their rarity the expense however is in this third case but as a drop of water to the ocean compared with what it is in the two former and the mischief consists—not so much in the absolute expense as in the preference given to it over needful expenses leaving thereby the correspondent evils in a state of continuance and increase—and in its operation in the character of an instrument of corruption by means of the official situations carved out of it and in that of an instrument of delusion contributing by the awestriking quality of the object—to beget and maintain a habit of blind and unscrutinizing submission on the part of the subjectmany ii

service of the public certain supplies therein mentioned are ordered to be procured enactive art   exceptions excepted—for the service     belonging to any administration subdepartment to the legislature alone it belongs on each occasion to issue for the procurement of a supply in any shape a procuration mandate enactive art   exceptions are the several occasions on which by some precedent act of the legislature authority for issuing procuration mandates for the purposes and to the effect therein mentioned has been given to the prime minister or a minister within his subdepartment ratiocinative art   exercising this function without authority from the legislature any functionary would to the extent of the supply ordered by him be acting as legislator to the amount of the expense thereof he would be imposing a tax instructional ratiocinative art   the person by whom such indication is afforded will naturally be a functionary and he the functionary for the service of whose office the article in question is needed in addition to whatsoever may be the function to the exercise of which the supply in question is needful—now comes the additional function distinct from and in its exercise preparatory to that of the procurative function necessarily called into exercise—call it the requisitive enactive art   accordingly in so far as for any supply that comes to be needed no sufficient procuration mandate remaining in force has been issued by the legislature—exercise will be given to this same requisitive function expositive art   by the requisitive function understand that to which exercise is given by a functionary when conceiving that for the due exercise of some other function belonging to him the faculty of giving direction to the labour of some person or that of making application of some thing to the public service is necessary—he makes application to the legislature or to some other functionary in whose power it is to place the article of supply at his disposal for that purpose expositive art   name of the written instrument by which such application is made a requisitional instrument or for shortness a requisition requisitor the functionary by whom—requisitee the functionary to whom it is addressed expositive art   the procuration mandate in this case not being valid or attainable otherwise than by means of a correspondent

certainly be introduced enactive art    the places from which requisition instruments will be issued are the several offices in which for their several businesses the need of the subjectmatters required is deemed to have place of all such need indication will at all times be given by means of the mimographical documents as per section   statistic function bissection   art   with or without the aid of the inspectionvisits instructional enactive art    of the heads under which the matter of a requisition instrument will in all cases be contained examples are as follows—   supplies needed

statistical matter in the hands of the functionaries to whom in each case it will belong—to reject simply confirm or substitute as above enactive art    such procuration mandate will be transmitted to the requisitor either immediately or through the medium of the finance minister as the case may require enactive art    to the minister of each subdepartment it belongs at all times on his responsibility to transmit to the prime minister appropriate and timely requisition instruments for the procurement of such supplies the need of which for the business of his subdepartment has from time to time come to have place instructional expositive art    service permanent and occasional or say ordinary and extraordinary in each several instance in which the need of an article or aggregate of articles of supply is regarded as having place—it will belong either to the permanent or to the occasional branch of the service either to the ordinary or to the extraordinary branch instructional art    at the commencement of this code the legislature will have to make provision of the first supply provided call it the outset supply on that occasion it will be considered—whether any and if any what part of that which is provided shall be distinguished from the rest by any such denomination as the occasional or say extraordinary supply instructional expositive art    the particulars of the outset supply being settled the legislature will determine and declare—at what point of time the provision thus made shall for the first time be renewed say at the expiration of the then current solar year and thenceforward at the expiration of each ensuing solar year if the point of time be any other than the last moment of the solar year and the recurrence of the renewal annual—here then will be constantly employed and necessarily referred to a sort of year different from the solar call it the service year if in this case to outweigh the burthen of the complication there be any preponderant convenience—any subdepartment or any office may accordingly have its own service year different from that of every other office as well as from the solar year name of the day on which for the service of the then next ensuing year whether solar year or service year the consideration of the supply to be provided for that same ensuing year commences say the general supply day instructional art  0 on this occasion the legislature will determine and declare—whether in the interval between the time of this first supply and that of the next provision may to any and what amount by any and what functionary or functionaries be made and in each case if yes whether by spontaneous mandate or not otherwise than in consequence of a requisition instrument declaring in this case from what office or offices for the obtainment of the corresponding procurement mandate it may be addressed instructional expositive art    diversifications which on this occasion the nature of the case admits of are the following—   procurement spontaneous—that is to say effected without antecedent requisition namely by an occasional mandate issued by the legislature and directed either to the prime minister or to this or that minister or subordinate of any grade belonging to the administration department and in this last case either directly or through the medium of the prime ministers office   in virtue of appropriate general and permanent powers conferred by the legislature procurement mandate spontaneous emanating from and issued by the prime minister and addresssd to such subordinate functionary or functionaries as the nature of the case is thought by him to indicate   the like from the minister of any subdepartment   the like from a subordinate of the minister in any subdepartment enactive ratiocinative art    if in this way from any office a procurement mandate whether spontaneously issued or in consequence of requisition be sent down to an office of any other than the next immediate grade exemplars will at the same time be transmitted to the intermediate office or offices reasons—   that in case of neglect or delay compliance with the mandate may be enforced by the intermediate superordinate   that no functionary may without his knowledge be divested of any part of the stock personal or real of which he may have need and for which he is responsible instructional art    on the occasion of the first general supply day that ensues after provision made of the outset supply—the legislature will have before its eyes or at its command the result in all its parts and elements of the statistic and registration system carried on during that interval as per section   statistic function it will thereby on appropriate and substantial ground be in a condition to draw a more determinate line between the ordinary     and all extraordinary service—and to determine—by what offices if by any and for what purpose procurement mandates may be issued without antecedent and correspondent requisition and from and to what offices requisition instruments may be transmitted in such sort that from those to which they are transmitted correspondent procurement mandates may be issued and followed by the transmission of the correspondent supplies when accordingly procured instructional art    of the considerations by which on these occasions the determination of the legislature will naturally be guided examples are as follows—   the importance of the branch of service in question   the quantity of the stock in whatsoever shape of which in the interval need is capable of having place and likely to have place   the degree of suddenness of which the demand is susceptible   the expense necessary for procurement note that by the uninterruptedness of the labours of the legislator as per ch vi legislature section    attendance—the latitude of the powers necessary to be given for procurement as above with or without antecedent requisition will of course be minimized instructional art    to a subordinate scarcely will the importance of the service afford any sufficient reason for giving the power of procurement in any other case than that in which by his waiting for authority from his superordinate the performance of the service to which the article was necessary would have been prevented or materially delayed instructional art    examples of cases in which in a subordinate situation power of selfsupply as above may be necessary are the following—   military necessity in the land defensive service   so in the sea defensive service see ch x defensive force instructional expositive art    modes of procurement as per section   functions in all and section   statistic function bissection   art    exemplificational art    cases in which between mode and mode as to certain articles competition or say antagonization may have place examples are as follows—   army and navy subdepartments requisites arms and ammunition antagonizing modes fabrication and purchase   navy subdepartment requisites navigable vessels antagonizing modes fabrication purchase and hire   health subdepartment requisites various medicines antagonizing modes fabrication or say preparation and purchase   all subdepartments requisites appropriate edifices antagonizing modes fabrication purchase and hire and as to fabrication antagonizing modes government account and contract instructional art    to the legislature in regard to each subjectmatter or class of subjectmatters it will be matter of consideration—whether of itself to determine between the several antagonizing modes after receiving appropriate information by reports from the subdepartment to which it belongs—or to commit the determination to the prime minister or the prime minister of the subdepartment to the service of which the subjectmatter in question belongs always observing that as the act of procurement by a functionary without authority from the legislature involves in it as per art   a power of taxation so in an indirect way does the determination as between two different modes to wit by determination in favour of the more expensive in preference to the less expensive instructional art  0 for giving expression to the several sorts of instruments employed in the exercise of the function as per section   functions in all art    by direction from and under the care of the legislature—appropriate and apt formulas will be framed useful qualities therein to be specially aimed at—clearness conciseness uniformity legibility and cheapness expositive art    by clearness understand exclusion of obscurity and ambiguity expositive art    by conciseness understand exclusion of all needless words for example complimentary phrases instructional art    under this head will be considered the employment to be given to abbreviations as per section   statistic bissection   instead of words at length care being taken that they be sufficiently and promptly intelligible to all who have need to read them instructional art    rules for uniformity as to expression rule   for giving expression to the same ideas employ on each occasion the same words rule   for giving expression to different ideas employ on each occasion different words instructional ratiocinative art    uniformity as to paper or other     physical ground of the signs employed—exceptions for special reasons excepted—to every exemplar written manifoldwise as per ch viii prime minister section  0 registration system—give the same dimensions that in every office exemplars may be put together in form of a book in this particular as between office and office and book and book no variation but for special cause instructional art    legibility cheapness for these conjunct purposes printing will of course be employed in so far as by reason of the number of exemplars needed they are more effectually accomplished than by writing manifoldwise instructional art    stamping for saving labour and time it will be for consideration—whether in any and if in any in what cases to employ it instead of writing for instance where in a formula of which the greater part has been expressed by printing expression is to be given to signatures such as names and dates the expression of which may require separate application to each several sheet regard will on this occasion be had to elaborateness of the figure as a means of rendering forgery more difficult and rare a subject for consideration and inquiry may be whether the human countenance as exemplified in the person of some extensively known individual

exercise given to it migration from the official residence of the functionary in question has place this function may be styled the visitative function considered in respect of a number of visits successively made each in a different place the visits or say visitations thus performed may be styled progresses considered in respect of the form of the line of march described by the making of such progresses they may be styled circuits enactive art   in the exercise of his inspective function once at least in every year and as much oftener as need may require and home business permit so far as may be in person as to the rest each time by a depute permanent or occasional spontaneously or by direction as to time and place from the prime minister the minister of each subdepartment will visit the several offices and any such other places as lie within his charge instructional expositive art   uses thence objects and purposes of this visitation system examples—   securing execution and effect to the system of statistication registration and publication ordained by ch viii prime minister section  0 and section    and by this chapter section   statistic function to wit in relation to each individual subjectmatter of registration—that is to say persons immoveables moveables money or occurrences and whatsoever class it belongs ascertaining whether it ought to be registered and if yes whether it has been registered and if yes how far the mode of registration is conformable to the existing ordinances   in relation to each office inspected—doing what the nature of the case admits of towards providing a supply as adequate as may be for any such deficiency as shall have been observed in respect of the execution and effect which should be given as above to that end taking personal cognizance of any such appointed subjectmatters of registration and publication as shall either have been left altogether unregistered or unpublished as the case may be—or not registered or

otherwise than from the report of other persons cannot be or shall not have been rendered adequate   taking cognizance of the degree of appropriate aptitude absolute and comparative in its several

different purposes and on different     occasions—inspection visits and even progresses and circuits may by different ministers in various numbers be made to one and the same establishment public or private reasons uses thence objects and purposes of this arrangement   for different purposes the same establishment it will be seen may require to be inspected by so many different ministers in order to their being inquired into for those several purposes and contemplated in so many different points of view in each case with reference to different branches or even the same branch of the public service   by the cognizance thus taken in relation to the same subjectmatter by divers functionaries independent of each other—the information furnished by each will serve as a check upon the conduct pursued and information furnished by every other   by this conjunction no collision of authority will be produced the directive function being in each subdepartment in the hands of one person alone—no obstruction need be afforded to it by any exercise given to the inspective and statistic function by whatsoever number of different functionaries exercised in relation to one and the same object instructional ratiocinative art   exceptions excepted—for the second of the above reasons it will be for the care of the prime minister so to arrange the visits of the several ministers in such sort that no two shall perform any inspection visit at the same time one with the other exception is—where for some special preponderant and declared reason—it appears to him that for mutual explanation information and discussion the purpose requires that by two or more members by whom by his direction a visit is made at the same time the inspective function should be exercised by them in each others company and thereby at the same time instructional art   cases in which the good of the service may require that by the minister of two or more different subdepartments one and the same establishment should be visited examples—   army minister and navy minister subjectmatters requiring inspection by each with a view whether to conjunct or separate service examples—artillery ammunition and small arms note that as to the adequacy of the aggregate of the supply the two interests are here united in case of deficiency antagonizing   army minister navy minister and preventive service minister

ends in view the administering the benefit of education in conjunction with relief to indigence especial care of health being alike needful in the two firstmentioned sorts of establishments   domain minister and every other minister to wit in so far as the land edifices and groundworks employed in these several branches of the public service belong to the public domain   all the several other ministers and the finance minister in consideration that it is from or through his hands that every expenditure of money and thence of moneys worth must come upon the expenditure of every other subdepartment without exception his care is a needful and indispensable check instructional art   the legislature the prime minister and the minister will have in consideration the advantage derivable in some cases from the use of chance for the purpose of securing unexpectedness to inspection visits and thence constancy of good order in the places visited for the mode of taking the decision of chance see section    locable who supplement instructional ratiocinative art   to the constant application of this security to establishments under government management—the addition liable to be made to the quantity of time spent on the road by fortuitous migrations made without regard to distance would by expenditure of time and money oppose such a body of disadvantage as would leave no adequate prospect of compensation such being the security afforded in all shapes by the universal registration and publication system coupled with the correspondent facility afforded to individuals for the   0 indication of imperfection and abuse in all shapes but on this or that occasion this instrument of security presents itself as being even in this case capable of being employed with advantage by the abovementioned constituted authorities instructional ratiocinative art  0 establishments under private management as per art   are those in regard to which the service capable of being rendered by it is most conspicuous the light of publicity not being otherwise capable of being thrown with adequate intensity upon those minor objects instructional ratiocinative art    yet not even in this case is the advantage clear of opposite disadvantage on the one side stands the advantage derivable from unpreparedness on the part of inspectees but this case supposes disorder already to have place the remedy suppressive only not preventive on the other side stands the advantage derivable from preparedness on the part of eventual accusers true it is that in the form of written discourse accusation is open to all at all times but it is by indication of individual facts that accusation will in this case be performed for this operation to some persons written discourse to others oral is the most convenient instrument but those to whom oral is so will always be the most numerous mutes excepted all are able to speak but to a purpose such as that in question few in comparison will in any state of things be able to write section x officially informative function instructional ratiocinative art   as in all private so in all public business necessary on every occasion to apt operation is appropriate and correspondently extensive information or say evidence what can we reason asks the poet but from what we know with correspondent and equal propriety—to reason he might have added act expositive art   to the import of the word evidence the word information adds a reference made to some mind as being one into which the evidence has been received in english practice with a view to the business of the administration department information is throughout the word most commonly employed in the business of the judiciary department the word evidence and not the word information is in most cases employed the word information and not the word evidence being employed in some cases in those to wit in which for insuring veracity in what is uttered no security is applied but in the judiciary department wheresoever it has not been the desire of the constituted authorities that falsehood should be elicited as in the cases where a disguised licence for encouragement of mendacity has been purposely granted some known security for veracity has of course been applied as to the mendacity licence see the procedure code vol ii and scotch reform letter vol v instructional expositive art   of whatsoever a man knows whatsoever portion he has not derived from his own experience or observation he must have received from some other person if received from another person it must by that other person have been furnished or say communicated expositive art   if communicated it must have been so either in compliance with application for that purpose by some other person or without any such application in this last case the operation by which it is furnished is termed spontaneous expositive art   when on the part of the possessor of the information—the possession of it has not been preceded by any operation other than that of concurrence for that purpose in so far as correspondent action is necessary with a person by whom it has been communicated and with whom the communication of it has in so far originated—it is said to be received expositive art   when on the part of such possessor—it has been preceded and produced by application made by him to the person by whom it has been communicated to him and from him as above received—in this case it has been extracted to wit from the person by whom it has been communicated and in both cases as per ch vi section    arts     it has been elicited instructional art   so obvious upon the bare mention of it does the necessity of all this appear that the mention will be apt to appear useless and frivolous but upon a closer view it will be found that of this necessity the perception has to a great extent been generally wanting and that not only has it been an object of sinister policy with legislators to obtain for themselves the information necessary for their own particular and sinister purposes while the information necessary to be communicated to and for the benefit of the community at large has been studiously kept concealed—but for want of due attention to the necessity they have everywhere to a greater or less extent     left themselves destitute of that portion of information by the possession of which service would have been rendered to their own particular and sinister interest instructional expositive art   in ch vi section    legislative inquiry judicatory—on allotting to the legislature its several functions it became necessary to allot to it the informationelicitative function in which is included the extractive and for that purpose to organize the institution on that occasion denominated a legislative inquiry judicatory in ch xii judiciary collectively and the succeeding chapters relating to the judiciary department and thereafter in the procedure code directions will be seen given for the elicitation of appropriate information under the name of evidence for the origination and guidance of the exercise given to the judicial function instructional expositive art   what the present occasion calls for is—to provide the information necessary for the apt exercise of the powers allotted to the administrative department and for that purpose to determine how far such information shall by the functionaries of the several grades be spontaneously furnished to the other functionaries belonging to that same department respectively as well as to the legislature in addition to that which is conveyed constantly and of course by the exercise given to the registration and publication system as to this see section    informationelicitative function and ch viii prime minister section  0    instructional expositive art  0 so likewise how far and by what means in addition to the supply thus afforded it shall on that occasion be elicited as to this see section    informationelicitative function art   to    enactive instructional art    exceptions excepted—by the several ministers information of all occurrences—relevant and with relation to the business of their several offices adequately material—will it is hereby ordained be furnished as well to the legislature as to the prime minister enactive instructional art    the exceptions will be made by the legislature consideration had of the encumbrance and expense of registration and custody and determination will be made accordingly—what part if any of such information shall not unless called for be transmitted to the legislature and the prime minister respectively in so doing it will take care that to each of the two authorities all such information as is necessary as a ground for its habitual action shall be habitually transmitted enactive art    to the several ministers such information will be furnished by the several functionaries respectively belonging to the several official situations subordinate to theirs instructional art    in what cases from this or that office information shall be furnished—to this or that other office of a grade superior to that of its immediate superordinate—at the same time with or in lieu of the furnishing it to such immediate superordinate—the legislature will determine regard being had to the businesses of the several subdepartments instructional art    by whatsoever need of the exercise of the officially informative function has place as above—is produced the correspondent need of the exercise of the correspondent informationelicitative function as to which see the next section section    expositive art    correspondent and correlative to the officially informative as per art   is the informationreceptive function the two functions being not only in their general nature thus correspondent and correlative but on each individual occasion accidents excepted the exercise of the former being accompanied or followed by the exercise of the other instructional art    by an exercise given to the officiallyinformative function suppose adequate ground made for the exercise of any other function to which it is or is designed to be subservient—correspondent exercise given to the correspondent receptive function is a matter of fact which must have been established but for this purpose presumptive evidence arising out of the nature of the case will without additional express evidence be in general found sufficient to produce adequate credence expositive art    example a letter sent by the letterpost cannot by him to whom it is addressed be acted upon unless and until it has been received by him but for the purpose of judging whether what he has done since the time at which it ought to have been received by him has been right or no—the presumption except in case of special reason for belief of the     contrary must on each occasion be—that it has been received instructional ratiocinative art    but forasmuch as comparatively speaking small indeed is the number of cases in which it cannot happen that by accident expectation how wellgrounded soever has been frustrated—hence in every case in which official action has for its sole ground such presumptive evidence care will universally be taken that in case of wrong produced to the public or to an individual by want of due attention and correspondent action on the part of the administration functionary—means of compensation as adequate as may be shall be provided and eventually applied instructional ratiocinative art  0 in the case of this department the administrative as in the others—for the appropriate supply of the information on each occasion necessary or serviceable provision is made as far as may be by the application made of these same systems to the business of this department the function by the exercise of which such information is afforded may however require to be considered and spoken of as a distinguishable and accordingly distinct function to wit for the reasons which follow   on this or that occasion—over and above all information or say evidence furnished by the exercise given to the registrative function—it may happen that ulterior evidence may for the particular purpose of the particular occasion require to be elicited and in conjunction with it arranged and commented on   in the event of the nonemployment or only partial employment of the registration system on this or that particular occasion—the exercise given to this same officiallyinformative function will be in proportion the more necessary instructional exemplificational art    accordingly the nature of the case will not admit of a doubt—but that under every form of government exercise is with more or less frequency comprehensiveness and symmetry actually and habitually given to it instructional exemplificational art    in english practice no such allcomprehensive or generallycomprehensive system of appropriate informationfurnishing from the administrative authorities to the legislature has place generally speaking no information is furnished to either of the two houses without its having been ordered nor for any information to be furnished in a readywritten form is any order commonly issued but in obedience to a special order by the house with or without an intermediate order from the monarch to whom a petition from the house in question is addressed for the purpose and with whom it rests to give or not to give such orders at pleasure nor is such petition addressed but in consequence of a resolution made and expressed in writing for that purpose which motion—though scarce ever negatived when made by a member of the administration—is frequently negatived when made by a member who is not specially connected with the party in office instructional exemplificational art    from this state of things cannot but result the consequences following   forasmuch as rare and extraordinary accidents excepted the will and agency of both houses of the legislature is determined by that of the administrative authority and no condemnation can be passed on the conduct of any person but on the ground of appropriate and adequate information—nor can any such information be furnished but by consent of the party in office—hence it is that on the conduct of no member of that party can any censure be passed nor so much as inquiry be made without the consent of that same party and by this state of things without need of anything more the selfjudication principle is constituted an alldetermining principle and all show of effective responsibility except to the publicopinion tribunal is mere pretence and mockery   even where the party in administration has no aversion to the exhibition of the information in question it is matter of accident whether the house ever receives possession of it   in consequence—to an indefinitely great extent evil in various shapes cannot but have been habitually taking place for want of some information by the receipt of which by both or either of the two houses it would have been prevented   of the information by which are determined the proceedings of the house in which with few exceptions all laws originate to wit the house of commons—it is only in a small part of the whole number of instances individually taken that the whole stock is possessed by the other house thus it is that in relation to one and the same matter the two houses are on almost every occasion acting on different grounds the one house on grounds frequently partial and inadequate the other house rarely on grounds other than partial and inadequate the whole legislature acting under a system of delusion and in an habitual course of more or less mischievous operation even when not thereto purposely determined by any sinister interest   by this system of partial information—whatsoever be the system of maleficence carried on—not only is all due punishment at the hands of the legal tribunal impossibilized but so is all cognizance and consequently all censure on the part of the publicopinion tribunal likewise     instructional art    to the case of provinces situated at great distances from the seat of legislation applies the mischief liable to result from deficiency of timely information proportioned to that distance in respect of place and thence in respect of time of communication—is the degree in which these dependencies are by the nature of the case rendered scenes of habitual misfortune and abuse and it is for the sake of the sinister profit derived and derivable from the abuse that at the expense of the subject many such dependencies situate at a certain distance are kept in subjection by the ruling few hence one cause of demand for sublegislatures instructional exemplificational art    in english practice deficient in appropriate aptitude in every shape this or that lord or other member or adherent of the ruling few is sent to exercise tyranny over the distant provinces and when at length complaints have reached and annoyed the ear of the legislature percipient witnesses have on this or that pretence been sent out of the way of being rendered for the information of the judicial and legislative authorities narrating witnesses section xi informationelicitative function enactive art   exceptions excepted—to every functionary belongs the informationelicitative function exercisible at the hands of every other person functionary or nonfunctionary in so far as the receipt of the information in question is necessary or useful enactive instructional art   for exceptions see cases for secrecy as referred to in ch xii section    publicity c expositive ratiocinative art   as between the simplyreceptive mode of elicitation and the extractive—in so far as the communicator and the receiver are both of them functionaries belonging to the official establishment—any distinction that may be observable between them will comparatively speaking be of little moment reasons   by the general registration and publication system as per ch viii sections  0    every functionary as such stands preengaged to furnish whatsoever appropriate information may on whatsoever occasion be needful or as such appropriately required of him   to a considerable extent reception and communication are works of the same hand and thus in a manner consolidated into one thus for example in every office to which a registrar is attached the several functions minutative and transmissive are on each occasion by the registrar exercised as of course and thus in that same hand united with the receptive and the custoditive instructional art   far different is the case where the proposed receiver of the information being a functionary the proposed communicator is a nonfunctionary in this case between elicitation by simple reception and elicitation by extraction in effect as well as in mode wide indeed may be the difference on the part of a spontaneous communicator willingness is indeed at least apparent naturally presumable and in most cases actual but on the part of him who communicates not but in compliance with requisition and from whom the communication if obtained is accordingly extracted unwillingness in every conceivable degree—for any length of time even noncompliance—may have had place the surmounting in all cases this unwillingness and substituting to it the correspondent compliance belongs in a more particular manner to the judiciary establishment and forms the most difficult of the tasks imposed upon it instructional art   in the business of that department this difficulty is all pervading and continual and so it will be whatsoever is in this proposed code done—or can in any code be done—for the lessening it happily in the business of the administration department it need be but incidental and casual in the quantity which for forming a ground for action is strictly necessary and proportionably sufficient appropriate information being provided for as above instructional art   in the hands of the minister in each subdepartment this power presents itself as indispensable on a view taken of the several official situations in their several grades established in each subdepartment in subordination to that of minister—to the legislature it will belong to determine to which of them this power shall be attached in each case subject to all such restrictions and conditions as may be deemed necessary for security against abuse instructional art   for securities against disturbance given to the exercise of this function see section  0 insubordination obviated for securities against oppression by abuse of power in the exercise of it see section    oppression obviated against extortion section    extortion obviated instructional art   as to the number of possible sharers     in the exercise of these functions—the extractive function is in the nature of the case susceptible of the being exercised by any number of persons on the same proposed communicator or say examinee on the same occasion or any number of different occasions witness in judicature under every system the examination of supposed evidenceholders by the judge and the parties or their advocates on both sides not to mention the other classes of persons to whom the power is imparted by the present proposed code so also at exactly the same time while the extraction process is going on by any number of notetakers instructional art   to the legislature it will belong—to determine in what cases if in any—or by what classes of functionaries if by any—belonging to the army and navy subdepartments respectively—power shall be possessed—of extracting from persons at large information requisite for the defence of the country against hostility commenced or regarded as impending instructional art  0 on the occasion of the several obligations of spontaneous information furnishing and information furnishing in compliance with interrogation—special care will be taken by the legislature to avoid the producing of preponderant evil by the divulgation of facts by the disclosure of which more evil will be produced than prevented regard being at the same time had to the evils producible by the practice termed in french espionage and to those produced by abuse of the power termed inquisitorial enactive ratiocinative art    in particular care will be taken not to comprise under the obligation the disclosure of any opinions entertained by any individual on the subject of religion reason in this case if the profession of such opinion is regarded and treated as a crime the authors of the crime such as it is are the legislature itself or the functionaries acting in pretended obedience to its ordinances instructional art    to the legislature it will belong—to determine in what cases if in any it shall be matter of obligation to persons at large to furnish to the several administration offices information relevant and material to the business of those same offices in so doing regard will be had as well to all expense and vexation necessarily attached to the furnishing of such information—as also to the difficulty of making sure that the knowledge of the existence of such obligation has been presented to the mind of the individual at whose hands it is required and for this purpose care will be taken that no such obligation shall extend to any species of information in regard to which mention of such obligation has not been inserted in the code appertaining to the situation in life in which the party is placed instructional expositive art    of cases in which the obligation of spontaneously furnishing information may—in so far as duly notified as above be reasonably imposed examples are the following   information of calamity recent or impending to the prerentiveservice minister   information of hostility recently committed or impending to the army minister or navy minister as the case may be and in both cases to the prime minister instructional exemplificational art    in english practice such obligation is imposed upon all persons without exception in the case of all offences to which the denomination of high treason is applied misprision is the denomination in that case given to the offence consisting in the nonfulfilment of that same obligation section xii meliorationsuggestive function enactive art   meliorationsuggestive function in the exercise of it as often as in respect of any part of the business of his office the practice thereof presents itself to the view of the minister as needing correction or as being susceptible of improvement—it belongs to him to draw up and transmit to the prime minister an appropriate meliorationsuggesting report enactive art   included in the meliorationsuggestive function are the elementary functions following i indicative function exercised by a statement made in general terms of the supposed amendments proposed enactive art   ii—ratiocinative or say reasongiving function exercised by adding in the form of reasons a statement of the beneficial effects looked for from the several proposed changes prefacing them with an indication of the maleficial effects if any resulting from the actual state of things enactive ratiocinative art   iii—eventually emendative function exercised by a written instrument by the authorization whereof in the very terms therein employed it appears to the writer that the change if approved of may most aptly be     accomplished together with an indication of the authority whose sanction will it is supposed be necessary and sufficient for the accomplishment of it whether for example the authority of the legislature be requisite or any and what authority subordinate thereto may be sufficient for the reasons why for the designation of a proposed change the very terms of the appropriate regulations require in this case to be employed see ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 judges eventually emendative function and ch vi section    enactive art   exemplars will be disposed of as follows   kept in the office one   kept by the minister for his own use one   transmitted to the office of the prime minister one   at the same time to the office of the legislation minister one   so to that of the finance minister one instructional art   whatsoever benefit may from time to time have been derived from the exercise given to this function—will be as it were the fruit and that the ripest fruit of whatsoever labour has been employed in the exercise of the several beforementioned functions section xiii term of service enactive ratiocinative art   dislocation excepted as per section    dislocable how—a ministers term of service is the term of his life ratiocinative art   question why in the situation of minister render the length of a mans term of service eventually and probably the same as that of his life instead of rendering it no more than annual followed by temporary nonrelocability as in the case of a member of the legislature answer reasons i—because in every one of the thirteen subdepartments—in the situation of minister the field of service being in comparison with what it is in the situation of legislator narrow—and the subjectmatter of consideration and operation matter of detail—appropriate knowledge judgment and active talent will necessarily be kept in a state of constant exercise and thence receiving increase in proportion to the length of the course of practice and experience whereas in the situation of member of the legislature to no one of the above faculties is any exercise given of necessity nor in the case of the great majority under the discontinued relocability system is it likely to be given in such sort as to be productive of public benefit unless it be under some special stimulus—such as that which has place in the case of those members who possess or look to possess the faculty of exercising influence on the proceedings in the character of speakers—and such to whom it may have happened to be continued for a number of years together in the situation of continuation committee men ratiocinative art   ii because in case of deficiency in appropriate aptitude in any of its shapes—for the dislocation of a minister as per section    dislocable how facilities have place much greater than those which apply to the case of a member of the legislature and for the existence of that same aptitude in the meantime securities as per section    more numerous and still more efficient the dislocatedness a loss to which a member of the legislature will in comparatively but a very slight degree stand exposed yes slight in comparison it would still be should he even be all the while carrying on in conjunction with the prime minister a plan of depredation by exercise all along given to the quantity of the matter of corruption placed at his disposal and the facility of making application of it to evil purposes section xiv attendance enactive expositive art   indoor service and outdoor service between these two modes or say branches of service will the attendance time of the several ministers taken in the aggregate be divided by indoor service understand whatsoever service is performed by the minister in his official residence by outdoor service whatsoever service is performed by him anywhere else for example by inspection progresses as per section   inspective function instructional art   by the principles and reasons brought to view in the case of the members of the legislature in ch vi section  0 attendance and remuneration how connected—will the aggregate quantity of time employed by them in both branches taken together be determined in what proportion it shall be divided between the two the legislature regard had to the different nature of the several services will determine ratiocinative art   for the uninterruptedness of attendance on the part of the legislature taken in the aggregate and the punctuality of attendance     on the part of its several members individually considered—special grounds over and above those brought to view as above in the chapter having for its subjectmatter the legislative department are furnished by the need of receiving the several communications made from the offices of the several ministers in the exercise of the officially informative functions as per section    to the end that in every instance at the earliest moment requisite all such arrangements may be taken for which at the hands of the legislature the nature of the communication may have produced a demand so likewise by the need of receiving and eventually operating in consequence of reports from the judiciary department as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    contested interpretationreporting function section  0 eventuallyemendative function section    sistitive or say executionstaying function and section    preinterpretative function also of taking the requisite cognizance of the proceedings of the several sublegislatures section xv remuneration† ratiocinative instructional art   aptitude maximized expense minimized indicated in these few words are the leading principles of this constitution on the subject of remuneration ratiocinative instructional art   as to maximization of official aptitude in this department for the course taken in this view see also the next section section    locable who ratiocinative art   subservient even to the maximization of aptitude is minimization of expense for   whatever be the occupation belonging to the office the greater a mans relish for it is the greater his aptitude for it is likely to be   the less the remuneration in consideration of which he is willing to exercise these same occupations the greater is his relish for them   greater still if instead of receiving he is willing to pay for the faculty of exercising them ratiocinative art   so on the other hand the greater the expense employed in remuneration the greater will be the opulence of the functionary so remunerated but the greater his opulence the less his appropriate aptitude will naturally be for   the less will be his activity   the greater his facility for engaging in merely pleasurable and other rival occupations   the greater his facility for obtaining accomplices in transgression and supporters to shield him against dislocation punishment and disrepute   the more apt to form an exaggerated estimate of the quantity of the expense for which at the charge of the public there may be on each several occasion a demand   altogether fallacious is the notion by which to the purpose of repression of wrong responsibility is regarded as increased by opulence by mans nature every the poorest individual is rendered susceptible of more suffering than in any case is ever thought fit to be inflicted for the purpose of repression by means of punishment altogether fallacious this notion and under a corrupt form of government invented for no other purpose than that of affording a pretence for needless wasteful and corruptive remuneration remuneration and to a vast extent in cases where the absence of all service is notorious and undeniable ratiocinative art   minimization of expense is therefore an object here pursued not only as being itself an end but as being a means of attainment with relation to that other end one and the same accordingly as per section    is the road that leads to the attainment of both these ends ratiocinative art   so far as regards remuneration minimization of expense in relation to all can no otherwise be effected than by minimization in relation to each in relation to each in each official situation note this rule having by appropriate courses as per section    locable who maximized the number of persons possessed of the maximum of appropriate aptitude ascertain from each the minimum of remuneration for which he will be content to charge himself with the official obligations modes of ascertainment are everywhere in use competition is no less applicable to the price of labour than to the price of goods to one sort of labour than to another to labour in the service of the public than to labour in the service of an individual so much for minimization of expense separately considered as to the arrangements of detail for     the union of minimization of expense with maximization of aptitude see the next two sections section    locable who section    located how ratiocinative art   exercised by a public functionary at the expense of the public liberality is but another name for waste combined in its essence are breach of trust peculation depredation oppression and corruption exercised to a good end and at a mans own expense liberality is a virtue exercised at the expense of others and without their consent it is a vice laudation bestowed upon it hypocrisy and imposture its fruits the above evils the good if any on the smallest scale the evil upon the largest ratiocinative instructional art   repugnant accordingly to these principles is remuneration in any shape on any occasion arbitrarily conferred repugnant even if for service really rendered or about to be rendered much more if on false pretence of service ratiocinative instructional art   arbitrarily conferred consistently with these principles can neither good nor evil be by the hand of government neither reward nor as per penal code punishment nor as per ch xxiv justice minister section   dispunitive function exemption from punishment expositive art  0 arbitrarily conferred is the matter of reward so far as by the hand of government it is otherwise than judicially conferred judicially conferred will accordingly be seen to be all official situations in relation to which location is performed as per section    located how ratiocinative instructional art    on no other account than that of service to the public can the matter of reward be conferred by the hand of government except in so far as it is bestowed in waste expositive art    ordinary and extraordinary under one or other of these denominations comes all service rendered or supposed to be rendered to the public expositive art    in the case of a public functionary by ordinary service understand all such service as by acceptance of his office he stands bound to render expositive art    by extraordinary service understand all such service as by such acceptance he does not stand bound to render expositive art    pecuniary and honorary by one or other of these denominations may the matter of reward be designated in every shape in which it is usually bestowed by the hand of government ratiocinative instructional art    for extraordinary service rendered to the public reward in a pecuniary shape may with as much facility and propriety be demanded at the hands of a judicatory at the charge of the public as in the like shape it is so demanded at the charge of an individual ratiocinative instructional art    with not less facility and propriety so may it in an honorary shape enactive instructional art    honorary reward in no shape does this constitution allow to be conferred but in the shape of natural honour augmented augmented by the hand of government and in this case the hand of government is as per art  0 the hand of justice expositive art    by natural honour understand that which in consideration of service in this or that extraordinary shape rendered to the community or to this or that section of the community the members of it in their quality of members of the publicopinion tribunal spontaneously render to the benemeritant render that is to say by means of appropriate sentiments of love and respect entertained in relation to him with the occasional addition of the special good will good offices and services in whatever shape tangible or untangible naturally flowing from these sentiments enactive expositive art  0 judicially augmented will natural honour be by two conjunct and correspondent appropriate judicial decrees the first opinative the other imperative in this as in other cases as to which see art    and ch xii judiciary collectively section   judges elementary functions enactive art    efficient causes of the augmentation in this case are authoritative recordation and authoritative publication enactive art    authoritative recordation is by entry made in an appropriate register book say in the extraordinary service register or say public merit register     enactive art    of such entry the matter is composed of an abstract of the record of the proceedings in a suit in conclusion of which the judicial decrees as per art  0 have been pronounced   the opinative stating the act deemed meritorious the shape in which the service has been rendered to the public and the fact that the individual by or for whom the demand of the reward is made is he by whom the service has been rendered with the evidence on which the decree has been grounded—time place and manner mentioned   the imperative ordering entry to be made of this same abstract in the abovementioned merit register enactive art    the commencement of the suit is by application made to the judicatory demanding for the alleged benemeritant a place in the public merit register on the ground of the extraordinary service thereupon stated as in the case of an ordinary application for money alleged to be due from defendant to applicant on the ground of work performed enactive art    the applicant that is to say demandant may be either the alleged benemeritant or any person for him with or without his consent and with or without his knowledge enactive art    the defendant will be the functionary who would be defendant were the subject of the demand money alleged to be due from government for goods furnished or work done otherwise than in the way of official service namely the government advocate of the immediate judicatory as per ch xviii immediate government advocates or the government advocategeneral as per ch xix government advocategeneral if so he thinks fit enactive art    the judicatory will be the immediate judicatory of the subdistrict in which the metropolis of the state is situated unless for special reasons assigned by the legislature or the prime minister the immediate judicatory of some other subdistrict shall have been appointed enactive instructional art    authoritative publication is by publication given in such way as the legislature shall have appointed to the matter of the recordationentry made as per art    in the public merit register enactive instructional art    repugnant accordingly to the principles of this constitution is all purely factitious honour or dignity in whatever shape conferred as hitherto it has everywhere been arbitrarily that is to say otherwise than judicially as above expositive art  0 titles of honour or ensigns of dignity to one or other of these denominations may be referred the instruments by which factitious honour or dignity has usually been conferred combined to a considerable extent they have been with one another and in many instances with masses of power or wealth in various shapes or both expositive art    examples of titles of honour are—   prince   archduke   grand duke   duke   marquis   count or earl   viscount   baron   baronet  0 knight—to wit of any one of a variety of orders    knight—of no order expositive art    examples of ensigns of dignity worn about the body of the individual are—   stars   crosses   ribbons   garters   gold and silver sticks expositive art    examples of ensigns of dignity exhibited on utensils of various sorts employed by the individuals are as follows—   coronets of various shapes corresponding to the several titles of honour   armorial bearings in this latter case the assertion conveyed though in most instances contrary to truth is—that some ancestor of the individual had employed himself in an enterprise of unprovoked slaughter and devastation for a symbol if requisite a gibbet substituted or added would have been more suitable ratiocinative instructional art    to the purpose of remuneration whether for ordinary or extraordinary service—unsuitable in comparison with natural honour augmented as above would merely factitious honour be as above even if judicially conferred for with the utmost conceivable accuracy in each individual instance does the quantum of natural honour adjust itself to the quantum of merit in every shape of the service the lots of reward attached to the aggregate number of     services rendered within a given time thus rising one above another in gradations which may be as numerous as the individual services themselves thus it is that in this mode of remuneration not a particle of injustice can ever have place except that which as in all other cases is liable to be produced by deceptiousness on the part of the evidence or want of aptitude on the part of the judge and by the supposition this danger is the same in both cases on the other hand where it is of factitious honour that the reward is composed no such accuracy of adjustment can have place between grade and grade how numerous soever the grades there must always be a space more or less considerable each such space is consequently a field of possible injustice the magnitude of which is as the amplitude of such space but proportioned to the magnitude of each such space is the discouragement applied to the most meritorious of two or more services to which the same lot of factitious reward is applicable for if for the rendering of each of them sacrifice in any shape is necessary in such sort that greater sacrifice is necessary in the case of the most than in the case of the least valuable of the two the identity of the reward in both cases operates as a premium on the least valuable—as a prohibition on the most valuable moreover in the case of the factitious honour the justice of the decree is exposed to a degree of disbelief and the judge to a degree of disrepute for which in the case of the natural honour there is no place in the case of the factitious honour it is by the judge that the exact place in the scale of honour is determined since it is by him that it is conferred in the shape of some title of honour or some ensign of dignity which has a specific name in the case of natural honour it is not by the judge but by the publicopinion tribunal that in each individual instance the benemeritants place in the scale of honour is determined the judge may be corrupt or what so far as regards the individual case amounts to the same thing may be suspected of being so the publicopinion tribunal cannot enactive ratiocinative instructional art    sufficient of itself for the destruction of this constitution might an instrument of corruption of this sort be if arbitrarily conferrible to the prime minister alone could the power of conferring it be allotted for to no other functionary could any one propose to allot it in the hands of a man of ordinary ambition and superior ability sufficient then might this one instrument be for the conversion of the hereproposed commonwealth into an arbitrary monarchy at the least into a monarchy operating by an allpervading and allvitiating system of corruption waste and unpunishable depredation as in england into his lap in return for these objects of general desire—for themselves or what would amount to the same thing for their connexions—would continually be poured power in various shapes impunity for various transgressions and money from various sources by the legislature that is by the acting majority of the members immoveable he would remain how flagrant soever were his inaptitude enactive expositive art    exceptions excepted repugnant to these same principles is all ultraconcomitant remuneration by ultraconcomitant remuneration understand all habitual remuneration for habitual service after the cessation of the habit of service for exceptions apparent rather than real see ch xi ministers severally section   army minister and section   navy minister ratiocinative art    completely needless and thence unjustifiable is all such ultraremuneration a baker is not paid for supplying food when he has ceased to do so a medical practitioner for attending patients a law practitioner for assisting litigants yet never is there any want of bakers of medical or of law practitioners as little in any official situation would there be any want of occupants—if in the case of service rendered to the whole community as in the case of service rendered to individuals the habit of receiving the remuneration were to expire with that of rendering the service but bakers have it not in their power thus to load customers medical practitioners patients law practioners litigants while in a government which has for its end in view the good of the few and for the subjectmatter of its sacrifice the good of the many placemen have it in their power thus to load subjects in the angloamerican united states waste in this shape has no place expositive ratiocinative art    of modes of ultraconcomitant remuneration examples are as follow—   superannuation pensions granted on presumption of relative inaptitude through infirmity caused by age   pensions of retreat granted on the score of casual inaptitude through infirmity   pensions of retreat granted without so much as the pretence of infirmity on the score of a certain length of past service balanced all along and requited already by concomitant remuneration remuneration thus located is a premium on inaptitude men flock into the situation in contemplation of inaptitude the infirmity if it occurs is exaggerated if worth while fostered or even produced for the plea of it naturally ready assistants may be looked for in all third persons who are or regard themselves as exposed to be sufferers by it most strenuous of all the patron to whom the right of location accrues   0 enactive instructional art    repugnant to these same principles is all artificially mislocated remuneration—so located at the expense of the community by the hand of government it is universally needless it is essentially unfrugal expositive art  0 by artificially mislocated understand conferred on an individual other than him by whom the service was rendered expositive art    mislocated it is either mislocated in toto or extravasated expositive art    it is mislocated in toto where to a person by whom the service in question was not in any part rendered reward is given to him by whom it was rendered none expositive art    it is extravasated in so far as to reward given to the person by whom the service was rendered is added on that same account reward given to some person by whom on the occasion in question no service was rendered ratiocinative expositive art    on the contrary purely beneficial and by the whole amount of it is all remuneration in so far as naturally extravasated naturally extravasated it is in so far as without expense to government in virtue of preestablished connexions the benefit of it diffuses itself among any who by any tie of interest selfregarding or sympathetic are in any way connected with the remuneratee in this case having place without expense to the community it is so much pure good and the more there is of it the better ratiocinative instructional art    of reward mislocated in toto an example has place as often as for service rendered by a subordinate the superordinate not having contributed anything to the performance of it the superordinate reaps the reward the subordinate no part of it in monarchies injustice in this shape naturally and habitually pervades the whole of the official establishment the more abundantly the more absolute the monarchy is and thence the more perfectly the light of the public eye is excluded from all official operations from this code by the exclusion of all arbitrarily conferred reward as per arts     injustice in this shape will be seen effectually excluded every man will be judged of according to his works expositive ratiocinative art    of reward artificially extravasated at the expense of the community by the hand of government examples are the following—   pensions receivable by the widow of the functionary on his decease   pensions receivable by a child or children of the functionary on his decease   pensions payable to any more distant relative of the functionary on his decease these may be styled postobituary or postobit pensions   an income in perpetuity derived from land or otherwise with power given to the supposed benemeritant and his representatives to hold in hereditary succession as if so purchased by him in this case for the benefit of one individual generations indefinite in number are subjected to depredation enactive ratiocinative instructional art    preeminently repugnant would be any such compound as that which is composed of factitious dignity with fractional masses of supreme power legislative and judicial together the whole rendered extravasate running in the blood of the first remuneratee from generation to generation through a boundless line of descendants from no one of whom could any part have been borne in the supposed public service so remunerated those same generations being moreover loaded with the obligation of keeping repaired all breaches made by dissipation in the originally excessive mass of wealth originally combined with that same inordinately rich compound† the whole for the perpetual saturation of appetites essentially unsaturable expositive ratiocinative instructional art    for examples see art    those appellations which elsewhere designate little more than the gaseous dignity designating in one nation—many of them—the abovementioned substantial compound for in the race of waste and corruption it was ordained of old that the foremost of all other governments should be distanced by that of which it is the distinguishing character to be in the words of its own so indefatigably trumpeted proclamations the envy and admiration of all surrounding nations enactive art    in respect of any extraordinary     public service analogous to the ordinary service attached to any official situation in this department—any person whatever by whom any such extraordinary service has been rendered may be considered as belonging on that occasion to that same office and in proportion to the value of the service be remunerated enactive expositive art  0 service which to a functionary in the situation in question would be ordinary and sufficiently requited by the remuneration attached to it may if rendered by a person not in that situation be extraordinary and as such be remunerated expositive art    examples are as follows—   service by defence of any portion of the territory or of a government or private vessel or any individual inhabitant of the territory against aggression by any pirate or foreign enemy subdepartment the army or navy   service rendered at the peril of life by the apprehension of a depredator or other common malefactor while engaged in the commission of a crime subdepartment the preventive service   service rendered at the peril of life by the extinction of an accidental conflagration subdepartment again the correspondent section of the preventive service subdepartment enactive art    but in a case of this sort the judge will be upon his guard against a fraud to which by its nature it stands exposed that is to say service left unperformed by an appropriate functionary that a confederate nonfunctionary may perform it and thus by the fraudulent display of pretendedly meritorious service receive appropriate remuneration enactive art    judicially in a pecuniary shape may reward to any amount be thus conferred enactive art    a ministers pay is — a year paid quarterly in advance from unwilling hands receipt of ulterior emolument is extortion from willing ones corruption this pay is the standard of reference in the case of the pecuniary competition as per section    located how art   enactive art    in every subdepartment the way of the minister is the same enactive art    whatsoever is the number of subdepartments allotted to one and the same minister pay is not given for more than one enactive art    to his stated pay is added indemnification money for the expense of inspection visits at the rate of — per mile actually travelled with — for each day or part of a day so employed for diet and lodging while out by the care of the finance minister—after each visit immediately on his return the money is paid to every other minister on his signing a receipt section xvi locable who enactive art   this section has for its object the providing as soon as may be and in so far as is necessary—but no further at the public expense in relation to the business of all the several subdepartments comprised in the administration department a system of arrangements whereby in the several official situations appropriate aptitude in all its branches shall be maximized and at the same time expense minimized say a system of official location or for shortness the location system instructional art   as to what regards instruction in so far as this system is well adapted to the instruction of persons destined to become public functionaries so will it be according to the nature of the business belonging to the several subdepartments to the instruction of persons at large foreigners as well as natives any benefit thus derivable from the system call it the collateral benefit enactive ratiocinative instructional art   of this system of location the leading features are as follows— a choice will at any rate be to be made out of a number of candidates or persons proposed according to this constitution for reasons elsewhere given by a single person and not by a number the location must on every occasion be made that person can be no other than the person on whom in case of a bad choice as demonstrated by relative inaptitude the responsibility legal or moral or both will fall in a word the prime minister by no legal restriction is he therefore prevented from choosing any person at pleasure but by a moral restriction by the circumscribing eye of the publicopinion tribunal his choice as per section    located how will naturally be confined within limits comparatively narrow the person whose degree of appropriate aptitude in all its several branches as certified by the votes of a set of appropriately determined judges stands highest will have been made known—made known to him and everybody thus it is that provision is made for maximization of aptitude remains now the minimization of expense     of those persons who in the scale of aptitude stand on or near the same level it is made known by public competition who those are who in the situation in question are willing to serve the public on the lowest terms provision for moral aptitude is at the same time made by a scrutiny performed at the same time in the course of the same examination and with equal publicity if to a person who in the eyes of the universal public is seen to stand foremost in the line of appropriate aptitude and in that of cheapness of service taken together—he prefers a person not distinguished in either way it is at his peril—at the peril of his reputation—that he does so nor can an improper choice afford any promise of producing to him any permanent advantage for in the case of every office the power of dislocation is confided to a number of hands each acting separately with full power and who not adding to it any one of them the power of location stand every one of them altogether divested of all inducement to abuse a power so thankless and unprofitable to the possessors for calling into exercise this dislocative power there will be the motive afforded by the affection of envy in the breasts of disappointed rivals—a check not capable of being brought into operation in the ordinary case of a purely arbitrary power of patronage the choice being thus narrowed not only expense but with it power of corruption is minimized the benefit thus bestowed is the produce—not of favour but of right though not of legally binding yet of morally binding right enactive ratiocinative art   under this system two periods there are in relation to which separate provision requires to be made the preparation period and the consummation period the consummation period though last in the order of time requires to be first described the other not being otherwise capable of being made intelligible expositive art   by the consummation period understand that during which the courses of proceeding regarded as necessary to the production of appropriate aptitude in the several official situations in the degree of perfection regarded as desirable and attainable will be carrying on each of them during the whole length of time regarded as desirable of this period the commencement will coincide with the termination of the preparation period determinate end it will have none expositive art   by the preparation period understand that during which those same courses will have been going on but will not have continued long enough it is supposed to have produced with sufficient certainty the whole of the desired benefit instructional ratiocinative art   if in any degree beneficial these same courses will however almost from the first have been productive of some degree of appropriate aptitude which benefit will have continued on the increase up to the point of time at which the preparation period terminates and the consummation period commences this increase at every distinguishable stage of it the legislature will turn to profit as per art    and those which follow it instructional art   for these several courses the several times of commencement will be appointed by the legislature instructional ratiocinative art   on these principles throughout the official establishment proceed the several arrangements in virtue of which so soon and so long as any person is to be found by whom appropriate proof has been given of his having reaped any distinguishable portion of the benefit in question no person by whom like proof has not been given will be locable and by the whole amount of the thus acquired aptitude how small soever this system of location will be preferable to any in which no security at all is given for appropriate official aptitude thus it is that not by doubt nor even by despair as to the practicability of carrying the system to the height of perfection here exhibited to view can any tenable reason be given for omitting to carry it so far as it shall be found capable of being carried into effect instructional art  0 for this as well as other purposes the legislature will have caused to be made and published an allcomprehensive list of the several situations belonging to this as well as the several other departments name of it the office calendar as to which see also section    securities for appropriate aptitude instructional expositive art    general heads under which for the present purpose these may be ranged are— i situations of talent ii situations of simple trust iii situations of trust and talent expositive instructional art    by situations of talent understand those so circumstanced that for the apt fulfilment of the duties attached to them appropriate knowledge judgment and active talent in some special shape or shapes as per art    over and above appropriate moral aptitude are regarded as necessary these situations will be formed into groups corresponding to the several groups of branches of art and science proficiency in which shall have been regarded as necessary to the apt     exercise of the several functions respectively belonging to the several situations expositive art    by situations of simple trust understand such for the apt performance of the duties whereof no such proficiency is necessary examples are—   situations the duties of which are discharged by the receipt custody and transmission of money   or of messages from a central part of the territory of the state to every other as in the case of postoffice situations   or of stores of any kind except in so far as according to the nature of the article chemical knowledge respecting the causes and preventives of deperdition may be necessary   so situations in virtue of which the custoditive function is exercised with relation to an immoveable subjectmatter excepting as above expositive art    by situations of talent and trust understand such situations of talent for the apt performance of the duties whereof the disposal of the services of men in considerable numbers or of things for public use to considerable value is necessary instructional expositive art    of groups of talents proficiency in which may be regarded as necessary to the apt exercise of the functions belonging to correspondent groups of situations examples are as follow— i talentrequiring situations

enactive art    except as per section    located how arts       antecedently to his admission into any office belonging to this department the name of the individual must have been entered upon a certain list called the locable list enactive art    for determining in regard to each individual whether he be qualified to be admitted and accordingly whether he shall be admitted into this list—and if yes in what rank a special judicatory will be formed under the name of the qualification judicatory or say examination judicatory enactive art    of this judicatory the composition will be as follows—   presiding judge the justice minister or his depute   other judges the prime minister and the several ministers or their respective deputes   quasijurymen the several instructors as per arts    to    under whose instruction the several locables have acquired their proficiency in the several groups of branches of art and science as to quasijurymen and their functions see in the part belonging to the judicial department ch xvi quasijury enactive instructional art    included in the supposition of the sitting of a judicatory of this sort are the suppositions following—   returns made to the advertisement as per art      to the several places in question pecuniary supply afforded by government or ascertainment of the needlessness of such supply   time elapsed sufficient for the obtainment of instruction more or less extensive in the several branches of art and science in question or some of them observation being at the same time made that how small soever the instruction obtained in consequence of this plan will by the whole amount of it have been so much more than would have had place otherwise more will always be better than less but the least will always be better than none enactive instructional art  0 mode of procedure in these examinations—in the main this will be the same as in an ordinary immediate judicatory examples of points of agreement and coincidence are as follow—   on the pursuers side applicants and demandants the several scholars demanding admission into the locable list and to that end presenting themselves for examination   subjectmatter of demand the judicial service which the judicatory will have rendered to the applicant if being placed on the list he is at the same time placed at the head of it or in any such inferior place as shall have been thought fit   defendants in like manner these same several scholars each contesting the demand made by every other of the highest station and the several next stations one below another as above   evidence in favour of his own aptitude spontaneously adduced by each scholar in the character of demandant—any such marks of proficiency as according to the nature of the case the regulation shall have allowed to be exhibited   other evidence in his favour elicited by interrogation addressed to him by any judges or quasijurymen or fellowcandidates so disposed   other evidence elicited by counterinterrogation addressed to him in pursuance of the opposite disposition   also whatever evidence operates in a direct way in favour of any one of his several competitors as above   publicity throughout maximized expositive art    examples of points of diversity on the part of this as compared with an ordinary judicatory are as follow—   substitute or assistant none gratuitous or professional to any such candidate either as demandant or defendant   codemandants or codefendants none compelled or compellable to be   extraneous witnesses none compelled or admitted except in case of necessity on an examination into moral aptitude as per art      costs that is to say compensation to a party on the opposite side for expenses of demand or defence none exigible enactive art    of the qualification judicatory the opinative decree will be thus formed—modes of rotation two the secret mode then before the result of the secret mode has been disclosed or ascertained the open mode enactive art    of the way in which votation in the secret mode may be conducted an example is as follows—   a roll of paper or parchment is provided length such as to contain the names of all the several candidates one under another   in this roll are so many columns placed abreast of one another headed each by the names of such groups of branches of art and

inaptitude an objection has been made a mark will be attached and of what has passed on the occasion of every such scrutiny a record under the care of the registrar will be made and published enactive ratiocinative art    for obtainment of instructors in the several branches as above—for maximizing the aptitude of those employed by maximizing the number of those competing for the employment—and moreover for preascertainment of the expense to government advertisement will by direction of the prime minister be made of the several places at which it is proposed that the instruction shall be administered together with questions to which every person desirous of administering it may give answers name of this instrument—the prime ministers advertisement for instructors or for shortness the advertisement for instructors enactive art    examples of these questions are the following   at the time of answering have you under your instruction any and what pupils and of what ages respectively in any and what branch or branches of instruction contained in this advertisement and during what length of time have you so had them respectively mentioning in each instance the year month and day of commencement   to any and which of them do you supply lodging and diet or either and which and on what terms   as to what other branches if any of art and science in the groups stated in the advertisement as per art    or in any and what other groups or separately do you regard yourself able being also willing to administer instruction   what remuneration do you require for each pupil with variations if any according to age or any and what other circumstance   shall you be able and willing and when for any and what number to supply lodging and diet or either and which and on what terms enactive art    of an advertisement to this effect the object will be to ascertain in the first place in what branches of instruction and in regard to each for what number of pupils apt instruction may be expected at the charge of the individuals more immediately benefited and thence what part of the expense will be required to be borne or advanced by government enactive ratiocinative art    as to the governments share of the expense the primary distinction will be between that part which must be advanced in the shape of capital and that part for which an annual or other periodically received allowance in the manner of interest on capital may suffice periodical allowance being preferable as far as it will go preferable inasmuch as if ineffective or become needless the expense may at any time be made to cease enactive art    of the purposes for which capital may be requisite the principal are houseroom groundroom and appropriate apparatus relation being in this case had to the several branches of art and science for houseroom and groundroom it will be the care of government that no advance shall be made in the shape of capital any further than room suitable and adequate to the purpose cannot be obtained for hire enactive ratiocinative instructional art    for the maximization not only of frugality and extent of provision as above but moreover of appropriate aptitude on the part of the instructors—it will be the care of the legislature to minimize in the instance of each instructor all such supply in a pecuniary and quasipecuniary shape as will be independent of the number of his pupils and thereby of the strenuousness and constancy of his exertions instructional ratiocinative art    in this view it will be the care of the legislature that whatsoever remuneration is needed for engaging apt instructors shall in as large a proportion as may be be defrayed not by government but by the pupils and their relatives considering that in so far as salary is provided at a fixed rate independent of the number of the pupils motives     for adequate exertion on the part of the alleged instructors are altogether wanting while the love of ease is an inducement by the force of which the absence of exertion will be secured considering moreover that even if remuneration were made to rise in proportion to the number of the pupils adequate motives for adequate exertion might still be wanting the number being kept up for appearance sake and the exertion no greater than what would be regarded as necessary to save the instructor from disgrace and that thus in both cases every allowance thus made operates as a premium on negligence and as a prohibition on appropriate attention and exertion instructional ratiocinative art    on the other hand cases may have place in which on pain of leaving the service unprovided with the necessary instruction on matters of indispensable necessity it may be necessary to provide extra remuneration in a quantity such as to free the instructor from any such dependence as above on the number of his pupils but against this case provision in a great degree effectual will have been made—made by the inevitable constancy of attendance and performance of the appropriate functions at the seat of duty on principles and by means as per ch vi legislative section  0 attendance and remuneration how connected and section    selfsuppletive function so far as consists in the reading of lectures performance being thus secured although the motives for exertion may not be in quite so high a degree efficient as they might be rendered by emolument rising in proportion to the number of the pupils still may they be sufficiently effective to make ample return for the expense delivery of the instruction in some state or other being by the supposition inevitable regard for his own character will prevent a man from exhibiting the instruction in any such state as should expose his character to disgrace and in situations such as those in question this will on the part of most men suffice to call into action nearly all such appropriate aptitude as they are conscious of being in possession of instructional ratiocinative art  0 of cases in which in addition to bare subsistence remuneration rising in regular proportion with and thence dependent on the number of the pupils may as above fail of being sufficient examples are as follows—   on the one hand the branch of instruction on the other hand the state of the country such—that an extra mass of emolument to a certain degree ample may be necessary to attract instructors from foreign countries   or in the country in question from rival pursuits   the branch of instruction such that in the country in question at the time in question notwithstanding the multitude of those by whom it is on account of the public desirable that it should be possessed—proficiency in it may not afford to pupils—in number sufficient to make up such remuneration as above to the instructor—inducement sufficient in their eyes to pay for the time labour and expense necessary to acquirement instructional art    in a case in which under the persuasion of necessity as above any such extra rate of remuneration has at the outset been allotted—it will be for the care of the legislature so to order matters that along with the necessity the overplus shall cease preserving therefore for the sake of good faith to the first professor his agreedfor remuneration—such reduction will accordingly upon his decease resignation or dislocation be made as the consideration of the probable desirableness of the situation in the eyes of apt instructors—consideration being moreover had of the habitual probable number of pupils appears to admit of instructional ratiocinative art    if in this or that place it should be found necessary to employ public money in providing pay for the engaging of apt instructors care will at the same time be taken not to make it larger than the pay customarily regarded as necessary for the subsistence of the lowestpaid class of labourers for if at the place in question at the expense of parents and relatives pupils cannot be obtained in number sufficient to afford an adequate inducement to an apt instructor it will follow that that same place is not so fit as some other that might be found for the mode in which on the part of instructors comparative aptitude will be exhibited by the examinations see art    instructional ratiocinative art    in this same view the propriety will be seen of abstaining altogether from making any allowance for lodging or diet of pupils considering that in no part of the territory in which any population has place can there be any want of parents or other relatives by whom persons apt in respect of age to become pupils are already maintained at their own expense and that in so far as allowance were made for any such purposes such allowance would operate as a premium or bounty on the production of population in excess instructional ratiocinative art    as to clothing if any government allowance is made it will be in the view of preventing the comparatively opulent from being excluded from the benefit of the instruction by disgust produced from the spectacle of deficiency or uncleanliness on the part of the comparatively indigent     enactive instructional expositive art    when in consequence of the advertisement as per art    answers at the end of a sufficient interval of time have been received—the legislature will by a succeeding advertisement fix a day distant not less than one year from the day on which such lastmentioned advertisement is issued on which succeeding day at the appointed place or places the first examination or examinations will be to be made these days may respectively be denominated the examinationappointing day or days and the examination day or days the advertisement the examinationappointing advertisement enactive instructional art    on the occasion of such examinationappointing advertisement if not before the legislature will have determined and will then declare its determination as to whether the several branches of art and science comprised in the several groups shall be included all in one examination or shall in any and what manner be distributed among divers examinations those examinations to be performed by the same or divers qualification judicatories at the same or divers times enactive art    length of the consummation period say seven years

the course of that period will be if annual   if semiannual    if quarterly    by the last examination will have been produced a complete set of functionaries by whom the full benefit of the system will it is presumed have been reaped instructional ratiocinative art    coincident with the earliest consummation period that has place will be the preparation period so many years halfyears or quarters so many stages into which it may be considered as divided by whatever considerations the legislature will have been determined to cause the course of instruction to be administered in its entire length by the same will it have been determined to cause to be administered whatsoever smaller portion the interval of time will at each stage have admitted for   in relation to appropriate aptitude in official situations any quantity of time employed in appropriate instruction for the obtainment of it will be better than none   of any given degree of such aptitude any such direct evidence will be better than none   on grounds unknown to all men no mans bare opinion in affirmance of another mans aptitude can be so well grounded as that of all men will be after a public examination though there were no more than one followed as it will be by collective judicial opinion having such examination for its ground and expressed by secret and thence by free votation as above enactive art    accordingly when one years instruction has been received no person those excepted who are already in office will be placed on the locable list unless he has been receiving the benefit of that same instruction throughout that one year when two years no person by whom it has not been received during those two years those persons excepted who are then already in office and those by whom the instruction had been received during the second year and so on during the whole of the period—the quantum of appropriate instruction receiving every year an increase until what is regarded as a sufficiency has been secured to all functionaries in all lines and the door perpetually shut against all those whose inaptitude stands selfconfessed and thus conclusively proved by their shrinking from the test instructional art  0 in relation to appropriate moral aptitude the legislature will consider—whether the course of examination relative thereto shall commence at the same time with the examination relative to the other branches of appropriate aptitude as above—or not till at some and what later point of time as also whether the acts of the examinee which on the examination may be permitted to be brought to light may commence at any point of time or whether a time shall be assigned to the end that no such act anterior to that time shall be endeavoured to be brought to light

been stowed in his memory but that for the purpose of their making proof of such portion of instruction as they have respectively obtained from it only a part of the instruction so obtained can be brought to view brought to view to wit by responses delivered in compliance with the corresponding questions propounded only a part by the aggregate of them consequently not more than a much smaller part by any one such accordingly is the course here supposed to be determined on and universally known to be so instructional art    or   this being assumed—one consequence is—what person soever it be by whom for the purpose of his undergoing the scrutiny in question it is deemed necessary that he should enable himself to make apt response to any one of these same questions by that same person will it be deemed necessary for him to enable himself to make response to all alike whereas supposing him to regard any one part of the whole number as being more likely to be propounded to him than others in any number—he would be tempted to content himself with qualifying himself for making answer to this most probably propounded part leaving the remainder in a state of absolute or comparative neglect instructional ratiocinative art    or   in the following mode lot may be seen to be made effectually instrumental to the exclusion of partiality as well unfavourable as favourable on the part of examiners   so far as it depended upon the choice of the examiner to determine the questions or other tests of aptitude that shall be propounded to a probationer—the consequence would be a power of favouring or disfavouring without any regard to appropriate aptitude the pretensions of probationers in any number at his pleasure to favour any probationer he might propound such questions alone how little probative soever of aggregate aptitude as the probationer was best prepared to answer or to disfavour another probationer he might propound such questions alone as—to his the examiners knowledge—the probationer would be unqualified or at any rate least qualified to respond to   if of the whole number of the questions that ought to have had place in the lottery any part were omitted—the lottery would in proportion to the magnitude of the omitted part     fail to be as probative a test of aptitude as it would be otherwise and such would be the case although it had been by chance not choice that the omission had been produced if on the other hand there were any person by whose choice any such omission could take place—it would in this indirect way be in the power of

man is entrusted by law with the entire management of his own concerns say    years enactive ratiocinative art    exceptions for considerations are—   army service the military branch in this branch

ratiocinative art   —  navy service the military branch in this branch an officer is locable in the lowest grade at the age of — years reason as per art    instructional art    on a comparative survey of the several subdepartments and the several situations in each subdepartment the legislature will consider in what instances demand for difference in grades has place and in so far as it is established how far succession to a vacancy shall be influenced by it that is to say in what instances in regard to any grade above the lowest biddings under the pecuniary competition system shall have place instructional ratiocinative art  0 on this occasion the considerations following will be borne in mind—   of two persons the one suppose has been habitually subject to the direction of the other in this case if by a fresh arrangement it happens to the superordinate to find himself subjected to the direction of his quondam subordinate—a natural consequence is—on the part of the thus relatively depressed superordinate a pain of humiliation—say in     this case a pain of degradation—a pain produced by the comparison made of his antecedently elevated with his subsequently depressed state   where no such subjection has had place no such pain is produced in a mans mind by the mere view of the rise of a person who not having been subject to his direction comes to be located in a situation more eligible than his in this case therefore that same reason in favour of settled succession has no place enactive expositive instructional art    as to every situation subordinate to that of minister there will be two locators—the initiative and the confirmative exceptions excepted as to every office in his subdepartment the initiative locator is the minister confirmative the prime minister exceptions if any remain to be excepted by the legislature enactive expositive ratiocinative art    if in any subdepartment any initiative locator subordinate to the minister is established—it will be in consideration of distance lest during the interval between the day on which the vacancy at the place in question takes place and the day on which information of the confirmative location reaches that same place the service belonging to the situation so vacated be left unperformed in this case there may be two initiative locators temporarily initiative locator the next superordinate of the functionary by whose dislocation the vacancy is created definitively initiative locator the minister expositive instructional art    examples of subdepartments in which in respect of distance a demand for initiative location in hands other than those of the minister and thence for temporarily initiative location is more particularly apt to have place are the following to wit—     the army minister     the navy minister     the foreign relation minister enactive ratiocinative art    in the army subdepartment in so far as regards command over functionaries in the military branch vacancies in respect of function are in effect for the occasion without special appointment filled of course to wit by the universally and necessarily established relation between rank and rank as to which see ch x defensive force instructional art    not so in so far as regards situations in the nonmilitary styled the commissariat branch those to wit by whom with relation to the matter of warfare and the matter of subsistence are exercised the several functions procurative custoditive applicative reparative and eliminative as to which functions see ch ix ministers collectively section   instructional art    nor in so far as regards the command of fortified places instructional art    nor in the navy department in which in the establishments of the great

foreign relation subdepartment at each missionary station as on the incapacity or absence so on the death of the principal functionary—his functions will be exercised by a depute of his as per ch viii prime minister section   selfsuppletive function failing such depute if an established subordinate of the principal is on the spot under a denomination for example such as that of secretary of legation such subordinate will for the time except in case of special provision to the contrary succeed as if located by a temporarily initiative locator as above art    enactive art    on a vacancy in the situation of viceconsul by the consul will the function of temporarily initiative locator be exercised instructional art  0 in what stations and on what footings the power of deputation shall be exercised by a viceconsul the legislature having regard to distance and to the state of society in the foreign nation in each case will determine enactive art    of the locative function the mode of exercise is as follows—by the minister he being the initiative locator an appropriate location instrument is prepared and conveyed to the office of the prime minister after the lapse of — days exclusive reckoned from the day of its being received in that office the location will have become confirmed unless     under the signature of the prime minister an instrument in correspondent form locating some other locable or an order suspending the effect of such initiative location has in the meantime in the office of that same minister been received enactive ratiocinative art    in case of any such substitution reasons for the rejection and the consequent location will be expected if none are given the conclusion of the publicopinion tribunal and of the legislature will be—that none can be found enactive art    deputes permanent—without special reason no person who has not been upon the general locable list as per art    is capable of being located as depute permanent in any office belonging to this department enactive art    special reason is—where in the location instrument by which the depute is constituted such the names of all persons on that list being by recital or reference designated—the locator states on the part of each either refusal or inaptitude actual or virtual absolute or comparative adding in what particular shape or shapes such inaptitude has place

in any subdepartment in the situation of minister or any situation thereto subordinate should any person be located who has no right so to be—such mislocatee as also the functionary by whom he was mislocated will for such act of mislocation be responsible compensationally if through temerity the act was culpable compensationally and punitionally if through evil consciousness it was criminal so also their respective accomplices if any as per penal code enactive art    but on no such account will any act done by such mislocatee in the exercise of any function belonging to the office be null and void or say invalid ratiocinative art    reason in so far as the exercise given to the function though by an usurper is apt the end for which it was allotted to the office is attained and no evil is produced whereas by nullification of the act an infringement of the disappointmentpreventing principle—on which as per penal code the law of property rests—would be committed and on the part of nonoffending persons suffering to an indefinite amount produced expositive art  0 examples are as follows   acts of sale performed in the exercise of the venditive function   acts of leaseletting

be divested of all profit therefrom provided they be exempted from all positive loss supplement to section xvii pecuniary competition principle reasons in support of it as hereinabove employed employed to wit not as decisive but as contributing in subordination as above to the aptitude manifestation system to the guidance of the decisive choice given to the responsible locating superordinate ratiocinative art    or   i—reasons direct and intrinsic deduced from the greatest happiness principle applied to the nature of the case case i the situation a situation of simple trust as per section    arts       for appropriate moral aptitude adequate provision being supposed to have been made to wit by section    locable who arts              0 and no special appropriate intellectual or active aptitude being regarded as necessary the presumption here is that but for some special reason assignable and assigned to the contrary—the choice of the locating superordinate will fall upon that candidate in whose instance the result of the pecuniary competition is most favourable to the public purse on this supposition all parties will have cause to be pleased to wit   the community at large because that choice has been made which is most beneficial to its aggregate pecuniary interest   the locating functionary the candidates aptitude and thereby the locators responsibility being alleviated by the result of the probationary trials as above say then the locating     functionary unless it be his desire at the expense of the community in breach of his duty and engagement and at the risk of his own fortune and reputation to gain to himself an undue benefit in the shape of patronage   the candidate by whose own offer the situation is procured for him ratiocinative art    or  —case ii the situation a situation of trust and talent to wit after the manifestation made of the grade acquired by the candidate in the scale of manifested appropriate aptitude in all its branches as certified by the certificate given by the examination judicatory as per section    art    that document contributing in conjunction with the result of the pecuniary competition to the guidance of the decision intrusted to the responsiblylocating superordinate i reason grounded as in the former case on intrinsic utility only where to the purpose of the practical conclusion the claims of the two candidates on the ground of the manifestation made as to appropriate aptitude as above are in the opinion of the examination or say qualification judicatory virtually equal—does it seem likely that the determination will be made in favour of him whose offer on the ground of its favourableness to the pecuniary interest of the community is accepted the locating superordinate being by section   selfsuppletive function responsible for the conduct of his subordinate—he is thus by a personal interest of no inconsiderable strength urged to have due and adequate regard to the thus manifestly demonstrated appropriate aptitude by a deficiency in the aptitude he would stand exposed to be more or less a sufferer in the small saving to the public purse he would have no perceptible share the arrangement affords therefore a prospect of good and this without a prospect of evil in any shape ratiocinative art    or   ii—reasons extrinsic deduced from authority and practice   in england among the highest of the ruling few the tide of events has of late years borne up some in whose declared opinion not only the price of labour—in whatsoever shape—unskilled or skilled—but also the price of commodities in general and in particular of those means of sustenance which are worth all other commodities put together—should be minimized and that as the only instrument of minimization the competition principle should be uniformly and steadily employed instructional art    or   these same distinguished statesmen—would they—durst they if they would—accede to the application of this same instrument to the reduction of the price of the labour performed by themselves and their present colleagues or—not to insist upon that which could not reasonably be proposed—of the like labour when performed by their successors and the colleagues of those same successors o yes when the energy of the people is to such a degree troublesome that in the high places in question regard for consistency and the comfort of the subjectmany cannot consistently with the comfort of these same ruling few be refused instructional art    or   at present engaged by so efficient an interest to maximize instead of minimizing the expense of official labour—they stand engaged by a no less efficient interest to minimize instead of maximizing all need and thence all proof of appropriate aptitude with relation to such labour if by competition—that competition being at the same time free and unrestrained—the degree of aptitude on the part of all competitors were made known—the chance in favour of the objects of their care would instead of being equal to certainty be but as one to ten or twenty or whatsoever greater multiple of their own number might be that of their fellowcompetitors moreover as—natural talents and other means being supposed equal—proficiency will be in the direct ratio of exertion and exertion in the ratio of degree of need—those who without exertion are sure of having in this shape what they have need of will not bestow any exertion at all on the acquisition of appropriate aptitude and their natural place instead of being certainly at the top will be probably at the bottom of the scale thus it is that to the ends which the greatest happiness principle requires to be pursued will be substituted the direct opposites of those exclusively justifiable ends and while for the benefit of the hands in question the expense of official service or of the appearance or the false pretence of it without so much as the pretence of it is maximized—appropriate aptitude for the performance of it will be minimized instructional exemplificational art    or   the more immediately education for office is under the direction of the ruling few in whose hands the fixation of the quantum of remuneration and the location of those by whom it is to be received are conjoined—the more striking and instructive will here be the exemplification of the relation between cause and effect instructional expositive art    or   note that in the case of pecuniary competition is comprised in a certain way the case of gratuitous service gratuitous     service constituting one point or say degree in a scale of indefinite length established by pecuniary competition at the same time there is a necessity in marking the distinction between them the difference in point of efficiency and extent of application being so great the application of gratuitous service including that which is so in appearance and is always called so being widely extensive while the application of pecuniary competition to personal service in this branch of the public business is nearly if not altogether as yet without example applied to the expense of the official establishment taken in its totality expense of remuneration for personal service included it is not in the power of pecuniary competition by reduction of expense to carry on good economy anything near to the point of gratuitousness—the point at which expense is equal 0 at the same time if applied to the purpose of engaging personal service in particular official situations it is capable of carrying that same benefit not only up to the gratuitous point but to a degree to an indefinite amount higher the matter of wealth being but one of divers instruments by the application of which personal service is engaged others being power reputation and dignity the dignity that which results from the nature of the occupation with or without factitious honour and dignity superadded in such sort that instead of receiving money in compensation for the service rendered by him in taking upon himself the obligation of exercising the functions of the office considered as a burthen—a man will be content to give money for the faculty of exercising those same functions that same faculty being regarded by him as a benefit but in the instances of gratuitous service here alluded to in so far as remuneration in a pecuniary shape has place neither is it paid avowedly by the hands of government for service performed in the situations in question nor is service in any shape rendered to the whole community nor otherwise than to a small particular and sinister interest of a small part at the expense of the interest of the whole which is thereby accordingly disserved instead of served in so much that in so far as this same alleged service is performed the remuneration derived from it belongs not to the present case and being so completely unfit or adverse to the purpose of the pecuniary competition—required to be with proportionable care distinguished from it in english practice to this head belongs the situation of member of the house of commons and member of the unpaid magistracy styled justices of the peace in these instances nominally the service is uniformly gratuitous really so according as abuse does not or does take place instructional ratiocinative art    or   to the proposed aptitudesecuring and expenseminimizing system as composed of the public examination system and the pecuniary competition system taken together but followed by the choice left to the locating functionary—various considerations in the character of objections present themselves as having been or being more or less likely to be urged with all employable diligence they have been searched for and found reducible under the heads following— i objection to the public examination part of the system   timid merit excluded   the unopulent excluded thence equality violated ii objections to the pecuniary competition part of the system   venality established   munificence or say liberality excluded   depredation sharpened by indigence invited   aptitude diminished aptitude being as opulence of these in their order with their answers ratiocinative art  0 or   objection   timid merit excluded answer in the case of a more or less considerable proportion of those who otherwise would be candidates for office this effect may ensue but it presents not to any precise amount so much as a deduction from the aggregate of the good effects expectable from the system nor anything more than the shadow of a reason for the rejection of it yet entire rejection if anything is what it calls for proportional number of the individuals excluded by this their misfortune say at random and only for arguments sake onetenth suppose then the system to be in other respects a beneficial one—such it will be—in the first place to the whole body of the unexcluded candidates on their several individual accounts in the next place to the whole community on the aggregate account give effect then to the objection and for the sake of the unliquidated benefit to the onetenth the remaining ninetenths will be deprived of that same benefit in one shape and the whole of the community in the other on the other hand suppose the system rejected this same onetenth for whose sake it is rejected in what determinable way will they respectively be benefited by the rejection to this question all answer is impossible then as to the existence of the alleged justificative cause of the proposed rejection—the supposed merit in the instance of this tenth part where is or can be the proof of it true it is that in whatever line of study or instruction the merit is supposed to have place—timidity to the degree and to the effect in question is not incompatible with it but on the other hand of the existence of the merit neither conclusive nor any how weakly soever     presumptive evidence does the timidity afford of merit in a word timidity may be an accompaniment but is not a cause this and all other objections notwithstanding—suppose now the public examination system established—observe what with regard to merit and timidity will be the consequence the trial to be submitted to being alike visible to all eyes each individual who might otherwise feel disposed to enter upon this career will consider and ask himself whether he has nerve enough to undergo it let the answer be in the negative he will then bid adieu to a pursuit for which his own judgment pronounces him unfit and betake himself to one for which it pronounces him fit so doing where will be his loss answer—nowhere for proof see answer to objection   before him lie for his choice all professions and other profitseeking occupations the profit from which is—not as here confined within the narrowest limits possible but altogether unlimited so much for proofs in a pecuniary shape as to reputation and esteem for services rendered to the public by intellectual labour—the press is open to him—and timidity—at any rate the sort of timidity here in question—is no bar to any use he may feel disposed to make of it ratiocinative art    or  0 but the proposed system—does it not hold up to view unopulence as an efficient cause of aptitude answer true but only when in a certain degree and in that degree only as a partially contributing cause and that a remotely operating one operating through the medium of appropriate examination true it is that in the character of a learner looking to be one day a probationer and competitor for offices—a man whose pecuniary supplies are scanty is likely to use more exertion than a man whose pecuniary circumstances are abundant—to use more exertion and thence in so far as depends upon exertion to acquire a greater degree of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude but the immediately applying probative test of this same appropriate aptitude is—not the situation in the scale of opulence but the result of the examination undergone and by this immediately applying direct evidence what little probative force belong to the faint and remotely applying presumptive evidence is superseded and reduced to nothing ratiocinative art    or    objection   the unopulent excluded thus equality violated answers—   the provision for equality must always be subordinate to that for security or society cannot subsist see leading principles c   supposed relation of equality not real the supposed loss to the classes in question will not have place into this source their industry could not be turned in quest of profit without being turned aside from other sources much more lucrative to the quantity obtainable by them from this source there would be limits and those rendered as narrow as by application made of the frugalitymaximizing principle appropriate aptitude on the part of rulers could render them to what is obtainable by every man from other sources there are no such limits   the bar opposed to the unopulent by the proposed instrument of frugality is not—like the bar opposed under some governments by want of nobility—an impassible one by raising himself to a degree of opulence adequate to the purchase of the office—the most unopulent man supposing him demonstrated to be by intellectual attainments qualified for it will be able to acquire it   by the access which by the objection is proposed to be left to the unopulent—entrance into office would neither be secured to them nor rendered so probable to them as to the more opulent the greater the opulence the greater the means of access to patrons who of course belong to the opulent class   from the rejection of this necessary security great would be the quantity of incontestable evil pressing upon this very class—evil pressing upon them in a much more tangible and sensible shape than any good of the chance of which it is charged with depriving them can be shown to wear burthen of taxation to the amount of the money which the competition would save is in proportionable quantities added to that of the matter of patronage with its corruptive influence mass of pecuniary remuneration saleable say £ 000000 ayear saving effected by the competition £ 00000 to reject this instrument of economy would thus be to impose a tax of £ 00000 ayear on opulent and unopulent together and this for no better purpose than the turning aside the profitseeking industry of the unopulent from other channels into this   by the rejection of this proposed instrument of frugality an exclusion would be put—not only upon the frugality but upon the bringing into play a main security for and thence instrument of appropriate aptitude namely relish for the business the less the emolument—in other words the more a man gives for the office—the greater is thus proved to be his relish for the business of it while to him who gives nothing for it it may be an object of disgust of disgust not surmountable but by the extreme of indigence no says another objection what is proved is—not the alleged relish but a plan for getting possession of the office for the purpose of converting into an instrument of depredation the powers belonging to it reply of no such plan is the formation in any degree probable this objection is objection   depredation   0 c which with the answers will be found in its place ratiocinative art    or    objection   venality established the plan makes offices venal it introduces venality into office answer   source of the objection confusion of ideas confusion produced by the misapplication of the word what is proposed to be sold is—not to individual suitors at the office the acquiror of it but to the acquiror himself the emolument in a particular shape attached to it   to find such a form of words as should give to the objection as above a sort of superficial colour of reasonableness required some industry that which the objection applies to is—not the arrangement itself but a particular word or two which are capable of being employed in speaking of it for example the modes in which the amount of the pecuniary part of the remuneration is capable of being reduced and minimized are as above shown two to wit—  the reductional mode according to which mention is made of the greatest reduction the bidder will consent to see made from a determinate salary proposed   the emptional mode according to which mention is made of the greatest sum he will give for it if unreduced employ the reductional form of expression the objection vanishes but the emptional being in effect precisely the same thing as the reductional so likewise does the objection to the emptional   the party to whom service in any shape is rendered by the arrangement is the public alone not any individual whatsoever of no individual is any service bought by of none any sold to any other   associated with the idea of venality is that of corruption and by the objection is meant if anything that by the arrangement as often as it is exemplified corruption in some shape or other has place or at the least is probabilized and that thence in some shape or other so is relative inaptitude   but the real effect of the arrangement is precisely the reverse for   minimizing the pecuniary value of the situation it minimizes the quantity of the matter of corruption which the patronage places in the hands of the locating functionary     minimizing the value of the pecuniary remuneration it maximizes as above the degree of relish which the candidate is likely to have for the functions which he is desirous of having the exercise of for the less the inducement he requires in the shape of money the greater is the inducement he possesses in the shape of relish or he would not make the offer which by the supposition he does make   minimizing the value of the situation and thence of the patronage it minimizes the probability of its being given by the patron to a protégé whose sole relish is for the money and who in regard to the functions has neither relish nor aptitude in any shape   as to corruption so far then from acting as a ferment to it the competition system is in the emptional as well as in the reductional mode a specific against that disorder it is for want of such a specific that corruption takes place when it does take place   in vain would it be said—a man who sees sinister profit in this or that shape as being capable of being made from an abuse of the powers attached to the situation—will offer and give more for it than one who sees no such prospect in vain for by the reduction thus made in the quantity of money the man will have at command no addition is made to whatever facility he will have for such abuse on the contrary as above that facility is diminished by the diminution of whatever facility he may have as to the finding associates and supporters for the abuse the greater the reduction he will thus submit to—and still further if so it be that he offers to give more for the salary than it is worth the more he offers to give for it—the more strongly he draws upon himself the attention of all concerned and puts them upon the watch to find out—by what course he expects and proposes to himself to endeavour to reap the sinister profit supposed to be in contemplation suppose even that as applied to the state of things under this or that existing government the objection would be a fatal one—it would not follow that it would amount to anything when applied to the one here proposed for in no existing government can any system of securities for appropriate aptitude be found comparable in point of efficiency to what may be seen proposed here ratiocinative art    or    objection   munificence or say liberality excluded—exclusion put upon that virtue in one quarter by which merit in other quarters and in all manner of shapes is brought into existence answer let but misapplication of words be argument—argument affording in the present case justification for useless and pernicious expense—true it will be that as good argument may be made out of the word munificence or the word liberality as out of the word venality liberality may perhaps serve still better than munificence being more extensively in use especially on the popular side it is more strongly as well as extensively associated with the sentiment of approbation and by the laxity of its import better adapted to the purpose of delusion but such being the nature of the arguments see now on what ground stands the title of either of them to the property of giving birth to merit when on the one part what is called liberality is exercised the alleged existence of merit on the other part—on the part of him or those in favour of whom the selfstyled virtue is     exercised is constantly alleged constantly alleged—so far from being constantly proved it is seldom so much as attempted to be proved the place of proof is occupied by assertion of the assertion when orally delivered the probative force is as the loudness and reiteratedness of it joined to the force and number of eulogistic epithets and phrases bestowed on the alleged possessor of the asserted merit and scorn with the imputation of envy and insincerity on all who presume to question it in the official establishment of the city of london conquests have it has been said been of late years made of official situations more than one by the virtue of liberality from the vice of venality these conquests made and the source of them—a corresponding quantity of patronage—put into official pockets the substance has now been seen of the eloquence by which these conquests were achieved ratiocinative art    or    objection   depredation sharpened by indigence when a man has paid the purchasemoney says the objection he will be left in a state of indigence such as will render it as it were a matter of necessity to him to commit depredation at any hazard answers—   the objection supposes that by a certain or an ascertainable quantity of emolument attached to the office the endeavour to commit depredation may be prevented or at least in an adequate degree improbabilized altogether groundless is this supposition draw the line where you will true it is the comparatively unopulent functionary will it is probable endeavour to commit depredation and commit it he will if in his eyes the benefit of the depredation is greater than the burthen from detection probability in regard to detection being taken into account this will the comparatively unopulent do but so will the comparatively opulent the most opulent of functionaries have always been the most voracious of depredators witness monarchs almost without exception and more particularly the most absolute witness even the best of kings as he was so commonly called witness he whose debts it was asserted in parliament had been nine times paid by parliament notwithstanding his million ayear—the exemption he gave himself from the income tax—and his seventeen millions obtained for his own particular use—without previous declaration of war—by the instrumentality of a richly remunerated judge—in pointblank contradiction to an act of the legislature passed in the year      the decrees issued without other warrant than the words droits of admiralty the assertion that the king is lord high admiral with reference made to an order of the king alone dated in the year       and that king charles the second   in the situation of the comparatively opulent the probability of depredation is greater than in the case of the comparatively unopulent on two accounts   in consideration of and in proportion to his opulence and the erroneously but commonly and naturally entertained supposition of the security afforded for his probity by that same opulence he will be less suspected—less closely watched   in proportion to his opulence will be as per section    remuneration art   his facility for obtaining accomplices in transgression and effectual supporters to screen him against punishment dislocation and even disrepute instances see everywhere   of the absence of any such degree of indigence as can probabilize a sharpness of appetite sufficient to produce depredation—a highly probative evidence is afforded by the very nature of the transaction here proposed what a man gives for the office with the emolument attached he would not give if in his eyes the emolument with his remaining income if he has any will not be sufficient for his exigencies instructional ratiocinative exemplificational art    or    this was the argument against economy brought out and made the most of on the occasion of his sham economy bill by edmund burke foaming with rage at neckers disinterestedness then staring him in the face—edmund burke on whose principle thus displayed the accidentally divulgated depredation committed by two of his protegés† formed not long afterwards so instructive a comment a document in no small degree instructive to the great body of the people would be a list of at length notified depredators with the particulars of their respective crimes under a system of sinecure and overpay with an assurance of support and protection with the commencement of the reign of george the third it might commence and be continued onwards as occasion called till the time should it ever arrive when the eyes of the people having been sufficiently opened the scene had closed instructional ratiocinative art    or    in this objection what there is of truth or at least of the semblance of it rests altogether upon a state of things in respect of official management and remuneration in its whole tenor the direct opposite of the one here proposed a man whose life has been a life of luxury without anything of his own to support it—the dependent of some patron whose habits have been correspondently luxurious—is put into an office with the emolument which has been attached to it for the purpose of enabling him to continue in the     same habits if then this same emolument is not by more than to a certain amount beneath his habitual expenditure—he confines himself within the bounds of it and neither peculation nor extortion have place but if it is to a certain amount lower he finds himself to such a degree uncomfortable that rather than continue so he risks the engaging in some one or more of the forbidden practices and exposing himself to the consequences but it may be asked knowing his own propensities how came he to take upon himself the office and thus subject himself to this risk answer nothing better offered the situation of absolute dependence was uncomfortable the mass of emolument in question how inadequate soever constituted by the whole amount of it a portion at any rate of the means of independence—and the general character of the whole establishment of which this office forms a part was that of maximizing the facilities for ease on the one hand combined with accustomed though unlegalized profit in every shape on the other as to the punishment he saw it altogether without example dislocation and that selfeffected and in the quietest and most unobserved mode the worst that could ensue dislocation and from what from an office which after experience was found not to give what was expected from it such is the state of things—such the frame of government in which the objection originated and on each occasion will be reproduced but of the whole multitude of securities here proposed against abuse scarcely will that system be found to exhibit so much as a single one ratiocinative art    or    objection   aptitude diminished aptitude being as opulence lessening opulence you lessen aptitude thus for shortness for precision a few more words are necessary by opulence understand—not opulence already possessed by the functionary but opulence given to him given to him at public expense this being understood say once more aptitude is as opulence this is the whole theory on which all practice is grounded this being an axiom may without difficulty be taken for a postulate if therefore in any situation you have not aptitude enough it is because you have not given out money enough give money enough the aptitude comes of course all other care is superfluous whatsoever be the situation if you want twice the aptitude in it that you have at present—give the man who is in it twice the money you had given him you have twice the aptitude note also that on divers occasions the more he has the more of it must be given to him instance the metamorphosis of an indiscriminate defender of right and wrong into a judge the stronger the repugnance between the two characters the greater the force necessary to effect the transition from the one to the other giving out money is in english treasury language making exertions if anywhere you want more aptitude you must make proportionable exertions giving out money being the cause—establish this cause the effect follows of course of a barrel full of spirits turn the cock out flows the spirits into the pocket of the functionary in with the money—in with it flows the aptitude as to how this happens this is in both cases matter of theory no need have you to trouble yourself with it this objection comes in aid of the one last preceding by which economy is presented in the character of a sure cause of depredation instead of giving receive money as the price—of the power or other object of desire attached to the office—you will says the objection have the reverse of aptitude and the more money you receive from the functionary the more flagrantly unapt in every respect he will be on the other hand says the basis of the present objection aptitude being as opulence—give twice the emolument you give at present you will have twice the aptitude and so on ad infinitum put the two objections together you have a triumphant dilemma offer it says with the office any less emolument than that which you will find attached to it—either no person whatever will accept of it or if any one will his acceptance of it will be a certain proof of his inaptitude for it with no other purpose than that of employing it as an instrument of depredation will the acceptance have been given to it—the offer will not be accepted—so says horn the first of this same irresistible dilemma good but why will it not be accepted answer because to be accepted it must have been made and it will not have been made but why will it not have been made answer because by nobody but the maker of the dilemma can it have been made and what he has made is—not the offer but the determination not to make it and why this determination answer because he has always been so perfectly convinced that the offer if made would be accepted and when accepted followed by consequences the opposite to those which his dilemma assigned to it to his own assertion his own conduct gives the lie tell him of any other country in which the rate is less then come two other objections   that country differs from this   of the smallness of the remuneration the result is actually in that country a proportionable degree of inaptitude—then for proof comes the assumption just disposed of as to the difference—propose any inquiry into it whether for example it is so great as to warrant in the whole or in any part the practical conclusion deduced from it—oh no this would be too much trouble so will say the objector and in this instance what he     says may be admitted for true a committee would not be very instructively employed in the inquiry whether it be true—that when a man breaks a contract for the performance of which no such securities as might be are provided it is because it does not give him all he would have been glad to get from it and not for want of those same necessary securities concluding instruction to the publicopinion tribunal instructional art   to the public opinion tribunal it will belong with all its energies to urge the commencement and urge on the progress of the system of appropriate instruction here delineated by the most powerful particular and sinister interests—the several ministers with their several dependants and other connexions whoever they are will at all times be urged to do their utmost for the retardation and if possible the frustration of it of this repugnance the cause is no less manifest than the existence is unpreventable till the tests of aptitude thus furnished are in operation the locating functionaries will of necessity remain in possession of a power of choice altogether arbitrary apt or in ever so high a degree unapt their several dependants and connexions will remain located and locable in all situations under them respectively from the least to the most highly desirable on the other hand no sooner are these tests of aptitude in operation than by the influx of tried minds whose aptitude has been made manifest to all eyes the sceptre of arbitrary power will be swept out of their hands and the feelings of a dethroned despot will be theirs instructional art   the whole artillery of fallacies will be drawn out and employed in particular the better the plan is in theory the more incapable it will be pronounced of being carried into effect in practice and to the thus predicted impracticability all imaginable exertions will be employed to give fulfilment instructional art   if and in proportion as in the dominion of the state apt instructors whose native language is the national language are wanting—either the functionaries must remain uninstructed and unapt or under the disadvantage of having to learn at a more or less advanced period of life a foreign tongue foreigners must be called in and employed but unless in case of temporary calamity men will not for nothing quit their old accustomed habits and connexions for those of a strange land and thus under the double mask of patriotism and frugality sinister interest will seek and with but too much probability of success a cover for mischievous and antipatriotic exclusions instructional art   unhappily no sooner has the system come into operation than a dilemma in no small degree unwelcome to every feeling eye will have taken place either to an incalculable amount sacrifice of the public good—of the good of every branch of the service—must have place or notwithstanding any the most perfect degree of moral aptitude a more or less considerable number of functionaries will have to quit their several situations instructional art   for minimizing the evil from these two opposite sources—one means however there is the application of which will be completely in the power of those functionaries whose situation exposes them to it according to their several situations let those in possession participate in the instruction administered to their successors in expectancy at this price they will add those titles whatever they be in which others are sharers with them to that experience which is peculiar to themselves should pride be troublesome let this fact quiet it anno      in london john macculloch having acquired the reputation of proficiency in the art and science of political economy instituted a

part of an accuser any administration functionary how apt soever for his own line of service might to a certainty be dislocated in the case of any functionary in a situation subordinate to that of minister army and navy subdepartments excepted small it is true might be the probability of any such confederacy not equally so however by a great deal in the case of a minister for instance a minister of the army navy foreign relation or finance subdepartment well might it be worth the while of a foreign enemy to employ—in engaging by bribery the two judges to concur in a judgment to that effect—a sum too vast to be resisted by any ordinary degree of moral aptitude ratiocinative art  0 reason   such would be the danger—supposing the exemption limited as it is not established on the other hand suppose it established—small if any is the danger of continuance in office on the part of an unapt administrative functionary in the course of a prosecution of the functionary in question

length of continuance in the several situations separately taken or any of them answer no such increase on this account     in any instance reasons for the negative in every case are—   of any mass of emolument that could be appointed for this purpose the receipt would be prevented by the pecuniary competition in so far as it operated   in so far as such prevention failed to have place the increase in question would give correspondent increase to public expense   of no increase in the amount of the reduction made in the expense by increase given to the reductional biddings does such an arrangement afford any prospect by a prospect of future contingent emolument at a distance men in general are not so numerously or so strongly influenced as by a prospect of emolument of the same value immediate or near at hand by it no increase would be given to appropriate aptitude either in a direct way or in an indirect way by increase given to competition   the reasons against it present themselves as not differing materially from those which have place in the case where instead of continuance in the office dislocation out of it by resignation has place that is to say in compliance with request made by the person himself as per section    remuneration arts         on the occasion of his biddings under the pecuniary competition principle he will be at liberty of course to stipulate for an eventual provision of this nature if in his judgment his interest will by such an arrangement be preponderantly served instructional ratiocinative art    should any and if any what increase be in this case given to remuneration at the expense of the public on the account of length of service in the official establishment taken in the aggregate answer reasons for the negative the same as those which apply to the case where as per art    the situation continued in is a single situation separately considered ratiocinative art    should any and if any what increase be in this case given to remuneration at the expense of the public on account of length of continuance in life or say longevity answer reasons for the negative   with no material difference the reasons are those which have place in the case of continuance in the service as per arts         to those to whose interior dispositions and exterior circumstances any such distant increase is adapted—means of producing the effect are open other than that of a provision appointed as in the case here in question for all persons without exception as well for those to whose case it is not as to those to whose case it is adapted   if settled by any general rule—it would in the case of every individual be liable to be either too great or too small too great the difference being thereby to the detriment of the whole community bestowed in waste or too little not sufficient for the exigencies of the individual whatever they were that were thought fit to be provided for   in no case will the exigencies of the individual be altogether dependant upon the number of years during which his life has continued but supposing that it is the smaller the remuneration he receives at the expense of the public service the greater is the regard he thus manifests for the good of that same service   the quantum if not determined by any such just and inflexible standard would be required to be determined by the individual will of some other functionary in this case the determination would be much more arbitrary than when as in the case of dislocation the question is—whether a man shall or shall not be deprived of the whole the eye of the publicopinion tribunal would not be so jealous and watchful in this case as in that   in this case misdirected sympathy real or pretended—regard for the happiness of the few at the expense of that of the many—would in the situation of locating patrons be for swelling the demand and working to this end upon the sympathy of others for the purpose of engaging sympathy in support of excess a commonlyemployed notion is—that a sort of moral merit is manifested by the employing time and labour in the service of the public in contradistinction to the service of the individual erroneous and fallacious is this notion naturally small and altogether incalculable exceptions excepted—no more is the good of the public service taken into the calculation of him who gives his time and labour for what he gets from it than by him who gives his goods for what he gets from it but supposing that it is the smaller the remuneration he receives at the expense of the public the greater is the regard he thus manifests for the good of that same service   the annexing to official situations remuneration to any greater amount than in the estimation of the individual functionary himself is needful is in the breasts of patrons more likely to have had selfregard than benevolence for its cause and is sure to have a net balance—not of beneficence but of maleficence for its effect   it would tend to people the establishment with individuals who at entrance were more advanced in life—to the exclusion of those less advanced and in that way to give not only useless but worse than useless increase to the expense   the less the pecuniary provision exacted by the proposed functionary at the expense of the public as necessary for his exigencies—the greater will be the quantum of that     which he has already of his own and the greater thereby his pecuniary responsibility to the purpose of eventual satisfaction for loss occasioned by him to the service  0 the greater the provision for eventual addition on the account of length of age the more efficient would be the tendency of the system to people the establishment with individuals absolutely or comparatively destitute of responsibility in the pecuniary sense instructional art    locable who to the legislature it will belong to consider—in what if in any subdepartments and in each subdepartment in what official situations subordinate to that of minister the principles applied as per section    locable who to the situation of minister will be applicable with beneficial effect

filling up vacancies for this purpose—in the present case so also in that of the day on which the location instrument is delivered in at the prime ministers office recordation will thereon be made

 —the locatee will not be liable to be dislocated by the prime minister otherwise than subject to the limitations attached to the dislocative power by section    oppression obviated ratiocinative instructional art  0 question to what end this security for despatch answer reasons—   to prevent the superordinate functionary from suffering vacancies to continue unfilled for indefinite lengths of time and thereby suffering the functions to remain unexercised and the business to be either put to a stand or exercised by functionaries whose responsibility to the publicopinion tribunal is diminished for want of its seeing in what manner exercise is given by them to the powers which in fact are exercised by them as to this matter see section    art    as applied to the situation of minister instructional art    on the occasion of the filling up of situations become from whatever cause vacant—questions which will naturally present themselves for consideration are the following—   the situation—shall it devolve as of course upon the depute permanent of the last occupant or upon one and which—if there be deputes permanent more than one   the qualification examination the result of which as per section    art    every admission into the list of locables and thence every admission into the official establishment for the first time has had for its efficient cause—shall it be undergone anew—by whatsoever candidates for location in the recently vacated office there may be   the pecuniary competition if any which in the instance of each official situation has on the occasion of the first location therein made had place between the successful candidate and his competitors—shall it antecedently to the filling up of the vacancy have place anew   promotion—in what shape if in any can it and shall it in this case have place ratiocinative art    question   in this department in any instance on a vacancy shall the situation devolve of course upon a depute permanent without power to the minister to make any other choice answer reasons for the negative   the obligation which would thus be imposed upon the minister would not be compatible with the need there is for the arrangement by which as per section    he is rendered in a greater or less degree responsible for the conduct of his subordinates   unless some particular reason to the contrary presented itself whether in disfavour of a depute or in favour of some locable person other than a depute—a depute would be the person towards whom in the first instance the eyes of the minister in his character of locator would naturally direct themselves     the greater the advantage thus possessed by the depute under a system of free choice the less the advantage that would be secured to him by securing to him the succession to it to the exclusion of free choice   under a system of free choice—the whole number of the persons whose names have place on the locable list will at all times remain as under all eyes in general so in particular under those of the locating minister should any other person whose name is on that list present himself to the conception of the minister as possessing appropriate aptitude in a degree superior to what has been deemed to have place on the part of the depute—the ministers responsibility as above will operate on him as an inducement to the giving to such more apt candidate the preference instructional ratiocinative art    question   the qualification examination—shall it as above be in any case repeated if yes shall the repetition of it be by the legislature ordained to have place in all cases—or should power without obligation be given to the minister for the repetition of it answer to the ministers having it in every instance in his power to receive the information which would be furnished by the examination in question there seems no possible objection by him in his situation no sinister advantage could be derived from it the interest of the public requires that for the guidance of his judgment he should be in possession of the completest stock of appropriate information obtainable and for his possessing it this is the most effectual if not the only adequate means the only danger to be apprehended is—his not giving to this instrument of instruction exercise so frequent as the interest of the public would require instructional art    note that for enabling the locating functionary to give to himself this information—no additional judicatory and thence no considerable addition to delay and expense would be necessary under section    locable who the qualification judicatory will be in existence and periodically at work for the purpose of giving admission into the locable list in this state of things candidates for admission into the vacant situation will if not prohibited be at liberty to aggregate themselves to the body of examinees for the purpose of making manifestation of their respective degrees of appropriate aptitude having it thus still in their power some there will naturally be who if they see a probability of thereby eclipsing the depute or deputes belonging to the several situations will of their own accord subject their own aptitude to this fresh test and to this number an express invitation given by the minister might have the effect of making addition instructional ratiocinative art    in this way alone can appropriate provision have place for the case where the vacancy leaves in the situation of deputes persons more than one for in this way alone—to wit by the course taken by them respectively as to the affording or forbearing to afford to him this information—can the locating minister obtain for the guidance of his judgment such lights as they being the most instructive which the nature of the case affords it may happen to him really to desire in this way alone can the tutelary influence of the publicopinion tribunal as applied to the securing of appropriate aptitude on the part of functionaries belonging to the classes in question be maximized instructional art    note that the situations to which the question bears reference cannot be any others than those which as per section    locable who art    are situations of talent applied to situations of mere trust the result of the operation would be time and labour expended without use of any imposition of labour in the shapes in question on candidates—the effect might be—a reduction more or less considerable in the number of those who would otherwise take part in the pecuniary competition and thence an increase in the expense instructional ratiocinative art    question   the pecuniary competition shall it in these same cases or any and which of them be repeated answer   the result of pecuniary competition being with relation to the locating functionary—in the same manner as the information afforded by qualification examination—instructional merely not obligatory—it is accordingly as completely free from objection as that has been seen to be   the minimization of the expense—or at the worst the proof that in that line of improvement the utmost that can be done has been done—is a beneficial effect which so long as no preponderant evil has been shown to have place will suffice to decide in favour of this case   were any objection to be found that could apply to the admission of the pecuniary competition—it would be removed by the consideration of the inadmissibility of any comprehensive arrangement by which on the occasion of a vacancy the location in it would be secured to the occupant of the situation next below to establish as a general rule that in all branches of the civil as well as in the two branches of the military service superiority of grade shall be accompanied with a correspondent superiority of emolument—would be to establish a system of boundless waste   in this or that station in this subdepartment     may be seen a situation of talent to which by reason of the smallness of the number of persons possessed of adequate appropriate talent necessary and the magnitude of the remuneration obtainable in the same line of art and science from service to individuals—it may be necessary to attach emolument to an indefinitely large amount next above may be a situation to which no such superiority of talent being necessary but which being a situation of high trust with or without incidental patronage might find persons willing to fill it for the sake of the power and honour with emoluments in small quantity or even without any instructional ratiocinative art    question   promotion consistently with the abovementioned proposed arrangements—so far as regards service other than military can any such system or practice as that indicated by the word promotion be with propriety said to have place answer it should seem not reasons   the objections which as per art    inhibit the necessitating the location of a depute into a vacancy created by the dislocation of the principal apply also to this case   they do so with increased force for be the situation what it will—evidence more probative as to appropriate aptitude of the functionary will have been afforded by the manner in which he has performed the business of the situation in question—than any that can in general have been afforded by the manner in which he has conducted the business of another and subordinate situation the business of which may happen to be in any degree different   to any degree of extent it might happen—that in the scale of directive power and correspondent superordination and subordination—in this or that instance the higher grade would to persons in general all circumstances considered be not so acceptable as the grade next below it in that same subdepartment or even a grade inferior to the next below it   it would be a negative upon spontaneous migration and upon the transference of a functionary from a situation in one subdepartment to a situation which though it belonged to another subdepartment might on good grounds be deemed more congenial to his faculties as well as his inclinations and if the inhibition were not thus all comprehensive—to reduce it within the most apposite bounds would necessitate a system of complicated arrangements such that the evil produced by the complication and the addition thereby made to the bulk of the rule of action would outweigh the utmost possible good producible by it instructional ratiocinative art    on the nature of the distribution proper to be made of power grade and emolument in nonmilitary situations—the distribution necessary to be made in military situations may in the way of contrast throw some light in the army service it is of necessity that power and thence grade should rise in proportion to extent of command as determined and measured by the number of individual functionaries subjected to it confusion and anarchy would be the result if a functionary having under his command a comparatively larger number—say a thousand men—were subjected constantly or incidentally to the directive function of another having under his command no more than a comparatively smaller number—a hundred men for example superiority of grade and power thus keeping pace of necessity with extent of command—and in a stipendiary army emolument to an amount more or less considerable being an essential and inseparable feature—addition to emolument—an addition keeping pace with addition to grade and power—was an obvious and natural accompaniment and hitherto has perhaps universally been an actual one it follows not however that even in that line of service it is a necessary one in the general nature of the case howsoever in the instance of this or that particular political community it may have been rendered so by local and temporary circumstances even when not combined with pecuniary emolument or with the matter of good applied as matter of reward in any other shape—power has its value and as has been shown in section    located how—is capable of operating not only as an inducement but of itself as an adequate and effectual one to the application of time and labour to courses of operation to which but for the inducement they would not be applied but of the adequacy of the mass of inducement in one shape the consequence is—not needfulness but needlessness of inducement in any other shape if in any one instance military subordination has place without being accompanied with emolument in any shape—this one instance suffices to prove that in that line of public service no such correspondent superiority in the scale of emolument is matter of necessity and of such gratuitous service the examples are numerous and extensive the result therefore appears to be—that of the degree of correspondency which has hitherto had place the cause is to be looked for—rather in habit and the propensity to imitation than in the necessity of the case instructional ratiocinative art  0 if to necessity it is to necessity in another shape—it is to necessity of a local and temporal character—that in the case of a stipendiary army and navy—more particularly a stipendiary army—the customary allcomprehensive correspondence between altitude in the scale of power and altitude in the scale of emolument is to be attributed in  00 this or that country—whatever at the time in question were the proportions—if an arrangement were expected to be made for reducing to a certain amount the scale of emolument—the proposed conjunct scales of grade and power remaining unreduced—resignation to an extent having the effect of dissolution—resignation or even revolt—might be the consequence to the case of nonmilitary functionaries however no such danger applies the consequence is—that to the complete disregard of symmetry—as exemplified in a mutual correspondency in the three scales of grade power and emolument—no objection on the ground of necessity has place instructional exemplificational art    for elucidation a glance at an arrangement made in russia by catherine the second may perhaps on this occasion have its use from the military situations analogy conducted her or her advisers to the nonmilitary and a scale of superiority and inferiority in rank with or without correspondent subordination and superordination in respect of exercise given to the directive function was the result it was borrowed it has been said from the practice of some other state or states in her native country—germany but by the conspicuousness of her situation her name has been stampt upon it be this as it may—in two respects it was a system of no small importance beneficial to a considerable extent it was and is maleficial to a much greater extent beneficial inasmuch as it is in its nature a vast source or mine of hope so many situations in the whole official establishment—so many objects of desire endeavour competition and hope open as at first sight might appear to the entire of one of the sexes and thence it might seem to one half of the whole population here then was a good placed within possibility of acquirement before the individuals in question considered in their individual capacity but by it was maximization given to the quantity of the matter of good applicable in the shape of matter of reward which by misapplication operates and continues to operate as matter of corruption placing within the hope of every individual of the male sex the capacity of serving his own particular interest by contributing to the sacrifice made of the universal interest to the particular interest real or supposed of the monarch by the maximization and perpetuation of arbitrary power in his hands instructional art    like as between the fabricational and the emptional modes of procurement antagonization as per section   functions in all arts       has place—so may it as between fabrication on government account by fabricating functionaries occupying a permanently and repeal excepted perpetually established situation in the official establishment and functionaries occupying situations not continuing any longer than till completion has been given to this or that individual work regard being had to circumstances local and temporary to the different natures of the services in the several subdepartments and to the situation in each several subdepartment—to the legislature it will belong—in relation to any such works as may come to be proposed—to determine to which of the two modes of procurement to give exercise instructional exemplificational art    of such antagonization examples are the following—   fabrication or say construction of a bridge over a wide and rapid river  —of an underground tunnel especially if under water  —of navigable vessels on the old accustomed plans for war purposes  —of steamboats for nonmilitary as well as military purposes by survey taken of the branches of art and science brought to view in section    locable who other examples might be found instructional art    in this or that instance what may happen is—that where for the exercise of the fabricative function unpermanent situations may be most eligible—for the exercise of the custoditive and reparative the exercise of permanent functions in relation to the same subjectmatter—and thus the institution of permanent and even perpetual situations—may be necessary or at any rate preferable instructional ratiocinative art    under a form of government of which corruption is the main instrument and under which on the part of superordinates appropriate aptitude is in a proportion correspondent to the degree of it rare—both the inclination and the ability to make apt choice  0  being accordingly rare—succession determined in ordinary cases by seniority in official age as contradistinguished from natural age—may afford a less bad chance for appropriate aptitude on the part of locatees than would be afforded by an habitual exercise of the power of unrestrained choice by superordinate locators in whose instance to such their power an unrestrained and irresponsible power of dislocation is conjoined instructional ratiocinative art    in such a state of things succession by seniority as above—with correspondent augmentation of emolument on such terms as above—is on several accounts obviously beneficial to the particular personal and sinister interest of the locating superordinate i it gives proportionable increase to the value of his patronage   it gives proportionable increase to the power and efficiency of allective corruptive influence   it gives proportionable increase to the power and efficiency of intimidative corruptive influence if suspected of want of devotedness to the will declared or presumable of the superordinate—the subordinate if not dislocated may at any rate without scandal and censure by the publicopinion tribunal remain unpromoted under a form of government of which corruption is the essence—power through whatever channels it runs having been converted into poison—there and thence it is that for appropriate aptitude as between choice and lot lot would afford the least bad chance instructional art    for obtainment of ordinarily meritorious service—no need nor use is there for augmentation of emolument on account of and in proportion to seniority in age natural or official no more than for the obtainment of commodities good in quality or cheap in price there is for paying for the same commodities to a shopkeeper who is sixty years old more money than to a shopkeeper who is but thirty years old or to a shopkeeper who has been keeping shop for thirty years more money than to one who has been keeping shop for no more than ten years instructional art    for ordinarily meritorious service—an individual master may in this or that instance have good reason for giving to a servant of his own extra remuneration on the score of length of continuance in life or service but it follows not—that at the expense of the public a superordinate functionary should have the same power as to the augmentation of the emolument received by a subordinate any such power will be sure to be employed for the benefit of the superordinate and in case of an antagonization will be little less than sure to be employed for that purpose at the expense and by the sacrifice of the interest of the public service instructional art    no need is there for any such augmentation but for obtainment of extramerit and when it is for that purpose that it is given it is for that purpose and on that account declaredly that it should be given not on the account of length of continuance either in life or of government service bounty on length in either track is prohibition of extramerit the reward that should have been appropriated to extramerit a man gets without it and in proportion as this has place labour and selfsacrifice in

function as to the several modes of vexation corporal and mental see the penal code   by operation performed on some other person or some thing in such sort that the  0  exercise of the function in question is rendered impracticable or less easy as above   by noncompliance with some mandate or requisition which in virtue of his official situation the functionary is empowered to address and does

ratiocinative art    if altogether exempt from inspection as above—any establishment and by means thereof the founder or founders and their successors might give an effective force to regulations repugnant in any degree to the greatest happiness principle and to the ordinances of the state for no otherwise than by appropriate application of the matter of punishment and reward can effective force be given to any imaginable regulation but whosoever for the creation preservation or extension of any institution or establishment attaches a fund to the support of it makes to that purpose a correspondent application of the matter of reward to the purpose of securing on the part of all who share or look to share in the reward conformity to the regulations whatsoever they may be by which the act of foundation is accompanied or followed of the matter of reward application is thus made avowedly and under that name of the matter of punishment not less effectually though not under that name for of the various modes of punishment subtraction of the matter of reward is one and whoso subject to any such subtraction gives his acceptance to the reward renders himself thereby subject to the correspondent punishment and in this way it is—that under the wing of any dominion a dominion still more powerful than itself is but for appropriate precaution liable at any time and anywhere to be established ratiocinative art    if under a representative democracy any secret establishment or institution is thus in a greater or less degree pernicious and dangerous and at the best needless and useless—in a still greater proportion is it salutary supposing it capable of subsisting under an absolute monarchy or aristocracy or a mixture of both for as under such a form of government no open security can the people have against the most excruciating tyranny—thence it follows that if they have any it must be a secret one and by the mere suspicion even supposing it groundless of the

are those who belong to the administration department with or without aid from those belonging to the judiciary by the indirectly applying understand such as are applied otherwise than by prohibition

between functionaries and nonfunctionaries for architecture adapted to these two opposite purposes see section    architectural arrangements   in the audience chamber of each minister and that of each functionary his subordinate of every grade—in situation and characters conspicuous suspended by the side of the table of rules of deportment for suitors c a table exhibiting the rules of deportment as above for functionaries in many points the two sets of rules will coincide in some points they will diverge   as in the proceedings of the judicial department as per ch xii section    and ch xxi judiciary registrars section   minutation how—as in the public so in the secret audiences minutation and registration applied to everything that passes see ch vi section      as in the judiciary department so in this—securities the same for clearness correctness relative completeness and thence undeceptiousness in the evidence so elicited   as in every justice chamber so in every administration functionarys audience chamber—the sort of register styled an incidental complaintbook as per ch xii section    will be ready for the reception of any complaint which at the charge of the functionary—the suitor inspectee or evidenceholder as the case may be—may think fit to make or at the charge of the nonfunctionary the functionary   thus as in judicial business as per ch xii judiciary collectively and ch xvii judicial inspectors and the correspondent procedure code—so in administration business—to the hitherto customary ungrounded and arbitrary mode a determinately and judiciallygrounded mode of procedure is throughout substituted instructional expositive art    as to the above rules of deportment for the more effectual comprehension of them take the analysis following rules—  of purely selfregarding prudence—  of extraregarding prudence—  of negative effective benevolence—  of positive effective benevolence—under one or other of these four heads may be ranked every rule by the observance of which increase can be given to the sum of human happiness call them rules of ethics† or say morality rightly understood instructional expositive art    of these four sets of rules the aggregate may again be distinguished into two groups the first composed of those in regard to which for securing observance to them the sanctions belonging to the penal code may be employed with advantage the others of those in regard to which those same sanctions cannot be or at any rate at the time in question have not been so employed instructional ratiocinative art    rules not thus advantageously enforceable as between individual and individual taken at large may be thus enforceable when applied to the conduct of persons brought into a state of constant and inevitable contact with each other by their particular correlative situations the reason is—that in this latter case a wrong which as between persons capable of keeping themselves separate from each other would be of little or no importance may by means of such constant and inevitable contact be rendered an instrument of constant and intolerable annoyance instructional art    between the respective fields of these two sets of rules the proper place of the line of demarcation depends in no small degree upon the state of the system of judicial procedure the less the quantity of factitious delay vexation and expense engendered by it the less will in this case be the evil of the remedy which they are respectively calculated to administer and the slighter the disease to  0  which application may be made of it to advantage instructional art    in the procedure code belonging to this present constitutional code evil in this shape is endeavoured to be minimized in the codes of several nations and in that of england in particular the endeavour has been rather to maximize it and has been but too extensively successful expense has been maximized for the sake of the profit official and professional extractible out of it delay and vexation increased for the maximization of the expense instructional art    as for the rules of purely selfregarding prudence extraregarding prudence and positive effective benevolence—they belong not to the present occasion as to the rules of negative effective benevolence—many which under a system directed to the ends of justice might be enforced with advantage—and in domestic procedure with a success proportioned to the degree of appropriate aptitude on the part of the domestic legislator and judge actually are enforced with advantage—must under a proceduresystem directed to ends opposite to those of justice be left unenforced and wrong in the several corresponding shapes left unopposed and by any force other than that of the popular or moral sanction unrepressed instructional exemplificational art    the distinction thus brought to view has not altogether escaped the observation of the authors of the existing codes the service of the two military subdepartments—those to wit of the army and navy ministers—being that in which the contact between functionary and functionary is in the highest degree close and constant—and moreover the quantity of mischief liable to be produced to the public service by mutual and unredressed wrongs greatest—endeavours more or less successful have in the correspondent parts of the aggregate code been directed to the repression of such comparatively petty wrongs the repression of which was not as it seemed called for by any such necessity in the case of any other subdepartment instructional art    take for example in english practice an ordinance to which for the purpose in question a place is given in a monarchicallyestablished code styled the articles of war which—with the addition of the annually enactive parliamentarilyestablished code styled the mutiny act—constitutes the whole body of the regulations by which the stipendiary functionaries belonging to the army are governed it is comprised—the whole of it—this same code of good manners in one article—article  0th—of those same articles and is in these words— whatsoever commissioned officer shall be convicted before a general courtmartial of behaving in a scandalous infamous manner such as is unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman shall be discharged from our service provided however that in every charge preferred against an officer for such scandalous or unbecoming behaviour the fact or facts whereon the same is grounded shall be clearly specified instructional ratiocinative art    in and by this exposition such as it is is plainly enough meant to be expressed the substance of the abovementioned rules of deportment as applied to the class of functionaries therein mentioned to the ordinary judicatories—in their stationary situations and with their endlesslyprotracted courses of procedure—of no such indeterminate and unparticularized rules could the enforcement have been committed with any sufficientlygrounded prospect of preponderant advantage to the extraordinary vindicatory to which as above the enforcemen of them is actually given yes for as in other countries so even in england whatsoever if any may have been the imperfections in the organization of that extraordinary judicatory to no ends other than those of justice can the procedure system attached to it ever have been directed never like the system organized for and by the ordinary judicatories—never has it been directed to ends diametrically opposite to the ends of justice maximization to wit of the wealth power and reputation of lawyers official and professional at the expense and by the sacrifice of the comfort and securit of the rest of the community instructional art  0 if in the practice of these military judges instances of a contravention of the rules of justice are ever produced it is by favour or disfavour by hope or fear derived from distant sources it is not by masses of fees the enormity of which as in english nonmilitary judicature rises in regular proportion to the enormity and constancy of the habit of contravention as applied to the very rules the contravention of which the judges in question pretend to be endeavouring to prevent instructional art    inadequate as is the aboveexhibited skeleton in the character of a substitute to a code of good manners such as legislation in its present less immature state might be capable of providing—there seems little doubt of its having answered its purpose in practice with a considerable degree of efficiency of such a result the smallness of the number of  0  prosecutions that have ever occurred under these same articles of war compared with the length of time and the number of the persons subject to them affords no inconsiderable presumption true it is—that by the unwieldiness of the judicatory in this case—and in particular the difficulty of getting together the required number of judges—the force of the presumption is somewhat lessened but in addition comes the general propriety of the deportment on the part of the functionaries of this class as compared with that of individuals of correspondent rank taken at large instructional ratiocinative art    as to the two corresponding codes of good manners here spoken of neither of them can be inserted here reasons are as follows—   for any such minute details the constitutional code is not it should seem the proper place   scarcely is the artandscience sufficiently in advance for the exhibition of them   to a more or less considerable extent variations would be indicated by the diversity of sentiments manners and customs in different regions and communities   as the public mind matures itself the matter of private will be removed into the field of political deontology instructional art    of the comparatively broad features by which to the purposes of satisfaction and punishment at the hands of the ordinary judicature delinquency in its coarser and most prominent shapes is characterized—no adequate portrait—no adequate set of definitions—is as yet to be seen in the code of any nation till these have been settled and delineated as in the penal connected with the present constitutional code they are endeavoured to be—scarcely in the minds of public men will appropriate aptitude be sufficiently ripe for the adequate performance of the still more delicate and difficult task brought to view as above enactive instructional art    case ii oppressee a functionary he can be none other than a subordinate functionary to wit a subordinate belonging to the same subdepartment and subject to the power exercised by the exercise of his superordinates directive function in this case in respect of the need there will be for the subordinate to hold intercourse with the superordinate—the relation of the situation of the subordinate to that of the superordinate is as per art   the same as that of a suitor to any functionary with whom he has business remedies direct and indirect will accordingly be the same enactive art    so likewise when the power the abuse of which is alleged is the power exercised by the exercise of the directive function enactive instructional art    remain the remedies to the abuse of the power exercised by the exercise of the dislocative function   directly applying remedy in this case right of complaint exercisible as per articles    to    but as to satisfaction by relocation the power if exercised by a judge ordinary recommendatory only—as will be seen—not imperative

uses of such recommendation are the following   by the prospect of it and the publicity attached to the procedure—affording a security against ungrounded and insufficiently grounded and thence oppressive dislocation   affording to the dislocatee the means of clearing his reputation from ungrounded imputations ratiocinative art    the due exercise of the functions of a functionary would be liable to be much impeded if so it happened that he were unable to give exercise to them without the instrumentality of a subordinate regarded by him as relatively unapt and by the apprehension of

communication   smallness or magnitude of the number of grades of subordination in the several subdepartments respectively considered section xxii extortion obviated expositive art   by extortion understand on the present occasion extortion committed at the charge of any person whatsoever nonfunctionary or functionary by a functionary belonging to the administration department by means of the power attached to the official situation occupied by him whatsoever it may be expositive art   if by oppression or fear thereof in any one of the four cases as per section    above exemplified profit to himself or any other person is obtained by a functionary at the charge of any other person whatsoever—predatory oppression or in one word extortion is thereby committed expositive art   by oppression at the charge of one person extortion at the charge of another is capable of being committed as where to save any person from ulterior oppression another gives money or renders service in any other shape to the supposed eventual oppressor or to any other person on his account instructional enactive art   for the remedies applicable in the direct and general way to the prevention of extortion see the title thus denominated in the penal code for those applicable in a less direct and to a certain degree peculiar way see section    of this present chapter instructional art   of extortion and fraudulent obtainment combined an example as striking perhaps as any that history ever did or human nature ever could afford may be seen in english judicature exemplificational art   by a species of subordinate judges styled masters in chancery acting under the lord chancellor sole judge of the highest singleseated judicatory suitors are constantly compelled to pay money and to a prodigious amount in the whole to the said masters for attendance alleged by them to have been bestowed by them and known not to have been so bestowed at the same time to a still greater amount to the solicitors a class so called of professional assistants of the parties on both sides for attendances alleged to have been at those same times bestowed by these same solicitors and in this case likewise known not to have been bestowed by any one of them by or for whom payment is compelled for their so mendaciously pretended services in this way it is that in the constant and full view of the english public fraudulent obtainment is combined with and aggravated by extortion justice being to a certainty denied to all who should refuse or be unable to comply with the demand the victim not having in any case any possible means of escape of criminality in this double shape the profit goes into the pockets—in the first place of these subordinate judges and of their thus protected and even compelled accomplices the solicitors in the next place into that of the lord chancellor by whom for the extraction of profit from this and other sources in such disastrous abundance a relative or any other dependant or connexion of his is on each occasion located at pleasure all this without so much as the pretence of application made of any test of appropriate aptitude other than the pretended judgment of the patron to whom were it only by want of time the actual exercise by it would be rendered physically impossible this enormity is matter of perfect notoriety and out of all dispute it has not only been denounced over and over again in various publications but—though without any the least token of disapprobation has of necessity been exposed to view in the pages of a report communicated to the house of commons by a commission composed of men appointed by the present lord chancellor to sit in judgment on the system of procedure of which this practice forms a part and on his conduct in the direction of it were it possible that prosecution should ensue—the defence for no other imaginable defence could there be would consist in the extent long continuance and constancy of the practice the practice of poaching and that of smuggling though neither of them so deeply stained with immorality are both of them still more extensive inveterate and constant but among their accomplices neither have the poachers nor the smugglers men sitting in parliament to secure to them the continuance of the profit—to secure them for ever against punishment and as long as possible from reproach and ignominy of ignominy at the hands of all men to whom justice is not an object of either hatred or indifference     section xxiii peculation obviated expositive art   peculation is where in an indirect way a trustee obtains for himself or another undue profit in a pecuniary or quasipecuniary shape at the charge of an intended benefitee producing thereby loss pecuniary or quasipecuniary or sufferance in some other shape in manner or quantity not intended by the law by or in virtue of which the trust was created expositive art   the trust thus violated may be either private or political political it may be either public or semipublic on the present occasion trust in both these its branches is the object in question public in so far as the loss being pecuniary or quasipecuniary falls upon the public at large semipublic in so far as it falls upon the population of this or that particular class or district expositive art   of the modes in which by a person at large undue profit may in a direct and criminal way be made at the charge of another examples are as follows     theft     fraudulent obtainment     extortion     robbery expositive art   that which would be called theft if committed at the charge of a person at large is called embezzlement when committed by a trustee at the charge of an intended benefitee expositive art   for the direct remedies against peculation see the penal code title peculation for indirect the measures of security brought to view in section   statistic function bissection   lossbooks see also what follows enactive art   whatsoever articles come to be procured for the public service by exercise given by a minister or by any subordinate of his to the procurative function—if the person of whom they are procured be by consanguinity affinity patronship on the one part and aspirancy on the other immediately or interventionally connected with such minister—the minister will in the instrument of contract cause declaration of such connexion to be attached to the other contracting partys name enactive art   moreover with respect to any supposed but not generallyknown tie of connexion—any person may in any public print—leaving with the printer his name and abode in such manner as that communication may be sure to reach him as per procedure code—address to the minister any question tending to impute partiality on that account and to all such questions the minister will either make such answers as to him shall seem meet or else abide all such inferences as may come to be drawn from silence ratiocinative art   so it be but avowed—from no such connexion can any adequate reason be deduced for inhibiting any such contract or imputing improbity as of course in respect thereof to the functionary or such his relative as per art   the person of whom it can be obtained best and cheapest is the person of whom in every case the article ought to be procured and if between one dealer and another there is not in these respects any difference—of which of them the article is procured is to the public and ought to be to the government a matter of indifference ratiocinative art   so it be but avowed and publicly known—so far from being conducive to peculation a connexion of this sort would rather be a security against it for by this means the public eye which in the case of a person not supposed to be thus connected might remain closed upon the transaction would naturally be wide opened to it ratiocinative art  0 under these circumstances—if a participation in any such contract as that in question ought to be interdicted even to the minister himself—the proper ground for the interdiction would be—not the danger of peculation but the draught which a private business of this sort would naturally if not necessarily be making upon him for that time and attention of which by acceptance of the office he has engaged to transfer to the public service the whole benefit ratiocinative art    by any endeavour pretended or real to apply a remedy in any other shape to this always impending disorder—the disorder would not be lessened but increased that which a minister would naturally fear to do with his own hand no cause can he have for fearing thus to do by another hand for all such purposes relative situations are sufficient no concert being necessary by no evidence need he expose himself to be reached in that situation as in every other—without the most flagrant and mischievous injustice for no misdeed in which he had not been proved to have participated could any man be punished for     by punishment in any such case the sense of security would in the breast of every person who knew of it be weakened if not destroyed in the fate of any man so punished any other man would be apt to read his own ratiocinative art    on the other hand against no such disclosure as is here required can any person feel reluctance unless it be his wish and desire upon a favourable occasion to do or see done the very thing—to be guilty or see others guilty of the very crime—which it is the purpose of the disclosure to prevent and the more ardent the desire the more intense will of course be the reluctance functionary this desire—is it not yours then what is it you can suffer by any difficulty opposed to the gratification of it but the imputation   yes if it were to you alone but it is to the whole species without exception that it applies itself say you—i am not as other men are well then—if not it is—not because you are better than they but because you are so much worse if in your case suspicion is not necessary—necessary in exactly the same degree as in that of the generality of men—it is because it is so in a greater degree this is what by this very claim of yours—this claim of exemption and privilege—you have proved it is the very claim which every malefactor if he saw any chance of its being granted would be sure to make and the more incontestibly as well as the more atrociously he were guilty the more anxious would he be to obtain it your wealth—your factitious dignity—your political power—your power in all shapes—is it on these that this claim of yours grounds itself rightly understood all these are but so many bars to it all these are so many instruments of possible delinquency in all these shapes—of delinquency in the case of every man possible in the case of every man more or less probable thus from beginning to end saith the penal code yes so says it everywhere for if anywhere there be a person exempt from suspicion as being incapable of delinquency—it is because he is—not man but god upon earth which being granted that which in a man would be wrong is in this god exercise of right to abuse power is upon occasion the wish of every man the greater the power the greater the facility he has for giving effect to that wish and therefore the more not the less needful is this and every other bar and check that can be opposed to it the greater the power the stronger indeed is the ground     the ground but for what for suspicion and precaution surely for anything rather than confidence are you sincere and honest you will now give up this exclusive claim of yours you will submit with resignation to the common lot are you insincere and crafty your mask is now off and will no longer serve your purpose instructional art    as to situations of mere trust in which the business consists in the receipt and disbursement of money—by the following rules unless for special and preponderant reason to the contrary will the conduct of the legislature be guided—   in the case of each such situation minimize the quantity of money placed at the disposal of the occupant   minimize the time during which it is left at his disposal   as a condition precedent to his location—require security for the eventual forthcomingness of a sum as near as may be to equality with the maximum of the money so placed at his disposal   such security may be composed—partly of property of his own remaining at his own disposal partly of property belonging to persons consenting to become bondsmen bound in case of deficiency to provide to an extent in each case limited for the filling it up or it may be given—partly in the one shape partly in the other   to the fact of his receipt of the money in each instance give recordation—together with whatever degree of publicity the regard due to frugality admits of   so to the time and place of its being transferred into his hands with a sufficient description of the person by whom it was so placed and of the cause and purpose of such transfer   so on its passing out of his hands—to the time cause and purpose of such its subsequent transfer instructional art    for the exclusion of sinister profit by public loss—a consideration that will be kept in mind is—that moneys worth—in all its several shapes immoveable and moveable—is more exposed to be made an instrument of such loss than money itself is that accordingly generally speaking in the exercise of the procurative reparative eliminative and venditive functions—in relation to land edifices vessels or goods—more facility is afforded for such malpractice than in the exercise of the receptive custoditive and transmissive functions in relation to money in a word that peculation is attended with less difficulty and danger than embezzlement on this as on other occasions proportioned to the demand will be the legislators vigilance instructional art    of the ways in which such sinister profit may be made by a peculator—examples are as follows   purchasing from a confederate or favourite he gives over value   selling to a confederate or favourite he accepts under value   in case of competition between vender and     vender he overrates the quality of the goods tendered by a confederate he underrates the quality of those tendered by a rival dealer   in case of competition between purchaser and purchaser he assorts the articles in a manner suitable to the demand of the confederate or favourite unsuitable to the demand of the competitor instructional art    by the united powers of recordation publication and unrestricted interrogability as per arts    —an effectual bar may in every instance be opposed to breach of trust in both those forms improbability of accomplishment and probability of detection will concur in excluding the attempt section xxiv legislationregarding functions enactive expositive art   exercisible in an appropriate seat in the assembly of the legislature by himself or

enactive art    responsible accordingly he is for all such detriment as in any assignable form shall have accrued to the public service through deficiency in any assignable shape in respect of appropriate aptitude in any assignable shape on the part of any subordinate in his subdepartment to wit in so far as by any vigilance on his part any such deficiency might have been prevented from having place enactive expositive art    of cases in which a presumption of culpable deficiency in respect of such vigilance may justly have place examples are as follows   if on the part of this or that culpable subordinate any such deficiency in appropriate aptitude has been judicially proved or is become generally known or suspected   if after apt information received of such deficiency the superordinate has omitted to take timely arrangements for preventing the recurrence of the like in future viz by dislocation suspension performed or judicial examination instituted and with as much despatch as is consistent with justice carried on or by simple admonition in a case in which there is reason to expect that such admonition will prove sufficient   if antecedently to or without such information—timely arrangements such as ordinary prudence would suggest had not been taken by him instructional art    by any such want of vigilance on the part of the superordinate—apt ground may be afforded to the publicopinion tribunal for inquiry into the cause thereof through the medium of the periodical press or otherwise—whether for example in consideration of the location or the continuance of the subordinate in his office service in some shape pecuniary or miscellaneous at the hands of the subordinate or some connexion of his to the superordinate or some connexion of his may not have been received or looked for service which how truly soever sinister and how extensively soever mischievous will in the nature of the case for want of sufficient proof coming home to the superordinate commonly be unsusceptible of legal punishment judicially applied enactive art  0 v completeness of the subjection to the power of the publicopinion tribunal as for all other good purposes so for this—as in the other departments so in this—under the authority of the publicopinion tribunal for the information of the supreme constitutive through the medium of the press—by any person on the conduct and character of any public functionary comments may be made—in so far as clear of falsity in respect of facts and made without disturbance of the business—and for bringing to light grounds for just censure—interrogatories may in like manner be uttered and made public answer or silence will remain to the interrogatee the tribunal will draw its conclusions from expressions of vague vituperation the appropriate and sufficient punishment will in the shape of the appropriate disrepute recoil on the vituperator in so far as ungrounded the vituperation will be regarded as groundless but for the purpose of judicial satisfaction or punishment or both in so far as a demand has place it will rest with the functionary to provide evidence to wit by minutation as per ch xxi immediate registrars section     minutation attestation enactive art    as for past misconduct censure may thus be administered and the individual placed under the surveillance of the public for the prevention of the like in future—so with still better effect and prospect may be held up to view—cause of suspicion on the score of apprehended inaptitude antecedently to location so far as regards moral inaptitude—the security thus sought to be established has been seen in section    locable who on the occasion of the probationary examinations in relation to the judiciary department see the like provision in ch xii section    locable who and the like in the chapters relative to the several particular offices in that department enactive ratiocinative art    vi completeness of the subjection to the power of the legal tribunals as to the prime minister it belongs as per ch viii prime minister section    securities c arts editor illegible number     to receive information of inaptitude on the part of any minister and to act accordingly—so to every minister does it belong to receive information of inaptitude on the part of every functionary in his subdepartment     who as such is subjected either to his dislocative or to his directive power and to proceed accordingly observing the provision as to secrecy in art   of that section and the extension established as per art   with relation to the ministers official predecessors instructional art    vii provision for securing the completeness of the necessary mass of responsible power together with the exclusion of all irresponsible exercise of power by functionaries belonging to this department to the legislature it will belong throughout the whole field of the administrative department to look out for—and subject to the requisite conditions to establish—all such powers the existence of which shall be necessary and sufficient and thereby to minimize all demand on the score of necessity for the exercise of powers not thus legalized expositive exemplificational art    examples of need of the exercise of such powers are as follows— temporary inhibition restriction or permission—of commercial intercourse with foreign nations—with a view to security against calamity in the shape of famine dearth contagion c as to which see ch xi ministers severally section   preventive service minister instructional art    note that on no minister under the undiscontinued session system established by ch vi legislative section    attendance and section  0 attendance and remuneration—can there be any use in conferring any such power the legislature being at all times in the exercise of its functions and every minister by self or depute present in the assembly on subordinates alone—that is to say on such subordinates of the several ministers as at the time in question happen to be in places in such sort distant from the seat of the legislature that the evil the exclusion of which is the object of the exercise given to the extraordinary power would take effect before the exclusion of it by exercise given to the power of the legislature could be accomplished—is it necessary to confer it instructional art    for his guidance in the exercise of such extraordinary powers—and for his indemnity in respect of the exercise given to it—the functionary will frame to himself an estimate of the two antagonizing evils—the several elements of value—to wit magnitude propinquity and probability being taken into account that is to say the mass of evil liable to take place if the power in question be not exercised and the mass of evil liable to take place if the power be exercised enactive art    conditions the fulfilment of which is necessary to the obtainment of exemption from punishment and from the burthen of satisfaction with or without extra remuneration on account of exercise given to such extraordinary power—are the following   with as much promptitude as may be—information as far as may be clear correct and complete—given to the legislature respecting the evil and the supposed remedy so applied   in case of any need of ulterior powers to be given by the legislature for the exclusion of the like evil in future—indication given of the terms proposed to be employed in the making of such appropriate amendment as shall appear requisite to be applied to the text of the law as to this matter see ch vi legislative section    members motions ch xi ministers severally section   legislation minister and ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 eventually emendative function instructional art    for elucidation by means of contrast—an artifice congenial to an aristocracyridden and corrupt mixt monarchy is an object a glance at which may have its use it consists in the leaving the provision made of administrative power purposely in a state of scantiness and insufficiency to the end that—on the plea of necessity power on any occasion at pleasure—to any effect at pleasure—may be exercised without previous exposure to the scrutiny of the public eye through those ordinary forms of debate which are conformed to in so far as legislation is not only practised but professed power exercised without any special and appropriate warrant from law power which under any aptly and adequatelypenned constitutional code could not be exercised without violation of some assignable and speciallyapplying enactment instructional art    a power of this sort may be exercised so it may seem in either of two ways according to the state which the pannomion is in with relation to the subject to wit either simply without authority or say warrant from the law as it stands or in direct and declared contrariety to some express enactment of the same law in this last case the power thus exercised is commonly designated by the appellation of a dispensing power so it may seem and in practice as yet so perhaps everywhere it is in the nature of the case however the diversity depends upon that which in the political community in question at the time in question is the state and the tenor of the written rule of action for suppose it to contain an enactment to a certain degree comprehensive—the case will be that no power not expressly given by law can be exercised without being exercised by an infringement of some assignable article in the body of the law nor therefore without the     exercise of a dispensing power setting itself above the law by every individual instance in which this device is practised—practised on the one part and submitted to on the other—exercise and strength are given to secret and silent despotism at the expense of open and preparatorily and freely and publicly discussed legislation instructional art  0 in pursuance of this same artifice—for prevention of opposition and discontent a natural and common practice is in the first instance—on each several occasion so long as the particular noxious purpose can without greater inconvenience be effected in some other way—to forbear giving exercise to this power otherwise than for a purpose which in itself or at any rate according to received opinions is of a beneficial nature whereupon when by a little experience accustomed to see the usurpation applied to good purposes the people are insensibly led into the habit of regarding it as intrinsically not only innoxious but beneficial and in that character paying in opinion and action the same deference to the executive as to the legislative authority—to the subordinate as to the superordinate—to anticonstitutional insubordination as to constitutional legislation—to acts by which law is violated as to acts by which law is made thereby aiding those who should be the under servants of their servants in their endeavours to put themselves over the upper servants and thereby over those in whom both upper and under servants ought to behold their masters instructional exemplificational art    in especial manner and frequency this artifice may be seen employed in english practice employed and with such success that public men—those even who on other grounds are all the while acting in declared opposition to those usurpers—may be seen and heard speaking of the exercise of a dispensing power as one of the ordinary operations of government in so much that on this or that occasion it is even matter of charge against them their not having had recourse to it instructional exemplificational art    continuallyincreasing extent given to this abuse is a relative use of and motive for two other congenial abuses   one is—minimization of that portion of time during which in each year legislation business is carried on—as to this see ch vi legislative section  0 attendance and remuneration   the other is—maximization of that portion of the field of law in which the rule of action is left in the state of fictitious alias judgemade law and at the same time minimization of the clearness and correctness and thence the cognoscibility as well as the extent and comprehensiveness of that part which has been brought into the state of reallyexistent and legislaturemade law instructional art    a circumstance which under a tyranny of the few over the many giving peculiar facility and commodiousness to the practice of carrying on the business of government in this pernicious mode is—that in this way the power of legislation—supreme and allcomprehensive legislation—is exercised without expense of time or thought and without control from opposition on the ground of the greatesthappiness principle whatever is is right—whatever is—that is to say whatever by men in the situation in question has been done—being tacitly assumed as a postulate—the rectitude of doing the same thing on any and every subsequent occasion deemed a similar one is stated and acted upon as a necessary consequence this is called following precedents and this course it is that is constantly held up to view not only as a safe course but even as the only safe course acting in consequence of allcomprehensive views taken of the same subject under the guidance of the greatesthappiness principle being at the same time marked out for a mixture of abhorrence and contempt under the name of theory and spoken of as an unsafe course that course which in truth is the most opposite to the only safe one being thus represented and acted upon as if it were itself the only safe one instructional art    thus it is—that by the comparative blindness of man in each preceding period the like blindness in each succeeding period is secured without the trouble or need of reflection—men by opulence rendered indolent and by indolence and selfindulgence doomed to ignorance follow their leaders—as sheep follow sheep and geese geese instructional art    to the purpose to which this mode of governing is applied nothing can be more commodious the labour of thought is saved to all who by indolence or incapacity or both stand excluded from the exercise of it the operation of judging of the mere similitude of one mode of action to another without confronting either the one or the other with whatever on the occasion in question is the proper end in view and standard being that sort of mental operation for which the lowest degree of intellect—the lowest degree in the conjunct scales of cognitional and judicial aptitude—is sufficient instructional art    and what is the class of persons for the giving effect to whose will this mode of legislation is in so eminent a degree well adapted it is the class of those of whom under such a form of government as that in question the great majority of the legislature is so sure to be composed men who being by     opulence rendered destitute of all motives for mental exertion are by the very nature of man from the beginning to the end of life kept as above in a state of relative ignorance and mental impotence instructional art    thus it is that of the thousand persons or thereabouts on whose will the prosperity of the millions depends the action of the whole number an accidentallyintroduced few excepted or not excepted is determined by a particular and sinister interest on almost all points standing and working in direct opposition to that of the millions this class may be divided into two subclasses those with misemployed and those with unemployed faculties to the misemployed meaning with relation to the universal interest belong the lawyer subclass the mercantile subclass and the official subclass to the unemployed headed and led on by men in possession and men in expectancy of situations in the peerage belong those who though distinguished as above by preeminence in mental imbecility are by this device enabled to do the work of depredation and oppression with the mask of wisdom on their visages and the praise of virtue in their ears sung on each occasion by the whole company in chorus instructional art    one point however there is—on which a representative democracy and an aristocracyridden monarchy do it must be confessed agree under both forms of government the possession of power is secured to one class to the perpetual exclusion of another class in the character of the powerholding class in the two cases lies the sole difference in the democracy the individuals of whom it is composed are the most apt of all whom the whole population of the country furnishes in the monarchy as above the most unapt and thus lodged must the powers of government continue—and thus disposed of the lot of the governed millions—until these same millions roused at length by the smart of the sufferings thus continually increased rise up in a mass and take the care of their own welfare into their own hands instructional art    precedent and practice—no head too empty or too weak to make the tongue say aye at the sight or the sound of both or either of these two so nearly synonymous and so aptlyassociated words—precedent set by the distinguished few whose characteristic is political and moral wickedness precedent followed practice persisted in by those comparative many whose characteristic is a compound composed of political wickedness combined as chemists phrase it in excess with mental weakness this mode of acting—acting by precedent understand always instead of and in preference to enactment what is it it is acting without reason to the declared exclusion of reason and thereby in declared opposition to reason acting in a more particularly anticonstitutional manner when it is by the executive or the judiciary in opposition to the acts of the legislature the more flagrant is the antinationality and absurdity the more antique the precedent the more antique the precedent—that is to say the more barbarous inexperienced uninformed and prejudiceled the race of men by and among whom the precedent was set—the more unlike that same past state of things to that which at the time in question is the present state of things to act thus—to argue in defence of action in this way—is it not as much as to say i will have it so because this or that other man still more profoundly ignorant than myself and still less restrained from evil by the tutelary control of public opinion than myself—said in his day—said some scores or some hundreds of years ago—i will have it so these declarations are they not such as every man who acts and argues in this way should be regarded and dealt with as having made by these arguments is endeavoured to be set up an everlasting bar against reform be the abuse ever so mischievous—against improvement be it ever so beneficial and unobjectionable instructional art  0 observations on the system of judicial control employed in this section and in sections  0    in preference to that of arbitrary will of the substitution here made of judiciary to purely arbitrary procedure in the administration department examples are not wanting in the practice of any civilized nations of europe witness in every nation the courts martial witness in english practice the courts martial and military inquiry courts in none of these cases without reasons regularly assigned accusation on specific grounds elicitation of evidence and conjunct deliberation by a body of judges—is dislocation commonly pronounced or suspension or so much as forced transference how averse soever—not altogether deaf are these judicatories to complaints preferred by subordinates against superordinates how comes it then—that in the case of the nonmilitary subdepartments of the administration department the security afforded by the essentiallynecessary judicial forms as above is almost without exception denied instructional art    instead of it may be seen—in absolute monarchies in relation to all nonmilitary administrational situations dislocation altogether arbitrary in the english an incongruous     and pernicious mixture of arbitrary dislocability with virtual undislocability how flagrant soever the wrongs done to individuals to the public or to both general rule dislocability altogether arbitrary exceptions made here and there with great parade by the latin phrase quamdiu se bene gesserit in english during good behaviour alias at the pleasure of the judge note too that in this case the mode of procedure is not as above the natural summary and naturallyeffectual mode but the technical and nevereffectual mode pursued in the ordinary high judicatories instructional art    referring his complaint to the one great penal justice shop the kings bench a man by whom a wrong is sustained places his complaint in the hands of a judicatory to which every one of the requisites necessary for the administration of relief is completely wanting instructional art    law by which the wrong in question is defined and prohibition attached to it none disposition none on the part either of judge or even of jury not to speak of the secretly acting instrument of impunity the grand jury to give relief against the wrong had it been so marked out and combated by the law both situations filled by members of the aristocracy bound by the chains of corrupt dependence on the monarchy and predetermined to give on every occasion the most effectual support to power howsoever exercised in relation to evidence arrangements such as in effect to put in great measure an exclusion upon all testimony but that of willing witnesses and the situation of all actually percipient witnesses such as to render it on every occasion in a high degree improbable that among them should be found any willing witnesses instructional art    in this state of things if the whole system of intercourse between functionaries and nonfunctionaries on the one hand and superordinate and subordinate functionaries on the other hand is not one unvaried scene of oppression it is owing—not assuredly to the state of the law but to the species and degree of good morals and good manners which—under the fostering care of the popular or moral sanction as applied by the publicopinion tribunal—has been nurtured and kept on foot in spite of the law and of whatever has the force of law instructional art    in the depths of the great pitfall in which the tickets in the lottery called justice are openly sold—sold at never preascertainable and continually increasing prices—anxious indeed must that evildoing functionary be to experience a stroke from the rod of punishment who can so much as prevail upon the hands that hold it to gratify him with a touch of it addressing himself to them he will be addressing himself to men to whom he will find his impunity scarce less dear than their own instructional art    hence when in the highest judicatory of all accused of having pocketed £ 0000 of public money an excabinet minister knowing the men he had to deal with stood up and said yes—i have pocketed the £ 0000 no was the answer of every one of the majority—no upon my honour you have not instructional art    against oppression in no one shape do the oppressed so it will be seen in detail find any tolerably efficient security in english legislation coupled with english judicature ask for relief—what you receive is aggravation oppression by partially assessed and to the vast majority of the people altogether unsupportable expense complain of oppression the yoke is additionally loaded by irresistible depredation sole relief against both a sort of anarchy creeping on by degrees and raising up its head under the feet of tyranny instructional art    highly advantageous in comparison is in this respect the situation of military men to them justice could not quite so safely be denied as to their unarmed countrymen accordingly from military procedure no profit finds its way into the pockets of the judge while from nonmilitary procedure flow into the correspondently situated pockets such immense and ever increasible profits hence the purity of the one system the corruption of the other hence in the one case the system is so wellsuited to what in both cases is the sole proper and professed purpose—giving execution and effect to the substantive branch of the law hence in the other case so utterly hostile remains indeed as a source of corruption in the military case the despotism of the commander in chief but that despotism would have nothing to gain on the contrary much to lose by poisoning the system with factitious expense and factitious delay for increase of the expense and absurd arrangements in relation to evidence—these too for increase of the expense and moreover of that uncertainty from which the source of the expense and the profit extracted from it receive their increase in that part of the present code which applies to the judicial department and thereafter in the procedure code this state of things will come to be laid open in some detail but even on the present occasion reference to it could not be altogether omitted those which belong to evidence see in complete detail in the rationale of judicial evidence     section xxvi architectural arrangements instructional art   among the ends in view—or say the elements or the features of appropriate aptitude—in the mode of carrying on the business of the administrative department and its several subdepartments—are some which cannot be given to it in so high a degree without as with that assistance which is not derivable to it from any other source than the artandscience of architecture instructional art   here as elsewhere—main ends to be aimed at—those already brought to view as per section   statistic function namely—maximization of relative good and minimization of relative evil—of relative good that is to say of the value of the benefit accruing to the public from the exercise given by the several functionaries belonging to the several subdepartments to their several functions—of relative evil that is to say of its main branch—to wit diminution of the benefit just mentioned of its collateral branches to wit the several evils of delay vexation and expense classes of persons in different ways affected by these evils respectively are—  suitors at and to the several offices   functionaries thereto belonging instructional art   by appropriate architectural arrangements contribution it will be seen may be made at the same time to that same main end and to those same collateral ends for by those same architectural arrangements by which delay vexation and expense are reduced in favour of suitors—may delay as well as vexation and expense be seen reduced in favour of the directing functionaries and through them in favour of the public service instructional art   intermediate purposes to which for maximization of good and minimization of evil architectural arrangements are applicable to official edifices are—publicity and secrecy of intercourse publicity in the cases where publicity secrecy or say privacy in the cases where secrecy is in the highest degree conducive to those same desirable purposes narrow will have been seen to be the extent to which secrecy compared with that to which publicity is productive of those same preeminently and universally desirable effects instructional art   with a view to the choice as between publicity and secrecy—subject matters susceptible of diversification and requiring consideration are—  occasions   persons   places   times   points of time   lengths of time instructional art   on one and the same occasion what may happen is—that at or in the same place or places at one and the same point of time for these desirable purposes it may be requisite—that during one and the same length of time as to persons two or more the existence and the matter of the intercourse should be known and in so far public so to another or others unknown and in so far secret or say private instructional art   according to the nature of the business the demand as between publicity and secrecy will be seen to vary as between department and department and in the same department as between subdepartment and subdepartment so also in the same subdepartment as between office and office instructional art   as to secrecy—the department in which the usefulness of that state of things is at its maximum is the constitutive so also the extent to which this usefulness has place this usefulness consists in the need there is of secrecy of suffrage for the preservation of liberty of suffrage preservation of it that is to say against corruptedness by the influence of the matter of reward and punishment applied to the producing an opposition—between the choice in reality desired to be made and the choice which in appearance alone is that which the person in question is desirous to make as where at an election it being the desire of an elector that a should be the candidate chosen—the case is—that by contemplation of the matter of good or the matter of evil as eventually about to be received by him at the hands of this or that other person an elector gives his vote in favour of b b being a candidate other than the one whom on that same occasion it is his wish to see successful instructional art   upon the agreement or disagreement or say upon the identity or the diversity—as between the wish really entertained and the wish expressed by the outward sign employed in giving expression to it—depends the character or say the quality of a vote or say suffrage in respect of the difference between genuineness and spuriousness if the two wishes point to the same object the quality exemplified is genuineness if to two different objects spuriousness instructional art  0 the department which taken in its totality presents itself as being that in which the need of publicity as compared with the need of secrecy is most extensive—is the judiciary     instructional art    the department which taken in its totality presents itself as being that in which the need of publicity exists in an intermediate extent—less to wit than in the constitutive greater than in the judiciary—is the administrative to the cases in which the demand for secrecy has place—they being cases of exception—occasion for making reference has in the chapters and sections of this volume been already frequent others will be seen in the several chapters which have for their subject the judiciary department instructional art    for the uses of publicity by whatsoever means effected see above section    securities c for the uses of secrecy by whatsoever means effected see ch vi legislative section    sittings public and secret ch xii judiciary collectively section    publicity c and other intermediate places therein referred to now as to the mode in which to publicity and secrecy—in the several cases in which they are respectively productive of good—architectural arrangements in particular may in quality of means be made subservient expositive art    by delay is meant on this occasion delay in respect of communication of communication on the part of persons employed in the service of the subdepartment or subdepartments in question with any of the several objects whether persons with whom or things with which in and for the exercise of their several functions it is necessary that communication should have place instructional expositive art    as for other purposes so for these—instruments necessary to communication are—the psychological and the purely physical psychological the two so intimately connected senses sight and hearing correspondent physical instruments light and air air in that state of motion of which sound is the result when and where by means of both these senses perception is rendered instantaneous—delay is not only minimized but excluded altogether when and where in regard to either of them perception fails in any degree of being instantaneous—delay in a degree proportioned to that of the failure fails of being excluded instructional ratiocinative art    so simple so obvious so familiar the appropriate arrangements—so sure of being effectual so easy to be employed so cheap in comparison with all others—shame might have prevented the mention of them had not a justification but too sufficient been afforded—not only by the utter neglect of them in practice but even by the absence of all mention of them in discourse principle say the allcomprehensive juxtaposition principle corresponding rule place in contiguity the several offices—meaning here the several apartments allotted for the official abodes of the several proposed intercommunicants during the time of such parts of their respective businesses as can in those several places be most conveniently carried on expositive art    offices—say then as above thirteen understanding at the same time—that under this name either so many entire and separate edifices or so many apartments only—and those in the same or in any lesser number of edifices—are as yet alike capable of being designated instructional art    relative situation of the offices of the thirteen ministers two to wit the election minister and the legislation minister not being necessarily subject to the direction of the prime minister—remains eleven as and for the number of those in the instance of each of whom need may have place for an office within the reach of the common superordinate for the purpose of instantaneous intercommunication with him ministers offices—say eleven twelve or thirteen as above disposed in a crescent a crescent or else—what to the purpose here in question would serve equally well—instead of any such fragment of a circle one entire circle or rectilinear quasicircle—a polygon of that same number of sides circumscribing or inscribed on a circle or an oval form correspondently diversifiable so far as ventilation alone is regarded—if protection against violent winds from particular quarters be not regarded as necessary—an unenclosed space such as that covered by a crescent presents itself as obviously preferable to the above proposed or any other plan by which a thorough draught of air sweeping the whole is excluded in any case though not necessarily yet naturally in the central situation with reference to the rest would be placed the prime ministers office from whence directions will have to be continually issued instructional ratiocinative art    with the exception of the saving in expense by diminution of the quantity of matter and workmanship employed in the erection of boundaries—as to the election ministers office whether it does or does not form a part of the assemblage presents itself as being     nearly if not altogether a matter of indifference as to the legislation minister—the most convenient if not the only convenient situation for his office is obviously that of contiguity with the edifice appropriated to the use of the legislature instructional art    in the apartment of the prime minister—from an apt position within reach of the seat occupied by him issue thirteen conversation tubes terminating in corresponding positions contiguous in like manner to the seats of the several ministers in their several apartments from the apartment of each minister to the apartment of every other minister runs in like manner a conversation tube as between one and every other of these fourteen administration functionaries—thus is promptitude of oral intercourse maximized ratiocinative art  0 collateral advantage by these same means effectual security is afforded against an imaginable mishap the realization of which is not without examples from office to office official papers are of course sent in locked boxes the offices being many of them out of sight of one another and situated at indefinite distances—the bearers of these boxes have been waylaid and for some sinister political purpose robbed of them† on the above construction—the messengers by whom papers are carried to and fro need never be out of sight of the intercommunicators by means of wheels withindoors—boxes if it were worth while might even be borne to and fro by ropes instead of messengers at the immediately preceding moment notice being given by accompanying bells‡     instructional expositive art    thus much for promptitude of oral communication between functionary and functionary now as to the promptitude as between functionaries and suitors—together with exclusion of needless delay vexation and expense vexation by haughty or negligent demeanour on the part of the functionary and by unjust favour in respect of priority of audience—follows the remedy in so far as applicable by architectural arrangements waitingboxes by a waitingbox in a ministers office understand—a compartment into which a suitor or set of suitors are admitted there to remain while waiting for audience seats in each from two to eight in tiers one above another—one two or three—as in the boxes of a theatre form of each office—suppose on the outside a polygon of thirteen sides eleven of them constituting the exterior boundaries of so many of these waitingboxes the two others contiguous to each other—use giving to suitors—the one entrance the other exit as to these see art  0 of the eleven nine contiguous to each other termed public boxes these for the reception of suitors in whose instance no secrecy is required private boxes as to which see art    two one at each extremity of the line of public boxes should the number be found or predetermined insufficient it might be increased by two or more at the expense of that of the publicboxes in each public box—the interior boundary a correspondent parallel to the exterior about the centre of the polygon—a counter or rectangular table with seats for the minister and one or two registrars or clerks for registration between that part of the table which is nearest to the interior boundary of the annular or say quasiannular line of waitingboxes—an open area of greater or less extent according to convenience into which opens a door waisthigh by the opening of which any person in the box may in case of need on permission pass to the table between the ministers table and the exterior boundary of the line of waitingboxes the distance not so great as to afford any obstruction to oral intercourse by this consideration the necessary limit will be set to the diameter of the groundfloor of the whole building exterior to the exterior boundary of this annular line of waitingboxes a correspondent line of passage along it the suitors make their way all round to the several waitingboxes he who comes first moving on to the box which is furthest from the entrance height not exceeding what is requisite for ventilation light received into it from the top the boxes distinguished from one another by numbers each number expressed in figures over the exterior door of the box to wit that which opens into the passage as also over the interior door which opens into the abovementioned area without and within these waitingboxes—in type and numbers such as to be visible to all eyes are exemplars of the two tables as per section    securities c arts  0    and    table i functionarys deportment rules table ii visiters deportment rules ratiocinative art    uses of these same public waitingboxes   service rendered by the population of them in securing and augmenting the publicity of everything that passes this in like manner as by the judicial inspectors in a justice chamber as per ch xvii   like service by securing observance to the abovementioned rules of deportment instructional art    into the central part occupied by the minister light is let in by windows running all round the roof at an elevation higher than that of the passage instructional art    all this on the same level that is to say the groundfloor over it in stories of any number are apartments or assemblages of apartments called collectively the treasury appropriated to the purpose of giving stowage to the official books and papers as to this see below arts       instructional art    to a set of these apartments may if the situation be approved be added another for the habitation of the minister and his family but see art    instructional expositive art    private waitingboxes by a private waitingbox understand a box having for its destination the affording audience to suitors in such manner that in the instance of such suitor not only the purport but even the existence of his intercourse with the minister while sitting in his central part of the room as per art   —shall remain for the requisite time unknown to all persons but such if any     to whom the suitor or the minister shall have communicated information of it instructional art    number of these private waitingboxes two one at each extremity of the ring of public waitingboxes but from that part of the passage which gives admission into the public waitingboxes the part which gives admission to the private ones is separated by a thick wall for the efficient cause or causes of demand for such privacy see below art    instructional art    across the ministers office in the direction of the diameter of a circle the diameter being drawn at right angles to the middle part of the ring of the abovementioned public waitingboxes or of a chord parallel to the diameter runs a partition closed by a door or curtain by the opening of which the minister makes his entrance to the table to give audience to any part of the population of the public waitingboxes on his return at any time through the aperture he gives audience to the individual or individuals in either of the private boxes as above between the construction of the public and that of the private waitingboxes the only considerable difference is—that in the private boxes the side partitions instead of being of any degree of thinness must be of such a thickness as to prevent the communication of sound and to the same purpose like regard must be had in the construction of the floor and ceiling instructional ratiocinative art    moreover in the case of the private boxes the area between them and the ministers table cannot be so spacious as in the case of the public boxes nor would there be any use in its being so a correspondent portion of space will thus be free capable of being allotted to other purposes instructional art  0 in that part of the circle which is opposite to the part occupied by the public waitingboxes—and thence with reference to them behind the abovementioned partition—is a sort of hall or vestibule equal in extent to at least two of those same public waitingboxes in the middle part of its exterior boundary—which is that of the whole building—is an outward door which opens into the street and thus gives admission to all persons indiscriminately after continuing undivided for some part of the space this hall gives admittance to whatever staircase or passage may be deemed necessary for communication with the several parts of the building for example with the apartments of the several superior stories and the annular exterior passage which as aboveleads to the waitingboxes on his entrance at the abovementioned outward door—a visitant sees on each side of the hall or vestibule a passage with two doors in it in a right line with one another divided by a wall into two equal halves the outward half gives admission to the public waitingboxes on that side the inward half to the one private waitingbox on that same side the two doors which give admission the one of them to the exterior the other to the interior half passage are both in the same right line the half passage which leads to the private waitingbox has besides the justmentioned door another opening sideways into the half passage which leads to the public waitingboxes by this means at his exit into the vestibule the secret suitor has his option—whether to pass into it directly or through the medium of the half passage that communicates with the public waitingboxes a suitor whose audience in a private box has been finished—to make his exit unperceived watches the time when either there is no person at all in the vestibule or no person in relation to whom he has any apprehension for enabling the secret suitor at his exit to see into the vestibule without being seen from it—a small hole closed by a glass would suffice the situation of it being at an elevation to a certain degree above that of the human figure and a step or steps being provided for enabling him to ascend to it of the purpose here in view a general conception being thus conveyed—an intelligent architect will it is supposed find little difficulty in giving effect to it in any one of a variety of particular ways adapted to local circumstances instructional art    for further security if deemed necessary a passage under ground may be provided opening into an exterior open passage with a sentinel at the end of it by whom all persons are precluded from the faculty of making observation of the persons coming into it or going out of it instructional art    cases in which justificative causes   0 for privacy of the intercourse between minister and suitor may have place examples— loss already fallen—or unless prevented about to fall—on the public service for a list of the several forms of which such loss is susceptible—a list endeavoured to be rendered all comprehensive see section   statistic function bissect iv loss books instructional art    motives capable of giving birth to such information on the part of a suitor examples—   benefit naturally resulting to him to wit from the termination or prevention of the efficient cause of loss as where by a fair trader information is given of contrabandism   benefit sought in the shape of remuneration from government by the hands of the minister example—case the same—except that the informant is not in this case—as in the other case it may happen to him to be—in a situation to reap any such naturally resulting benefit and that an adequate one for illustration this one example may suffice the subdepartment from the business of which it is taken is that of the finance minister but the like example might alike have been furnished from most of the other subdepartments ratiocinative art    question why in a case of this sort admit the information to be secret answer reasons i—liableness of publicity to convey to a delinquent or to delinquents information enabling them to elude the operation of the appointed remedies to wit—   in all cases the punifactive and thereby subsequentiallypreventive   in many cases the satisfactive including the compensative   where the offence is continuous the suppressive   in so far as the mischief is as yet in contemplation only the preventive ii need of temporary secrecy to secure the information from being suppressed by fear of the disrepute liable to be attached to the exercise of the function of informer iii illwill and ill offices on the part of the delinquent and persons especially connected with him—by the tie of interest selfregarding or sympathetic be the act what it may—where motives adequate to the production of the requisite information have place—it may be presumed that a correspondent probability of such prevention or suppression will thus have place where no such adequate motive has place the evil practice will go on unpunished note that the disrepute so generally attached to the character of informer can scarcely have any other cause than a correspondent depravity in the character of the laws of that depravity it is accordingly everywhere strongly presumptive at least if not of itself conclusive evidence ratiocinative art    objection answered no reward cries an objector no reward in this case if true the information will have been given by the pure motive of regard for the public good given for the sake of lucre it will have been false answer   but this same lucre—what is it that the word designates nothing more than the matter of reward that is to say the matter of good applied to the purpose in question with intimation given—that to him who is speaking of it the application made of it is an object of disapprobation but without any intimation of the ground on which that sentiment is entertained   admit the objection to be a valid one a consequence is—that no offence—no mischief producible by an offence—should ever be prevented—except in a case which for this purpose presents persons in sufficient number who are content to sacrifice each of them his own interest to a comparatively small interest on the part of the public—and act accordingly ratiocinative art    as in any other way so in this—to oppose discouragement to the proceedings necessary to the prevention of an offence is to act as an accomplice—question you yourself—have you ever made any such sacrifice—out of a hundred such sentimentalists not more perhaps than one is there whose answer would not be in the affirmative yet not so much as one perhaps is there in whose instance it would be true that which in the language of sentimentalism is a sacrifice of private to public interest being but a sacrifice of a selfsupposed private interest in one shape to a selfsupposed private interest in another shape for example of an interest corresponding to the love of power to an interest corresponding to love of reputation—of that reputation of which power is the expected fruit instructional art    the determination to exclude all false evidence—is it an absolute one included in it then is the determination to exclude all evidence for where has ever been the piece of evidence in relation to which antecedently to examination it could have been known not to be false instructional ratiocinative art    attached to the official apartment of a minister including the treasury thereto belonging and under the same roof—shall there be or not be a mass of building with the appurtenances provided for the habitation of the minister and his family reasons for the affirmative   saving in respect of the roof       protection against furtive abstraction—or say robbery—particularly by night   assurance that by this means the minister will be generally speaking on the spot reasons for the negative   if an habitable part be to be added—there must be for the subdepartments of the eleven or twelve ministers taking directions from the prime minister that same number of ministerial habitations but as per section   ministers and subdepartments what may happen is—that for several subdepartments one and the same minister may suffice in this case so many unions or reunions so many masses of superfluous expense   the number of the persons of whom the family of a minister is composed admits of an indefinite number of diversifications but of the habitations thus provided the aggregate mass will require to be sufficient for the most numerous family and in this sufficiency will be included a proportionate superfluity and excess with the correspondent wasteful expense—in every instance in which the actual number falls short of the number thus arbitrarily assumed and this excess may be to be repeated upon any number of habitations not exceeding the eleven or twelve   as to the ministers being always on the spot—by his having a habitation on the spot no complete security will be afforded for his being himself constantly in that same habitation nor of his being accessible when he is there other and more appropriate arrangements the nature of the case affords as per section    securities by which this accessibility is capable of being secured understand always—at the times at which the business requires his presence at office hours in the official apartment but every year a portion more or less considerable of his official time will be to be employed in inspection visits as per section   inspective function   suppose no such appendage attached—the habitation occupied by each minister will be that which in the judgment of the most appropriate judge is best adapted to his wants and means in all respects as to the expense—it will in both cases be taken into the account on the occasion of the offers made by candidates on the occasion of the pecuniary competition as per section    located how instructional art    this same instrument might and naturally would—every part of it—serve at the same time for both the matériel and the personel of both departments—the legislative and the administrative—for the personal as well as real stock—for the functionaries belonging to the two departments as well as for the dead portion of the public property instructional art  0 compare with a view to comparative importance the prime subjectmatter of preservation in the case of a representative democracy as here with the corresponding subjectmatter of the like care so universally bestowed in the case of the monarch the absence of all expense in the one case the enormity of the expense in the other the needfulness in the one case with the uselessness in the other more particularly in the case of those whose attendance is paid on his migration from place to place behold in the case of the monarchy a virtual certificate—that under that form of government the state of perpetual insecurity—into which for the increase of the inordinate prosperity of that one individual the subject millions are kept plunged—is shared with them at the same time by that same unit to whose interest in this shape a sacrifice so enormous of the universal comfort of those same millions is not grudged instructional ratiocinative art    note well—that in the organization of this compound instrument of security an indispensable condition is—that the individual elements of the fictitious body be frequently changed a prime minister for life—with an unchanging body of men—though in number for example not more than fifty under his command—encompassing at the same time his residence and that of the most confidential and highly empowered servants of the people—might sooner or later become a pisistratus with his fifty yeomanry or a roman imperator with his prætorian guards instructional exemplificational art    subsidiary arrangements requiring to be connected with and adapted to those which belong strictly to architecture alone are—arrangements for the security of the buildings their appurtenances and contents against loss by whatever causes—physical or psychological—produced of such loss examples are—   destruction by conflagration   destruction on deterioration by other physical causes at large   furtive abstraction instructional art    subjectmatters the preservation of which is of prime importance are—the literary contents of the treasury more particularly those in manuscript but so far as regards the manuscripts the evil from loss is already minimized to wit by the universal registration and publication system as per ch viii sections  0    instructional art    of psychological causes of indiscriminate destruction and deterioration examples are—   ill will on the part of a foreign adversary   ill will on the part of internal adversaries as in the case of popular commotions     instructional exemplificational art    of psychological causes of furtive abstraction examples are—   desire of the matter of wealth in the ordinary case to wit that in which the subjectmatter possesses intrinsic marketable value   indirect advantage from the loss of the subjectmatter to a party on one side or the acquisition of it to a party on the other side over and above any marketable value which it may happen to it to possess of furtive destruction or abstraction thus produced individual examples have every now and then transpired instructional art    follow correspondent safeguards even in a republic established with the best possible constitution a purposed destruction of public property by popular commotion should not be regarded as too improbable to need guarding against the love and veneration of ten millions at a distance might be an altogether inefficient protection against ten dozen of individuals impregnated with effective malevolence in this shape whether by inbred error or by fraud and mendacity from without in which case—by resentment produced by the conduct real or supposed justly or unjustly regarded as culpable on the part of this or that minister—the public treasure in this shape—the whole or any part of it—might be made a sacrifice instructional ratiocinative art    sole adequate as well as appropriate security in this case—a military guard minister in this case specially charged with the directive functions and responsible for the exercise of it—the preventive service minister—subordinates draughted from the professional subordinates of the army minister by the employment of nonmilitary functionaries for the purpose—for example under the name of watchmen or porters—appropriate aptitude would be lessened—remuneration the whole of it expended in waste instructional exemplificational art    thus much as to that which might have place—might should and everywhere if the good of the whole community were the end aimed at would have had and have place what can be more obvious what more simple what more effectual what more easily effectible look round now everywhere—and everywhere behold what actually has place turn first to monarchy here the alldetermining principle is—that as beasts in general are made for the use of men in general—so in each community are men—all of them but one—made for the use of that one of this universal slaveholder the duty for he too has his duty is—as in all other matters and on all other occasions so in this matter and on this occasion—at every moment of time whatsoever to do that which at that same moment is most agreeable to himself of these twolegged beasts of draught and burthen corresponding and proper state—that of slavery under that one domestic slavery did the nature of things admit of it but the nature of things not being thus tractable then that which comes nearest to it—to wit political slavery instructional art    thus as to all operations and all arrangements in general this same allcomprehensive principle—apply it now to those arrangements in particular which apply to architecture and thence to the habitual official residence of the chief functionary and his chief subordinates that which the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires is—that at each moment of time the residence of each functionary and in particular of that one whose functions are of most importance should be on that spot on which his service reference had to the greatest happiness of that same number would be of the greatest use correspondent howsoever opposite is the arrangement as to place in the case of this allruling one that which his greatest happiness requires is—that without communication received of his will and pleasure no operation which is regarded as being of adequate moment with reference to such his happiness is ever to be performed when with the utmost possible despatch the welfare of the community requires this or that thing to be done which cannot be done but by this or that next highest functionary nor by him without verbal communication with this highest—how great between the two functionaries the distance is—distance in place and thence in time—with the consequent delay vexation and expense—is not worth a thought his official abode being in the metropolis is it at any time his pleasure to be at twenty miles distance the delay correspondent to those twenty miles is to have place if sixty miles the delay correspondent to these sixty miles and so in the case of  00 miles whether by land only or by land and sea with all the uncertainties resulting from that mixture instructional art  0 on this or that occasion what is the evil that may not have had its origin in this cause but why mention it who ever heard anything about it what minister except for the fatigue to self and friends ever cared about it the value of a straw instructional art    what then is the remedy to have a monarch and keep him in a state of confinement no surely what then not     to have any functionary but one by whom for the power and so forth attached to the office the confinement would be submitted to with pleasure instructional art    while the monarch is upon his rambles in pursuit of pleasure—wretches by dozens or by scores are kept suspended between life and death waiting their doom true it is—that in this case combined with the all but most unapt form of government for pure aristocracy is still worse is the most unapt form of punishment but this though the most conspicuous is but one drop in the current of inscrutable evil flowing from the same source instructional exemplificational art    in the united states the offices belonging to the subdepartments together with the residence of the prime minister styled president are under the same roof the whole edifice being styled the capitol but neither has the circular nor the polygonocircular plan of construction been employed nor for aught that appears the conversationtubes for the designation of the several departments four denominations and no more are there employed namely   state   treasury   war   navy—see the plans in the new national calendar for      instructional ratiocinative art    as to the office of the justice minister—this should rather be remote from than contiguous to the abovementioned cluster of offices between the administrative department and the judiciary—the less the unseen and unheard communication the better chapter x defensive force section i branches what instructional expositive art   of the army and navy subdepartments mention may be seen made in ch ix ministers collectively section   ministers and subdepartments on the present occasion the businesses and operations respectively carried on in them having one common object to wit national defence though pursued mostly by the use of two different sets of instruments personal and material included the two subdepartments may with a view to that same object be on the present occasion considered as constituting one compound subdepartment styled the national defence subdepartment expositive art   throughout this code under the appellation of seaservice is meant to be comprised whatsoever service is performed in vessels constructed in respect of bulk or form in such manner as to be designed or fit for the being employed in the open sea whether the tract of territory in which at the time in question the vessel in question is actually employed be part and parcel of the open sea or an inlet running from the sea into the land and whether the quality of the water be salt fresh or mixed instructional expositive art   for the detail of the arrangements for national defence see the army and navy codes to the present code belong those principles rules and arrangements which have for their object the securing to those same arrangements a character in harmony with that of the other parts of this same code expositive instructional ratiocinative art   by the words national defence as applied to these two subdepartments considered as one manifestation is made—that of the arrangements thereto belonging defence is the sole object and that offence and aggression as towards other nations much more conquest are repugnant to the essential and leading principles of the constitution delineated by the present code expositive art   considered with reference to origin the national defence force requires to be distinguished into two branches—the radical and the excretitious the radical the root from which the excretitious derives its existence and the members of it their subsistence of the radical force the members naturally unpaid for pay to all by all would be pay to none of the excretitious paid whence they may be also called the stipendiary expositive art   considered with reference to the elements on which their respective operations are principally carried on the branches into which this same force requires to be distinguished are—  the land service or say army branch   the sea service or say navy branch expositive art   from the two sources of distinction taken together come four branches of the national defence force to wit—  the radical landservice branch   the stipendiary landservice branch   the radical seaservice branch   the stipendiary seaservice branch     instructional art   of all these four branches first for the most part in order of existence and thence in the order of necessity is the radical landservice force in each state exceptions excepted the individuals of which it is composed will be—all such members of the community as are in a physical sense capable of contributing to the purpose in question to wit national defence instructional art   in an early and immature state of society the labour and peril of defence against hostility from without has without exception been the lot of all who were capable of contributing to it in case of extreme necessity even the weaker sex has not been altogether exempt from it for for the support of this portion of the aggregate interest no fund having in that state of things been formed no separate class of functionaries could have been charged with none therefore exempted from the care of it instructional art  0 of the landservice force the stipendiary portion is but as a twig growing out of and nourished by the radical branch though in respect of its quantity capable of being augmented and but too liable and apt to be augmented to excess the existence of it is the result and evidence of a considerable progress made in the career of civilisation forasmuch as thus by means of a comparatively small portion withdrawn from the care of producing the matter of subsistence and abundance the whole remainder of the population is left free without obstruction to employ itself exclusively in maximizing the aggregate mass of the matter on which life and prosperity depend thus much as between the two branches or say subbranches of the land service force instructional art    now as to the sea service and its two corresponding subbranches considered in respect of the order of existence and necessity—that is to say in respect of the extent to which the necessity of its existence has place—the landservice force radical and stipendiary branches together claims the precedence over both branches of the seaservice force so likewise considered with reference to degree and extent of use for—the comparatively small portions excepted which are employed in the business of fishery on a large scale—those preeminently extensive portions of the globe which being covered with water are called seas are but so many means of communication so many water roads as it were between those several portions of the earths surface which not being covered with water give habitation and sustenance to the several communities of which the human race is composed no political community ever had place the members of which had not their habitation and means of subsistence mostly on dry land at all times many have had place the members of which neither had in the sea their place of habitation nor so much as in their own power any means of immediate communication with it exemplificational art    at this day in europe no such means have the kingdoms of bavaria wirtemberg or saxony no such means has the swiss confederacy composed of republican states aristocratical and democratical together instructional art    as in the instance of the majority if not the whole number of political communities past and present taken together the seaservice force has been and is but as it were a twig growing out of the landservice so in the seaservice force the stipendiary is and has been but as it were a smaller twig growing and how commonly soever not necessarily out of the radical branch instructional art    posterior as above in the conjunct scales of priority of existence necessity and extent of the demand—the stipendiary branch of the sea service is prior to all the other three branches of the defensive force in dignity in so far as on the part of the functionaries dignity is proportioned to quantity of demand for appropriate intellectual and active aptitude aptitude bearing in this case reference to a considerably greater number of mutually different operations than in the case of the radical branch in that same service or in the case of either branch of the landservice instructional ratiocinative art    as in the present state of the art of war to put and keep himself in a condition to act with adequate effect in the capacity of a constituent part of the stipendiary defensive force must generally speaking occupy of necessity so much of a mans time as not to leave him in possession of a stock of it sufficient for the providing himself with the means of subsistence hence the necessity in virtue of which every man so occupied must be provided with those means at the expense of those by whose labour the stock of the means of subsistence and enjoyment is continually brought into and consumption notwithstanding kept in existence and as the stock of those means which would otherwise have been brought into existence is diminished by every quantity of human time and labour employed in giving security to it by contributing to the efficiency of the mass of the defensive force—hence—without a loss of the means of subsistence and enjoyment—loss to such an amount as never has been submitted     to nor is likely to be submitted to by any political community—hence it is that the number of the individuals acting as members of the stipendiary part of the national defensive force has always been and will always be small when compared with the remainder of such of the inhabitants as in respect of age and sex would be capable of serving as component parts of it instructional art    but while the number of them is thus comparatively small their power of exerting force with effect—and this for the purpose not only of defence but of offence likewise—will in equal numbers be comparatively great and it being necessary not only for the actual exercise of their appropriate functions but also for the putting and keeping them at all times in a state of preparation for it that they should be kept together in bodies more or less numerous hence it is that they are at once a source of security on one account and of danger on another—see section   leading principles arts                 0                      instructional art    of danger in two ways the danger being capable of taking its origin in two different descriptions of persons   the commander in chief under whose orders they are all of them at all times acting and   any subordinate leader or leaders appointed to act in subordination to him instructional ratiocinative art    in the stipendiaries belonging to the seaservice branch no such source of danger is perceptible the element on which they act keeps them in a state of comparative separatedness and at the same time mostly at an uninfluential distance from the seat of the legislature expositive art    that which in the land defensive force the radical branch is to the stipendiary in the sea defensive force the private navy is to the public or say the government navy the private navy which as above may also be called the radical navy is composed of those navigable vessels which belong to individual proprietors their crews serving either in vessels of their own respectively—or for hire or otherwise in vessels belonging to other persons instructional ratiocinative art  0 uses considered in kind of the radical sea force the uses are—the serving eventually as a check and constantly as a source of applicable supply but as in comparison with the danger from the land stipendiary force the danger to a constitution from the sea stipendiary force is inconsiderable—so on the other hand is the use of it in the character of a check as above correspondently inconsiderable in its serving as a source of constantly applicable supply consists its principal use instructional art    as to preparedness—at the expense and for the account of the individuals interested the radical sea force without especial design on the part of those who compose it is in its own way trained unarmed or armed as it may happen and thus kept in a state of comparative preparedness for eventual military seaservice thus much in point of fact as to the mode in which and terms on which if at all it is desirable that such extraordinary application and transference should be made of it see section    sea defensive force instructional art    as to stipendiaries whether in land or sea service—under a constitution such as the one here in question—in a word under a pure representative democracy where governors and governed are to the greatest possible extent the same individuals—the principal and sole constant use of a body of stipendiaries is—that which consists in their serving as an instrument of security against aggression by foreign adversaries actual and eventual but moreover a collateral and highly useful though but eventual and occasional use is—the affording aid to the justice minister and the preventiveservice minister respectively in the application of remedies suppressive or preventive against delinquency in various shapes when operating upon a large scale—that is to say upon a scale too large to admit of the mischiefs being suppressed or prevented by the personal force constantly at the command of the directing functionaries at the head of the abovementioned nonmilitary departments and subdepartments and capable of being with adequate promptitude brought to bear by them respectively upon the place in which the mischief has its seat instructional art    a casualty to which a democratic constitution like any other stands perpetually exposed is—that of giving birth to a knot of malefactors who acting in manifest opposition to the ordinary official establishment of the government constitute thereby a sort of temporary government of their own formation monarchial or aristocratical as the case may be waging war upon the government established by law in which case although no such prospect should be entertained by them as that of subverting the government which they find established yet were it not for a body of welltrained military men in readiness to act for their suppression no limit might be assignable to the quantity of the mischief which before an end could be put to it might be produced by them     instructional ratiocinative art    in each such case by the radical force the same effect might in the long run with equal certainty have been accomplished with equal certainty yes but not with equal promptitude and while the comparatively unwieldy instruments were putting together mischief may have been produced in indefinite quantity mischief which by the immediate use of the prompt and more appropriate instrument might have been prevented instructional ratiocinative art    a use in some sort intermediate between these same uses principal and collateral is—that which applies to the case of a federative democracy tyranny and anarchy—to employ such words as language furnishes—tyranny and anarchy though in forms and degrees much less drastic and afflictive than those which by reason of the states of things to which they have been in use to be applied will naturally be brought to mind by these appellations—are two rocks between which even in the case of this democracy the vessel of the state has to steer its course and upon each of which it is constantly by violent gusts from this or that quarter exposed to be driven instructional ratiocinative art    of the confederated states this or that one omits suppose to furnish the agreed contingent towards the common expense of the whole or this or that state resists and paralyzes the authority of some portion of the judicial establishment maintained in each state for giving execution and effect to this or that power conferred by the terms of the federative constitution on the general government if without apposite and effective remedy these acts of disobedience to the general will are committed in and by any one member of the confederacy so will they be sooner or later in and by every other and thus will the whole fabric fall to pieces instructional ratiocinative art    for security against every such catastrophe a body of land stipendiaries a little standing army—with or without a portion of permanent naval force according to local situation—will naturally be kept on foot instructional ratiocinative art    but this standing army it may be said may in the hand of the general government be—and will always be but too apt to be—an instrument of tyranny yes if illproportioned but no if wellproportioned and to its being wellproportioned nothing more is necessary than that it should be strong enough to put an end to disobedience on the part of this or that one of the confederated states without being strong enough to produce that same effect against the defensive force of the majority of the population belonging to the aggregate of the confederated states further details belonging not to the present chapter—see ch xxxi government simple or federative instructional art    as to the radical branch peculiar to a pure republic and mixed form of government is this securityaffording function of this branch of the defensive force establishment preserved from all care of preservation from loss are all they who have nothing to lose preserved from all care about security against the ruling one are the members of a community governed by a pure monarchy for that which a man hath not he cannot fear to lose preserved from all care about security against the ruling few in the same manner are the members of a community governed by a pure aristocracy in none but a republic or a mixed government therefore can there be either security or care about security section ii leading principles instructional art   in regard to this composite portion of the establishment belonging to the executive department as in regard to the several others the object and endeavour of the legislator will of course be—to maximize the appropriate aptitude of it with relation to its several ends instructional expositive ratiocinative art   these ends are two—positive and negative first come positive ends   principal or main positive end conduciveness to the security against hostility from without   collateral and secondary positive end subserviency to any other branch or branches of the public service to wit in so far as practicable without causing preponderant detriment to this present branch instructional expositive ratiocinative art   negative ends—  minimizing the danger to the supreme authority and thence to the whole community from the quantity of force lodged in an authority intended to be subordinate   minimizing the amount of the attendant evil in all shapes—the burthen in all other shapes—including the expense in all shapes—at the price of which this good this security is endeavoured to be purchased instructional art   of the entire establishment the appropriate aptitude in all shapes will depend upon and will be in exact proportion to the appropriate aptitude of the persons and things     of which the stock belonging to this compound subdepartment is composed instructional art   as to the subjectmatters belonging to the head of things the consideration of aptitude on their part is a subject not belonging to the present head considerations having for their object the maximization of this or any other part of the government stock taken in the aggregate that is to say the augmentation of it in proportion as the expense allotted to the purpose will admit may be seen in ch ix ministers collectively—section   statistic function instructional art   as to the material stock composed of the appropriate things for what regards the choice of them see the military code and the temporary and local regulations and mandates from time to time grounded on it as to the mode of keeping account of them see ch ix section   statistic function instructional art   in so far as regards the personal stock the appropriate aptitude of this branch of the establishment will be as the appropriate aptitude of the several persons of whom it is composed the rendering their operations subservient to their abovementioned appropriate ends belongs as above in detail to the military code but when considered in a general point of view and with reference to their effects on the constitution it belongs also to the present constitutional code instructional art   with reference to these ends all other arrangements which present themselves as conducive to the accomplishment of them may in proportion as apt names can be found for the designation of them be stated as subordinate ends or in one word means of this distinction indication having thus been given a convenience will be found in bringing them to view together main and subordinate in one list instructional art   connected with and correspondent in signification to the words ends and means are the word rules and the word principles expositive art  0 an end being assumed as fit to be aimed at by the word rule is expressed in a general way a proposition indicative of a course of action by the maintenance of which it is by him who lays down the rule supposed that with or without the aid and observance of other rules probability will be given to the attainment of that same end instructional expositive art    but a rule consists of a number of words which in the logical sense compose an entire proposition or say in more ordinary language an entire assertion and as in one and the same proposition in one and the same rule may be contained words in number abundant and altogether indeterminate—hence it is that for bringing or rather for recalling to view a conception more or less clear correct and comprehensive of the matter of a rule a single word the word principle is by universal experience found a convenient and serviceable instrument and so far as this employment is given to it—for every rule we either have already or are authorized to devise and employ a correspondent principle sometimes also by one word employed as the name of a principle rules more than one—rules even in an indefinite number—may be recalled or even brought to view instructional ratiocinative art    of the two branches of the defensive force the most convenient standard of reference fittest therefore to occupy the first place in the order of exposition though latest in the order of existence is the stipendiary it is among the fruits of civilisation the products of appropriate art and science being of the two branches so much the more efficient it is the only one which in more or less amplitude is at present to be found in existence in every political community it is the only one that suits that which is everywhere the actual end of government namely the prosperity of those by whom the powers of government are possessed this being accordingly everywhere the subjectmatter of superior culture—the radical of inferior culture or of none—the radical has everywhere pined or withered under the shade of it in it accordingly is to be looked for the complete list of those properties on the possession of which     the aptitude of the system for its purposes real or professed or both depends instructional art    in each of the two branches so many of these desirable properties so many principles under the head of each branch follows a list of the properties thence of the principles belonging to it the two lists being for mutual illustration placed columnwise side by side i stipendiary branch ii radical branch   external security maximizing   external security maximizing   internal security maximizing   internal security maximizing   aptitude maximizing   aptitude maximizing   number minimizing   number maximizing   contentment maximizing   contentment maximizing   inequality minimizing   inequality minimizing   employment extending or say diversifying   inapplicable here   time occupying   inapplicable here   expense minimizing   expense minimizing  0 preponderant detriment excluding  0 preponderant detriment excluding instructional art    in these lists will it is believed be found words indicative of all the several distinguishable properties which can be stated as being desirable ones that is to say as being contributory to the rendering the management of the branches of defensive force in question conducive to their respective ends but in the best form which could here be given to it such is the imperfection of language that antecedently to the conveying of any tolerably clear correct and comprehensive conception some words of explanation it will be necessary to employ in regard to each instructional art    i  ii as to the security maximizing principles externalsecuritymaximizing and internalsecuritymaximizing to neither of the two branches the stipendiary and the radical of the defensive force establishment could a title to the possession of the correspondent desirable properties be disallowed for in both instances the propriety of the end in the character of a main end and the necessity of rendering the means conducive to the attainment of that end are alike unquestionable but in the instance of the radical force a particular import requires to be attached to it over and above that which belongs to it in both instances in both instances reference is made to an evil against which in the character of a source of evil security requires to be provided in both instances this evil is composed of mischief in all imaginable shapes considered as producible by foreigners acting in the character of enemies but in the instance of the radical force to this evil is added an evil of the same sort and extent considered as producible by individuals belonging to the stipendiary force itself acting in that same character and against evil from this source the only source of security is that which is afforded by the radical force instructional art    thus it is that while the contributing to security in both its branches is a property common to both these branches of the national defensive force in the instance of the stipendiary the property of primary importance is that of affording security against danger from without a property of but secondary importance is that of affording security against danger from within in the instance of the radical force the proportion is reversed in this instance the property of affording security against danger from without is but of secondary importance the property of affording security against danger from within—that is to say from casual hostility on the part of the appointed guardians—is the property of primary importance for the modes in which the stipendiary force may be rendered subservient to the purpose of internal security see section    collateral employments and ch xi ministers severally section   preventive service minister instructional art    iii aptitudemaximizing principle of the property or say quality brought to view by this appellation the subjectmatters alluded to bear it may be observed in both instances the same generic names that is to say persons and things persons constituting the personal stock of this compound branch of the official establishment things the material stock of both these subjectmatters explanation has been given in ch ix ministers collectively section   statistic function but as in the two branches of the defensive force compared the one with the other the individuals respectively belonging to them are in every individual instance different so to a considerable extent will be the description of the properties belonging to them or desirable in them respectively when considered in the aggregate instructional art    after mention made of the property indicated by the word securitymaximizing mention of the property indicated by the word aptitudemaximizing may seem superfluous but that which the word security indicates is but the effect nothing being brought     by it to view in the character of a cause whereas that which is brought to view by the word aptitude is of that same effect the immediate cause instructional art    in name and general design appropriate aptitudemaximizing is a property that applies alike to both these branches of the defensive force but in nature and particular description the difference is considerable in the case of the stipendiary branch the demand for it is at its maximum in the radical at its minimum in the stipendiary it includes not only the manipulationary and evolutionary movements with small arms but moreover other branches of physical art and science wide in extent and variety mechanical and chemical for example—through the medium of fortification and artillery exercise in the case of the radical force the small arms exercises as above are those with which the members in general will naturally be apt to content themselves instructional art  0 iv in the instance of the stipendiary branch number minimizing in that of the radical branch number maximizing by the opposition thus exhibited the idea of inconsistency will be apt to be suggested and but for the requisite explanation might remain attached but in the instance of the stipendiary force when minimization of the number is stated as desirable what is understood is that even setting aside the article of expense under a constitution such as in all other respects the one here proposed would be the number of these functionaries cannot be too small the perfect state of things would be—that in which it was equal to 0 instructional ratiocinative art    then again in the case of radical force what in this instance is to be understood is not the absolute number but the relative number relation had to those composing the stipendiary force why because the greater the number of those of whom the radical force is composed the greater the security against all enterprises to the temptation of engaging in which the members of the stipendiary force stand exposed instructional art    here then between principle and principle and between desirable property and desirable property may be seen to have place a sort of relation—antagonization the existence of which there will be frequent occasion to bring to view and whenever it has place a choice will be to be made and a line drawn from the consideration of local and temporary circumstances instructional art    to the two mutually antagonizing principles—to wit the number minimizing as applied to the stipendiary force and the number maximizing as applied to the radical force correspond the rules which follow with their respective reasons rule   minimize the stipendiary force so far as is consistent with security against hostility from without ratiocinative art    reasons   minimization of danger to the constitution from insubordination on the part of these functionaries and from resistance to or even forced ascendancy over their respective superordinate authorities whether in the military line or the nonmilitary to wit the army minister the navy minister the prime minister and the legislature   minimization of expense—of the quantity of the expense bestowed upon the service of this compound subdepartment   minimization of power and disposition on the part of the government to engage in offensive aggression against other states and thence to involve this state in needless and internally pernicious warfare instructional art    rule   maximize the radical force—to wit so far as is consistent with the nonemployment of compulsory means for the formation or maintenance of it ratiocinative art    reasons for the maximization   maximization of security and sense of security against danger of insubordination and ascendancy on the part of the stipendiary force   giving increase to the chance and facility of affording without expense of bounty or enlistment or at less expense as well as without compulsion increase in case of need to the stipendiary force ratiocinative art    reasons for the limitative proviso—evil effects the following   on the part of the individuals to whom the compulsion is applied—the correspondent quantity of suffering   expense employed in the application of this compulsion—the instrument which must have been employed in the application of it if it be efficacious being the appropriate and necessary portion of the stipendiary force increase thence given to the quantity of this most expensive species of force and thence to the expense of it   a civil war thus raised between one part of the people alone on the one side and one part of the people in conjunction with the stipendiary force on the other side thence danger to the constitution as per art      0   if in any place in any instance compulsion employed on this occasion by the civil power alone—that is to say by the small force habitually under the command of the judicial authorities—has been efficacious—it is because the degree of reluctance thus surmounted has either in intensity or in extent not been very considerable   true it is that in this or that case it may not be impracticable to employ a part of the voluntarily serving radical force of one part of the country in the application of compulsion to the production of enlistment in the radical branch of the military force in another part of the country but in this case by the supposition commencement is given to a species of civil war and thus in the meantime instead of being strengthened the aggregate of the military force of the community is weakened instructional ratiocinative art    v contentmentmaximizing principle peculiar in degree not to say altogether to the military branch of the public service will be seen to be the demand for a principle under this name peculiar whether the interest of the public at large or that of the particular class of functionaries in question be considered i as to the public interest to contentment suppose to a certain degree discontentment substituted of discontentment substituted to contentment possible consequences are—insubordination mutiny revolt subversion of the government—substitution of a military despotism for whatsoever form of government the people had by habit with or without affection been more or less attached to these consequences not only possible but as history shows to no small extent actually realized instructional ratiocinative art    connexion which the contentmentmaximizing has with the expenseminimizing principle the worse the treatment which by men who are not in the situation is understood as being given to those who are in it—the higher the remuneration which ere they enter into it they will require the better the treatment the smaller the remuneration they will be disposed to accept instructional ratiocinative art  0 ii now as to the private or say the particular interest in every other branch of the public service for the investing of the system with the desirable property here in question the arrangements proposed in ch ix ministers collectively section    under the head of oppression obviated were regarded as sufficient but in all those cases whatsoever of hardship presses upon a man while in the situation he has at all times the power of liberating himself from by so simple an operation as the going out of it in a word by selfdislocation not only with the use but with the very existence of the military service understand in this case the stipendiary branch the existence of this faculty is obviously and utterly incompatible as there is no sort of practice how mischievous or foolish soever for which agreements may not come to have been entered into—agreements for terms invariably limited may have been entered into though in the stipendiary branch any such agreement is in the very nature of the case void and unfit to be observed since by no breach of it on the part of government is in any case any mischief capable of being produced so great as in some cases would necessarily be produced by the strict observance of it the practical result is therefore in every such agreement a reservation of the power of giving to the term any such extension as a case of necessity incapable of being described in detail may at any time happen to require by a clause to this effect inserted in the instrument of agreement discontentment from this source may be effectually prevented by no other means can it be instructional art    opposite to contentment is discontentment main source of discontentment in the instance of the stipendiary branch—treatment during the term of service in the instance of the radical branch compulsion applied to give commencement to the term of service as to this see section   arts          instructional ratiocinative art    vi inequalityminimizing principle in some respects this principle with the desirable property correspondent to it may be considered as included and thence as already brought to view under another head to wit under that of the contentmentmaximizing desirable property and principle for as between one person and another whatsoever inequality is the work of law—which to the purpose is as much as to say of force—is in proportion to the degree of it a natural source of discontentment so of course any arrangement the tendency of which is to lessen the effect of that same force will in so far tend to give increase to contentment but arrangements may be found which while the effect or tendency of them is to lessen discontent in so far as producible in this way shall not be contributory to the production of it in any other way here then will be a reason nor that an insufficient one for a separate mention see section   oppression obviated section  0 remuneration section    collateral employment instructional art    a consideration obviously presented by the nature and use of the two branches of this service is—that in two cases as compared the one with the other the task     of lessening the inequality will be a very different one as between commander and commander inequality increases so of course will the magnitude and efficiency of the power of command and the greater the inequality naturally attached to this entire system of factitious arrangements the greater the difficulty of lessening it by any particular arrangement or arrangements without producing preponderant evil by lessening the efficiency of the whole of that body of security which it is the main object of this part of the establishment to provide thus it is that as with the securitymaximizing antagonizes the contentmentmaximizing principle so in its own particular way does the inequalitymaximizing principle instructional art    scarcely on any other account than that of the relation it bears to those other two principles respectively has the inequalityminimizing principle as applied to either branch and in particular to the stipendiary any claim to notice but to put the system in possession of the correspondent desirable property requires a distinct set of arrangements and consequently a distinct measure of attention to prevent the minor from being swallowed up by the major object on this occasion to secure efficiency to whatsoever means come to be employed a particular degree of attention will be rendered needful by the opposing obstacles instructional art    in the military branch of the public service it is and more particularly in the stipendiary subbranch that the need of inequality is at its maximum this being obvious to all eyes hence the danger lest by the inconsiderate concurrence of the popular with the legal sanction the inequality should be permitted to have place in excess this tendency seems to be of the number of the most naturally powerful obstacles with which on this occasion the guardian care of the legislator will have to contend instructional art    vii employmentextending or say diversifying principle in the relation borne by this branch of the official establishment to the state of war—joined to the wide difference between a state of war and a state of peace—lies the cause of the demand which has place for the mention of this principle in no one of the several other departments or subdepartments is there any place for so sudden a variation as in these two subdepartments in the quantity of the demand for appropriate official service in time of war never can the quantity of service capable of being rendered be so much as equal to the quantity in demand and by the indisputable and unchangeable nature of the service it is rendered necessary that of each mans time the whole quantity should be at the absolute disposal of the directing functionary on the spot for extra demands provision by location of occasional deputies a provision in the civil branches of the service so easy and serviceable is in this impossible in this branch in the time of peace the number of functionaries being supposed the same as in war the quantity of appropriate service demanded at their hands is comparatively speaking next to none here there being a quantity of time left without appropriate employment and in this sense in a state of vacuity hereupon comes the question—in what way with most advantage to the general interest of the public and to the particular interest of the class of functionaries in question—in what way with most advantage to both these interests taken together the vacancy may be filled expositive art    viii timeoccupying principle by the time here in question understand in the case of each functionary that portion of his time which is not occupied in the performance of his appropriate official service generally speaking it will only be this or that portion of this or that particular day take for the subjectmatter of consideration a series of days—either uninterrupted or with interruptions—and it may be considered as capable of being disposed of on the ground of the collateralemployment principle as to which see section    expositive art    scarcely in any other line of official service than the military can any demand have place for the considerations which the mention of this principle is designed to bring to view nor in the military line of service does the demand apply to any other than the stipendiary branch in the case of the radical branch the greater part of each mans time is employed in more uniformly necessary or otherwise desirable occupations the superfluous part alone if any is that which in that case can be allotted to the occupation carried on by the performance of official service expositive art    in speaking of the timeoccupying principle what is here assumed is that on the day in question by the operations strictly professional and exclusively appropriate the whole of the disposable portion of the fourandtwenty hours will not be filled up remains on this supposition a quantity of time capable of being employed—with more or less advantage—to government to the individual to both or to other purposes at large instructional art  0 in relation to the application capable of being made of this principle rules that     present themselves as appropriate are the following   of the day of a functionary belonging to the stipendiary branch of the defensive force leave not unemployed on the account of government any portion that can be so employed consistently with his comfort and recreation   in so far as consists with his comfort give to his recreations all such shapes as promise to be in the highest practicable degree conducive to his appropriate aptitude with relation to the service   by recreations understand on this occasion such occupations as being conducive to present pleasure are not detrimental to health or in any other way to the aggregate interest of life   lest by the idea of obligation and coercion an occupation which would otherwise be acceptable should by the circumstance of its appearing to be prescribed by government be rendered unacceptable—let the choice of it although antecedently made in a general way by the government be on each individual occasion felt and by each individual person understood to be made by himself instructional art    for this purpose one course is the making provision of things immoveable or moveable adapted to the purpose of serving as instruments of the occupation in question and placing them within his reach instructional exemplificational art    of things by access to and use of which this purpose is capable of being served examples are as follow i for active occupation   ground and appropriate furniture adapted to the purpose of the various exercises styled gymnastic   waters in which—without annoyance to persons of the female sex in respect of decency—swimming may be practised   covered places in which and instruments by which the exercise of fencing broadsword quarterstaff singlestick wrestling and other pastimes partaking of or approaching to the nature of military exercises may be practised   various places where pastimes of which balls of one sort or other are the principal instruments may be partaken of ii for sedentary occupation   appropriate libraries with their contents instructional art    ix expenseminimizing principle—included in this case too is the assumption—that for the purpose of security external and internal and thence of adequate appropriate aptitude and contentment sufficient provision is made and that by no additional expenditure that could be bestowed on the service of any one of the departments in question could any equivalent addition be made to the serviceableness of the whole instructional art    for reduction and thence for the minimization of expense in its several shapes meaning always the balance on the side of expense—the nature of things presents two different and in form opposite though in effect accordant modes   direct to wit by defalcation of what is needless as to which so far as regards the personal stock see section  0 remuneration   indirect to wit by return in the shape of profit from the aggregate stock as to which see section    collateral employment instructional art    x preponderant detrimentexcluding principle this desirable property thus brought to view with the correspondent principle applies to the whole system taken together and consequently to each of the several arrangements made under the guidance of the abovementioned principles to be borne constantly in mind and serve occasionally as a memento is the use of this principle and consequently the purpose for which the mention thus made of it is here made seldom will any special arrangement be anywhere suggested by it seldom anything more than the cautions which are thus given—in the first place not to give existence to any arrangement without the conception of a quantity of the matter of good in this or that specific shape presenting itself as about to be produced by the arrangement—in the next place not to make any arrangement for the attainment of such good without sufficient assurance that by such arrangement along with such good evil preponderant over it in all elements of value taken together propinquity and certainty not forgotten will not be produced instructional ratiocinative art    uses of the exhibition thus made of these principles   assisting the conception and memory of the directing functionaries employed in the business of this compound subdepartment to wit by keeping constantly under their eyes a representation as clear comprehensive and correct as may be of the subjectmatters calling for their attention   assisting their judgment by keeping at the same time under their eyes the conflicting demands made upon them by the mutuallyantagonizing principles on both sides in such sort that to each a due and no more than a due regard may be paid   assisting their invention by putting it to them to consider whether these are all the items that belong to the account and if not to add such as are wanting allotting to them for that purpose their appropriate denominations with any such explanations as the nature of the case may have suggested     section iii radicals who expositive art   exceptions excepted to the radical branch of the defensive force will belong at all times all who being apt with respect to the performance of the appropriate exercise are willing to join therein none who are not willing appropriate denomination accordingly volunteers instructional art   to all such as being as above apt are at the same time willing the government will be disposed to afford the necessary instruments of instruction persons and things included instructional expositive art   the appropriate personal instruments of instruction will be persons of the same class as those by whom the corresponding instruction is afforded in the stipendiary branch of the defensive force say for example for the appropriate manipulations and evolutions upon the smallest scale drill sergeants for the appropriate evolutions upon the larger scale superior officers with or without appropriate habiliments as per section   art    no  0 instructional expositive art   the appropriate material instruments of instruction will be the least expensive of those which will suffice for the exercises for articles no otherwise employed than by being instantaneously consumed—powder and ball for example—no absolute need will for this species of service have place exemplificational art   examples are—   musquets which having been employed or destined to be employed in the stipendiary service have been ascertained to be unserviceable and accordingly condemned and eliminated   instruments which—though incapable of being employed in firing have at a minimum of expense been rendered in a degree sufficient for this purpose conformable in respect of materials weight composition form and size to those employed in firing in actual service principle the expense minimizing instructional art   to the legislature it will belong to consider whether in addition to infantry service instruments of instruction as above shall at government expense be afforded for volunteers in other more expensive branches of exercise for example in cavalry common artillery and horseartillery service principle the expenseminimizing instructional ratiocinative art   as to pay or remuneration in any other expensive shape no immediately effective service being called for or needed no such expensive instruments will it is supposed need to be nor therefore at government expense ought to be employed principle the expenseminimizing instructional ratiocinative art   as to the number of the individuals in whose instance for the operations in question spontaneous inclination by whatsoever motives produced has place—the number it is supposed will for the sort of preliminary and contingently useful service in question be sufficient in the event of its being so neither reward nor punishment could for the purpose of giving determination to will be employed without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of uncompensated expense principle the expenseminimizing instructional art   exceptions excepted to the instrumentary means above afforded at the public expense the volunteers in question will in each district subdistrict and bissubdistrict be at liberty to make by voluntary subscriptions such additions as they feel inclined to make principle the aptitudemaximizing instructional ratiocinative art  0 exception is—where by a disposition made of the funds so formed a probable effect might be the giving an undue ascendancy to the more opulent over the less opulent classes or to the population of one part of the territory of the state over that of another example—   one part exercised by firing at marks either with rifles or firelocks while in the case of others firing makes no part of the exercise   one part performing cavalry as well as infantry exercise while in the case of others the infantry is the only exercise   one part employing in their exercise horse artillery cannon or mortars while in the case of others no such additional and preeminently expensive instruments of warfare are employed principle the inequalityminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    the legislature will not it is supposed look for radicals in the character of volunteers elsewhere than in towns of considerable size and in the near neighbourhood of such towns reason   avoidance of the expense in labour and money of journeys to and from the place of exercise principle the expenseminimizing reason   avoidance of the exclusion put     upon those who are unable to afford the expense the advantage thus given to the relatively opulent at the charge of the relatively indigent principle the inequalityminimizing expositive art    on this occasion as on that of the demarcation of the territories of immediate judicatories—by near neighbourhood understand a distance not exceeding that which by a person not incapacitated by special infirmity of mind or body may be traversed to and fro on the same day without need of sleeping away from home leaving moreover an interval of time sufficient for the performance of the business in question at the seat of business ratiocinative art    why on this occasion and for this purpose cannot compulsion be advantageously employed answer reasons   for procuring for this service men in sufficient number—compulsion it is presumed would not be needed   repugnant would the employment of compulsion be to the several principles following that is to say i aptitudemaximizing—ii numberminimizing—iii contentmentmaximizing—iv inequalityminimizing—v expenseminimizing ratiocinative art    i aptitudemaximizing in this case as in every other the greater a mans relish for the service be it what it may the greater in so far as depends upon relish will be the probability of his appropriate aptitude in relation to it—the less the less his appropriate aptitude that is to say in every one of its branches—moral cognitional judicial and active thus far as to the aptitude of the several individuals individually considered now as to aptitude on the part of the whole taken together by the supposition on the part of this branch appropriate aptitude will not be upon a par with what it is in the case of the stipendiary branch if it were no adequate reason would there be why future and contingent should be purposely substituted to present serviceableness and actual service that is to say no adequate reason for affording facility as above to the keeping on foot of the radical branch of the national force ratiocinative art    ii numberminimizing to the number of the individuals of whom the aggregate of the defensive force would be composed so far as compulsion were applied here would be an addition made without any proportionable addition to the efficiency of that same force of this addition the amount would be the exact number of the individuals of whom the addition in question would be composed and of these not one would be about to enter or fit to enter into the stipendiary branch not one in a word fit for actual service ratiocinative art    iii contentmentmaximizing by compulsion to the whole extent of its application maximized would be—not contentment but discontentment on the part of the whole difference between the number raised and kept on foot by compulsion and the number that could be raised and kept on foot without it—discontentment to a greater or less amount would of course have place so many as are the individuals thus engaged so many individuals whose endeavours instead of joining in the service would be employed either in avoiding the being attached to it—or if attached in deserting from it for the consequence of such a state of things in respect of efficiency and expense see below—arts        0 ratiocinative art    iv inequalityminimizing here again instead of minimization comes maximization a state of enjoyment the state of a few a state of sufferance and oppressedness the state of the many in this case actual service is supposed payment for exemption constitutes another and a very different case in the case of payment for exemption the inequality is not altogether unsusceptible of measurement completely unsusceptible it is in the case of actual forced service ratiocinative art    v expenseminimizing here either the number will be incomplete and to the correspondent degree the design frustrated or deserters originally or subsequentially such will be to be pursued and endeavoured to be caught but to the expense requisite for this purpose no assignable bounds can be found for each deserter pursuers more than one will be to be employed of the whole number pursued only a portion will be caught in so far as the endeavour to catch them is successful then comes the expense of prosecution and of the number of those prosecuted only a portion will in all probability be convicted and of that portion again only a portion punished and forcibly aggregated to the corps then again on the part of those thus aggregated will naturally remain the most anxious desire and endeavour to desert anew and so toties quoties but while a part more or less considerable are being thus dealt with the whole must and at the expense of the public be maintained to serve in this or any other capacity every man who from property of his own or other sources has not wherewithal to keep himself alive must be kept alive at the expense of the public or he dies but in the distribution of     the matter of pay to find out who can and who cannot live without it is not in this case practicable pay if given to any must then be given to all to the expense of hunting and catching a part more or less considerable is thus added the expense of keeping the whole and for the only actual service which is looked for at their hands not one of them as yet so fit or so much as expected to be so fit as those actually belonging to the stipendiary branch to which they are designedly kept from being aggregated instructional ratiocinative art    thus it is that on willingness depend aptitude contentment equality frugality—everything desirable but willingness—on what does it depend answer upon time and distance first as to time in vain would it be looked for on the part of a man who not having for his days subsistence anything but his days labour is called upon to give it—and without equivalent—to poor and rich together the day on which no man labours—on which no man does anything for his subsistence—this if any must then be the day and the only day on which a man who has no quantity of the means of subsistence in advance can reasonably be expected to be found willing to take part in this or any other kind of pastime by this consideration the possibility of obtaining men for this service without preponderant detriment is confined to the day of general repose thus much as to time instructional ratiocinative art  0 now as to distance in vain would willingness be looked for on the part of a daylabourer who to bear his part in this pastime for a small part of a day—even though it be as above the day of general repose—would have to give up the whole remainder of that same day with part of another and the whole of the intervening night thus it is that the possibility of obtaining men for this service—without preponderant detriment as above—seems confined to the site and near vicinity of towns of considerable magnitude nor to either party need this limitation be all things considered a subject of regret in town as contrasted with the country—in the seat of the densest not in that of the thinnest population—has the nature of man in unison with the nature of things placed the seat of the most intellectual public what the town pays in labour it thus gains in influence what the country parts with in influence it saves in labour and it has been seen how vast the saving is nor by this division is the population separated into castes with permanently conflicting interests town remaining always open to emigrants from country country to emigrants from town instructional exemplificational art    to an english or englishbred mind the idea of an aggregate body the individuals of which are brought together by compulsion with a view to landarmy service—and which is distinguished from an army by its comparative unserviceableness for the purposes for which both are intended—presents the word militia as to the existence of this institution in england and in the angloamerican united states it is unquestionable to find for it anything like a use must be the work of imagination two and no more than two uses does this instrument it is believed ever bring to mind   supposable use the first nursery for the army this phrase may serve to give expression to one—  supposable use the second protection against the army and those who have the command of it this phrase may serve for the other as to the benefit derivable from the keeping up at all times—by pay and compulsion to boot a large body of ineffective men with no better prospect than that of a chance of being able with or though it were even without compulsion at one time or other to aggregate a small portion of it to the effective army instead of aggregating to that body on each occasion at the minimum of expense the number actually wanted and no more—this first imaginable use has just been held up to view instructional art    under the head of contentmentmaximizing the affliction attached to compulsory service in this line has been brought to view to save from all such affliction themselves and their associates it has of course been the effectual care of rulers to grant exemption from it to purchasers price for a temporary exemption say for example as under english militia law £ 0 of the persons on whom the obligation is imposed some there will be who having for their all this same £ 0 purchase the exemption pay for it such their all and suffer accordingly others who if they had had the money would gladly have paid it for the exemption but not having the money serve per force and suffer accordingly still more than those from whom their all has as above been taken thus stands the matter at the bottom of the scale of opulence look now to the top others there are each of whom having a million of pounds at command pay the  00000th part of their property and suffer nothing between these two extremes rise in the scale of inequality as many degrees as there are farthings between the ten pounds and the million of pounds nor is this highest degree of inequality regarded as sufficient for at the top of the scale persons there will be sure to be and in considerable numbers of whom such effectual care will have been taken that they     will have the benefit of the exception without paying so much as one farthing for it such under matchless constitution is the regard paid on this occasion to the inequalityminimizing principle instructional art    remains the protection imagined to be afforded or affordable by the militia against the army against the army and thence against those who have the command of this lastmentioned instrument the force and formidableness of which are not open to dispute here if the use itself is imaginary—not so is the fact of its having been held up to view and that by the highest authority in the character of a real one witness the english statute   th geo iii cap  0  passed for consolidating antecedent statutes by which the institution styled the militia had been legislated upon true it is nothing can exceed the delicacy with which the conception here in question is sought to be conveyed but what is meant is either the above or nothing a respectable military force under the command of officers possessing landed property within great britain is essential says the act to the constitution of the realm the militia now by law established has it continues been found capable of fulfilling the purposes of its institution such are the propositions by which in the guise of reasons the approbation of the subject many is bespoken for the institution—bespoken by the united wisdom and eloquence of the ruling one and the subruling few instructional art    thus much for profession now for efficiency and sincerity this shadowy instrument of security against the irresistible instrument of danger and the hand that wields it—by what hand if applied is it to be applied by that same hand and no other approving this policy would you pursue it with consistency—one course and one course alone lies open to you an invasion is that what you are afraid of to the apprehended invader give the command of whatsoever army you have for your defence buonaparte when at boulogne was the man to have commanded your army buonaparte—not the king the prince regent or the duke of york instructional art    the engine with its primum mobile being in such hands the machinery—can it be worth looking at look then at the intermediate wheels persons holding command in this body—to whom does it belong to locate them to the monarch every one to whom to dislocate them and that at pleasure to the same on whom at all times does it depend whether motion shall be given to them to the same oh but the officers must each of them have a piece of land belonging to him true but such a piece that putting all the pieces together the aggregate will still fall short of what is possessed by this or that individual whom the vision of a star in the east will lead at all times whithersoever his majesty pleases remain all this while the privates and if as above proposed it was on their own freewill that their convention and their operations depended then indeed the security might amount to something but no matchless constitution knows better things instructional art    well then—this same machinery—is it altogether useless by no means to whom then is it of use to the engineers—the civil engineers—king lords and commons that have charge of it and its value to them what is it answer—year ending   th december      £    0    s  d note however that what this year gives is the minimum of its value this year the militia was not as the phrase is called out if called out the value of it as above would to an indefinite amount have received increase instructional art    so much for england turn now to the angloamerican united states when the democracy there does wrong it is by thoughtless continuation of the usages of the corrupt monarchy out of which it sprung witness senate as to which see below ch xxix witness common law militiamen—on paper say   00000† number in attendance everywhere variable at all times unascertainable for estimating effects two portions of the aggregate must be distinguished those whom freewill and those whom compulsion brings together to the last alone applies what follows‡     instructional art    danger being equal to 0 query the value of the best security of danger from without sole possible source hostility from the small still unevaporated remnant of the savage race miles of frontier between  000 and  000 for lining it number of stipendiaries authorized by law      officers included in actual existence the whole number never on the   st of october           a little more than two to a mile in existence why so few answer—because judging from experience more are thought not to be needed instructional art    so much for security against danger from without now as to security against danger from within against danger from the abovementioned      stipendiaries of the men who in the character of riflemen have from boyhood been at least as much practised in the effective use of firelocks as any of the abovementioned      stipendiaries what shall conjecture state as the number fifty times as many twenty times as many ten times as many strange if for bringing the danger down to 0 the least of these numbers be not amply sufficient reckoning as amounting to nothing in respect of appropriate force the number of the fencible men not thus practised instructional art  0 so much for security in all shapes now as to expense expense of the price paid for it under this head a little more accuracy would be worth obtaining were obtainment possible meantime note that under this head compulsoriness or noncompulsoriness makes no difference the pecuniary loss by the nonperformance of productive labour being in both cases the same but if and in so far as in addition to this loss money or moneys worth on the score of pay or equipment is expended—thereupon comes a correspondent addition to this same loss in the united states average value of a days labour a dollar say on a low calculation half a dollar in english sterling  s taking the dollar for even money at no more than  s number of each militiamans attendance—days in the year four this gives for the yearly expense of his attendance dollars two english sterling  s this multiplied by the abovementioned   00000 gives dollars   00000—pounds sterling   0000 compare this with the total expense of the general government in dollars not more than seven millions in pounds sterling     000 instructional art    such is the expense the burden of which is designed and endeavoured to be imposed true it is that to a large and that an unascertainable amount the attendance is not paid and in so far the design is frustrated true it is that to that same amount a deduction will require to be made from the expense instructional art    but proportioned to this deduction from the expense comes an addition to the mischief and that to an amount by which all attempts to bring arithmetic to bear on it are set at defiance this consists in the debility infused into the whole legal system compulsory law covering the whole territory with its whole population and disobedience to it staring everybody in the face everywhere everywhere either the actual suffering from the compulsory obedience or the contingent and inappreciable mischief of debility in the government from the disobedience instructional art    as a substitute for the compound composed of indirect waste and the compulsion—pay to be employed simply has been proposed—pay to be given to a smaller number for longer and closer appropriate attendance and preparatory service that in this way the evil in all shapes might be lessened seems beyond dispute but for a security where there is no danger—for a security the value of which is equal to 0 0 would be a somewhat more appropriate payment than hundreds of thousands of pounds or dollars were there ever so few of them instructional art    but an invading army—oh yes a curious enough sight would be an invading army but from whence henceforward is it to come from no whither unless it be in a fleet of steamboats sent out from washington to fetch it yes the very last invasion from europe that the confederacy will ever have experienced is the one which was disposed of by that general in whom because the rifles under him performed so well the unreflecting multitude behold their fittest president instructional art    from england shall an armament come for this purpose if expense be mischief—more mischief will it have done in england—to england—before starting—than it could reasonably expect to do in the united states before the country had closed round it and disposed of it as burgoyne and cornwallis were disposed of if to the people of england the colonies called their

small number of those members of the community whose subsistence being permanently secured is drawn from masses of property already brought into existence and habitually kept up—no numbers anywhere sufficient for this service would voluntarily serve or could or ought to be made to serve constantly and gratuitously in time of actual service to such a degree is the occupation exposed to bodily hardship in the extreme in all imaginable shapes temporary and perpetual such hardships being moreover liable to terminate in the loss of the substance or use of bodily organs or limbs or of life itself and to those who have no such assured means of subsistence such gratuitous service would be impossible instructional expositive art   classes from the nature of the armature or say species of

according to the state of advancement at which the art and science of warfare has arrived instructional expositive exemplificational art    of the armature classes at present in use examples are the following i infantry serving by land on foot armed with firearms and bayonets—  infantry of the line intended to act in close order and for the most part in close combat αγχιμαχεσθαι cominus—  light infantry or say riflemen destined to act by their dispersed force and for the most part at a distance eminus ii cavalry i—serving on horseback   heavy horse or say in french cavalerie délite frequently cuirassiers   light horse commonly lancers   horse artillery including rockets† horse artillery is virtually cavalry all artillery used in the field or to accompany troops in their movements should be horse artillery any other is an impediment instead of aid ii serving amphibiously on foot or horseback   dragoons often confounded with cavalry in general but improperly they should be able when dismounted to form a body of infantry for close attack all great generals have known how to derive utility from a body of men on horseback possessing the quality of fighting on foot obstacle feudal and barbaric propensity to think service on foot less honourable   light dragoons or say mounted riflemen principally intended for the duty of outposts iii serving for defence or

part issuing commands to one another any more than to officers in the several grades instructional ratiocinative art    necessary to the attainment of the end in view—in every line of service but more eminently in this—is mutual conformity of operation on the part of cooperators necessary to adequate conformity of operation is on one part obedience necessary even to obedience itself is on the other part command at the time of actual service during a battle for example in no number of privates will the need of command and obedience to the production of conformity in operation be diminished much less done away by the death disablement or casual absence of all superordinates between whom and them the faculty of communication has place in the army code provision will accordingly have been made for the contingency thus indicated instructional expositive art    ranks one namely the lowest is composed of privates it can hardly be called a grade the other ranks are so many grades instructional

maintained or from time to time varied by the legislature instructional exemplificational art    of these relations as they have place at present examples are as follows— lowest in this line is the grade of ensign or say second lieutenant exceptions excepted in this grade is placed every erudite officer on his first location instructional exemplificational art    in monarchical states in the present practice of nations civilized in the european manner—superordinate to the grade of ensign or say second lieutenant—and one to another in the order here following the lastmentioned to the

product of the labour of the labouring many particular and subsequent objects as per ch ix section    located how art    c on the occasion of this as of every other part of the official establishment is maximization of expense coupled with minimization of appropriate aptitude as to the particular set of arrangements which in the present instance the pursuit of these objects has had for its result—such is the diversification and perplexity which they exhibit that the exposition of it would occupy a far greater quantity of space than can here be afforded suffice it to add—that in the maximization of the expense care is taken that the most eligible lots shall be shared in the largest proportion practicable among the members of noble and other aristocratical families for whose further accommodation the quantity of aptitude necessary to location understand of aptitude in that shape in which it is the fruit of natural talent improved by labour is minimized as to this see further section   promotion instructional ratiocinative art    in any part of the abovementioned arrangements is the saving of expense to government among the objects plainly enough it may be seen to how much greater an extent that object cannot but be attained by the union of the reductional with the emptional bidding as per ch ix section    art   to   and the universality of its application to the lowest or original grade beyond which it cannot be carried with preponderant advantage as to which see this ch section   promotion moreover—to obviate the inaptitude producible by absolute deference to the joint result of the qualificationcompetition and the pecuniary competition—for this purpose as in all the other subdepartments so in this to an individually responsible functionary will the function of location be committed to wit to the minister of the subdepartment after mention made of the cognizance taken by him of the respective results of these same competitions and once more thus it is that the union is endeavoured to be effected between maximization of appropriate aptitude and minimization of expense section v term and conditions of service expositive art   in the

say subbranch of it that is to say land service sea service amphibious—or say marine service or to this or that rank or grade in any one of these same subbranches expositive enactive art   in the several subbranches of the stipendiary military service the business of location and dislocation is susceptible of diversifications the same as those which have been brought to view with reference to the members of the administrative department taken in the aggregate as per ch ix ministers collectively section    dislocable how but under denominations some of them peculiar to those two defensive force subdepartments in regard to exit no such favour—no such inequality—did the nature of the service leave possible on the part of every officer or of officers in any considerable number—suppose the faculty of exit left altogether to choice—perpetual danger of mischief to a boundless amount is the consequence even without concert without sinister design without inducement in any shape other than that of personal comfort—an army—any army or any part of it—might at any time be dissolved by concert and to a correspondent extent threat of eventual resignation—power to an indefinite amount might at any time be exercised exercised over the superordinate authorities including the supreme authority in the state consequence in a word at any time on any occasion the establishment of a military aristocratic or monarchical despotism expositive art   enlistment—recruitment—discharge—disbandment in these words may be seen so many denominations employed in giving designation to modes of location and dislocation liable to be different in some sort from those which have place in nonmilitary service as to location see above section   stipendiaries     who and section    recruitment as to dislocation see section    disbandment expositive art   enlistment is location voluntary or involuntary in the case of the military subbranches of both those modes is the operation of location

of public service only in the case of some change of system can any such extensive mode of dislocation as that which is termed disbandment have place and in that case the demand for the operation itself is to such a degree rare and casual that no appropriate denomination for it has grown into use to the landbranch of the defensive force is the frequent demand for it and consequent use of it confined to an extent more or less considerable the operation is the natural and always desirable result of a change from a state of war to a state of peace instructional art    in relation to the terms of defensive force service subjectmatters for the consideration of the legislature will be the following—regard being had to the different branches of the service and the different weapons and other material instruments of warfare therein employed   age earliest at which the enlistment of the individual shall have place   freedom in what cases if in any cases the enlistment shall be compulsory   age latest at which the individual shall continue on the list   reckoning from the day of enlistment length of the time during which the individual shall stand engaged to serve whether limited no otherwise than by the duration of his life and physical aptitude or likewise by a certain number of years   if by a certain number of years—shall this his term of service speaking in general language be long or short   the length of this term shall it be subjected to any modification in consideration of the age of the individual at the time of enlistment   at its expiration shall

shall it depend    punishments—to what and in what events respectively shall the individual be subjectable—and in each event in what shapes other than those to which a nonmilitary man is equally subjectable instructional ratiocinative art    note that whatsoever expenditure may be necessary on the score of subsistence scarcely any part of it can with safety be left to be defrayed by the individual himself out of that which is allotted to him in the shape of money reason—because the fluctuation which in his situation may have place in respect of the relative value of money may be such that from the insufficiency of the supply in respect of this or that article of subsistence unexpected hardship to an unlimited degree even to that of loss of life will be liable to ensue the degree in which such enhancement is capable of having place will be susceptible of indefinite augmentation by the scarcity liable to be produced in time of warfare by the circumstances of time and place instructional ratiocinative art    reasons in favour of a long term these—for a long term that is to say for the longest term consistent with the individuals continuance in a state of capacity for service in respect of health and strength   generally speaking with length of continuance in the service will increase practice and with practice aptitude principle the aptitudemaximizing   successive renewals may require correspondent bounties principle the expenseminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    reasons against a long term or say in favour of a short one these   in proportion as the individual is well treated the service will generally speaking answer his expectation and supposing it to answer his expectation—generally speaking he will with satisfaction join in the renewal of the engagement principle the contentmentmaximizing   in this case the shorter the term the stronger will be the motive by which the government will be solicited to make provision for good treatment to this class of public functionaries to make such provision to wit by appropriate enactments followed by execution and effect uniformly given to them in practice principle the contentmentmaximizing   as to expense the better the treatment in other respects the less will be the expense needed in the articles of subsistence and pecuniary pay principle the expenseminimizing instructional art    if a pension of retreat fixed or dependent on pleasure be included in the terms of the engagement it may be made greater in case of a second engagement still greater in case of a third and so on instructional art    in this case the past length of life at entrance into the original engagement may present a demand for consideration with a view to its being taken into the account instructional art    in the case of enlistment for a limited number of years—into the account of the expense may require to be taken that of conveyance to the individuals home as per art    no   the sort of government which has distant dependencies is however the only one under which this article of expense will     be found to possess any very considerable degree of importance and with a constitution such as the one here proposed the possession of distant dependencies will scarcely be found reconcileable instructional ratiocinative art    of an arrangement in relation to this subject the importance would range upon a scale varying in length from a few score miles to that of a semicircumference of the globe at the one end of the scale place the soldier in a stipendiary army kept up for common defence by the helvetic confederacy and at the expiration of his term suppose him in the territory of any one of the confederated states at the other end in an army in the english service and at the expiration of his service suppose him stationed in van diemans land or on some part of the northernmost boundary of british india in this case suppose the place of his first enlistment his own native place and that place anywhere about the middle of england the refusal or omission to reconvey him to such his native place or at any rate to some place or other in england might have the effect if not of homicide at any rate of perpetual banishment aggravated by hardships to the magnitude of which no limits can be assigned principles concerned—  the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing instructional art    note here the effect of an arrangement of this sort on the state of the army taken in the aggregate in so far as in the instance of each functionary the term of service is in duration limited—and in proportion as the duration is short—an eventual efflux and correspondent influx will have place for this continual change the legislature will of course have to make provision and in the register of the armyminister in the lists of the several functionaries belonging to the several corps attached to each mans name will be a memorandum expressive of the day on which his engagement expires together with the place to which in the event of a nonrenewal it may be necessary he should be conveyed and from these individual memorandums will be formed aggregate statements exhibiting in the case of each corps the efflux which in the several successive years will thus be produced and thence the influx that will be needed a separate account being kept for the casual efflux produced by death or by discharge for debilitation or other causes instructional art  0 by circumstances of a local and temporary nature—the legislature and under the legislature the appropriate minister will be guided in aggregating together in the several remote situations such functionaries in whose instance the reconveyance requires to be effected in such sort as to minimize at the same time on the one part the danger of preponderant detriment to the service on the other part the amount of the expense principles—  the preponderantevilalleviating   the expenseminimizing as

rights and obligations—its importance whatsoever be in other respects the conditions of the engagement an essential condition—a condition of the utmost importance to the interest of both parties—the public and the individual—is that the rights and the obligations the benefits and burthens certain and eventual which respectively belong to them in virtue of it be at all times as completely known as possible all contingencies liable to result from it included to the end that for all such contingencies the most effectual provisions possible may on both parts be made and thus the evil of disappointment as effectually as possible be averted principle the disappointmentprevention principle as to which see more in the penal codes of the rationale of which it constitutes to a large extent the foundation instructional ratiocinative art    only in proportion as they are antecedently and timely known can the benefits whatsoever they may be meant to be conferred by the establishment of rights be received—the burthens appointed to be eventually borne in the shape of the punishments appointed be avoided and forget not that every portion of punishment which cannot operate in the way of prevention nor yet in the way of compensation to individuals wronged is so much suffering expended in waste instructional art    to the accomplishment of this object an inseparable condition is that the expression given to the terms of the engagement—that is to say to the rights and the obligations—the benefits and the burthens—devolving upon each party in consequence of it as above—be committed to permanent signs—to words in the written form in a word to a code and that with reference to these same reciprocal rights and obligations this same code be an allcomprehensive one and in this as in all other cases as clear and correct and so far as is consistent with clearness as concise as possible name of it in the case of the stipendiary land service branch say the soldiers code instructional ratiocinative art    the more explicit the terms of the     enlistment paper the better assured will be the condition of the enlistee under the engagement expressed by it and the better assured his condition—the cheaper and in every respect better the terms on which it will be in the power of the government to obtain at all times such supply of those functionaries as it stands in need of and the better assured it will be of obtaining at their hands the renewal of the engagement in the event of its seeing reason to prefer short terms of years to long ones or terms for life principles   the

every state of things occurrence or event by which a termination is capable of being put to either principles   the internalsecuritymaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing enactive instructional art    for this same purpose at the time of enlistment an operation indispensably necessary is the delivery of a copy of this same soldiers code by the appropriate registrar into the hands of the enlistee together with the making entry of such delivery in the register enactive instructional art    this copy being for its more effectual preservation provided with a portable case in which it will be kept—the possessor will be at all times accountable for the existence and good condition of it accountable for it to wit in the same manner as for the habiliments arms and other moveables allotted by government to his use instructional ratiocinative art    a mans not being able to read is no reason for his not being provided with this implement for by no other means can he be at all times apprized either of his rights or his obligations—either of the services he stands bound to render or the punishments to which he stands exposed in the event of failure on his part in respect of the rendering them nor can this document be in any case a useless one for whether he himself be able to read or no he will at all times be in the presence of those who are if in the case of a private no comrade of his is—able at any rate will be some officer from whom he is habitually receiving orders instructional art    as to certainty and correspondent prevention of disappointment true it is that in respect of the effects of the right created and conferred by any engagement of this sort—absolute certainty is altogether incompatible with the very nature of the service but by every source of unavoidable uncertainty distinctly explicitly and faithfully brought to view and thus preannounced—disappointment and with it discontentment will be prevented—the condition of the functionary meliorated—and the price which it will be necessary for the government and the public to give for his services saved from needless increase instructional art  0 in every such code in the instance of every article having for its purport the establishment of an obligation on the part of government for the benefit of the individual—better the engagement were not inserted than when inserted broken not less repugnant to the principles of the supposed constitution in this than in every other branch of the public service—are all arbitrary dealings—and in particular all breaches of faith instructional art    true it is that in this branch great latitude of action on the part of the constituted authorities—much greater than in any other—may be necessitated by the nature of the service but for no such latitude in no line of action nor to any extent can need have place for any degree of latitude to which in the instrument of engagement expression cannot be given in the tenor and wording of it instructional art    to the nature or extent of the obligations to which during the continuance of the engagement it may be necessary that the functionary should be subjected no determinate limitation does the nature of the service admit of for by that same nature he cannot but be at any time and for any length of time exposed to death in every degree of probability from the lowest to the highest and were it not for such contingent exposure his service would be nothing worth never can fail to have place the eventual need of his exposing himself to more or less probable death by marching up to the cannons mouth this with certain death in the shape of punishment in the event of his declining so to do instructional art    on the other hand from all obligations other than what as above are essential to the nature of this particular branch of public service—he will in common with other functionaries belonging to the administrative department find protection and security in the principles exhibited in ch ix ministers collectively section    oppression obviated and moreover in the present case for the application     of those principles to practice in and by the military code—to the legislature it will belong to establish in conformity to those principles such particular arrangements as the nature of the case may appear to require see

shall the selection be made by choice in respect of the classes out of which it shall be made by choice in respect of the individuals who among those of the classes determined upon shall be selected or by chance in respect both of the classes and the individuals instructional art    prodigious are the difficulties which the exclusion of compulsion will in so far as it is found practicable exclude but as in number altogether indeterminate individual instances individual places and times may occur in which this practicability will not have place these difficulties may all of them come of necessity to be grappled with instructional ratiocinative art    under some governments with or without exceptions in favour of privileged classes—the natives of the male sex have by coercive law been aggregated to the land stipendiary force in the rank of privates in some instances from the age of adolescence in others from the time of birth and thereupon in some instances for and during more or less protracted but commonly at any rate limited terms no application however have those cases to the present case the land stipendiary branch being the branch in question and in those cases the numbermaximizing being the principle looked and acted upon in the present case the     opposite principles subject only to the eventual exceptions as per section    collateral employments instructional ratiocinative art    under the compulsory system—the classes being supposed determined—for the selection of the individuals the fortuitous mode of selection presents itself as the only one consistently applicable principles   the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing instructional art    nor yet would this same fortuitous mode be inapplicable to the voluntary or say spontaneous enlistment system for the qualifications necessary—in other words the elements of appropriate aptitude age stature and so forth being supposed determined—and notice given for all who are desirous to be enlisted to give in their names—this done out of the names given in the selection might be made by lot and that with not less propriety and facility in this case than as above in the opposite case principles   the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    in the framing of the enlistmentpaper and correspondent code care will be taken by the legislature to distinguish by as clear a line of separation as possible—and accordingly to place in two different sections—those obligations which are necessitated by and accordingly are intended to have place in a time of war only and those which are intended to have place in time of peace ratiocinative reasons   in time of war powers and eventual punishments will be necessary such as being in a time of peace unnecessary—and thence uselessly burthensome—will be naturally and unwarrantably odious and the line of separation being thus drawn that it may be more universally conspicuous the two portions of the code will naturally be placed in two different sections   the clearer the code is of all needless hardships—as well on the score of constant duty as on the score of eventual punishment—the more plainly eligible will be the condition of the individual and the cheaper the terms on which his voluntary service will be obtainable principles   the contentmentmaximizing   the expenseminimizing instructional art  0 for the consideration of the legislature it will moreover be—whether even in time of war a distinction may not with advantage on the above accounts be made between the powers and eventual punishments which are to have place in a state of things in which the corps to which the functionary belongs is within reach of the enemy and that in which it is not instructional exemplificational art    at the time of actual or nearlyimpending war—at any rate in or near the presence of an enemy—it is obviously and beyond dispute indispensably necessary that death should be a punishment capable of being attached to disobedience of orders but it follows not that any such punishment or indeed any punishment beyond that of dislocation should in time of peace be attached to an offence of a description so extensive and thence so indeterminate and thence in a proportionable degree in respect of the latitude of description that cannot but be given to it liable to give facility and impunity to oppression on the part of the superordinate authorities instructional art    a circumstance which in official service at large but more especially in this branch suffices to give in an especial degree in respect of certainty of appropriate evidence efficiency to the exercise of power and thence at the same time the faculty of reducing the magnitude of the lots of punishment—is the continual existence of the subordinate in the presence of his superordinates as in the case of rewards so in case of punishment the less the uncertainty the less the magnitude requisite and necessary instructional art    the peace arrangements and war arrangements being thus distinct and the state of peace being taken for the ordinary state of things and that which shall accordingly be made the subjectmatter of reference—whensoever it is the will of the legislature that the war part of the code shall take effect it will make effectual notification

mutation taken place ratiocinative art   exceptions excepted as above why as an efficient cause of promotion is length of service or say the seniority system proposed to be established answer reason proportioned to length of service or say of standing in the army or navy as the case may be—will on a general view be experience length of habit in the exercise of the appropriate functions and thence probability of appropriate aptitude in all its several branches instructional art   note however on this occasion the difference between habit of appropriate operation in the preparatory periods and habit of actual service that is to say in war time in the several operations of assault and defence for example in battles attack or defence of forts sieges forced marches with or without combat

diversifications of which such actual service is susceptible a shorter portion of time employed in such service shall to the purpose of promotion be equivalent to a larger portion of time no otherwise employed than in general service instructional art   whether there shall be given to this or that corps in preference to this or that other the occasion and thereby the means of being occupied in modifications of actual and special service rising one above another in importance—will be for the consideration of the prime minister and the army or navy minister respectively to the legislature on this same occasion it will belong to put and keep itself upon its guard against undue favour and disfavour on the part of those several members of the administrative department and to devise and employ all suitable arrangements by which partiality in both shapes may most effectually be excluded instructional ratiocinative art  0 from the practice of giving promotion otherwise than according to seniority subject to the above exceptions as per arts          —evils which present themselves as   0 resulting or capable of resulting are the following— evil i in the breast of a functionary over whom is located another towards whom he had been in the habit of exercising command scarcely can a sense of hardship fail to have place and consideration had of that selfpartiality which is inherent in human nature scarcely can the unpleasant sensation fail to have for its accompaniment an opinion pronouncing injustice to have had a share in the production of that same hardship principle the contentmentmaximizing note that in this case by transference into another corps the evil in this shape might in a considerable degree be diminished and this in the greater degree the less close and frequent the communication between the two corps ratiocinative art    evil ii of an habitually improper use of so widely extensive a power one effect might be—the establishment of a permanent inferiority in the condition of those to whose disadvantage it came to be habitually exercised as compared with the condition of those in whose favour it came to be exercised principle concerned the inequalityminimizing ratiocinative art    evil iii of a power of this sort in the hands of a prime minister one consequence might be—on his part by means of this class of functionaries a plan for substituting to a republic a despotic monarchy as in the case of buonaparte instructional art    note that in the case of buonaparte—of no such result could there have been any the least probability had not the despot thus formed been an extensively successful military commander and that in the case of a constitution such as the one here proposed the number of stipendiaries being minimized while that of their sure antagonists and watchmen to wit the voluntarily serving radicals is maximized—plainly inadequate to any such purpose would be the number capable of being on the occasion of any such design employed as instruments instructional art    note also that from the limitation of the time during which the primeministership is continued in the same hands the probabilities of both evils—to wit favouritism and despotism—receive correspondent limitation instructional art    so far as regards the command in chief of a corps appointed on this or that particular occasion for this or that particular purpose the following modes of proceeding present themselves as open to the choice of the prime minister or of the highest commander on the spot   appointing to the command the senior of all the officers not as yet employed principle the contentmentmaximizing   appointing to the command an officer who is the senior of all who are actually employed his seniors in a number more or less considerable remaining on this occasion unemployed—in which case though passed by they are not any of them placed under the command of one over whom they had been in the habit or expectation of exercising command   openly placing the officer in question over the head of others in number more or less considerable as per arts     they serving at the same time with and under him principle the

contentmentmaximizing   the expenseminimizing note in this case the antagonization between the two principles the aptitudemaximizing and the expenseminimizing instructional exemplificational art    in the english navy service an occurrence not unfrequent has been—the appointment of an officer whose grade is not higher than that of captain to the command of a squadron of considerable force while other navy functionaries in great number in the several superior grades comprised under the denomination of admirals have remained unemployed in the histories of the times indication of occurrences of this sort may be seen in the appellation of commodore given to the commanding officer in such cases instructional exemplificational art    in that same branch england affords an example of a practice not likely to be found carried to so great an extent if at all anywhere else this is—for the purpose of accelerating the pace of promotion for the benefit of a particular individual without infringement of the seniority system and thence without producing in that part of the official establishment any discontent—pushing up before him and for the purpose of coming at him his seniors whatsoever the number of them may be individuals to no one of whom at so early a time would promotion have been given otherwise to give to one man whose extra services or perhaps whose services altogether are not worth sixpence from £ 00 ayear to £ 000 ten times or twenty times the money is thus given to ten or twenty others     on no one of whom but for the sake of this one so much as a sixpence would at that time have been bestowed so far as regards expense this comes of the union assumed to be inseparable between increase of power and increase of pay as to which see section  0 remuneration thus it is that while with the help of the halfpaylist in the army there are commissioned officers enough of themselves to constitute a considerable army without the help of private soldiers—in the navy there are commissioned officers a large portion of them admirals enough to man a frigate if not a ship of the line without the help of private sailors in the english armyservice commissioned officers in more number than in the angloamerican united states armyservice army stipendiaries of all ranks added together commissioned officers noncommissioned officers and privates as to the cause of this diarrhœa it is no secret to any one to whom newspapers are familiar aristocratical ascendancy with the accompanying plundering the leading object aristocratical ascendancy of matchless constitution the choicest fruit instructional art    note that in regard to permanent promotion no course which the nature of the case admits of can be altogether exempt from danger of error on the part of this or that individual success may have been obtained—success any number of times reiterated and on each occasion proved by abundant and uncontradicted evidence—yet notwithstanding on the scale of appropriate aptitude considered in all its elements taken together the attainments of that same individual may have continued much inferior to that of numerous others to none of whom any such favour has been shown by fortune instructional art    still worse however will be the chance for general aptitude if instead of success proved as above the choice be left to the arbitrary will of any individual or number of individuals secretly and thence arbitrarily exercised nothing can their opinion be worth any further than as grounded on appropriate evidence never can evidence exposed as in this case it cannot fail to be to the influence of sinister interest and interestbegotten prejudice in all manner of shapes and at the same time unexposed to the check of counterinterrogation and counterevidence constitute a ground comparable in point of trustworthiness to judiciallydelivered evidence delivered in public and under the wing of that security which is afforded by those same allpowerful instruments instructional art  0 one consequence is—that in default of special meritorious service judicially proved or other more probative and at the same time observable evidence if any such there be—the command of an army may by seniority be made to devolve upon an individual in whose instance deficiency to any degree in appropriate aptitude is not only in fact but even according to general opinion but too well established in a monarchy but for the expedients mentioned in art    the practice which is so natural of giving the most important commands to persons the most nearly connected with the monarch by the tie of natural relationship would suffice to render the chance of success against a representative democracy or a selfcreated monarch in too great a degree inferior to be endured two obvious causes concur in the production of this dangerous practice the additional security regarded as thereby given to the power of the family and the gratification afforded to it by the possession of an item so valuable in the account of the objects of general desire to wit wealth power and factitious dignity at the same time in this case as in others the higher the elevation of the individual in the rank of prosperity prosperity being the aggregate of which these objects are the elements the less is of course the degree of appropriate aptitude the less being the quantity of them of which he is not already in possession without need of that exertion labour selfdenial and selfinflicted pain included without which no such aptitude is in any adequate degree attainable as to the expedient of secret pupilage how frequent soever may be the mention of it in books of anecdote and even in general histories—it is not of the number of those in the case of which the publicity of authoritative and thence conclusive evidence were naturally to be expected†     instructional art    as to security for appropriate aptitude—to the legislature it will belong to consider and determine whether in any and if in any in what armature class or classes antecedently to promotion into any and what superior grades—in addition to the examinations in consequence of which the functionary had been placed in the locable list as per ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who fresh examination shall be undergone armature classes in which if in any the demand for such reexamination is most obvious are the scientific that is to say the engineers and the artillery classes instructional art    also in case any such reexamination has place what shall be the person or persons subjected to it that is to say whether that one alone who stands next in seniority to him by whose exit the vacancy is made or all such other functionaries as stand in the same grade as indicated by the same name whether for example on the happening of a vacancy in the grade of firstlieutenant the process shall be undergone by the senior secondlieutenant alone or by all lieutenants in that same battalion or by all lieutenants in any and what number of battalions taken together instructional art    supposing any such reexamination to have place—a further subjectmatter of consideration will be—whether an officer who has been passed by in consequence of the result of one reexamination shall on the happening of another vacancy be admitted to a second reexamination for the purpose and eventually with the effect not merely of filling that vacancy but moreover of recovering his former relative rank in such sort as to take precedence over one or more of his comrades by whom in consequence of the first reexamination precedence over him had been received ratiocinative art    why to the scientific weapon classes if to any—in preference or to the exclusion of the others—should application be made of the reexamination system as above answer reasons   in their case preferably if not exclusively has place the faculty of affording indication of adequate aptitude or deficiency by the process of which examination principally consists that is to say affording answers in compliance with questions instructional ratiocinative art    after the first location that is to say on the occasion of promotion the pecuniary competition will not it is supposed be employed reasons   to the purpose of reduction of expense it will not be necessary under the seniority system the increase of remuneration at the accession of each successive superior grade as often as it will occur is foreseen and will naturally produce its suitable and duly proportional effect at what time each promotion may be expected will be matter of calculation grounded on a course of experience open to all eyes principle the expenseminimizing   on the other hand suppose this sort of competition

mark the regard shown to consistency in the british service the seniority system has place in the scientific armature classes that is to say the engineers and the artillery and also in the marines in

obtained through seniority alone efficient cause purchase favour and parliamentary influence all these if not in undistinguishable at any rate in hitherto undistinguished proportions instructional ratiocinative exemplificational art  0 note that in the case of the scientific armature classes antecedently to location examination has had place question why in these classes answer because the affording admission into these classes without that same security for appropriate aptitude would be too hazardous in the nonscientific classes examination none why because military official situations are in so high a proportion the destined patrimony of the ruling few and because of every official situation the value to the occupant is in the direct ratio of the remuneration attached to it and in

difference as between peace and war in time of peace occasions will not in regular course be apt to occur for the manifestation of extraordinary merit by the performance of extrameritorious service but by internal commotion or by collateral employment as per section    occasion may incidentally be produced instructional expositive ratiocinative art    to the legislature it may also be matter of consideration—whether in time of peace without prejudice to permanent precedence the power of command might not in this or that part of the scale of grades be made from time to time to change hands in such sort that for example as between secondlieutenant and firstlieutenant he who the former year was second should during the second year become first he who was first descending and taking his place and so upwards in other grades by this means on each such scale of grades each functionary will acquire experience in the business of all the grades and whatever degree of unpleasantness may stand

determined may not receive appropriate and useful information from the opinions of such persons as in virtue of their relative position relation had to the candidate in question will necessarily or at any rate naturally and ordinarily have possessed opportunities of forming a peculiarly wellgrounded judgment as to his appropriate aptitude in all points always understanding that by appropriate arrangements for the preservation of secrecy effectual means are afforded for screening the votes from the action of corruptive influence     instructional art    arrangements for this purpose suppose

effective benevolence in relation to those their subordinates principle the contentmentmaximizing ratiocinative art    why not render the aggregate of the opinions and wishes of these same percipient witnesses decisive answer reasons   presumable comparative deficiency in respect of appropriate moral aptitude the selfregarding interest which each individual has in his own comfort being generally a stronger motive than sympathy for the public service hence the danger lest a candidate whose chief qualification consists in the favour shown by him to these same selfregarding interests will be voted for in preference to those whose qualifications are in a superior degree conducive to the welfare of the public service true it is that at and during the time of actual service on the degree of appropriate aptitude on all points on the part of officers will throughout depend in a more or less considerable degree the personal security of all ranks that of private included but the motive derived from this source is confined in its operation to the consideration of the conduct of the persons in question during that comparatively short portion of time whereas the motive derived from the consideration of the dependence of the personal comfort of the subordinate on the conduct of the superordinate in relation to him applies to the whole of the time during which such their relation to one another continues   presumable comparative deficiency in respect of appropriate intellectual aptitude in each armature class the greater the quantity of time labour and natural talent requisite to put a man in possession of the requisite degree of appropriate intellectual aptitude with relation to the service of that class—the less on the part of the privates understand such as have not been

their meals with them in a common mess instructional ratiocinative art    as to the collection of the votes     as above—for the consideration of the legislator it will be in what divisions or say groupes the votes of the privates shall be received as above that is to say whether the only aggregate shall be that of the votes of those belonging to the individual grades next below that in which the vacancy has place—or that of the votes belonging to that same grade throughout the whole of the battalion or regiment or whether the votes shall be collected in both these modes the particular object or say end in view being in both cases the obtaining the votes of those who in the quality of percipient witnesses have possessed the best opportunities of obtaining perception of the several relative facts and of those who have been best qualified for forming a correct judgment on the ground of those same facts instructional ratiocinative art    on this combined plan provision is made for the maximum of appropriate aptitude in all points taken together without sacrificing aptitude in any point to aptitude in any other for to the purpose of affording in their maximum of strength those motives or say inducements by which the commanding as well as obeying ranks to wit the erudite and the noncommissioned officers are urged to have regard for the comfort of the purely obedient rank it is not necessary that the votes of subordinates of the lowest rank should be decisive sufficient is the assurance that they will be taken into consideration and with more or less influence operate on the minds of those to whom it belongs to decide instructional art    in making their choice while having before them the results of the several relations as above—the army minister navy minister and prime minister respectively will not forget to have regard to the advantage attached to the observance of the seniority system they will accordingly take this as the generally and primâ facie operative guide to their choice not departing from the line of conduct indicated by it otherwise than for some special reason assignable and accordingly assigned exemplificational art    such being

any person at large has but if from any superordinate of his a military functionary has received a command to inflict wrong in any shape on the person or property of any individual at large—such command will not operate in his behalf as a justification rather than pay obedience to it he must submit to arrestation as above for redress see the course open to him in section   oppression obviated

promptest and most efficacious measures for staying the design in its progress in so far as circumstances admit and finally preventing it from being carried into effect instructional ratiocinative art

provision as often as wrong in any shape and in value ever so minute in respect of such property were regarded by the subordinate as about to ensue he were bound or so much as authorized to withhold obedience to any order of his superordinate—the greatest confusion and even anarchy might ensue on the other hand if in no case whatsoever disobedience were exempted from punishment a superordinate might give complete security against all punishment to as many subordinates as he could engage to become his instruments in the commission of crimes having for their effects destruction of public property to any amount he might thus consume the contents of storehouses dockyards and arsenals or blow up fortifications instructional art    as to the power of dislocation and that of relocation the legislature will have in view the principles on which were grounded the arrangements contained in ch ix ministers collectively section    oppression obviated having regard throughout to the difference

analogous to that which in the case of an ordinary judicatory is delineated in ch xii judiciary collectively section    incidental complaint book article   to   instructional art    of the heads under which on the occasion of a complaint the matter will be entered see for examples those in art   as above instructional art    the legislature will at all times apply itself with anxious attention to the invention and adoption of every arrangement     which presents a promise of contributing to reconcile a freedom of complaint with exactness and promptitude of professional obedience or by any other means of contributing to the minimization of oppression in this branch of the public service it will accordingly in this view have all along an eye to the provision made in ch ix ministers collectively section    oppression obviated against oppression in all branches whatsoever of the public service instructional art    in so far as in any case it lies in the power of an oppressor to produce suffering in any shape on the part of an intended oppressee without exposing himself to experience suffering at the hands of any one—all remedies against oppression the above not excepted cannot but be correspondently ineffectual to give to the above arrangements what further degree of efficiency the nature of the case admits of is the object of these which follow enactive art  0 of an act of oppression alleged to have been committed against any military functionary by any superior whether in grade superordinate to or coordinate with his—information at the hands of any nonmilitary person applying for that purpose will be received by every military functionary by whom any such complaint could have been received at the hands of any individual engaged in military service instructional ratiocinative art    true it is that in some cases in the mind of a party informed against there will be little doubt or even not so much as any as to the functionary with whom the information originated when for example a party suffering is the only person in whose instance any knowledge or suspicion can have had place of the fact which is the subject of the complaint but   in the first place such will not be the case in every instance   even where it is the irritation produced by a contest with a person other than the sufferer in the mind of a party complained of will not naturally be so great as if it were with the party himself instructional ratiocinative art    a supposed remedy which is obvious enough—and which in fact has on one occasion or another been employed—is the institution of what may be styled a secret information box but by the nature of the case any such channel of communication stands exposed to three distinguishable evils evils which taken together present themselves as preponderant over any good capable of being derived from it in addition to that which seems promised by the admission of nonmilitary informers as per art  0   evil the first to one person alone say for example the registrar the power is intrusted of opening the box by this person would in this case be possessed the faculty of bringing to view the information or suppressing it at pleasure true it is that of such suppression complaint might be made through any even the most public channel but though publication of it might proof of it could not thus be made without the disclosure of the person complaining which is the very evil sought to be avoided   evil the second persons necessary to concur in the exercise of the power are two or more beneficial consequence the danger of suppression diminished per contrà a quantity of naturally producible delay in length proportioned to the number of these same persons indefinitely increased by the simple negative act of not choosing to act in conjunction with the rest by each one might be exercised the faculty of producing delay to an indefinite extent to an extent by which in many cases the design of the information might be frustrated   evil the third for the purpose of suppressing all useful information the receptacle might by persons unknown be secretly clogged up with papers conveying false information or papers on other matters not furnishing any information whatsoever by either of these means the proposed remedy might not only be completely frustrated but covered with ridicule enactive instructional art    for rendering the informant responsible—compensationally or punitionally or both as the case may require—in case of false information accompanied with evil consciousness or culpable inattention—the same securities will in this case be provided as in the case in which the party complained of is a nonmilitary person as to these see procedure code ch viii section    enactive instructional art    exceptions excepted exemplars of each proceeding in every such military complaint book will as soon as taken as per ch ix section    oppression c art  0 be distributed and in this case as well to the nonmilitary judicatories as to the several military offices superordinate to that into which the complaint was delivered enactive art    exception is—where and in so far as in declared contemplation of the evil likely to ensue to the service of the defensive force subdepartments by means of the information liable to be thereby conveyed to a hostile power—the communication of the complaint or of any of the proceedings occasioned by it shall by or by authority from the legislature have been interdicted enactive ratiocinative art    in case of investigation should it   0 appear to the judicatory that the conduct of a party complained of was not perfectly justifiable yet not in such sort and degree culpable as to present a demand for the application of a repressive remedy under the name of punishment or satisfaction—it may decree accordingly stating the publicity given to the transaction to have been regarded as a sufficient remedy to all purposes satisfactional and punitional not excepted instructional art    by these means an efficacious check may it is supposed to a considerable extent be given to wrongs which though individually taken they might be regarded as trivial might by repetition be rendered serious instructional art    a consideration which should never be out of the mind of any one of those on whom as to this matter the law with the execution given to it depends is—the superior demand for attention which has place in the case of a private compared with that of an officer the greater the exposure to oppression at the hands of individuals the stronger the demand for protection at the hands of government principle the inequalityminimizing instructional art    to complaints of oppression—in whatsoever branch armature

lest in the breast of any individual in the rank of private who regards himself as suffering under oppression rashness should for a moment obtain the ascendancy over prudence—he will of course be exempted on that occasion from the labour of attendance instructional art    supposing the faculty of giving communication to complaint as effectual in reality as it thus is in show and profession

the danger of ulterior oppression in revenge for or in consequence of complaint may be lessened is transference of a complainant from the corps in question to some other but on this occasion care will require to be taken—on the one hand lest under the notion of relief oppression in another shape be exercised to wit by transference of the complainant to a corps to which he is averse on the other hand lest for the purpose of obtaining such transference a groundless or frivolous complaint be instituted section ix minor delinquency checked enactive ratiocinative art   minor delinquency book

cases given to that same quantum the functionary being in a state completely fit for service   invalidship in regard to quantum and shape what the course most proper to be taken in case of a

desirableness of the condition of the functionary as to matters independent of the treatment bestowed upon him by his superordinates individually considered to wit state of the laws in this behalf and of the official establishment   desirableness of it in respect of the treatment bestowed upon them by these same superordinates   condition of the people at large at the time of enlistment the worse their condition the greater in respect of intensity and extent will of course be their desire and disposition to enlist instructional art   the effective or say net desirableness of his condition will

consistently with the good of the service including appropriate aptitude on their part—here will be an additional item in the account of desirableness as well as a proportionable reduction in the expense instructional exemplificational art     in the prussian service soldiers have of late years been allowed to be on leave of absence for as much as threefourths of the year pay ceasing during that time   so in the practice of the helvetic confederacy during eight months in the year the same indulgence has been given to the german part of the soldiery instructional ratiocinative art   independently of rank and grade shall pay be made to receive any and what addition at any and what time from mere length of service for the affirmative sole reason assignable prevention of desertion but if the situation of the individual is rendered to such a degree desirable as that at all times the number desirous of being admitted shall be greater than is desired to be actually maintained the reason will not be applicable if at any time for addition to desirableness addition to pay is necessary it may with better prospect of advantage be applied to present than to future contingent time as to desertion to no other rank than that of private can the danger of it have any application it cannot to that of officer instructional art   as to desertion if at all times all who are willing to cease to serve are permitted so to do any precaution against that occurrence will in the ordinary state of the service be unnecessary in two states of things alone can it be needed to wit   in a state of actual war   in a state of peace if the number of those desirous to quit should be so great that by the substitution of that same number of recruits to veterans the deterioration to the strength of

quantity employed for and during the time of service the less the quantity needed to be employed in the purchase of the consent to enter into the engagement instructional art    in two cases no money for the purchase of such consent will be necessary   if the enlistment be compulsory as to which see section   term and conditions of service   if without expense so employed the terms of service are upon the whole sufficiently desirable to produce voluntary enlistment instructional art    note always that in the quantum necessary the difference between a time of peace and a time of war will of course make     a difference more or less considerable in time of peace—that time being time present time of war future and contingent—the probability of war will be more likely to be undervalued than overvalued but supposing the arrival of a state of war actual or nearly impending the question as to bounty and the amount will of necessity be determined by the circumstances of the time the time for bounties is the time of urgency and as the urgency has no determinate limits so neither has the necessary quantum of the bounty instructional expositive art    essential with a view to practice is the distinction between that part of the remuneration which is received in money and that which is received in all other shapes put together—say in kind instructional ratiocinative art    of that which is received in kind the greater the proportion the better—reasons   of that which is received in kind the real value in use will be the same at all times whereas of that which is paid in money the value in exchange and consequently the quantity of the means of comfort receivable is constantly exposed to diminution principle concerned the contentmentmaximizing   in both shapes taken together government will of course at each point of time give as far as it is able as large a quantity as it deems necessary for the good of the service and as to the money part how much greater soever the value of money may happen to be at the time of enlistment government cannot at any subsequent time without breach of faith give itself at the soldiers charge any indemnification for the extra expense in that article whereas as to that part which is to be furnished in kind—though by and in proportion to rise of prices it must unavoidably and without compensation remain exposed to loss yet it will also have the benefit of any fall in money prices and this without prejudice to the comfort of the functionary principle the expenseminimizing instructional exemplificational art    in british india even in the rank of private in the case of such of the natives as are enlisted in the land service—to such a degree desirable and in all particulars taken together satisfactory is the condition of the individual in this situation compared with that of the bulk of the population—that no bounty on entrance is ever given on the contrary permission to enlist is at all times an object of competition to a multitude of candidates instructional art    note that on entrance into the service that is to say in the lowest grade—promotion into the several superior grades with whatsoever increase of remuneration it may happen to be attended—will of course enter and be seen to enter into the account of the matter of compensation and thence at the same time into that of the subjectmatter of competition instructional art    so likewise any title or titles of honour which for extrameritorious service a man may have a chance to receive instructional art    note also that in the rank of officer the several grades are in themselves so many titles of honour rising one above another in the conjunct scales of power and factitious dignity instructional ratiocinative art  0 prospect of

invalidship produced by old age from what they are in the case of casualties ratiocinative art    reasons in favour of such provision in the case of superannuation are the following   in a nonmilitary state the man might to an extent more or less considerable have possessed the faculty of making provision for this contingency by frugality and good economy in the military service of this there is hardly any chance   in a nonmilitary state by passing his life in the bosom of his family connexions he would have possessed the opportunity of engaging their affections in his favour and finding in those affections the means of subsistence in his military state he will unless by accident be cut off from this resource   by these considerations—if for this contingency provision was not made by government by the terms of the engagement—men     who were governed by prudential considerations—and who as such would in this as in any other situation afford correspondent promise of good conduct—might be deterred from entering into the service principle concerned the aptitudemaximizing   from the withholding of this provision the sufferings inseparable from the decline of life in every situation would be aggravated and between men at that time of life and men at earlier periods of life the inequality increased principle concerned the inequalityminimizing   altogether different

incomplete aptitude may have been left to him with relation to collateral employments suited to his particular case collateral that is to say with reference to actual combat and those manipulations evolutions marchings and other modes of selfconveyance which are preparatory to actual combat instructional art    of incompleteness in respect of appropriate aptitude with reference to defensive force service the efficient cause will be—absence or deficiency in respect of some one or more of those qualities the possession and manifestation of which are necessary to the apt performance of the several operations in art    mentioned instructional art    qualities requisite and desirable in defensive force service and more especially in the ungraded or say the purely obedient ranks may be thus enumerated i on the part of each individual   intrepidity   exactness in obedience   promptitude in obedience   vigilance   hardiness that is to say power accompanied with will to endure appropriate hardship in every shape   activity appropriate including appropriate dexterity or say adroitness in the several manipulations and evolutions ii on the part of numbers acting conjunctly in the same place at the same time   simultaneity or say simultaneousness of motion instructional art    in case of invalidship as per art    the legislator will consider and determine in relation to what invalidshipemployments military and nonmilitary together defensive force functionaries will remain apt and applicable—after and notwithstanding deterioration of aptitude by loss of substance or use of various limbs or organs examples are as follow limbs or organs lost or disabled employments aptitude for which may be remaining notwithstanding   one eye   serving in a garrison     serving as

exterior local guards as above guards where marching or considerable locomotion is not necessary for the protection of the exterior of government or other public edifices   service as interior local guards as above guards placed in the interior of public edifices such as theatres and the several apartments in public libraries and museums of all sorts   operating in private manufacturing and other profitable establishments conducted on a large scale government contributing what addition shall in the case of each individual have been found necessary where the manufacture could not consistently with its profit afford pay to an amount sufficient for his subsistence     instructional ratiocinative art    to the erudite grades scarcely does any such invalidshipprovision—except in the case of wounds received or loss of the substance or use of a bodily organ such loss being caused by actual service—present itself as applicable reasons   in that rank in life due regard to such contingencies may reasonably be expected to be had on the occasion of the pecuniary competition   unsuitable to such their condition may be thought to be the being subjected to examination by authority and the having their infirmities scrutinized into for the purpose of their being distributed as per art    among collateral employments instructional art    in respect of making provision for a mans subsistence—suppose it determined that by reason of invalidship he is no longer in a state of complete aptitude for appropriate service as above—three options will call for the determination of the legislature   retaining him on the list and aggregating him to some determinate corps with his pay in the whole or in part continued to him and with employments one or more assigned to him in quality of invalidshipemployments   discharging him from the service but continuing to him in whole or in part his pay down to the time of his decease   discharging him from the service without pay at the expense of the public or means of subsistence in any shape instructional art    that in whatsoever service exercised some employment—profitseeking employment—so it be not accompanied with unwillingness—is more conducive not only to good economy but to individual comfort than idleness is—seems almost too obvious as well as indisputable to be worth mentioning but what may be worth mentioning is that it consists not either with good economy or with comfort to keep in a state in which he is incapable of earning anything towards his own subsistence any man for whom profityielding employment could be provided either by those at whose expense he is so kept or by any other employer thus much as to what ought to be done principles concerned   the contentmentmaximizing   the

under any form of government has as yet been felt necessary and accordingly paid by rulers either to the financial interests of the whole community or to the comfort of this class of the individuals over whom they rule whatever is given—the course has been to give it at this stage of life gratis that is to say without requiring service rendered to any person in any shape in return for it modes in which such gratuitous provision has been made two one the granting to each of the individuals in question an annuity styled a pension in the shape of money another the keeping them congregated in

stipendiary military force the matter of prosperity composed as it is of the matter of wealth and the other objects of general desire acting in the character of matter of corruption is regarded as an indispensable primum mobile as well as support to government—the aggregate of these useless and emolumented situations adds to the value of the service they render to the several possessors with their respective locating patrons in the shape of matter of prosperity the ulterior value of the service they render to matchless constitution in the character of matter of corruption instructional ratiocinative art    remuneration pecuniary for extraordinary merit in ordinary service here by the very nature of the case anything like exact approportionment of remuneration to service is impossible all that in the way of instruction can be done is to caution against a naturally recurring argument in support of waste in the case of each individual so far as it is in a pecuniary shape that prospect of eventual remuneration is applied—the remuneration to produce its desired effect must be raised not only in proportion to the value of the service but in proportion also to the quantum of the matter of wealth which it finds the benemeritant in possession of among men who have engaged in the military profession instances are not wanting of those whose incomes have been not less than a thousand times as great as those received by persons of the least opulent class which in such vast proportion is also the most numerous from this fact an inference that may be drawn is—that where to produce the necessary impression on the mind of a man of the least opulent and most numerous class one pound would suffice there to produce an equally effective impression on the mind and conduct of a person of the abovementioned opulent class a thousand pounds would be necessary the conclusion is that—consistently with good economy no such exact fixed appointment is possible moreover in the eyes of that same most numerous class including that of privates in the whole of the stipendiary force in both branches—any such fixed sums would if thus proportioned to pecuniary circumstances be apt to present the idea of partiality of partiality in favour of the relatively opulent few to the detriment of the relatively unopulent many principle concerned the contentmentmaximizing instructional art    natural honour augmented to wit by the hand of government as per ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration art    to    in this may accordingly be seen the only shape in which with unquestionable propriety remuneration for extra merit in ordinary service can be bestowed in either of the two branches land and sea of the defensive force establishment instructional ratiocinative exemplificational art    with increased force if there be any difference does this same reasoning apply to the case of extraordinary merit exemplified in extraordinary service     example case of

rank above the lowest the legislature will consider and determine whether to every or any remuneration in the shape of grade and power any and what addition shall be made in the shape of pay reasons against such addition these   grades rising one above another in such manner as is customary are necessitated by the very nature of the service   by every promotion addition is accordingly in the very nature of the case made to power and dignity   but by addition of reward in one shape it seems not easy if possible to say why a demand should be produced for addition in any other shape—why money should be necessary to induce men to accept of addition to power and dignity subtraction of money would if any seem the more needful and reasonable change   in this as in other cases the less the reward looked to the greater the relish for the service and thence so far the aptitude probabilized   immense is necessarily the waste—where while promotion follows seniority additions to pay accompany it through a line of grades to come at one individual—recommended for promotion by which soever consideration merit or favour—the correspondent pay is given to all his seniors in a number to which there are no limits see section   promotion   if pay is thus made to receive additions corresponding to lengths of service additions over and above the necessary additions made to power and dignity—still greater should be the demand for it in the case of the private if by him no such additions to power and dignity are received principle the expenseminimizing instructional art    true it is—that under the pecuniary competition—which as per section   stipendiaries who art    will have had place on the first location—any addition to pay by whatsoever cause about to be effected whether this or any other will have been taken into account but a benefit thus contingent and remote seems more likely to be undervalued than overvalued and the more it is undervalued the less under the pecuniary competition will be the sum bid for it the greater therefore upon the whole the expense to the public ratiocinative art    reasons in favour of such additions these   without proportionate extra pay men possessed of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude—reference had to extensive command—would not be to be had they would     be drawn aside from this public occupation to other private ones   in the case of the scientific armature classes in particular—for the acquisition of the appropriate intellectual aptitude requisite a long course of more or less severe mental labour antecedently to entrance into the service will always be necessary   if the extra pay were confined to these same extraerudite armature classes—here would be an invidious distinction established between the classes of the one description and those of the other an invidious distinction having for its natural consequences on the one part contempt on the other part envy and resentment on both parts antipathy and consequent diminution of the facility of intercourse necessary to maximize the efficiency of mutual cooperation in the business of the publicservice principles concerned   the

of those to whom the qualification in question shall have been imparted by means of the general instruction system as per ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who the greater the number of competitors the less the quantum of the matter of reward necessary instructional exemplificational art    neither in the practice of ancient greece nor in that of ancient rome will be found either such accompanying rise of pay with rank as in modern practice—or even between pay of officers taken in the aggregate and pay of privates any difference approaching to that which has place at present in the service of the several european governments and in particular in that of england in which country from causes which will be seen it is more abundant than in any other in greece under xenophon when letting out himself and the corps under his command to a sovereign of thrace—the pay of a commander was twice that of a private of the commanderinchief twice that of a subcommander no more than four times that of a private in the roman service before the time of the triumvirate—the pay of the subcommander styled a centurion was no more than twice that of a private on distribution of gratuities after a triumph—gratuities analogous to the modern prizemoney—proportion the same instructional ratiocinative art    officers   clothing one means of lessening the expense of officers in the article of clothing and thereby diminishing the aggregate of their remuneration by enabling them to increase the amount of their bidding for their pay on the occasion introductory of the pecuniary

bestowed among officers when messing together shall be taken for the subjectmatter of regulation on the one hand retrenchment thereby unavoidably made on liberty may on that part operate as a cause of discontentment on the other hand if the fixation be left to individuals—especially to individuals in higher and better paid grades—the power of determining the question of the expense may operate as an instrument of oppression at the charge of the less opulent in the hands of the more opulent principle the contentmentmaximizing instructional art  0 the number of officers in a grade being less and less as the grade is higher and higher two expedients are thus presented by the nature of the case as capable of obviating oppression in this shape   diet being the same—the price paid may rise in proportion to the pay attached to the several grades   the fixation of the price may be peformed by votes in which case it will be in the power of the lowest paid to prevent the price from being oppressive to themselves instructional art    note that without the latter expedient the former would not suffice for still a superordinate in whose instance the amount of private income bore a large proportion to the official income might for increase of luxuriousness set the expense—though in this case at his own charge—at a mark at which the amount of it might be oppressive to the lower paid subordinates instructional art    note that for the purpose of more luxurious living than the mess afforded the more opulent might be disposed to absent themselves from it thereby leaving the less opulent as it were in a state of degradation but if each of them were at all times obliged to pay alike whether present or absent—the degradation is not so marked as not to be capable of receiving an adequate compensation from the improvement in the diet instructional ratiocinative art    the legislature will judge whether in case of the death of the functionary from wounds received in actual service provision in any and what shape shall be made for any of his genealogical relatives and if yes in what mode of relationship altogether different is the footing on which the demand for postobituary provision stands in the case of this particular official situation from that on which it stands in the case of official situations in general as per ch ix section    remuneration arts       in that general case the provision operates as a bounty on increase of population simply in this case if on the one hand it operates as a bounty on population on the other hand it operates as a bounty upon courage it counteracts the bounty which nature gives upon cowardice to this purpose see what regards smartmoney as per art    principles   the externalsecuritymaximizing   the

no such power instead of a power so given fixation made by the legislature itself exemplificational ratiocinative art    according to appearance the rational cause of the distinction is this in the case of death the alleged efficient cause of the right is an invariable quantity and the existence of it a matter out of dispute not so in the case of disablement instructional ratiocinative art

guards this corps however was not in use to be sent upon actual service except when the monarch himself took the field a custom which was not broken through till towards the conclusion of the second war against the french revolution instructional exemplificational art    in the french service sale is not in use of this difference between the practice under the two governments the efficient cause may be seen in matchless constitution of this fictitious constitution one fundamental principle is that which prescribes the imposition of taxes to an unlimited and continually increasing amount on the indigent many for the further and further enrichment of the already opulent few for the accomplishment of this object the defensive force subdepartment more particularly the landservice branch affords a preeminently apt and commodious field number of official situations maximized number of degrees in the scale of grades maximized quantum of needless remuneration in each situation maximized† by the power of sale value of each such situation increased thus is depredation maximized of that force which should be purely defensive but which as against the people whom it pretends to defend is thus rendered offensive the magnitude is thus increased and thus by the same means is oppression maximized instructional exemplificational art  0 now as to pecuniary competition as exemplified in english practice true it is—that in no instance it is believed in any regular form authorized avowed or even generally known has diminution in this mode either on public or private account received

place   be the commodity what it may if it be a generally known subjectmatter of sale—especially if not only in fact but also of right—a subjectmatter of competition is what it cannot fail to be in some way or other to persons desirous of being purchasers   in every case without exception were it brought under the auctioneers hammer exactly as an annuity to the same pecuniary amount encumbered with the obligation of personal service in a military or any other shape thus and thus only would the expense be minimized   add examination public examination by and before an appropriate

of the correspondent patronage to individual rulers so also the greater the aptitude requisite thus under a system of which the matter of good and of reward in the shape of matter of corruption is the primum mobile—the greater the benefit to the public the more determined is of course the opposition on the part of rulers instructional art    in the nature of the case no less applicable to military

respectively will of course enter and be seen to enter into the account of the matter of remuneration and thence into the account of the subjectmatter of competition instructional art  0 so likewise any title or titles of honour which for extrameritorious service a man may have a chance to receive instructional art    note also that in the rank of officer several grades are in themselves so many titles of honour rising one above another in the conjunct scales of power and factitious dignity instructional ratiocinative art    on the other side stands the objection brought to view in ch ix ministers collectively supplement to section    located how art    or    under the head of the unopulent excluded thus equality violated applied as there to all other official situations belonging to the administrative department the objection is for the reasons there mentioned stated as not presenting a title to prevalence but admitting the conclusion to be in that case the proper one it follows not that it must necessarily be so in this likewise the danger from an aristocracy constituted by opulence being so much greater in the military than in the nonmilitary lines of service instructional art    a middle course capable of being taken is the making application of the pecuniarycompetition principle as to one part of the defensive force establishment and not as to another the demand for such a modification—and the extent to which it might be advisable that it should be carried—might in no inconsiderable degree depend upon the extent given in practice to the voluntaryservice in the radical landservice branch instructional art    note that the only occasion on which consistently with the principles respecting promotion as per section   promotion application of this same pecuniary competition could be made—is that of the original location to wit in the lowest of the erudite grade section xi prizemoney instructional expositive art   in regard to prizemoney subjects of consideration for the legislature will be the following—   subjects of capture what   proportion as between government and the captors   proportion as between rank and rank   proportion as between armature class and armature class   proportion as between army and navy in a case in which both are employed in conjunction   proportion as between one and another of the various cooperators individually considered on each individual occasion instructional ratiocinative art   i subjects of capture principle applicable the individualsparing principle rule exceptions excepted—confine the capture to such things as are in the hands of the government of the hostile state reasons   value for value the impression made on the enemys strength by loss of a mass of property already in the hands of his government is much greater than that made thereon by a loss to the same pecuniary amount of a mass in the hands of individuals   of a given mass in the hands of individuals it is no more than a small proportion that can be taken into the hands of government to be applied to the military or any other branch of the public service   before it can have been extracted and brought into the form in which it is employed in war and in the seat of war some indefinite length of time must commonly have elapsed   on the part of the enemy military and nonmilitary taken together though the power of military aggression is so much more weakened     the suffering is less the suffering which the military classes endure is what they are prepared for as well as by the pay received compensated for in the case of the nonmilitary—preparation none compensation none   on the part of the enemy the less the suffering is the less violent is the exasperation the less strenuous the disposition the less strenuous the endeavour to retaliate instructional ratiocinative art   exception may be—where a fortified place is to be taken by assault reasons   benefit to the assailants—that without extraremuneration and that too derived from a source that is immediately in view the soldiers in the attacking army will perhaps not be prevailed upon to expose themselves to the extra danger   benefit to the assailees for minimizing the suffering—that the existence of the acknowledged right may induce them to come to terms before they are reduced to the uttermost extremity and thereby prevent them from making a resistance which on the average of cases would be unavailing as to ultimate success but which in consequence of the irritation produced thereby would almost certainly end in their private property being subjected to plunder whether the right to plunder it were universally acknowledged and avowed or not instructional ratiocinative art   ii proportion as between government and the captors rule—maximize the governments share thence of necessity minimize the captors share reasons   so says the expenseminimizing otherwise styled the frugalitymaximizing principle   true it is that by the remunerationmaximizing principle—were that in any case general or individual deemed necessary to be called in—the whole would at first view be allotted to the captors none to the government but without reducing the quantum of the demand so far as to render the inducement afforded by it inadequate—no small service might by the reservation of a portion to government be rendered even to the captors when abandoned to the cupidity of each individual much of what might otherwise have been saved for all the individuals taken together is destroyed and in the shares of the profit derived from that which is not destroyed great inequality will have place while in the case of a scramble cupidity converts fellowsoldiers into mutuallyconflicting adversaries in the hands of government—the inequality might and naturally would be minimized and the greater the service thus rendered the greater the share which for this service the parties interested would be content to see retained instructional ratiocinative art   iii proportion as between rank and rank directing principle—the same as that which applies to remuneration in its regular and continuous shape namely the inequalityminimizing principle instructional ratiocinative art   iv proportion as between armature class and armature class if there be any ground for difference it will be in favour of that class to the apt exercise of whose functions the higher degree of appropriate aptitude intellectual and active is requisite together with the greater risk in so far as any determinate difference in this case can be ascertained note that for the purpose of regular pay the standard of reference will already have been settled principles—  the aptitudemaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing instructional art   v proportion as between army and navy service standard the same as between armature class and armature class in the army service as above the navy service being that in which the larger proportion of intellectual and active aptitude in the shape of art and science is requisite and accordingly in the natural order of things is actually exemplified instructional art   note that generally speaking the navy can do better without the army than the army without the navy for without the aid of landsmen seamen may act—and in numerous instances have acted on land whereas at sea landsmen never have acted nor can ever be expected to act without the aid of seamen but in this or that individual case it may happen that this general presumption may be found outweighed and overruled by the individual facts instructional art   vi on each individual occasion proportion as between one and another of the various cooperators in so far as any sufficiently determinate distinction can have had place and the existence of it have been proved by sufficient evidence—this may with indisputable propriety be taken for a subject of judicial examination it ranks naturally under the head of extrameritorious service as to which see section  0 remuneration instructional ratiocinative art  0 a question which on this occasion presents a demand for consideration and if possible decision on the part of the legislature is—who shall be admitted as sharers and in what proportion as between the particular corps actually engaged in battle in the     service by which the prizemoney was produced on the one part—and on the other part the whole or this or that other portion of the army by whose movements or position contribution in greater or less amount may have been made to the success   in so far as in any degree any such contribution has been made—some share it should seem should be allotted to the bodies and the individuals respectively thus contributing if in any instance the factitious motive in question is necessary so is it in every other   at the same time by those by whom none of the hardships or perils were shared the share received of the reward should not it should seem be so great as the share of those by whom the whole burthen of evil—actual hardship and danger together—has been borne in default of special reasons indicative of a different proportion—say for example share of the nonengaged half that of the actually engaged instructional ratiocinative art    care will be to be taken that on the occasion and for the purpose of reward—in so far as a clear line of distinction can be drawn in such sort that the matter of fact be not open to dispute nor the decision accordingly open to the imputation of injustice—the service rendered by each particular corps or even individual be kept as distinct as may be from that rendered by every other for as every distinguished exertion requires for the production of it a separate motive—the more exclusively dependent on each occasion the receipt of the reward is seen to be on the exertion made for the obtainment of it the greater will be the efficient force of the reward in the production of the exertion and thereby of the service the less exclusively dependent the less the efficient force so consequently the less numerous and less strenuous the aggregate of the exertions on each such occasion made suppose on the other hand the aggregate of the prizemoney earned by the aggregate of all the armies of the state to be lodged in an aggregate fund and of the matter of that same fund periodical—say for example annual—distribution to be made one consequence is that the quantity of money thus earned in both cases being supposed the same the more numerous the army the less strong and effective will be the operation of the mass of reward towards the production of the desired effect if it be too much to say that in this case the prospect of a share in this same aggregate fund would in the breast of each individual be altogether without effect—scarcely can it be too much to say that half the money thus employed would if employed upon the individuallyapplying plan operate with greater effect than the whole of it if employed in the lumping plan as above instructional art    with particular attention the legislature will on this occasion keep in mind the consideration—in how great a degree the effective force of the reward cannot but depend upon promptitude in respect of the receipt of it—or in how great a degree by delay—especially by delay seen or suspected to be needless—the effective value of it cannot but be diminished section xii power of military as to nonmilitary instructional expositive art   correspondent and equivalent to     this title is that of military necessity understand by military necessity the necessity of giving by law to military functionaries authority to produce on each occasion in any shape whatsoever whatsoever evil may be at the same time sufficient and necessary to the exclusion of greater evil remoteness and uncertainty taken into account say for perfect correctness evil superior in value principle the preponderantevilexcluding in the penal code military necessity will constitute one of the grounds of justification its applicability is more extensive than that of any other of them of the openly committed offences against person and property few there are to which it is not applicable instructional art   as to the efficient cause of the necessity—in the most comprehensive description that can be given of it it will consist in the need of contribution in any shape to the supply in every shape which happens to have been provided for the purpose of national defence and note that   for the purpose of national defence it may at any time happen that operations of an offensive nature may be necessary   to both defensive and offensive operations the matter of subsistence for all persons engaged in or for those same operations is at all times necessary instructional ratiocinative art   as to the need of making provision for obviating this necessity and the nature of the appropriate powers by the establishment of which the provision must be made they will be seen to be as follows— by the general arrangements made by the law whatsoever is a mans own his person as well as his property included other persons in general stand inhibited from meddling with for without such inhibition nothing can be caused to be any mans own by and in proportion to the extent of the appropriate powers necessary this inhibition is taken off and allowance with or without the addition of the obligation of employing it is substituted on this occasion the supposition and assumption is—that on the occasion in question from the nonestablishment of these powers evil to a greater amount propinquity and certainty taken into the account may at any time come to be produced than by the establishment of them accordingly no political community has ever existed or is likely to exist in which when need has been thought to have place exercise has not in fact been given to these powers but in general it is in violation of acknowledged law that the operations in question have been performed what is here proposed is—that still as often as the need has place they should be performed but that the performance should be not in violation of but according to and under the authority of the law instructional art   for modified authorization instead of prohibition reason this by issuing prohibitions which in the nature of the case cannot be enforced the legislator gains nothing and loses much that which you prohibit you cannot regulate that which you leave unprohibited you may in cases to no inconsiderable extent regulate to advantage at any rate you leave yourself free to regulate ratiocinative art   to a man who with arms in his hands and food within his reach is on the point of starving—in vain would you say—meddle not with what you see be still and starve on till you die if he obeys death is present and certain if he disobeys death is but contingent and at any rate comparatively remote instructional art   for such regulations as the nature of the case allows to be established with a view to the states of things and occasions belonging to this head appropriate purposes are the following   minimization of the evil in all shapes producible by the exercise of the powers on these occasions established   providing compensation to individuals in so far as they have been sufferers by the exercise of it and by the evil or say the damage produced in consequence   facilitating the application of appropriate punishment so far as necessary to the repression of such abuse as is liable to be made of the power established abuse—that is to say by the production of evil in any detrimental shape over and above what is necessary this evil necessary and unnecessary together wwill stand designated by the name of offences one or more comprised and defined in and by the penal code instructional art   as to the means of accomplishment with relation to these same purposes—such means as the nature of the case admits of are reducible all of them to this one expression to wit publicity publicity effected by appropriate notification notification made   of the evil on the occasion in question produced   by the proper persons   to the proper persons   at the proper portion of relative time instructional art   proper persons for the notification to be made by—are the persons by or by whose orders the evil has been produced proper persons for the notification to be made to—are such persons by whom for the purpose of compensation to be made for the evil it is necessary that the particulars of it and the amount of it should be known—in time     proper portion of relative time—is the portion of time during which the evidence by which indication of the evil is afforded may be elicited with least danger of its being altogether extinct or rendered more or less obscure and inconclusive by length of time that is to say at points of time and within portions of time as near as may be to those in which the evils produced by the exercise of the power have taken place or been seen to be about to take place instructional ratiocinative art   as to the minimization of the evil whatsoever evil you allow a man to produce—the production of it being at the same time not discreditable to him nor inhibited by the popular or say moral any more than by the legal sanction—he will have no repugnance to your knowing of it in this case of any repugnance which it can happen to him to feel and have to get the better of the only possible objects are—  exclusion put upon any additional evil which for his own particular purposes he feels inclined to produce   any such trouble as it may have been rendered necessary for him to take for the purpose of causing it to be known what the evil is which the production of it being allowed to him he has produced accordingly instructional ratiocinative art  0 if you prohibit the production of the supposed necessary evil—the prohibition will include in it the effect of an order for concealment and under favour of this concealment the supposed agent stands exposed by you to the temptation of producing over and above the evil necessary to the exclusion of the supposed greater evil evil in whatsoever shape and quantity may afford a present gratification in any manner to himself if for the preservation of his life you allow him wheresoever he finds them to take necessaries but not unless in so far as the necessaries may be insufficient dainties—he may and if notification is to a certain degree probable commonly will spare the dainties but if you inhibit him from both he will take not only necessaries but dainties and perhaps slaughter the family to prevent their telling tales instructional expositive art    subjectmatters over or in relation to which it may be necessary that on the sort of occasion in question for a purpose such as that in question power shall be exercised—may be thus distinguished     things considered simply     persons considered simply     persons considered in relation to things instructional art    i things considered simply these things will be either—  things the use of which is subservient to warfare or   things composing the matter of subsistence in both cases instruments of conveyance and communication with reference to these same things and thence the powers in question exercisable over things applicable to these purposes may also be necessary exemplificational art    of a case in which for the purpose of subsistence need of a power of prehension and consumption applied to this or that portion of the matter of subsistence may have place—an example is the following soldiers one or more on a march—that part of the country thinly inhabited provisions in sufficient quantity not taken with them or not remaining with them money none sufficient for purchase or though sufficient no adequate supply obtainable in exchange for it cause of the impracticability absence or hostile affection on the part of the inhabitants instructional exemplificational art    ii persons considered simply from persons not military the services which there may be occasion to exact may in their nature and character be either   military or   nonmilitary exaction of services of a military nature is for the time that the course of operation lasts compulsory enlistment enlistment for a time corresponding in duration to the emergency as to this see section   term and conditions of service a town for example is in a state of siege for contribution to defence the commanding officer causes hands to be laid on persons not military in such numbers as to him appear necessary and compels them to join in the labours and perils of the military functionaries for and during the appointed time—these persons are thus aggregated to the number of actuallyserving functionaries instructional exemplificational art    of services which not being of a military nature there may be occasion to exact for military purposes examples are the following     going on messages     furnishing information instructional art    when for any such occasional and temporary purpose a nonmilitary person is pressed into military service it will be for the care of the legislature—and of the several administrative functionaries nonprofessional and professional in their several grades—to allow to the person so impressed in so far as the nature of the case admits the benefit of the arrangements made in that view in the enlistment contract and to furnish him accordingly with an exemplar thereof and of the soldiers code as per section   term and conditions of service and in particular those     which regard smartmoney as per section  0 remuneration instructional art    iii persons considered in relation to things of services military and nonmilitary employed by persons on occasions of this sort in relation to things—examples are as follows i things immoveable—  assisting in the fortification or dismantling of a post   assisting in the fortification construction repairs destruction or endamagement of a bridge or other instrument of communication ii things moveable—  assisting in the conveyance of military stores and provisions of all sorts for use or safe custody   assisting in destroying or endamaging them to prevent them from falling in a serviceable state into the hands of an enemy instructional art    when by a military functionary or set of functionaries on the ground of real or supposed military necessity power is exercised—it is exercised either without order of superordinates or under and by virtue of such order instructional enactive case i power exercisable without order sole case for trespass as above through military necessity without order—selfpreservation preservation of life from deperition for want of necessaries in relation to this matter much will depend upon the state of the country in respect of population and cultivation at the time but in general the existence of any such necessity will be confined to war time as to which see below art    instructional exemplificational expositive art    to this head belong in the english landservice the practices authorized by law and termed quartering and billetting in england population is so uniformly dense that the houses of entertainment known by the general denomination of public houses are everywhere in extent and number sufficient for this purpose and to the obligation the benefit of which extends alike to all classes namely the obligation of furnishing the matter of food drink and lodging at the ordinary prices is added in the case of the particular class here in question the obligation of furnishing lodging and some few articles of small value gratis an order by which in favour of the individual functionaries in question the house chosen for this purpose is required to furnish the supply in question is called an order for quartering and when expressed in and by an appropriate written instrument an order for billetting instructional art  0 case ii power exercisable by order in accordance with the circumstances of place and time to the legislature it will belong to determine—  the purpose for which   the occasions on which   the powers which shall be exercisable   by what persons   on what persons and   on and in relation to what things instructional expositive art    purpose—general description of it on every occasion the same that is to say defence of the territory of the state against hostile aggression whether from without or from within on each occasion supply—  of whatsoever persons whatsoever services may on that same occasion be at once needful—and with least balance on the side of evil applicable and accordingly applied to that same general purpose   of whatsoever things according to their several natures the use may be needful   of powers and accordingly acts allowed to be exercised in the application so made of such services and such things—of whatsoever persons military functionaries included whatsoever acts may with least evil be in the highest degree conducive to the fulfilment of that same purpose in this case as in that of an exercise given to a correspondent judicial authority prehension will be the general name employed in designating the physical act by which commencement is given to the course of operations necessary to the extraction of the service or the derivation of the use prehensor the functionary considered as so occupied on the part of the operations in question degree of promptitude needful—such as will not admit of application to the judiciary functionary for his sanction instructional expositive art    in relation to orders for the general purpose here in question and the functionaries by whom on the several occasions for the several particular purposes they may be issued—the legislature will distinguish—  the general and most extensive order   and if such there be the immediate order or orders understanding by an immediate order that which is to be immediately followed by physical execution to wit by prehension and the operations which follow it as per art    circumstances of place and time always taken into account—the legislature will accordingly determine and ordain—what orders for the purpose in question may on any and what occasions be issued and carried into effect that is to say—without waiting for authorization from the army minister or navy minister as the case may be or the prime minister instructional art    from the legislature itself will emanate such orders as in respect of place time and occasion are most comprehensive compared with orders emanating from functionaries belonging to the appropriate department and subdepartment of the executive authority     those emanating from the universallysuperintending authority of the legislature have the advantage in respect of time for collection and consideration of appropriate grounds for arrangement they lie under a disadvantage in respect of perception of individual occurrences from which at the individual places and times in question it may happen to the demand for arrangement to receive modification instructional art    a distinction by which the nature of the demand for regulation at the hands of the legislature cannot fail to be modified is that which exists between time of full peace and time of war whether actual or but impending as to this matter see below art    instructional art    on the issuing of any order for the prehension and forced employment of persons or for prehension and forced employment or destruction or endamagement of serviceable things as per art    to    antagonizing cautions that will require to be kept in mind are these   by the terms of the order take care to allow such latitude as may be sufficient to leave it in the power of the subordinate by appropriate forbearance to minimize the quantity of the evil produced by the execution given to that same order   be aware of the danger lest under the cover of such latitude on the occasion of the execution given to such order—whether through sympathy or selfregarding interest—undue favour or disfavour be shown to an individual at whosesoever charge whether that of an individual or that of the public service   by the arrangements for the maximizing of appropriate notification will be done what is capable of being done by law towards the exclusion of these evils and in the tenor of the instructions reference to these arrangements will give each subordinate to understand that all complaints of contravention will find adequately open to them the eyes and ears of all those to whom it belongs to give redress instructional art    unless for any purpose on the part of an intermediate functionary to whom an order is issued cooperation by applying modifications to the order be deemed necessary—the superordinate in such his order will in proportion as success depends upon promptitude be careful not to cause needless consumption of time by causing the order to pass through the accustomed channels when in less time immediate communication can be made of it to the functionary by whose immediate agency execution and effect are to be given to it care being however taken at the same time to send examplars of the order to the several intermediate authorities in whose instance acquaintance with the matter of it may be requisite instructional art    of the existence of the several extensively manifested and extensively influential facts by which in the mind of the legislature or the prime minister the demand for extraordinary powers of the sort in question has been constituted it will be for those authorities respectively to have satisfied themselves by appropriate evidence instructional art    but should any instance occur in which in consequence of information not capable of being transmitted or not actually transmitted to these same superior authorities it should by any military commander on the spot be deemed necessary to give exercise to such powers—two distinct sets of facts which for the justification of such exercise will be necessary to be proved are the following—   the individual facts by the aggregate of which the necessity is regarded as being constituted   the facts expressive of the damage sustained or about to be sustained by the several individuals whose persons or things or both it has been deemed necessary to subject to the powers in question and which have accordingly been so subjected instructional art    for this latter purpose three distinguishable operations will on each occasion require to be performed by the military functionary in pursuance of whose orders and under whose inspection the damage is produced these operations are—   not merely permitting—but by appropriate invitation procuring or endeavouring to procure—in as great number as may be without mutual obstruction or preponderant evil in some other specific shape—persons in the highest degree competent to perform the functions of percipient witnesses   maximizing in the instance of each the facility given to him for clear correct and adequately comprehensive observation viz as to the subjectmatters themselves and their respective values   giving whatsoever degree of clearness correctness and comprehensiveness the circumstances of the individual case admit of to the several operations of minutation and recordation as to which see ch viii section  0 registration c section    publication c ch xii section    publicity c ch xxi judiciary registrars c section   minutation how enactive instructional art  0 now as to compensation for damage in whatever shape produced at the expense of a nonmilitary person by exercise     given to power on the ground of military necessity—compensation will as soon as without preponderant evil may be be administered compensation—at the charge of the public in every case in the first instance in case of abuse and to the amount of the abuse at the charge of all such functionaries as have had part in the abuse allowance being at the same time made for their state of subjection on behalf of all such as on the occasion of such abuse shall by the irresistible force of military command have been rendered instrumental in the production of the abuse this charge will constitute part and parcel of the public debt principles—  the contentmentmaximizing   the inequalityminimizing instructional art    in the account of damage will in every case be included—not only that which is direct but that which is consequential for example not only the loss of the value of a thing taken or destroyed but any loss incurred for want of the use which would otherwise have been made of it on this or that individual occasion for this or that individual purpose for what on this as on other occasions is to be deemed consequential damage—see the penal code exemplificational art    example thing prehended suppose a navigable vessel loaded and on the point of starting the vessel taken for public service the lading not included in the account will in this case be—the diminution of profit or the production of positive loss by frustration or delay of the voyage at any rate the cost of unshipping the lading and reshipping it instructional art    on this occasion the judge will be on his guard against taking for facts proved any alleged probabilities brought to view by imagination inflamed by pecuniary interest as if for example were brought to account not only the profit that would have been made upon that cargo but the profit that might have been made by the investment of that profit in the purchase of a fresh cargo and so on of the first cargo the profit might be susceptible of proof namely from the profit actually made on goods of the same kind sold about the time in question at the place of destination not so any such profit of the second order as above instructional art    on the military functionary by whom the order is issued and the military functionary by whom or under whose orders the damage is produced respectively—it will be incumbent—not only so as above to cause perception and recordation to be made of the damage while it is causing and after it has been caused—but moreover whensoever and in proportion as the nature of the exigency will permit to cause previous estimates to be taken to wit by appropriate perception calculation minutation and recordation instructional art    of the evidence so recorded and of the estimates so made as per art    exemplars will be distributed in this case as in the several cases in which throughout the course of this code distribution of such exemplars is ordered in particular for example   to the party by whom in each case the damage is sustained one   to the military officer by whom or under whose order it has been caused one   to the next superior military officer under and in pursuance of whose orders it has been caused one   so upwards to the several superordinate authorities instructional art    against abuse in the two opposite shapes of which it is alike susceptible the legislature and the several subordinate authorities in their several fields of service and in particular the finance minister—will on this occasion be respectively on their guard these shapes are— i to the detriment of the individual   causation of damage beyond the extent of the necessity   undervaluation of the damage so caused ii to the detriment of the public in favour of the individual   in the causation of the damage stopping short of the extent of the necessity   overvaluation of the damage so caused iii to the detriment of either party or both as it may happen   omission in not causing to be made the previous estimate in a case in which the nature of the exigency admitted of its being made instructional art    of persons to whom on any such occasion it may happen to be competent to officiate with or without such invitation as above in the character of percipient witnesses and registering functionaries respectively examples are the following—   a judge or judge depute as per ch xiv of the subdistrict if near enough to the spot   the local headman as per ch xxv of the bissubdistrict or any person or persons by him deputed for the purpose   the local registrar or say headmans registrar as per ch xxvi of the bissubdistrict or any person by him deputed for the purpose   any person or persons officiating on the spot in subordination to the preventiveservice minister as per ch xi ministers severally section   preventiveservice minister

officiating on the spot in subordination to the indigencerelief minister as per ch xi ministers severally section   indigencerelief minister   any person or persons officiating on the spot in subordination to the education minister as per ch xi ministers severally section   education minister   any person or persons officiating on the spot in subordination to the domain minister as per ch xi ministers severally section   domain minister   any person or persons officiating on the spot in subordination to the health minister as per ch xi ministers severally section  0 health minister  0 any person or persons officiating on the spot in the capacity of a functionary under the orders of the sublegislature of the district as per ch xxix sublegislatures and ch xxx sublegislation ministers the functions of any of the several sorts of official situations herein mentioned by numbers from   to   inclusive instructional expositive art    abuse of prehensive power employed as above on the occasion or pretence of military necessity—what in this case the act by which the wrong is done will be of the number of those acts on which under the head of offences against individuals inhibitions are put in and by the penal code instructional art    punishment for such abuse in the case in question the act being by the supposition unjustifiable will in and by this code have been subjected to its appropriate punishment including the burthen of making satisfaction in the shape of compensation and any other appropriate shape burthen of satisfaction being as far as it goes placed to the account of punishment and capable of being of itself sufficient for that purpose instructional art  0 on the score of abuse of power—application of punishment in addition to the imposition of the burthen of satisfaction supposes evil consciousness on the part of him by whom the abuse is effected of such consciousness presumptive circumstantial evidence may be afforded—not only by positive agency employed in effecting or endeavouring to effect the suppression of appropriate evidence in relation to the exercise given to the power—but even by reluctance or backwardness as to the exhibition or procurement of such evidence of sincerity on the other hand the degres of positive exertion employed in the endeavour to render the body of appropriate evidence as clear correct and complete as possible will in each case operate as a proof and test enactive art    as to procedure for obtaining compensation at the charge of the public the mode of procedure will be as follows   the party by whom the damage is alleged to have been sustained will make application to the judge in this case as in any other case in which at the charge of the public a judicial demand is made   of the service of the eleemosynary advocates as per ch xx if his circumstances render them needful to him such demandant will have the benefit   on behalf of the public the government advocate as per ch xviii will either give his consent or make any such opposition as in his view justice shall require enactive art    for abuse of power to the prejudice of an individual—the individual himself or the government advocate for the public or both in conjunction may pursue enactive art    for abuse of power to the prejudice of the public alone the government advocate alone will pursue but moreover by any person who is so minded information may be given to the judge as per procedure code ch viii judicial application instructional art    in this case as in all others on the part of the military functionary as above the offence whosoever be the party wronged by it that is to say whether one individual or individuals assignable or a particular class or the public at large may have had for its accompaniment either evil consciousness as above or culpable inattention and in respect of punishment and satisfaction respectively the offender will be dealt with accordingly see penal code head of remedies instructional art    the country in a state of peace—or the country in a state of war from this distinction will result the corresponding parts or say divisions in the military code say the peace code and the war code see section   term and conditions of service in the peace code will be contained the enactments by which are created and conferred the powers exercisable by military functionaries in relation to nonmilitary persons as well in time of peace as in time of war in the war code those the need of which is regarded as not having place in any other time than a time of war of war actual or regarded as impending in the time of peace the applicability of the   0 part which regards war alone will remain suspended it may however remain in the code in readiness to be revived revived either unaltered or with any such alteration as the exigencies of the moment may happen to have suggested instructional art    if as per ch vi legislature section    attendance the sittings of the legislature are at all times undiscontinued—adjournments made no other than from day to day—and if at the same time the residence of the prime minister is at his office in the near vicinity of the legislation chamber—no reason seems assignable why a determination of such prime importance as the revival of this same war code should be in hands other than those of the legislature circumstances of place and time considered it will be for the legislature to determine whether—in consideration of the distance from the seat of supreme power and the possible urgency of the case—the power shall be imparted to any or what commanding functionary or functionaries in any or what distant districts instructional art    between the arrangements sufficient in the one case and the arrangements necessary in the other case the difference will turn principally upon two points   the extent of the extraordinary power given as above to the class of functionaries in question   the extent and burthensomeness of the obligations to which for securing on their parts the due exercise of their several functions to the advantage of the service it is necessary they should be subjected instructional art    of the difference requisite as to the extent of the powers in question an example may be afforded—by the case as per art    where for the justification of the exercise of these powers by the military functionaries in question appropriate previous orders will not have been rendered necessary compared with the opposite case in so far as necessary for securing a functionary of this class from perishing by want the requisite provision must be in force at all times in the one state of things as well as in the other but as to those powers exercise to which need not and thence ought not to be given but by and in consequence of appropriate orders—no otherwise than by war actual or impending can the need of them it will be seen be created instructional art    of the difference required as to the burthensomeness of the obligations necessary to be imposed constantly or eventually on these same functionaries an example may be afforded by the case of capital or rather say mortal punishment in time of war in the presence or in the immediate expectation of the presence of an enemy—for securing appropriate operation in preference to flight nothing less than fear of death can on the part of men in general be sufficient if in separate flight and desertion a man saw a probability of escaping from impending death at the hands of the enemy—men in unlimited numbers might naturally be disposed so to do whereas in so far as by so doing they behold awaiting them a certain death no less probable at the hands of their own superordinates—in this case and by a prospect to this effect this disposition so pregnant with danger of all imaginable evils to the whole community will naturally be surmounted at any rate the disorder will thus receive the benefit of the most effectual remedy which the nature of the case admits of but it follows not that because this remedy is thus necessary in time of war it should in an equal degree or in any degree be necessary in time of peace and with a view to the quantity and quality of punishment necessary for military offences generally the legislature will see the expediency of making application of this same ground for alleviation throughout the whole mass of penal arrangements principles—  the contentmentmaximizing   the expenseminimizing instructional examplificational art  0 under matchless constitution arbitrary power being of course dear to both sides the established practice is—not to establish by law the necessary powers but to leave the powers to be exercised by practice—by practice avowedly contrary to law whereupon for wrong done in all shapes under assurance of impunity—comes in due season an indemnity act alike obvious and incontestable is the convenience of this course had the powers been demanded of the legislature adequate grounds for the demand would have been looked for and any that were produced as such would have been liable to be canvassed and though being made by ministers the demand would of course have been complied with—no instance of noncompliance being to be found elsewhere than in imagination—still reason suppose being clearly against compliance—eyes in some small number might on each occasion be opened and the substitution of a form of government having for its object the augmentation to one having for its object the diminution of the aggregate of happiness—be proportionably promoted as it is—under the assurance of the subsequent indemnification—abuse in all possible shapes is of course practised power exercised where there is no need of any at all and where of a power to this or that effect a real need has place—along with those operations which are needful and contribute to the desirable effect others are performed which contribute to that effect nothing—but to the effect of depredation or oppression     or both whatsoever may be desired by the operators instructional exemplificational art    thus if by flogging or otherwise it happens to be your wish to keep men in a state of torture till they give any such information as it may happen to you to wish for—or till they say anything else you wish them to say—do you apply to parliament for power so to do not you indeed you know better things you cause torture to be applied to them as much as it is agreeable to you to see applied this done some months afterwards you state to parliament for its information that extraordinary disorders require extraordinary remedies the bill passes and everything is as it should be be it ever so bad what has been done cannot be caused not to have been done and by so perfectly unanswerable an argument the satisfaction produced in the mind of every admirer of matchless constitution is entire on goes thus at all times the commodious repetend composed of criminality and indemnity criminality each time by wholesale indemnity each time foreknown to a certainty—through any number of generations till the matchless mass is dissolved in its own rottenness instructional art    under other constitutions the object of law is to secure obedience to itself under matchless constitution to secure disobedience to itself under such law whatsoever may be the opinion as to security security itself is an empty name empty and useless—to all but those who make the law and those who are partakers in the sinister interest by the force of which it is made instructional art    on this as on all other occasions the legislator whose allcomprehensive ruling principle is the greatesthappiness principle looks out with anxious industry for the problems of the greatest difficulty to the end that such solution as the nature of things admits of may be applied the feefed judge—who by every instance of evil prevented by timely legislation regards himself as robbed—beholds in every such difficulty with hope and delight a source of fees among legislators the man in authority beholds in every such difficulty unnoticed and unremoved a source of safe depredation or oppression exercisable by himself the man in opposition an instrument of warfare a source of accusation against his more fortunate antagonist of accusation on the ground of whatsoever under the difficulty happens in a case of necessity to have been done done—whether beyond the necessity or in ever so strict conformity to it the evil which an oppositionist denounces as such he of course wishes it to be inferred and supposed that were he in power he would cure natural enough the conclusion is but far indeed from being a necessary one if according to his own estimate it were his interest to cure it cure it he would otherwise not be the evil be the abuse what it may—be the accused who they may—whether it shall have him for defender or assailant depends on fortune it depends on the side on which fortune has stationed him at the time†     instructional exemplificational art    analogous to the establishment and occasional suspension and revival of the sort of war code here in question is in english practice the proclamation of martial law anywhere as also the various arrangements occasionally employed for prevention or quelling of insurrection in ireland amplitude of powers and scantiness of all securities against the abuse of these same powers are two congenial properties of which these enactments may be seen affording exemplification as ample and instructive as can for any purpose be reasonably desired section xiii military judicature instructional art   on the occasion of the excepted judicatories ch xii judiciary collectively section   excepted judicatories by which application is to be made of the general principles of judicature to the particular situation of the functionaries belonging to the defensive force the legislature will take for the standard of reference the several arrangements by which those same principles are applied to the rest of the community as also to those same persons in so far as their situation agrees in other respects with that of their nonmilitary fellowcountrymen it will therefore be considered—in what particulars the difference between the two situations requires a correspondent difference of arrangement in the case of the two sorts of judicatories—to wit nonmilitary or say civil and military in particular it will be considered—whether in this line of service a manyseated judicatory such as that customarily in use under the name of a courtmartial or a singleseated judicatory as in other cases under this constitution with or without a quasijury sitting incidentally as a body of assessors to the judge may be preferable see ch xvi quasijury instructional art   of the difference between the circumstances in which the civil judicatories and those in which military judicatories are placed examples are the following   as to disobedience   as to disobedience to the orders of the civil functionary execution and effect might in a large proportion fail to be given with comparatively small defalcation from the security which it is the object of the civil judicatory to afford to the orders of a military functionary a single act of disobedience might suffice to bring ruin on the state still the power should not on any occasion through negligence be suffered to extend beyond what is regarded as necessary to provide against the supposed danger   as to mischief from delay   as to mischief from delay in the case of a civil suit delay of considerable length will in a considerable number of instances not be productive of any considerable bad effects nor any ultimately bad effect at all to any person but him on whom in consideration of his supposed culpability the burthen of compensation for the burthen of the suffering produced by him on the other side is imposed in the case of an order given in time of war by a military commander the delay of a moment may not be distinguishable from disobedience   as to partialities and dissensions   as to partialities and dissensions in a civil judicatory the number of the individuals with whom the judge would have to mix in social intercourse would at any rate in proportion to the whole be extremely small and by appropriate institution it may be as it is here endeavoured to be made much smaller in a military judicatory the individuals subject to the jurisdiction of the judge could not any of them unless by accident fail to be known to him they would be known to him—as in an extensive manufactory the working hands in general are personally known to the principal managing hands   as to promptitude of communication   as to promptitude of communication in a civil judicatory the individuals subject to its jurisdiction are with a few exceptions all of them within the reach of the judgmentseat at one and the same time with no other difference than that which is constituted by the distance between their respective abodes and the judgmentseat to wit nowhere so much as half a days journey in a military regimental judicatory suppose one and but one judge or set of judges the whole body is at all times liable to be broken into detachments sent in any numbers to any distance from the seat of judicial authority and from one another decomposed thus into bodies of which no more than one shall be effectively within the reach of this military judicatory in the way that with small and casual exception all within his jurisdiction are within the reach of the civil judge     instructional art   from the institution of courtsmartial each composed of a council of officers of different grades two inconveniences are inseparable to wit   more or less of mutual dissatisfaction where the same individual is by one portion of the judges pronounced guilty by another innocent and   where the part taken by the judgment or the affections of the highest in rank or other most influential person is known—comes on the side opposite to his the suspicion that suffrages have been procured to his side by sinister interest to wit by the desire of obtaining his favour at the expense of justice in the judicatory in ordinary as delineated in this code the inconvenience from mutual dissatisfaction has no place and against the suspicion other remedies—ample and efficient—are provided the legislature will inquire and consider whether by the manyseated judicatory exhibited by a courtmartial advantage in any shape is in any and what cases presented substantial enough to preponderate over the herementioned inconveniences instructional art   in time of actual service in an army which is in a state of actual conflict with an enemy all general regulations must give way to the necessity of the moment but if the two most efficient guardians of justice—the inequalityminimizing principle and the publicitymaximizing principle have taken root in time of peace no demand for implicit obedience can be so urgent but that the pressure of the yoke may receive more or less of alleviation from regard paid to those same salutary principles and the corresponding rules instructional art   in military legislation and judicature as compared to civil a sort of opposition has been commonly regarded as having place between the interest of justice and the interest of power in so much that to security ab extra in military legislation and judicature a sacrifice to an extent more or less considerable must it is supposed be and is accordingly made of justice regulations which in a civil case would be established with a view to justice are accordingly in this or that military case made to give way to others which are regarded as most conducive to the maximum of efficiency on the part of the national force this sort of conflict being admitted—follows the observation—that in time of war the demand for corroboration of power is at its maximum the demand for justice at its minimum in time of peace the demand for justice is at its maximum the demand for corroboration of power at its minimum what at the same time is observable is—that whatever punctuality of obedience is necessary in time of war is so in time of peace for if a habit of disobedience takes root and gains strength during the one period it will naturally and little less than necessarily remain and operate during the other period or at any rate at the commencement of it if between the state of the law in this respect in time of peace and its state in time of war there be in this particular a difference the mischief produced by suffering through neglect the establishment of a habit of disobedience will be the greater the longer the habit has continued and thence the longer the country has continued in a state of peace instructional art   note that among military and nonmilitary persons taken together—the case of disagreement as between class and class is susceptible of the following diversifications   disagreement as between individual and individual both being in the private ranks   in the several officergrades disagreement between individual and individual in the same grade   in all ranks and grades disagreement as between the individual of one rank or grade and the individual of another   in some cases more particularly as between landsmen and seamen and between both and marines—between the functionary of any rank or grade and the functionary of any other in two different armature classes   disagreement as between a military functionary in the rank of private and a nonmilitary individual   disagreement as between a military functionary in any grade below the highest stationed on the spot and a nonmilitary individual   disagreement as between a military functionary in the highest grade stationed on the spot and a nonmilitary individual instructional art   to the judicatory in ordinary will belong of course the cognizance of the three last cases unless in the character of plaintiff or say pursuer the nonmilitary individual gives it to the military instructional art   so likewise of the four first unless the subjectmatter in dispute in so far as property is concerned is property purely military—in so far as reputation is concerned reputation purely military instructional art   as to the offences affecting person the cognizance capable of being taken of them by a military judicatory need not preclude the civil judicatory in ordinary from taking cognizance of them instructional art  0 remain as cases cognizance of     which cannot without manifest impropriety be taken by the judicatory in ordinary as such—cases as between this branch of the public service and the individual bearing on any point of military discipline as per section   discipline established art   instructional art    on the other hand it follows not that because it is necessary that by appropriate means punctuality of obedience should be kept up in time of peace as well as in time of war—therefore for the accomplishment of this object in time of peace means must uniformly be employed as high in the scale of severity as those employed in time of war all that is wanted is the punctuality and if in time of peace by means less severe punctuality can be kept up in a degree as high as by means more severe the difference would be so much suffering expended in waste instructional art    moreover if instead of being employed alike in both cases the extra quantum of punishment is reserved exclusively for a state of war—the fear of it may naturally operate with greater effect when applied to minds to which it is new than when applied to minds to which by habitual presence it has been rendered familiar instructional art    as to the minimum sufficient—no otherwise than by a course of experiment can it in the nature of things be made known in the first instance employ for example the least quantity that presents any promise of being effectual that being found insufficient add another quantum and so on in time of peace experiments of this sort may be made with little or no risk in time of war scarcely without the utmost risk instructional art    for this purpose the best adapted course seems to be this to the offences in question attach punishments of the kind in present use in a scale commencing with a quantity no matter how small and terminating in mortal punishment but what it is believed has never as yet been exemplified divide the scale into two parts allowing to the judicatory in a state of war all the degrees contained in the part above but limiting the option of the judicatory in time of peace to the degrees contained in the part below instructional exemplificational art    example i desertion under this one name—desertion are commonly included two species widely different in degree of maleficence these are—  simple desertion   transfugitive desertion simple when the deserter merely quits his own service transfugitive when in quitting it he passes over to an enemys service in time of full peace—war neither actual nor apprehended as impending—transfugitive desertion has no place remains capable of being exemplified no other species than the simple mischievous effect exceptions excepted inconsiderable and easily reparable exception is—where by the operation of some cause instances to a certain degree numerous are produced at or about the same time now admitting that in time of war for transfugitive desertion death may be an apposite punishment and the option of applying it may be given to the judge—still for simple desertion scarcely can there be any need of giving to the judge any such option to be exercised in time of peace instructional exemplificational art    example ii disobedience of orders in time of peace to such a degree indeterminate and diversified is the nature of the offence thus denominated—that the maleficence of it varies upon a scale beginning at 0 and ending at a degree not inferior to that of transfugitive desertion but in this scale lines may be drawn below which there cannot in time of peace be any demand for any such punishment as death instructional art    for the purpose here in question one line of distinction requisite is—that which separates simple disobedience of orders from that which is specially maleficent by specially maleficent understand productive of any act placed on the catalogue of offences whether in the general penal code or in the military code instructional art    take it unaccompanied with special maleficence as above—it will either be or not be accompanied with evil consciousness—consciousness of the contrariety of the conduct maintained to the conduct lawfully prescribed and when in this sense wilful—the offence may receive a punishment which shall be the same in all cases the offence will in this case consist in the disregard manifested by the subordinate as towards the authority of his superordinate contempt is the name given in english law to the disregard when—the functionary towards whose order it is manifested being a judicial functionary—it is dealt with on the footing of an offence for this offence setting aside the case of repetition small indeed is the punishment for which there can be any demand the offence being supposed pure of any intention of positive insult be the offence what it may punishment will indeed be nugatory if it falls short of what is necessary to outweigh the profit produced in all shapes by the offence but in this case by the supposition no such profit has place     instructional art    slight in this case for a first offence the punishment may be made in a considerable degree more severe for a second and so on till it ends in ignominious discharge this in time of peace but in time of war in or near the presence of an enemy it may have had for its object the effect of desertion simple or transfugitive on the part of the entire corps and in such case the punishment necessary will be proportionable instructional art  0 for the statement and exposition of the several appropriate and peculiar rights and powers which appertain respectively to military functionaries of the several branches and grades—the wrongs and corresponding offences commissible by them—and the several remedies preventive suppressive satisfactive and for subsequential prevention punitive—see the stipendiary army code the stipendiary navy code the radical army code and the radical navy code instructional art    in time of actual service especially in the presence or within the reach of the enemy the judicial power without being liable to be stopped by appeal should it not be in the hands of the commanding officer on the spot principle the external securitymaximizing instructional expositive art    of this phrase on the spot a definition will on this occasion require to be given in and by the military code instructional art    sole but indispensable check in this case registration in so far as the exigency of the case will admit registration and subsequent publication instructional art    this may have place without prejudice to subsequent appeal for the purpose of compensation or satisfaction in other shapes attestation of nondelinquency for example see penal code tit remedies instructional art    by possibility occasions may arise on which it may be matter of necessity for the commanding officer with his own hands to put a subordinate of any grade to death at the instant and this not only for acts of positive aggression but for a mere negative act an act of noncompliance with a positive order whereby the subordinate is commanded to do this or that positive act for example to march in a certain direction indicated instructional art    it being by supposition established and for the reasons in the appropriate places mentioned—that in the ordinary judicatories the few inconsiderable exceptions excepted the judicatory should in every instance be singleseated—in a military judicatory can any preponderant mass of reasons be assigned—why seats more in number than one should have place and if in any in what number and by what description of persons should they respectively be filled instructional ratiocinative art    in the case of military service the body of reasons against such plurality seems even stronger than in other cases at large the sorts of cases and suits it is assumed are in every instance penal   in general practice the judges being many in english practice for example thirteen or fifteen are taken from the corps to which at the time of the alleged offence the defendant belonged   but in this case whether conviction or acquittal has place unpleasant are the sentiments and sensations left in the breasts of all persons by whom respectively any part in the judicial drama has been performed defendants to wit prosecutors judges witnesses and by the contemplation of their future contingent affections and conduct—influence detrimental to justice cannot but to a greater or less extent be exercised in every one of these cases the smaller the number of the persons exposed on the one hand to suffering on the other hand to sinister interest in the shapes in question—the better in the case of witnesses no reduction does the nature of the case admit of not so in that of judges without any assignable detriment to justice the number may it should seem be reduced to one   by the addition made as at present to number one arbitrariness in the exercise of the power in question is it may be said more or less reduced true but in general practice appeal has not place and no reason can be assigned why if on the judgmentseat there be but one functionary appeal from his decision should not have place in the class of suits furnished by this particular section of the community as well as in the suits furnished by the aggregate of all the other sections   in what way soever the suit terminates transference of the defendant from the corps in question to another community presents itself as a desirable result person by whose authority and order the transference is made the army minister persons at the instance of any of whom it may be made—  the judge immediate by whom the terminative decree was issued   any one or at any rate any two of the members of the corps in question   the defendant himself whether acquitted or convicted     section xiv recruitment instructional ratiocinative art   in providing and keeping up a supply of functionaries for the stipendiary branch of the national defensive force the legislature will bear in mind the positions following— i of two persons in other respects equally apt the one unwilling to serve in the situation in question the other willing—he who is willing will on that account other things equal be the more apt upon the whole ii if in the room of a person unwilling another person not positively unapt is willing to serve—such willingness howsoever procured will generally speaking be sufficient to prove that of the two the willing is upon the whole more apt than the unwilling one principles   the aptitudemaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing   the expenseminimizing expense in hardship being taken into the account of expense antagonizing principle none instructional art   for the raising and keeping up the stipendiary branch of the national defensive force preference will accordingly be always given to voluntary service in comparison with compulsory instructional art   in so far as for the continuous mass of remuneration apt individuals are found in sufficient number to present themselves—bountymoney will not be offered as to this see section  0 remuneration instructional art   when otherwise than by bountymoney volunteers in sufficient number cannot be obtained bounties without compulsion will be employed so long as the state of the national power of furnishing pecuniary contributions shall be able to bear the expense and the pecuniary supply can be obtained with a promptitude adequate to the exigency instructional art   if at any time the demand for an addition to this force becomes to such a degree urgent that a pecuniary supply adequate to the purchase of it is altogether hopeless—or cannot by loan or forced contribution be procured within the necessary time—the legislature will fix for the respective districts and subdistricts their proportionable quota committing to the sublegislature of the district the choice of the mode of raising or taking such other more prompt and certain course if any such there be as the occasion shall be found to require instructional art   in each district or subdistrict or other smaller division of territory the number imposed will be raised by a lottery in which the names of all persons actually serving in the radical force will be inserted—with or without the addition of those who though not so serving are liable so to serve as the legislature shall have seen reason to determine principles   the externalsecuritymaximizing   the aptitudemaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing   the

the time for that purpose prescribed on pain of being dealt with as a deserter present himself to be aggregated to the stipendiary force unless within that time some apt person whose name has not been drawn shall have presented himself to serve as his substitute no person for whom such substitute has presented himself and been accepted of shall be compelled to serve instructional enactive art   for those who in this case have thus already been enlisted substitutes will at all times be admitted as far as consistently with appropriate aptitude as per section   term and conditions of service the exigency of the service will allow principles as per art  —the aptitudemaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing instructional art   consistently with this constitution—only in case of invasion or

it would be—when in respect of the selection to be made of the classes and the individuals the judgment might be formed without being exposed to the influence of the excited passions of the several individuals in the usual way interested in a word—a time of profound peace     instructional art    in giving expression to the enactments by which the lottery with such its necessary exemptions is established—the preferable course will be—to say—not on what classes the obligation shall be imposed but to what classes the exemptions from it are accorded principle the contentmentmaximizing in which is included the discontentmentminimizing instructional expositive art    under some governments all persons of the male sex exceptions excepted are—either from birth or some later period antecedent to what is regarded as that of maturity—consigned by compulsive power to this condition in life their names being for this purpose entered upon a written register conscription is the appellation by which the instrument of location is in this case denominated ratiocinative art    reason in favour of this mode of location this being all of them brought up in expectation of serving in this line—the minds of the persons in question will have been fashioned to it this being the case no disappointment nor therefore any reluctance will have place ratiocinative art    reasons against this same mode of location these—   on the part of parents and other relatives discontentment may at all times to any degree of extent and on the part of each to any degree of intensity imaginable have place without its coming at any rate in all its details under the cognizance of the legislature   so on the part of the conscripts themselves especially if enlisted at a time of life some years later than that of birth in such sort as to be susceptible of appropriate observation and reflection—of observation in particular of the effect produced by the arrangement on the language and deportment of their parents as above   if the time of enlistment be that of birth—in this case true it is that on the part of the conscripts themselves the danger of discontentment is minimized still will it be far from being excluded   on this plan exceptions in no small number and variety will of necessity be to be made consequence in the arrangement and enactments proportionable complication in the minds of the nonexempted discontent instructional art    as to volunteers note that by remuneration competent in value attached to the officer grades the having served for and during a competent time in the rank of private being at the same time attached as a condition to admission to the lowest of the officer grades—the discontentment will naturally be minimized sole seat of it the breasts of a proportion more or less considerable of the number of those parents and other relatives of any such persons as in the character of volunteers are thus selflocated against the wishes of those same relatives instructional exemplificational art    in some countries it is from their mothers womb that the recruits have as above been born into the locable list and thence adopted into the army list from a constitution such as the present the expense in money or moneys worth will at a first glance suffice to put an exclusion upon this resource only that it may be seen not to have been overlooked is mention in this place made of it in those countries the form of government having for its end in view the maximizing of the happiness of the ruling one at the expense to whatever amount of that of the millions—the principle pursued in relation to this class of functionaries—instruments at the same time and victims of the appetite of the ruling one—is not the numberminimizing but its opposite the numbermaximizing principle as to the individuals destined from birth to be shot at as pigs are to have their throats cut it seems probable that being brought up and educated in this expectation their suffering will on this account with here and there a casual exception be or at least be capable of being made to be inferior to the suffering experienced by those who at the age of maturity find themselves aggregated to the service by force or fraud supposing the education well adapted to this its end the means of aptitude will on this plan be greater than any other here then comes in the conflict between two antagonizing principles on the one side the aptitudemaximizing supported by the contentmentmaximizing on the other side the expenseminimizing section xv disbandment instructional art   throughout the whole time of peace the existence of a military force supposes a constant danger of war and in political communities in general down to the present time this supposition has received but too much confirmation from melancholy experience instructional art   during peace the better prepared a community appears to be for the renewal of war by resistance made to actual aggression—the better other circumstances equal will be its chance of preventing such aggression by fear of the evil consequences to the aggressor by this consideration will the operation of disbandment be of course in a main degree     regulated of the force which at the close of the war the government had on foot retained will be in preference that portion which on a renewal of war it would require the longest portion of time to bring to a state of adequate appropriate aptitude or say disbanded in preference those portions which in the shortest portion of time are capable of being brought to that same desirable state in addition to promptitude certainty it is true is an element which may present itself as claiming to be taken into the account of value but forasmuch as the state of the community in question must be extraordinary indeed if those portions of the defensive force which it had at one time could not sooner or later be brought into existence at another time—for simplicitys sake the consideration of certainty may accordingly generally speaking be discarded from the account and that of promptitude alone set down for consideration principle applying to this particular case say the difficultreplaceability principle or the easyreplaceability principle with equal propriety either may serve according as retention or disbandment is the object of reference generally applicable principles—  the externalsecuritymaximizing   the internalsecuritymaximizing   the aptitude maximizing instructional art   to bring the men to a state of adequate appropriate aptitude different armature classes require different lengths of time say different numbers of days supposing on each day in the case of each class as compared with every other the same number of hours employed in the learning of the exercises hence corresponding to the abovementioned difficultreplaceability or easyreplaceability principle comes the following rule disband in preference the armature class which for endowing it with adequate appropriate aptitude requires the smallest portion of time next that which requires the next smallest and so on instructional art   for this purpose the following scale composed of modes of operation with corresponding comparative lengths of time annexed will constitute an appropriate subject of inquiry for the legislature the blanks for the number are left to be filled up in the military code by advice of professional functionaries armature classes—lengths of instruction time requisite in months say two in this number of months total number of hours of exercise say as follows   i infantry man in general hours    ii infantry rifleman additional hours  instructional ratiocinative art   question the infantry why not all of them trained to be riflemen that is to say marksmen habituated to the shooting at a mark answer reason the expense that is to say—  the oncepaid or say capital expense of the rifle gun   the continuous expense of powder and shot instructional ratiocinative art   in the case of the rifle the time requisite for loading and some other circumstances considered—it has been matter of question whether any preponderant advantage would be obtained—if to the exclusion of the ordinary musket the rifle were employed by the whole body of the infantry but supposing the question determined in the negative—it would not follow that by no part of that body should this instrument of extraordinary efficiency be employed for supposing the ordinary musket preferable in the engagement between body and body drawn up collectively and in order on a plain—riflemen in a state of appropriate distribution might still in the maintenance of a defile or other position in particular in a hilly country perform a service

instructional art  0 of all these specially instructed classes not one is there who is not qualified to perform whatsoever can be required to be performed by an infantry soldier at large in time of peace not one the particular service of which the infantry soldier at large is qualified to perform hence the following rules rule   so long as an infantry soldier at large remains who can be spared discharge not one from any one of these specially instructed armature classes rule   after appropriate distinction made between landservice and seaservice—so long as any individual belonging to a less long instructed class remains who can be spared discharge not any one belonging to a longer instructed class instructional art    note that supposing cavalry men to be kept up in preference to mere infantry men—it follows not that for and along with each man a horse should be kept up once obtained the aptitude for horse exercise would not ordinarily be lost by desuetude to any such degree as not to be soon recovered but for greater certainty or in so far as collateral employments for them as per section    may be found horses might be kept up in any number short of that of the whole number of the men say for example half the men taking care of them and exercising on them in alternate weeks or months instructional art    supposing the whole number of the thus specially instructed classes—say marines artillerymen and cavalry kept undisbanded for guard and garrison service as is the english phrase—with the addition of the preventive service—this supposed among mere infantrymen the riflemen will as above claim the preference over the rest of the infantry instructional art    supposing no engagement incompatible with it contained in the enlistment instruments—by the circumstance of comparative difficulty of replacement will be determined the number of the land stipendiaries to be disbanded privates and officers together principles—  the aptitudemaximizing   the expenseminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    but supposing a determination takes place in this or that regiment or other corps to disband a part and no more than a  00 part of the whole number of the privates—thereupon comes a state of things in which application may be made of the contentmentmaximizing and inequalityminimizing principles instructional art    for this purpose what is most desirable of course is—that the number of those who are desirous of being discharged should be exactly the same with the number which the government is desirous of discharging or what comes to the same thing the whole number of those who are desirous of being kept will be exactly that which the government is desirous of keeping instructional art    but against the existence of this state of things the chances will be several hundreds to one provision must accordingly be made for two opposite states of things   that in which the number desirous of being kept is greater than that which the government is desirous of keeping   that in which the number desirous of being discharged is greater than that which the government is desirous of discharging instructional ratiocinative art    in section  0 remuneration arts     the observation has been made that in the natural state of the case bating some extraordinary degree of mismanagement on the part of government the number of those if any such there be who are desirous of being discharged will at all times be very small and if at all times much more upon the substitution of a state of peace with its security and repose than of a state of war with its perils and toils but no contingency should be left unprovided for in the nature of the case the state of things in question is susceptible of as many diversifications and correspondent degrees as the aggregate of the defensive force contains privates and if in the management of defensive force mismanagement has place—better it should remain to other nations unknown unless on its being known punishment attaches upon it—a result which how frequently soever merited will not even under the best government be an altogether probable one instructional art    on this occasion from two different sets of persons two facts there may be adequate reason for keeping concealed   at a time when the number desirous of being discharged is to a certain degree considerable the persons from whose eyes it may be desirable that the number should be concealed will be—not only the people at home but also the people and governments abroad   at all times and be the number ever so large or ever so small persons from whose eyes it may be desirable that the individuals desirous of being discharged shall be concealed are their respective superordinates reason for their not being known danger of displeasure and oppression at the hands of these same superordinates instructional art    these points considered suppose   the danger of divulgation of number to people and foreign powers unremoved—the evil to be apprehended then is that the ruling powers would not come into any measure for this same joint purpose of keeping in the contented and letting out the discontented suppose   the danger of divulgation of individuals and consequent oppression unremoved—the evil to be apprehended then is that many of the subordinates in question would prefer suffering under present oppression to the increasing the danger of ulterior oppression for the amount of which antecedently to experience no precise limit could be found instructional art  0 the ensuing plan has for its object the keeping of both these secrets and at the same time and by the same means maximizing the number who according to their desires are retained together with the number of those who according to their desires are discharged instructional art    mode of voting for discharge   for the whole number of the privates and noncommissioned officers in the aggregate of all the regiments in which the number of those same functionaries is meant to be diminished are provided an equal number of votingcards   to each regiment are allotted cards in number equal to the whole number of those same functionaries belonging to the regiment   the cards all equal or similar dimensions suppose a square inch   for receiving them two equal and similar votereceiving boxes closed in each a slit depth of the box such that the last of the cards may drop through without sticking   on the lid of one in large placard letters the words discharge me of the other keep me   these boxes are kept in such sort near to one another that a card may be dropped by a man into either of them without its being possible for any other person to see into which this may be effected in various ways for one way

numerical order   in the muster book in connexion with each voters name entry is made of the act and time of his voting by the dropping in of his card  0 the voting completed the two boxes will be transmitted together to the seat of government addressed to the army minister    the two boxes each in a separate room are for the first time opened each of them by two or more persons of each of whom it is known that he is unable to read writing    by them the several cards are ranged in regular lines each card with the comparatively plain side uppermost having as per no   nothing on it but a number    into the room are then let in two persons who being able to read range the cards in numerical order and in an appropriate recordbook make entry of the total number contained in each box and so successively in the case of each regiment    when thus counted the cards are dropped one upon another in numerical order into boxes of appropriate form forming so many piles each card with the numbered side still remaining uppermost the lettered side remaining invisible to every person to each box its lid is then immoveably attached by a certain number of seals    these are the seals of so many high functionaries to whom the knowledge of the proportion between the number of those desirous to be kept and that of those desirous to be discharged may be confined suppose the prime minister the army navy and finance minister    if the number desirous to be discharged is not greater than that which the government is desirous to discharge all are thereupon discharged for this purpose the boxes are opened the cards read the persons desirous thus ascertained and for their discharge appropriate orders sent to the several regiments    if the number desirous to be discharged is greater than that which the government is desirous to discharge the abovementioned namecards are all emptied into a box having instead of a lid a cloth with a slit in it big enough to receive a hand and arm after having thus been mixed unseen by several successive hands they are drawn out one after another in a number equal to the intended number as above in relation to these the orders for discharge are sent the others remain unknown    in the same manner when the number desirous of being kept is greater than the government is desirous of keeping are ascertained those who shall actually be kept    as to the case where the number desirous to be discharged is greater than the number actually discharged relief if the number of them be not too great might be afterwards given to them to wit by receiving volunteers offering themselves for enlistment without bountymoney and for each volunteer so enlisted discharging one of the men desirous of being discharged as above  0  instructional art    officers the difficulty of drawing the line of separation considered—the legislature will consider and determine—whether on this occasion and for this purpose the engineer class and the artillery class may not be regarded as constituting one and the same class instructional art    for the perfection of appropriate scientific aptitude both these classes requiring a perfect acquaintance with the higher branches of posology or say mathematics trigonometrical and meridional surveying and hydraulics as applied to architecture in particular with a view to sieges—the order of their respective degrees of proficiency in the aggregate of the operations belonging to the aggregate of those same branches of art and science will at any rate—supposing aptitude equal as to all other parts taken together—be the proper order of preference instructional art    note that antecedently to their location on the locable list as per ch ix section    their respective aptitudes absolute and comparative will have been decided on on the ground of the appropriate examinations by the votes of the qualification judicatory and in the nature of the case there is nothing to interdict the repetition of those same means of proof at any time—reluctance yes nothing can be more natural reluctance but on whose part on the part of the unapt and of the unapt only and as the strenuousness of the reluctance will be the degree of inaptitude antagonizing principles—on the one part   the externalsecuritymaximizing and   the aptitudemaximizing on the other part   the contentmentmaximizing section xvi sea defensive force instructional art   in respect of what particulars do the arrangements desirable in the instance of the sea stipendiary force differ from those desirable in the instance of the land stipendiary force these particulars the legislature will have constantly in mind instructional art   rule exceptions excepted whatsoever arrangement is with preponderant advantage applicable to the land defensive force is so to the sea defensive force instructional art   exceptions are all such arrangements as shall have been found prescribed by special assignable points of difference in the respective natures of the two branches of service call these points of difference the differential circumstances thus by mutual comparison and observation made of analogies the state of things in both branches of the military defensive service may be optimized observation being made on the one hand of the several subjectmatters and points of agreement or say of coincidence by which they are assimilated on the other hand of the several subjectmatters and points of diversity by which they are distinguished each thus affording instruction with relation to the other instructional ratiocinative art   i subjectmatter of diversity the first—the appropriate military exercises in the case of the landservice the military manipulations and evolutions are capable of being performed in any places by all persons  0  without distinction where physical force is adequate and moreover in the radical branch on the part of a sufficient number adequate inducement as well as means for the performance of such exercises may in almost all places and times be found in the case of the seaservice in addition to the military exercises the nature of the service necessitates others that are nonmilitary that is to say those by which motion and direction are given to the vessels in which the men and things together—the personal and the material stock—have their characteristic and essential moveable abode as to the manipulations—except in so far as those employed in the landservice happen to be exactly copied in the seaservice—they bear no resemblance to those employed in the landservice as to the evolutions in the seaservice those employed in the landservice the form and comparative smallness of the field render impossible in the seaservice if among such operations as are performed by the combined exertions of numbers at a time there be any to which the term evolutions is applicable they are in the seaservice of a nature altogether different from what they are in the landservice while by men in whose instance whatsoever may eventually be their lot no design to engage in the practice of the military exercises in either branch has place the practice of the nonmilitary sea exercises will in their quality of seamen be engaged in to wit on private account or in private service—scarcely to any of them will it happen to engage or in the course of their seaservice to be disposed to engage in the practice of those land exercises which are purely military instructional ratiocinative art   ii subjectmatter of diversity the second circumstances relative to the erudite grades in section   of supplement and section   stipendiaries are brought to view the elementary aggregates by the continual addition of which in the landservice grades rising one above another are constituted number of units in the smallest or say first elementary aggregate termed a squad   component individuals privates   corporal   a plan of aggregation this the aptitude of which is generally regarded as being certified by general practice in the seaservice no such regular plan of aggregation seems to be either needed or easily capable of being established from a ship of war no detachments can be made but in boats nor in these but for and during the short and always precarious time which a boat can live in the open sea and between the numbers necessary to be occupied at the same time in the production of a given effect in the two cases scarcely can there be found any degree of resemblance thence it is that in the seaservice the grades are everywhere so much less numerous than in the landservice instructional art   iii subjectmatter the third grades—their denomination as between the one service and the other no small confusion of ideas and misconception are produced by the giving to a considerable extent to situations so widely different in power one and the same denomination in the landservice the number of privates for the designation of whose commanding officer the word captain is employed is not greater than  00 while in the seaservice it runs in english practice as high as   00 men and in the service of other nations to still higher numbers say   00 or   00 and so in some sort in the case of lieutenants of whom under the captain in the landservice there are no more than two in the seaservice as many as six instructional art   to the legislature it will belong—to consider and determine whether to any and what extent it may be worth while to substitute to that at present established a correspondent vocabulary of official denominations and accordingly whether that which is in use in the landservice should be extended to the seaservice or that which is in use in the seaservice to the landservice or whether a new system different from both shall be applied in common to both instructional art   iv subjectmatter the fourth remuneration rising or not with grade as to which see section  0 remuneration art    for guidance the same principles will apply in the one case as in the other but the result of the application may in the two cases be to a considerable degree different instructional art   v subjectmatter the fifth—officers distinction between ordinary or say noncommissioned and erudite or say commissioned this distinction—whether in any and if in any in what degree and manner applicable in the case of seaservice instructional art  0 vi subjectmatter the sixth locable who to wit in the situation of commissioned officers in the case of the land stipendiary service as per section   stipendiaries a comparatively short time—say a twelvemonth will suffice for qualifying a person whose name has been admitted as per ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who into the general locable list in the sea stipendiary service no such short time can reasonably be expected to be sufficient consideration had of the manipulations by which alone motion and direction can be given to navigable vessels and of the variety of appropriate gymnastic exercises the performance of  0  which is thereto necessary as also of the great variety of subjectmatters of information necessary to be continually borne in mind instructional art    to the legislature it will accordingly belong—to consider in addition to the points of appropriate aptitude intellectual and active requisite in the landservice what ulterior points shall be requisite to be possessed in the seaservice and in the case of a candidate for admission into the relative locable list before an appropriate qualificationjudicatory what course of examination shall have been undergone antecedently to his location in the lowest of the erudite grades in the lowest grade occupied by a commissioned officer in the seaservice on this occasion in respect of the appropriate qualifications necessary—notice will be taken of the difference as between the scientific and the nonscientific armature classes in the landservice instructional art    vii subjectmatter the seventh officers previous service in the situation of private on this occasion will be considered how far the reasons which as per section  0 remuneration arts    and    apply to the landservice apply also to the seaservice instructional ratiocinative art    viii subjectmatter the eighth—compulsory aggregation in case of emergency of the radical branch of the sea defensive force shall the personal stock in any and what portions of it be liable to be compulsorily aggregated as per section    recruitment to the stipendiary answer in this case as in that of the landforce—no unless and in so far as for obtaining the supply voluntarily with or without pay for enlistment the money necessary cannot in time be found principles the contentmentmaximizing the inequalityminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    ix subjectmatter the ninth like question as to the material stock namely the vessel with its contents and appurtenances cargo not included answer the same instructional art    note here as to the personal stock—the crew including or not including the several members of the official establishment in the english private service styled captain or master and mates for compulsory transference from the radical to the stipendiary branch whatsoever ground there may be in the landservice—the necessity being always supposed—stronger is the ground which presents itself in the case of the seaservice why answer because the number of men thus transferred being supposed in both cases the same—in the seaservice on the part of the seafaring man fully trained in the situation of a member of the radical force that is to say in private service relative appropriate aptitude as in comparison of that of a man therein wholly untrained is in so high a degree greater than in the instance of a man completely trained either in the stipendiary or in the radical branch of the land service in comparison with a man equally untrained instructional art    note now as to the material stock in the seaservice in and by navigable vessels with their appurtenances is afforded an instance of a mass of appropriate matter of a sort applicable to the purpose of national defence over and above whatsoever in the case of the landservice is so applicable instructional art    with less reluctance and reserve it should seem may compulsion be applied to this mass of material stock than to the personal stock in the case of the vessel unless by accident as per art    upon no more than one party will the burthen fall viz the individual or the partnership to whom the vessel belongs and in that case supposing the money obtainable compensation may be rendered exactly adequate while of that same vessel the crew may amount to dozens or to scores and on the part of each of them the burthen of personal service under the sufferings and perils of warfare may to an indefinable degree be different and greater instructional art    under this head not inconsiderable is the difference liable to arise out of the circumstance of the vessel in respect of loading if it be waiting for a freight and not under any engagement for that purpose—then is the case a simple one as above not so if any such engagement has place still less if at the time of prehension the vessel is already laden in which case there will be the certain expense of unloading with the loss of time and the uncertainty in respect of time and practicability as to the obtainment of the use of another equally fit vessel for the same purpose eminent is the uncertainty in which in this case by the unchangeable nature of the case the quantum of the damage in the shape of consequential damage will frequently be involved and in this case in addition to the owner of the vessel another party or any number of parties damnified that is to say in the character of freighters may have place instructional art    x subjectmatter the tenth notification timely and appropriative for diminishing and even to a considerable extent doing away altogether the sense of suffering  0  from compulsion—in the case of transference of seafaring persons from private unwarlike to public warlike service as above—it will be the care of the legislature to apply to this case the timelynotification principle mode of application suppose the following an enactment that exceptions excepted no person shall by any owner or commander of a private vessel be hired for the service thereof or received therein without signature of a written contract a blank form for which will be annexed establishing the eventual obligation to serve in the government navy if and as often as so required instructional art  0 exemplars as per ch viii prime ministers section  0 registration system to be delivered one at an appropriate register office belonging to the port at which if a national port the vessel is stationed at the time if a foreign port or at sea then at the first national port thereafter entered and in any case one to the register office of the navy minister others to any such other places of deposit as local circumstances may have indicated instructional expositive exemplificational art    of exceptions which in this case may require to be made examples are the following   a landsman working his passage as the phrase is an individual who not being accustomed to the sea—to save the money expense of payment for his passage bestows in lieu of it his labour in the navigation of the ship   a foreigner who on being interrogated declares the fact of his being a foreigner together with his intention of not being subjected to this same eventual obligation on this occasion it will be made the duty of the commander of the ship to put the questions and together with the answers cause entry of it in the ships books a blank form for this purpose will of course be provided instructional art    added to the locatees exemplar of the copy of the contract will in this case be a printed exemplar of so much of the navy code as he has any interest in being acquainted with including every enactment by which his condition whether immediate or future contingent in the sea stipendiary or say government navy service is affected instructional art    inserted moreover in the instrument of contract will be a clause having for its object—the securing at all times for the benefit of the public service the means of communication with the individual in which means will be included the means of knowing at all times—if his condition be stationary at what place if itinerant in what vessel and on what voyage as to this matter see the procedure code ch x section   instructional art    to the legislature it will belong to consider and settle with itself—whether in consideration of the hardship attached to this eventual obligation remuneration in any and what shape receivable at the time shall be attached to the service performed by the individuals entrance into such contract as above instructional ratiocinative art    by no other consideration than that of the impracticability of otherwise obtaining a sufficiency of men for this branch of the military service will the course taken on this occasion be it is supposed determined reason suppose a bounty given—persons in any number intending at the time to quit for ever the territory of the state in question in such sort as not to be thenceforth in effect subject to its laws might receive the bounty and thereafter either not serve at all according to the contract or at a time anterior to the earliest at which the need of their service for government account could have place cease to serve and withdraw themselves out of the service principle concerned the expenseminimizing instructional ratiocinative art    as to the sense of hardship and the discontentment thence resulting—in the instance of the individual thus compulsorily engaged the nature of the case precludes the possibility of putting a complete exclusion on it at the time of entrance into this occupation in the private service—the degree of eventual hardship in the event of the compulsory transference will in the mind of each individual be inversely as the apparent probability of the result at that time and should that probability appear small the call whenever it happens will in spite of the original warning and consequent preparation unavoidably if at that time the service is disagreeable in his eyes produce in a correspondent degree the perception of hardship with the correspondent sufferance instructional ratiocinative art    thus far that is to say so far as regards the functionaries themselves—the evil is an unavoidable one but an evil distinct from this perception is in the breasts of persons at large members of the same community the idea of the above hardship accompanied with a pain of sympathy and thence on the score of injustice and want of due sympathy on the part of the government a correspondent sentiment of antipathy on their part as towards that same government but by the care taken thus to obviate as above and lessen as far as possible this same hardship the conception  0  of injustice will it should seem be pretty generally excluded instructional art    note that in the shape of provision for wounds disablement superannuation widowhood and orphanage—remuneration if any in the shape of bounty on entrance will not be exposed to the original fraud in art    indicated for only by actually serving according to the engagement can the claim of the individual to the remuneration be in any of those cases established but as to the question—whether in those cases respectively such provision shall be made—individuals voluntarily or involuntarily entering into the government service in the first instance and individuals entering in like manner from private service into government service stand it should seem on the same footing instructional art    in relation to the seaservice comparison had with the land service—in a particular degree important is the consideration that as contentment is increased need of remuneration whether continuous or once for all on voluntary enlistment from the radical to the stipendiary branch is diminished circumstance in which this particular degree of importance has its efficient cause—superior difficulty of securing appropriate notoriety to oppressions exercised thence the importance of arrangements conducive to that end as to which see section    shipboard oppression obviated instructional art  0 in speaking of the radical branch of the sea defensive force mention is made to wit per arts          of the possible eventual necessity of compulsory transference from the radical personal stock to the stipendiary personal stock for this purpose arrangements for securing eventual forthcomingness on the part of the individuals in private service with the maximum of promptitude will be necessary to the obtaining of forthcomingness on the part of each individual necessary to the constituted authorities is the knowledge of three distinguishable matters of fact these are—  his existence   his being in a state fit for service   the place at which and means by which at the time desired a mandate for his attendance will reach him in such sort as to present itself to his mind instructional art    necessary again to these purposes is appropriate registration as to the heads under which for this purpose the matter of the information will require to be entered they will be found to be of the number of those which have for their purpose the minimization of shipboard oppression to the section on that subject section    they are accordingly posted off instructional art    applied to the radical branch of the sea defensive force registration has four distinguishable purposes interests more particularly provided for and served—in the three first that of the public in the fourth those of the individual functionaries denominations these which follow these may be thus denominated i for public interest   financial to wit for the extraction of the contributions assessed on goods imported and exported   commercial for bringing to view the effects produced on the aggregate value of those same imports and exports by the arrangements made from time to time whether for the maximization of this same value or for the extraction of these same contributions of the sea defensive force stock personal and real together to wit by enlistment voluntary or in default of voluntary compulsory as the exigency may require   defensive for ensuring to the several amounts at the several times necessary the transference of the necessary quantity ii for the interests of the individual functionaries—to wit as well in the private as in the stipendiary sea service   oppression obviating—as to which see section    instructional art    on the occasion of the distinction between the land and the sea branch of the defensive force—among the subjects for the consideration of the legislature will be the question—how far the nature of the case requires that a distinction should be kept up between the functionaries of the one branch and those of the other instructional art    in particular   as to the system of exercises whether and how far to the functionaries belonging to each branch might at different times be given the exercises more particularly belonging to those of the other   whether and how far the system of grades which at present has place in the one might have place in the other instructional exemplificational art    in the english service those military functionaries in whose exercises the land and the sea exercises are thus combined—in a word whose system of exercises is amphibious—constitute but a small portion of the whole and are distinguished by a special denomination to wit that of marines a small body being allotted to every ship in the  0  british service the ordinary number is in the proportion of one to each gun in the ship instructional exemplificational art    in the french service a plan has recently been adopted having for its principle the minimization of the distinction the maximization of the union—see art   instructional ratiocinative art    consideration had of the general superiority of the maritime branch of the defensive force in england as compared with that of france a natural inference on the part of the government of any other nation might be—that the reason of the case is on the side of english practice but by whosoever considers the difference between the forms of government in the two nations this inference will not be seen to have any substantial ground france since the establishment of the charter possesses a constitution which how unapt soever when compared with that of a representative democracy is not only a reallyexisting constitution but one which has in it some seeds of melioration whereas in england the constitution matchless as it is and may well be styled being a mere creature of the imagination not existing anywhere in any determinate form of words and the practice of government in a state of constant deterioration—what there is of melioration being on the part of government the result not of design but negligence—no superiority of aptitude on the part of the french plan as above would by force of example suffice to produce in england any considerable alteration in the plan at present pursued instructional art    in england two circumstances have place either of which would suffice to render any such considerable improvement hopeless one is the horror of change by any other instrument or efficient cause than the secret operation of arbitrary conduct on the part of the constituted authorities for in this or that particular department suppose a change introduced—and this in how high soever a degree beneficial and extensively recognised as being so—and this too even without detriment to any particular interest—still it is on the ground of the greatesthappiness principle that it would have to be proposed and advocated on the ground of the greatesthappiness principle to the exclusion of or at any rate in preference to the imitation principle and the custompursuing principle but suppose the habit of reference and appeal to the greatesthappiness principle thus established it would of course with more or less frequency be applied to cases in which the advancement of the public interest would necessitate this or that sacrifice to a greater or less degree on the part of particular and sinister interests to wit those of the ruling one and the subruling few—the advancement of which by the sacrifice of the general interest constitutes in the country in question the only actual end of government hence it is that a maxim on the establishment of which deliberate reflection concurs with imbecility and inaptitude in respect of all the several branches of appropriate aptitude—moral intellectual and active—is that which prescribes the exclusion of all change the inexorable preservation of abuse in all its forms the most absurd and maleficent not excepted instructional ratiocinative art    another circumstance sufficient of itself to put an exclusion upon the inference in question is that in this case as in every other no change beneficial to the general interest could be effected without the consequence being that to the several particular and sinister interests concerned detriment in some shape and degree or other would with more or less reason be apprehended and it being a maxim as evidenced by unvarying practice that on each occasion the greatest general interest shall give way to every the smallest particular interest on the part of the aggregate of the ruling and influential few—this maxim would on this occasion in particular suffice to put an exclusion upon the change in question in how high a degree soever beneficial to the general interest instructional exemplificative art  0 note here—that by the change in question three distinguishable subbranches of service would in some way or other be affected the landservice the seaservice and the amphibiousservice termed that of the marines by the functionaries at the head of each apprehension would hence be entertained of seeing the value of their patronage in some degree lessened by this apprehension the change would be rendered unendurable unendurable to them and of course to all those connected with them by the common ties of particular and sinister interests as above instructional ratiocinative art    even if the branch of inaptitude correspondent and opposite to the moral branch of appropriate aptitude as above did not suffice to the production of this effect—those which correspond to the intellectual and active branches would of themselves be sufficient in the case of the landservice by the habit of locating in the situation of commanderinchief in this subdepartment a near relation of the monarch the want of motives adequate to  0  the production of the necessary labour of mind suffices to put an effectual exclusion upon any tolerably adequate idea of appropriate intellectual and active aptitude experience in the military branch of the service—experience with or without success—experience in this branch alone without any experience in or aptitude in relation to the civil branch or in relation to any official or other situation requiring mental labour—has been sufficient under matchless constitution the assumption uniformly acted upon is—that the higher the degree in which the objects of general desire taken together are possessed by the individual the higher is in all points taken together the degree of his appropriate aptitude while idiosyncrasy out of the question the truth is—the very reverse for of all such aptitude the degree is in proportion to the quantity of time and labour employed in acquiring it and the greater the amount of the objects of general desire a man is in possession of the less is his sensibility to these motives by the force of which alone can the employment of time and labour be produced instructional exemplificational art    for the direction in chief of the business of the seaservice subdepartment—no appropriate experience whatsoever even in the military line of that same service has for this long time been regarded as necessary or till in a recent single and shortlived instance had place in practice a functionary in whose instance experience in the military line has had place—and an individual in whose instance not any the slightest presumption of appropriate aptitude with reference to any function whatsoever has had place—have been located with the same indifference instructional ratiocinative art    in preference to this indifference an arrangement confining the choice to an individual taken from the college of physicians or from that of surgeons would be a real an important and incontestible improvement for without a long continued course of mental labour applied to branches of art and science chemistry and mechanics to wit of which application is made in the military line of this branch of service—scarcely can any individual even find his way into either of those colleges whereas in the official situation here in question instances have not been wanting of men not known to be possessed of any the least acquaintance with any branch of useful knowledge whatsoever—such excepted and that in such degree as men of opulence not destined for any profession cannot escape from being more or less superficially acquainted with instructional ratiocinative art    the declared situation has been rendered an appendage to an undeclared function namely of applying to the purposes of parliamentary corruption the patronage of one of the three recently united kingdoms for as of late has been over and over again demonstrated—without so much as one act of the will on the part of the corruptor the existence of a quantity of the matter of property applicable by him to the purpose of corruption is abundantly sufficient to produce the effect thus in a certain mode of fishing—when the fisherman has baited his hooks and thrown them into the water no need has he of any labour other than that of returning at the end of a competent interval of time to take the fish off the hooks and stow them in his basket for the skill of the flyfisher this same mode of political fishing presents not any demand instructional exemplificational art    in a statement recently made in the french chamber of deputies by the minister of the sea defensive force subdepartment—in french practice contrasted with a recent proceeding in the english house of commons an incontestably conclusive proof may be seen of the utter inaptitude of the practice of government in england as to the serving as a model of imitation to other nations of the inaptitude in england—and at the same time of the aptitude comparative at least on the part of the practice of government in france instructional exemplificational art    of the french statement the substance may be seen in the extract following from a speech of m hyde de neuville as reported in the morning chronicle of the  th of july      we have  0 general officers we had    in      according to the statements which have been already given—if england were to trace them in the same proportion she would have about  0—she has actually     france has  0 captains of ships of the line—in      she had     england at the same rate ought to have at most   0—she has had   0 we have   0 captains of frigates england had     commanders who are equivalent our lieutenants de vaisseaux and enseignes together are     england has    0 lieutenants and     masters allowance made for controvertible points—on the one hand in relation to numbers requisite under each head on the other hand for difference in the value of monies as between the two countries—from these data an estimate not altogether uninstructive might be made of the quantity of money in this subdepartment alone under matchless constitution constantly applied to the purposes of waste and corruption at the expense of the indigent subject many by and for the benefit of the opulent and ruling few  0  instructional exemplificational art    so much for france of the principles pursued in english practice the manifestation here in question is as follows every now and then for the purpose of blinding the subject many and preventing them from seeing that the maximization of waste and depredation is of the number of the ends uniformly pursued by those on whom everything depends—a finance committee is appointed by the house of commons declared purpose that of proposing reductions in the aggregate amount of the public expenditure of this committee a majority is on every occasion composed of individuals in relation to whom the most perfect assurance has place that no considerable reduction will ever be consented to by them in the session of      a committee of the sort was appointed at the close of the session they had made four reports in one of these reports one single office that of lieutenantgeneral belonging to the ordnance—an under subdepartment the business of which is conjunctly subservient to each of the two subdepartments the army and the navy belonging to the defensive force—is stated as needless and on that account requiring to be suppressed on being brought before the house at large this proposition was set aside by  0  votes to    from this one example what probability has place as to any such reduction as that held up to the view of europe by the statement of the french minister as above—may be estimated without much difficulty section xvii shipboard oppression obviated instructional art   in the hands of a commanding officer—in the radical branch of the seaservice the power needful it will have been seen has place in quantity much greater than in the radical branch of the landservice so likewise has the power commonly exercised but coupled with the sense of the need of the apt exercise the facilities which the nature of the case affords for the abusive exercise of this same power have been known to render the abusive exercise extensive to a degree which calls upon the legislature for a corresponding degree of attention and endeavour employed in obviating it   as to the need necessary—not only to the purpose of the service itself—that is to say to the safe custody and appropriate conveyance of the cargo but to the preservation of the lives of all on board is the exactest subordination—and in time of danger the most unqualified obedience—on the part of all on board whosoever they may be to the orders of the person by whom the operations are directed whatsoever the denomination attached to such his situation may be   as to the fact that is to say the actual state of things in consequence of the narrowness of the limits within which the abode of all on board is contained not one of them all so long as it continues to be their abode can by possibility escape from out of the reach of the irresistible power of the alldirecting functionary so long as he continues in the exercise of such his function thus then it is—that for the sake of the individuals concerned a demand has place for all such arrangements as may be found necessary to the securing as far as may be against the abuse of this power all such individuals as by their particular situation stand exposed to it thus much for the interests of the individuals and it will be seen that by the arrangements necessary to provide for these same particular interests services will at the same time be rendered to the public interest in the several ways mentioned in the last preceding section—section xvi art    instructional art   under the legislature and in conformity to its ordinances the authority provided for the repression of abuse in whatever shapes and situations liable to have place is the judicial on the present occasion the arrangements required are—such by which apposite application shall be made of the general authority of the judge to the peculiar or differential circumstances of this particular case instructional art   by the arrangements to which expression is given in ch xii judiciary collectively section   fields of service and section    attendance provision is made in a general way for the uninterrupted attendance of a judge—and in case of need judges acting singly in number more than one in the several spots regarded as requisite and accordingly in every seaport belonging to the state the arrangements which on the present occasion require to be brought to view are—the particular arrangements requisite for adapting the general powers so given and obligations so established to the particular circumstances of the present case instructional art   these peculiar arrangements will be seen to be referable to one or other of two heads to the first those which are employed in securing the existence and forthcomingness   0 of adequate evidence of all such facts as can present a demand for the exercise of the authority of the judge in and in relation to a vessel on its arrival in port to the next those which provide for the regular transference of the judge in person to that receptacle as being the seat of the possible abuse and the spot on which the whole of the evidence relative to it will commonly be to be found care being taken at the same time effectually to obviate all such evil as by retardation of the business of the vessel the exercise given to the judicial power might otherwise produce enactive art   seamans general register for the above purposes in addition to whatsoever register might be kept for exhibiting to view the state of the stipendiary portion of the personal stock of the sea defensive force—will be kept under this denomination at the seat of government in the office of the navy minister a register exhibiting to view the state of the radical portion of this same stock that is to say the aggregate number of the individuals employed as seamen in any service other than that of government enactive art   formed and constituted will this register be in manner following port seamans register at every port under the care of the directing functionary of the port will be kept a port seamans register in which at the first entrance of every person into the service of any individual or set of individuals in the line of seaservice—entry of such his engagement will be made and for securing the making of such entry appropriate penalties will be attached to the omission of it enactive art   on one of the leaves on the left side of the book the righthand leaf being employed as per art    entry will be made of the name of the individual in question at full length surname or surnames and christian name or names

expressive of the place occupied by the name of the individual in question in the list of the individuals if any such there be before him bearing the same name as per this or any other port register also another word expressive of the name of the port in which such other register is kept thus suppose portsmouth the port and peter porter the name common to two individuals whose names have been entered in the same year in this case peter porter with no other addition than that of the year and portsmouth the port of entry being the designation of the one who was first entered peter porter the second with the addition of that same year and the port will be the designation of the one who is next entered and so on enactive art   by the individual himself in so far as able will be written the words expressive of his time of birth place of birth and condition in respect of marriage if not by the registrar the individual making his mark to which will be subjoined the words his mark together

engaged one   transmitted to the office of the navy minister one also delivered or transmitted to the persons or offices in question any such other exemplars as the legislature may have seen reason to ordain to be delivered instructional enactive art    so much for entrances follows now the mode of recordation as applied to exits on the leaf which is on the right side of the book in a line with that the contents of which have just been described will be a set of heads expressive of the mode and time of the individuals ceasing to be in the condition in which he was placed on entrance examples

the information thus at the several posts obtained and thence transmitted to the navy ministers office within  days after the last day of every solar year the registrar will have drawn up and entered—an aggregate account of the whole seafaring population in its several classes and grades the stipendiaries and the radical each in a separate book to which account along with the other public accounts appropriate publication will be given as per ch viii prime minister section    publication system instructional enactive art    exceptions excepted as per art    after the institution of this register no navigable vessel belonging to this state will be suffered to depart from any port belonging to this state—until on inspection made by an appropriate functionary account has been taken and delivered in of every one of the individuals composing the population of that same vessel of such persons as are therein inspection having been at the same time made by him and of all such if any as though belonging to the population of the vessel are not on board thereof at the time of inspection as above—an account will be taken—by examination of the commander and of any such other persons as may be requisite which account will be signed by such commander or his refusal noted instructional enactive art    in such account of the whole population will be contained two separate lists one the list of the crew the other that of the passengers if any actual or intended in the capacity of a person belonging to the crew no person will be suffered to depart in the vessel unless either his name stands entered on the register of that same port or a certificate as per art  0 of his having been entered on the register of that same or some other port has been inspected by such functionary as above enactive art    if among the passengers there be any person who his name not being on the seamans register nor intended so to be has been admitted into that same vessel on condition of his contributing his services towards the working of the ship the name and description of every such person will be entered on a separate list name of such list the passageearners list enactive art    of such seamen of whom in the port register in question the names are as above recorded as having at that same port made for the first time their entrance in the service—the list when formed will be styled the seamans entrance list distinguished in respect of the quantity of time comprised in these same lists there will be the days list the weeks list the lunar months list the calendar months list the quarters list and the years list entranceman the name given to each individual considered in respect of such his entrance enactive art    for every statement made on the occasion of any examination taken as per art    the examinee will in case of falsehood be responsible to the same effect as if the examination had been taken in an ordinary judicatory as to which see the procedure code ch viii section    instructional enactive art    at the entrance of the vessel into any such port the commander will deliver an exemplar of the crews list and the passsengers list resulting from the accounts taken as per art    at the last port from which he took his departure to this list will be subjoined three other lists termed subsidiary or say supplemental lists namely   the missing list   the unexpectedlyreceived list or simply the unexpected list   the comeandgone list in the missing list will be entered the names of those who their name appearing either in the crews list or in the passengers list are not at the time of inspection present together with the alleged causes of their not being present or say their nonappearance in the unexpectedlyreceived list will be entered the names of those who their names not appearing either in the crews list or in the passengers list as above are at the time of the inspection present and appear as belonging to the number of the crew or to the number of the passengers as the case may be together with the day of each persons reception and the occasion on which and cause for which received     in the comeandgone list will be entered the names of all such who their names not appearing on either the crews list or the passengers nor they themselves appearing at the time of inspection have spontaneously or in consequence of examination as above been stated as having been as above unexpectedly received and so made their entrance and thereafter their exit as above instructional art    of the capacities in which correspondent to the occasions on which it may have happened to a person to have made his entrance into a vessel during the voyage—that is to say otherwise than at a port as above—examples are the following   passageearners as per art      persons who in consequence of casualties of any kind have obtained admittance and been received for instance persons taking refuge from shipwreck from famine from enemies from pirates from mutineers instructional art  0 prevention of oppression being here the purpose and of shipboard oppression in particular—comes now the application made of the appropriate ratification principle whatsoever other arrangements may to this same purpose have been made by no possibility to any individual on any individual occasion can they be of any use any further than to him or to some one for him their existence and purport are at the appropriate time in question known here therefore follow the proposed arrangements directed to the purpose of securing the existence of the notoriety thus requisite enactive art    at the time of the entry of the persons name on the shipscompanys register—into his hands will be delivered a printed exemplar of the seamans code for which antecedently to the making of the entry he will have had to pay at a price not exceeding the ordinary price of printed work of the same type and quantity of matter and paper of the same sort on a blank leaf thereof will have been inscribed his name expressed as above with a certificate of the entry made thereof in the register as above enactive art    in this code will be contained in a form as concise as the conveyance of adequate conceptions of the matter will admit the indications following—  indications of the several wrongs by the infliction of which by a superior oppression is exercised wrongs whether it be the body and thence the mind the mind alone the reputation the property the power or the condition in life of the individual that is respectively affected by them together with the remedies respectively provided for these same wrongs by law   indication of the course to be taken for conveying information of the wrong to the authority instituted for the application of those same remedies that is to say   the antecedently preventive   the suppressive   the satisfactional including the compensational   the punitional or say subsequentially preventive enactive art    on the joint responsibility of the commander of the vessel and of the functionary on whom its departure from the port depends a table expressive of the nature of those several wrongs and printed in placard types having by the care of the navy minister been provided exemplars thereof will be kept hung up in such parts of the vessel and in such number that some one or more of them cannot fail to meet at some part of the day the eye of every person belonging in any capacity to the population of the vessel to take down or in any part without lawful authority obliterate alter or add to any such table will on the part of any person be a punishable offence so likewise on the part of the commander connivance thereat that is to say omission of any lawful exertion the exercise of which depends upon him towards causing the punishment to be inflicted instructional ratiocinative art    each mans copy of the code being kept in an appropriate case the preservation of it from injury may as easily be enforced and effected as the preservation of any part of his official clothing or any other part of his official stock as to reading he who is able to read it will himself read it he who is not able will hear it read by others who are able to no rational being can want of willingness to be secured against oppression be rationally imputed and no otherwise than this means of security is afforded and profited from can such security against oppression be enjoyed by no person but by one whose wish it is that oppression should have place can any provision necessary to such notoriety be opposed instructional art    consideration had of the amount of damage liable to be produced by demurrage it will be seen that it is not of every individual instance of wrong of which a navigable vessel has been the theatre that without preponderant evil in that shape cognizance can be taken in such sort as to give to the provisions for repression of the wrong their full execution and effect upon the spot with the benefit of all such relevant evidence as it has happened to the individual case to have brought into existence but to no inconsiderable extent may justice be even thus administered     and extraordinary accidents excepted of the existence of complaint at least under the appropriate head whatsoever it may be as per art    cognizance may without any such preponderant evil be in every individual instance taken by an appropriate judge the completion of the mass of evidence and the pronouncing judgment and causing execution and effect to be accomplished being reserved until the nearest point of time at which such consummation can be effected enactive art    exceptions excepted no navigable vessel after entrance into any port in the territory of this state shall be suffered to depart unless and until before the judge immediate of the place as per ch xiii judges immediate and ch xiv judgedeputes permanent all such persons shall have made their appearance as in and by art    are in that behalf mentioned to the end that all complaints which any such person is desirous of making of wrong in any shape experienced in the course of the vessels then last voyage may be received by him and if practicable without preponderant evil by reason of the delay—a decision thereto relative will before the departure of the vessel have been pronounced by him and execution and effect given to it instructional art    on this occasion it will be the care of the judge that no person who on the entrance of the vessel into the port was or had been of the number of its inmates—whether belonging as per art    to the crews list or to the passengers list—shall remain unheard in such sort that of all persons who at the timebeing are or at any time have been on board the vessel to no one shall the hereby intended protection of the law fail to be afforded instructional art    to this end he will take the examination of the persons in question either on board the vessel or in the justicechamber as the considerations of despatch and general convenience may determine and either all at one and the same time or some at one time some at another as the circumstances may require enactive instructional art    for the purpose of such examination the judge principal or some depute of his together with the registrar principal or some depute of his will with all practicable promptitude repair to the vessel and take possession of the principal cabin excluding therefrom immediately in the first instance every other person this done the registrar taking each person according to the order in which his name stands in the aggregate population list or in such other order as shall have been prescribed by the judge will with his own voice or through the intervention of any other call for and effect the requisite appearance instructional art  0 having regard to the sinister influence of fear on testimony the judge will if he sees reason give a secret and separate hearing to every one of any such number of the persons in question as he may see reason thus to distinguish applying the concealment as well to the purpose of the examination—and as far as may be to the person of the examinee—as to the result of it instructional art    from the evidentiary matter elicited by means of any such examinations as happen as above to have been performed in secret the judge will deduce and frame any such questions as the case may require to be put on the occasion of any subsequent public examination instructional art    it will be the care of the judge so to order matters that any such delay vexation and expense as the affording this security against oppression may necessitate shall on every occasion be minimized enactive art    to any person whose name stands in the seamans register belongs the right of addressing to the registrar of the justice minister or to the registrar of the navy minister letters of complaint stating as well as he is able any wrong alleged to have been sustained by him with indication of such his name and of the persons by whose evidence it may be proved and of the ports or other places at which the elicitation of the evidence or any part of it might with advantage be performed by the judge at the judicatory there situated enactive art    of such letter immediately on receipt thereof the registrar will transmit a manifold exemplar to every port in the territory of the state to the end that at whichsoever port the vessel in question or the alleged oppressor or the alleged oppressee or any other person alleged to be capable of furnishing appropriate evidence may arrive—the judge of the port as above may take his examination and to the purpose of decretion and eventual execution carry on such appropriate proceedings as the circumstances of the individual case will admit enactive instructional art    in the seamans code will be contained     a printed formula for such letter of complaint stating the name or names of the act or acts of alleged oppression complained of as they appear in the table of offences together with reference to the articles in and by which they are constituted offences moreover the place or places and time or times as near as can be recollected and the person or persons from whom in quality of evidenceholders evidence—personal or real or both—may it is supposed be elicited in a word it will be little more than an ordinary demandpaper for a formula of which adapted to every species of offence see the procedure code ch xii section   enactive instructional art    to every such proposed complainant warning will at the same time be given—that in case of ungrounded complaint he will be satisfactionally and punitionally responsible to wit according as the falsehood is accompanied by evil consciousness or is the result of culpable inattention or of blameless error and with the information—that if by accident the use of the formula should be placed out of his power his complaint so far as intelligible will be attended to and transmitted but that by every word of needless matter contained in it its chance of being found intelligible will be diminished instructional ratiocinative art    responsibility on the part of every individual as towards every individual being thus assured the probability appears to be that in this way the number of wrongs real and erroneously supposed together will in comparison with the hitherto ordinary state of the case be in a large proportion reduced instructional exemplificational art    turn now to england look at its technical procedure for an example of the sort of protection afforded by it against shipboard oppression—behold the result in the autobiography of a man of character himself a declared percipient witness of the several facts by the master of a vessel in private service on the bodies of divers privates seamen under his command an enormous and long continued course of cruelty carried on on prosecution—matter of the defence composed of allegation made of theft as having been committed by the prosecutors mode of prosecution by indictment the commander acquitted acquitted because such had been the behaviour of the witnesses the witnesses themselves not punished by any competent or supposed competent judicatory not punished—otherwise than by that same course of arbitrary cruelty carried on without any the least proof to fix the crime upon any one of the individuals upon whom it turned out afterwards that they had been guilty of it turn now and behold the costs one horribly lacerated and tortured to make him confess himself guilty of anothers offence the real author of which was afterwards found to be a man who had assisted in the torture p     with nearly the whole savings of his last two years labours the defendant was about to return to his wife and family—p     stopped by the prosecution he is though acquitted stripped by it of all these savings and sent out of court absolutely pennyless so much for the acquitted defendant undoubted author of so much groundless cruelty look now to the prosecutors by a class of licensed and authorized depredators too learned to be ever punishable page     behold these unlicensed ones with their blameless companions divested in the figurative sense of whatever else they could call their own such was the result of a single suit in one of the least expensive modes purse employed in the prosecution a common purse in that same suit had the conduct of all of them been ever so blameless not a shilling would any one of them have received from that suit or any other in compensation of the torments so endured the purse employed in the prosecution let it not be forgotten—a common purse in the situation which was theirs the situation of a common seaman the situation constantly occupied by so many myriads—think what possibility of relief there could have been for any one whose purse had no other for its support the english judge the feefed english judge is the surgeon who when a wound is brought to him to dress instead of lint applies poison to it this surgeon is a fictitious character the judge every english chief judge who goes by that name a too real one and by a statute of     —lest the poison should not be strong enough and relief from oppression not sufficiently near to impossible—king lords and commons have given to these same judges the power of making for ever unlimited addition to the fees exacted by them for their own benefit through the hands of their own creatures on pretence of contributing to the administration of justice not long after the enactment of this law—in a pamphlet intituled indications respecting lord eldon† this choice fruit of matchless constitution was endeavoured to be brought to view by the author of these pages down to this day   d sept      any more than in the course of its passage has any one of the selfstyled representatives of the people prevailed     upon himself to utter so much as a syllable in disapprobation of it instructional art    in reviewing the contents of this and the last preceding sections the legislature will consider whether in any and if in any in what instances—the arrangements herein and therein proposed in relation to the radical branch may be applicable with advantage to the stipendiary branch and in what instances the arrangements so proposed in relation to the seaservice may be applicable with advantage to the landservice section xviii collateral employments expositive art   by collateral employments at large understand such as are so with reference to and are by this name distinguished from others considered as the employments mainly or say principally carried on by persons belonging to the class in question on the present occasion the employments considered as the main or say principal employments are those which are termed military and consist in the use of arms offensive and defensive whether in actual combat against an enemy or in the performance of any such manipulations or evolutions as are performed for the purpose of learning how to employ such arms against an enemy with most advantage by collateral employments for military men understand any such nonmilitary employments as are considered as capable of being performed with advantage to the state by men belonging to the stipendiary branch of the defensive force under the direction of the army and navy ministers respectively those ministers acting on the occasion under the direction of the prime minister expositive art   neither to the radical branch of the land defensive force nor to that of the sea defensive force has that which is here said of collateral employments any application instructional art   leading principles serving as sources of rules applicable to this subject are the following—   the aptitudemaximizing   the contentmentmaximizing   incidentally the inequalityminimizing   the expenseminimizing instructional expositive art   in the stipendiary force what is necessary is—that of each individual functionary the whole time should be at all times at the command of government what is not necessary is that at all times it should be actually employed either in actual war service or in war exercises here then of that which is not necessary for either of these two purposes is composed the quantity of surplus time capable of being applied to employments at large which with reference to the main and characteristic employments may be termed collateral to the hours in the day bears reference the timeoccupying principle as per section   leading principles art    the occupations themselves though considered as being allotted to military men acting under military discipline being themselves other than military to entire days in the year and in any number bear reference the employments here spoken of under the name of collateral employments by the very nature of the service it is rendered indispensable that during a certain season throughout all the days in the year as well as throughout all the hours in a day the occupations of all subordinates should be at the absolute disposal of their respective superordinates this season is that of actual war with the addition of any other portion of time during which on the part of the government the apprehension of nearlyimpending war has place instructional expositive art   in and during a season of profound peace a portion more or less considerable of the aggregate time of the military functionaries belonging to the defensive force establishment will without detriment to the service be capable of being disposed of according to either of two systems—the furloughallowing system and the employmentallotting system by the furloughallowing system or say the furlough system understand that according to which the military functionaries in question are allowed to betake themselves to nonmilitary employments on their own account respectively by the employmentallotting system or say the employment system understand that according to which employment is given by government to the days of the military functionaries in question in the same manner as in time of war during which time they are occupied in employments other than military though it is under military discipline that these same employments are carried on instructional exemplificative art   by several governments the furlough system has been customarily pursued   in the prussian service during threefourths of the year permission has been habitually given to soldiers in general to betake     themselves to employments nonmilitary on their own account respectively and this without any special regard to vicinity or remoteness with reference to the places at which the corps they respectively belong to were stationed   so in the service of the helvetic confederacy during about twothirds of the year in neither of these cases do the functionaries thus licensed receive it is believed any pay at the charge of government or if any not so much do they receive at this time as at other times principle the expenseminimizing instructional exemplificational art   in english practice in some corps the privates have been customarily permitted thus to betake themselves to employments nonmilitary on their own account but as to pay instead of being made—the whole or any part of it—to cease it has been supposed to find its way into the pocket of this or that superordinate principle not as above the expenseminimizing but the expensemaximizing this being the principle which under matchless constitution is in every department and every subdepartment the allruling principle the aggregate of the expense constituting so much profit in the conjunct hands of the ruling one and the subruling few instructional art   as to collateral employments that which in relation to them is desirable is—that in this as in other cases those should be chosen if any such there be by the practice and pursuit of which appropriate aptitude with reference to the main or say principal employment promises to be kept up and increased or at least not diminished rule for collateral employments other considerations being equal choose in preference such as with reference to the main employment are aptitudeincreasing and subsidiary the

following example   occasional employment in acting in aid of the preventiveservice establishment more particularly on the occasion of the application made of it to the prevention or suppression of delinquency accompanied with violence as to which see ch xi ministers severally section   preventiveservice minister instructional art  0 note however that only occasionally and by accident can this species of collateral employment be furnished at all times for the service of that subdepartment as of that of every other functionaries must be kept provided in number sufficient for ordinary occasions only on this or that extraordinary occasion can there be demand or use for auxiliary force from this quarter or any other and it may be that no such extraordinary occasion shall ever have place the extraordinary occasion will be—when by some extraordinary occurrence the standing provision made has been rendered inadequate instructional exemplificational art    example   preventive service specially applied to the collecting of the revenue under the authority of the finance minister to wit in cases where the number of cooffenders is liable to be so great as to produce a demand for aid from an armed force so far as any defensive force functionaries are thus employed the army or navy ministers subdepartment as the case may be lends its aid to the preventiveservice ministers

by a judge for the prehension or say arrestation of individuals on the occasion and for the purpose of judicial procedure as to which see ch xxviii prehensors and procedure code prehension ch xxii instructional exemplificational art    of collateral employments adapted to the situation of land stipendiary defensiveforce functionaries and to the keeping in exercise the qualities in section  0 remuneration art    mentioned that of intrepidity excepted—examples are the following i employments consisting in the performance of operations actually contributory to the service of the defensiveforce subdepartment though without danger to the operator   keeping on foot or improving or enlarging fortifications of fortified towns or ports   keeping on foot or improving or enlarging by land or water or both roads for military purposes   keeping on foot or improving or enlarging naval works of the stationary kind such as ports breakwaters slips for the construction of navigable vessels docks for fitting out and repairing them ii employments consisting in the performance of operations on subjectmatters of the     same kinds as the above but applied to other purposes   roads—land roads   water roads including purely natural to wit rivers and lakes artificial to wit canals   bridges and underground tunnels   dykes and embankments   watercourses instructional art    preferable of course are such collateral employments as give employment to officers as well as privates to such as give employment to privates but not to officers of this last sort are some of those exemplified in art    with the exception of the officers of the engineer armature class in small numbers for general superintendence instructional art    note that to defensiveforce landservice defensiveforce seaservice is less near of kin than preventive service as above not but that it might be of use that as in the case of the so called marinearmature class the functionaries belonging to each of the two branches should be made qualified for and applicable upon occasion to the service of the others moreover in virtue of the qualities common to both as per section  0 remuneration art    seaservice functionaries have in fact been every now and then employed in the landservice even without the aid of any of the landservice functionaries and yet with conspicuous success but without the aid of sea functionaries never could the land functionaries with any the least chance of success be employed in seaservice true it is—that landarmy manipulation exercises are not altogether incapable of being performed at sea but land evolution exercises are room for these being altogether wanting in seaservice the distinctive operations and these the only ones are of the manipulation class and with a few exceptions scarcely worth mentioning these are incapable of being performed on land instructional art    in a certain state of things through the instrumentality of collateral employments as above—the stipendiary land defensiveforce service will be seen to be by means of the discipline which is inseparable from it capable of being rendered conducive to habits of labour to profitseeking industry and thence to contentment and moral deportment place where the heat of the climate and the facility of obtaining land with rude produce on it sufficient for subsistence have concurred in producing an aversion to labour time when the formation of new states and the struggles almost inseparable from that process have concurred in producing an exclusive demand for service in the two branches—one or other of them or both—of the defensiveforce service especially that of which dry land is the theatre in this state of things if as in france and other old established states the whole male population appropriate exceptions excepted are by what is called conscription aggregated to the army service though not as in those cases for a small number of years but for a large number say from twelve to twenty or upwards and in the course of that time occupied in collateral employments as per art    the habit of obedience and the habit of labour may thus be formed in conjunction useful literary and other intellectual instruction being during a portion of each day superadded through plenitude of mental occupation contentment—the fruit of a continuity of moderate and pleasurable desire excitement and correspondent gratification—with urbanity of deportment may thus be substituted to listlessness uneasiness discontent and quarrelsomeness the natural endemial diseases of unfurnished minds in this manner that state of things which is to a certain degree forced upon such communities by the operations of their enemies may be made subservient to ultimate good while by means of the appropriate and inseparable discipline privates will thus have learned how to obey commanders will have learned how to command and by such learning supposing it to have for its fruit the habit of commanding without oppressing the power of commanding being divested of the power of oppressing as per section   the lot of those who are thus under command will be better—more conducive to happiness—than if they were not under such command where no such determinate and legislative checks to abuse of power by oppression have place—power by whichsoever of its two instruments matter of punishment and matter of reward—operates within the limits prescribed to it by the political and popular or moral sanctions arbitrarily and without check in this case in great measure are in private life the masses of power respectively exercised in the several relative conditions in life domestic and extradomestic exercised to wit by husband over wife by father over children by master or mistress over domestic servants by employer over persons receiving or expecting employment at his hands by customers over dealers by possessionists over expectant legatees in public life by the functionary possessing power of dislocation over his dislocables and by expected locating patron over persons looking for offices at his hands in a word by him who has power to cause uneasiness in any shape over all those at whose hands he sees no ground for apprehending retaliation and by him who has power to confer benefits in any shape over all those who are looking for benefits at his hands in the case of military command—even as upon an average exercised under existing institutions—it is to a considerable degree exercised in a manner not altogether arbitrary but judicial in such sort as to afford against oppression     a security over and above what would have place otherwise and by the arrangements above referred to the substitution of the judicial to the arbitrary exercise of power is endeavoured to be maximized instructional art    in the case of military enlistment—voluntary or as in the case of conscription compulsory—commencing at adolescence and continued as in the case of apprenticeship during the period requisite for instruction—that portion of the population to which the benefit of the requisite instruction would be imparted would stand distinguished into two very differently circumstanced classes or say sections section the first composed of those actually operating under the regulated power of command in question section the second composed of those who having during that length of time been experiencing the benefit of it subject to the attached burthen are deriving the benefit of it clear of the burthen instructional art    the distinction is the more material inasmuch as it helps to obviate the danger to internal security from excess in the quantity of the stipendiary force for supposing those who at the time belong to it disposed under the prime minister or a leader of their own choice to overthrow the constitution—on the other hand all those who on the expiration of their respective terms of service have passed from the stipendiary body into the aggregate mass of the population will naturally be more disposed to resist any such project than to concur in it instructional exemplificational art    an example of a nature to serve as proof of the amelioration capable of being made by military discipline in the morality and happiness of a population found by it in a low condition in both these respects—may be seen in british india in the case of the native soldiery styled sepoys as to morality in favour of these comparison had with that of the classes from which they are drawn for proof reference may be made to universal testimony as to happiness in favour of these same persons the fact equally notorious and capable of being made manifest by authentic documents is—that for the situation of private in that army there are at all times candidates in large numbers but in so far as they are willing the experienced and yet uninvalided being of course preferred to the inexperienced—diminution is never produced by other causes than invalidship or death a circumstance which affords matter for just regret accordingly is—that this part of the official establishment being as it is a receptacle which in so high a degree possesses the property of ameliorating whatsoever is included in it should be in the state of a reservoir with a valve opening inwards but none opening outwards with reference to the mass of the population at large the statement thus made in favour of the good effects of military discipline under these circumstances is the more trustworthy in so much as it is universally concurred in by persons by whom in almost all other particulars the conduct of government in that so extraordinarily circumstanced country has for a long time never ceased to be covered with strong and stronglygrounded blame instructional exemplificational art  0 of representative democracies in which by extension given to the mass of land defensive force a reasonable promise seems to be thus afforded of a continued addition to the stock of morality and happiness—examples are the following—   late spanish america throughout   late portuguese america   haiti and other hot countries in general which have not yet made advances in civilisation equal to those made under the advantage of more temperate climates art    so even greece although in this instance the circumstance of temperature as per art    has not place the moral character having by oppression inflicted and endured during so vast a length of time suffered that moral depravation which on the part of slaves on the one hand and that of masters on the other is the unhappily certain fruit of slavery section xix concluding remarks instructional art   for the consideration of the legislature and the subordinate authorities it will be—what instruction may be derivable from the practice of other states and other times in some instances the practice although carried on with advantage then and there will be found to be inapplicable here and now in other instances not the cases in which it will be found inapplicable are mostly those in which the applicability depends on the state of the mind the cases in which it will be found to be applicable are those in which it depends on the state of the body of cases in which it being the condition of the body that is in question the applicability may be found to have place example is the following—   weight which a soldier is capable of habitually carrying about him weight which according to vegetius the roman foot soldiers were accustomed to carry sixty pounds state in respect of maturity of age being the same no reason appears why by a roman at the present day or a frenchman or an     englishman the same weight should not be carried on the other hand in the armies of modern times men are admitted at ages less mature than into the roman armies of those ancient times the reason depends on the nature of the armature for making use of the firearms in modern use less strength is necessary than for making use of the cutting weapon and shield employed by foot soldiers in those ancient times instructional art   cases in which applicability depends on the state of the mind for examples see section   stipendiaries who art    ranks art    distinction between ordinaries and erudites in those days in respect of martial instruction the difference was small between rank and rank compared with what it is at present almost completely unknown in those times were the branches of art and science on which for the artillery and engineer armatureclasses appropriate aptitude in so high a degree depends instructional art   number of the grades supposing it ascertained that the number of grades in european service in general and in english service in particular is greater than needful it would not follow that it could with any advantage or even without utter ruin be rendered so small as it was in the roman service in ancient times in modern times the state of society and the nature of the armature combine in enabling commanders to employ detachments of small numbers on many different occasions for many different purposes and consistently with the common safety and the accomplishment of the purpose whatsoever it may be no detachment how small soever can be without its commander on the other hand in the ancient times in question comparatively speaking there was scarcely any action but in the largest bodies the whole of the force collectible at the time on one side met and encountered in a body the whole force collectible at the time on the other side supplement section i composition of troops infantry in english service the company unit is the private   privates and  a squad  commanded by a corporal

brigade commanded by a brigadiergeneral   brigadesa division commanded by a lieutenantgeneral section ii on courtsmartial a general courtmartial in the british service consists of thirteen members at least usually fifteen to make allowance for sickness or other contingency the senior of these is president to him by name the commander under whose authority the courtmartial assembles directs the warrant to assemble and try the judgeadvocate is also named in the warrant the other members are not named but selected by the commander or taken from the roster at his pleasure the president must be superior or senior to all the others and in case of his sickness or death it is presumable that the next senior would officiate of course no man ought to vote who has not been present from first to last though this is not so clearly defined as it should be the judgeadvocate is often a civilian or common lawyer—often a military man selected without necessarily proving any fitness he holds his place at pleasure and if a military man his commission also like all the members of the court he is paid by a per diem allowance from date of the warrant assembling the court till the sentence is finally returned approved by the commander who summoned the court or his successor in the command   0 the judgeadvocates functions are diversified and incompatible he has all the influence but the president backed by the court all the authority saving the judgeadvocates right to record his opinion and dissent on any point of form at all times on the proceedings the judgeadvocate is public prosecutor representing the state he prepares the crime indictment examines for the crown chief and cross sums up after all the proceedings for the defence as well as prosecution are closed in an address to the court who president included then become a jury the judgeadvocate is the adviser in law and conductor of all the proceedings though the court is not bound to follow his counsel and though the president is always professedly addressed as the chief authority present lastly the judgeadvocate is supposed to be counsel for the prisoner but the prisoner frequently provides if an erudite a lawyer as his amicus curiæ and he suggests the questions to be put to evidence—the points of law and fact that arise incidentally—and by a fiction for lawyers quâ lawyers are not recognised in courtsmartial obtains leave to read the prisoners defence it is plain that in most cases the judgeadvocate must be possessed of tremendous influence and power and must be everything in such a court how is it then that beyond doubt military courtsmartial lean strongly towards the accused and often baffle power and persecution the reason may be found perhaps in the sympathy excited by the total helplessness of one of the courts own class exposed thus to such tremendous odds and the means are clear enough whereby this merciful and sometimes erroneous tendency is gratified—namely the secrecy of individual votes and opinions this secrecy pervades every important proceeding of a courtmartial at any stage any member has a right to clear the court of all save president members and judgeadvocate the clearer then propounds his objections to any matter of law or procedure to any question put or answer received in short to anything the judgeadvocate may record any opinion or objection he chooses to the resolution taken by the court but the debate is concluded with closed doors the majority decides no record is made upon the minutes of opinions or votes—the proceedings simply state the fact that the court was cleared and opened again the court having ruled so and so the president and members as well as the judgeadvocate are bound by their oaths to secrecy with respect to the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court this secrecy is the grand safetyguard of every prisoner it has many of the advantages of ballot and its only disadvantage of much note perhaps is that no record is thus kept up of the reasons that swayed courts in deciding important points of law and proceeding thus future courts have no benefit from past decisions they only know the naked facts perhaps this is not without advantage considering the mischief done by precedents in the administration of law but there is a great difference in this—that regular judges and lawyers have all a fellowfeeling and a common comedy to perform and therefore bend or affect to bend to previous dicta whereas the tribunal called a courtmartial uniting the functions of judge and jury is taken for each occasion out of the mass of erudites and the occasions being but rare each member is generally full of his vocation and inclined to exercise the portion of power vested in him fairly for the public weal thus little difference exists in the temporary judgejurors opinion of today from that of the plain man of yesterday and thus it is that only a few broad matters of law procedure and evidence have come to be ruled points a great loss of time certainly follows this necessity of arguing everything de novo so far this state of things is matter of regret a greater because invariable loss of time arises from everything whatever in the proceedings being conducted in writing except the conclave discussions all evidence is minuted—opening—defence—summing up likewise this must be so long as the sentence and verdict of a courtmartial are not final nor anywise operative until they have received the approval of the commander who assembled the court or his successor and who may correspond with the court and the judgeadvocate pointing out what they should do—ordering them to reassemble and revise their sentence not proceedings but finding and sentence only once or as permitted by the letter of the article of war twice no such power exists in the navy there the courts finding and sentence are unalterable and pronounced in court—the execution or staying of it or commuting or pardoning being in the competence of the admiralty alone no other power should exist in the army and then proceedings might be abbreviated the shortest general courtmartial now takes up several days every question even from a judgejuror being in writing no sentence of death can be pronounced unless twothirds of the court concur in it this comes into collision in particular cases with the rule that the verdict of guilty or not is first declared by the same court quâ jurors and by a bare majority while a subsequent vote is taken distinctly as to the question of pure law i e the sentence applicable to the finding of guilty this second question is settled by a bare majority save in two or three articles—mutiny—forcing a safeguard—and cowardice are the articles in question see annual articles of war—where death is the sole     punishment—no discretion allowed—yet twothirds must concur suppose out of the thirteen necessary members six against seven find guilty of mutiny the law is peremptory as to the punishment of death but yet nine against four must concur in this sentence whence will come the two in addition to the seven required not certainly out of the six who dissented from the verdict of guilty the anomalous things above pointed out do not occur often—  because the penalties of most articles of war in the code admit of great latitude—death or such other punishment as a courtmartial shall award—such punishment—corporal punishment—mulcted in such proportion of his pay c c such is the usual phraseology—  because both in the finding and in the sentence the same species of majority viz a bare majority suffices in most cases this latitude of arbitrary punishment as the scotch lawyers have it is bad yet it is not easy to say what can be done where scarcely any of the offences legislated for are mala in se but almost all mala prohibita only in england none but erudites are privileged to sit on courtsmartial whether general or regimental in the navy none under the degree of post captain i e lieut col in the army an absurd rule originating in days when men of very inferior knowledge and education filled the lower commission of lieutenant which corresponds with captain in the army an ensign in the army is qualified to sit on any courtmartial none under the degree of a fieldofficer of which the lowest rank is that of major can lawfully be president of a general courtmartial nor under captain of a regimental court and this only in case of necessity in india all the native officers of a battalion viz one subahdarmajor ten subahdars or captains and ten jemahdars or lieutenants must have risen from the ranks as private sepoys† in this class of hindoos and mohammedans native officers is wholly vested the delicate function of doing justice between the sepoys and the state all the forms are the same as in british courtsmartial the code almost the same a judgeadvocate the ordinary english functionary who acts in white courtsmartial sits in general courtsmartial and in regimental or garrison or line courtsmartial a european officer is temporarily named to act as superintending officer with exactly the powers of a judgeadvocate european and native sworn interpreters are employed everything is reduced to writing in english by the judgeadvocate sentence is approved by the officer who ordered the court matters of life and death equally with those of the most trifling nature are handled by these tribunals and no complaint is ever made of their conduct substantial justice is always done and if any slight leaning exist it is not towards their own body but towards the state the minor courtsmartial are the worst parts of the system until lately they acted not under any solemn sanction of oath or other asseveration whether on the part of judges or evidence—nay it is not very long since drumhead courtsmartial used to be assembled without any record of proceedings and sanction instantaneous lashing five or six hundred stripes of men taken from the ranks for some sudden offence of discipline sir francis burdett has done indescribable good in the whole field of military justice by drawing attention to these courts punishments are now of a more judicious and merciful kind—drumhead courts are defunct all courts now meet under sanction of oath and record a species of more formal regimental court called general regimental courtmartial has arisen to take cognizance of offences which used to be referred to general courtsmartial the difference is that the new court has a responsible person to act as judgeadvocate which no minor court formerly had and a greater number of members‡ in the french armies stripes have ever been unknown count de narbonne before the revolution     tried to introduce the coup du plat de sabre in conformity to the germanizing rage of england and france forty years ago thirty thousand men are said to have deserted on the promulgation of the order and it was abandoned the peine du boulet—hard labour—ignominious dresses—imprisonment c are inflicted for smaller offences but death is often inflicted for desertion mutiny c in the indian sepoy army flogging is comparatively rare and almost solely confined to ignominious offences theft c no flogged man is usually allowed to be retained in a corps but is turned out it is needless to say that such an army must be animated with a very high spirit and that such a system could only be maintained where the status of the soldier is placed very high in general estimation and so it is a sepoy considers himself and is considered by family and neighbours a gentleman all the higher ranks of natives in the battalion are filled from the lower exclusively pay clothing food lodging medical treatment invalidpension—all are liberal and quite secure and the natives judge and punish each other by a simple though severe code of laws if this could be done in england instead of filling our armies with jailbirds the same effect would follow and as in bengal fifty aspirants would follow each battalion waiting for vacancies in france it is well known how much the military morale was raised by the unsparingness of the conscription by the open avenues between the marshals and the privates situations by the sympathy created between officer and soldier owing to those circumstances and to that of every officer being obliged to begin as a private soldier in austria and prussia where they count quarters and so forth the morale of the military machine is of the lowest grade in the scale yet these last are at least as dangerous to liberty and humanity as the french or the sepoys—as ready instruments against their countrymen—their own fathers if need be is it only then when the soldiery of high military morale look up exclusively to the executive for promotion protection bread that they are dangerous let us hope this is so and that it may be possible to find the two desiderata capable of coinciding—namely a high military feeling among the soldiery with a preference of country liberty public rights in case of collision to the will of one to compass this measures must be systematically devised to make the few stipendiaries cease to consider themselves as servants of the executive alone paid by it promoted by it dependent on it but all this though perfectly feasible in a really free country where representation of the people is substantive cannot coexist with an overshadowing aristocracy and an unreformed parliament our english volunteers might in a political panic or other epidemy have by accident taken part with a sovereign or minister in a direct attack upon such liberty as was possessed by their countrymen but this delusion could not have long subsisted so the thirty battalions of the french parisian national guard   000 of whom long survived all political changes so the american militia and regulars in both wars remarkable fact—that in india where the english pretend they cannot introduce criminal or civil native juries—they have introduced them from the very origin of their power—seventy years ago in the sepoy service no sepoy can be punished in any way but by sentence of native officers all of whom are of his own colour and caste and all have served for many years as private soldiers the thing has completely answered in practice by universal consent subsidiary observations by the editor of the original edition of the chapter on defensive force the editor of the chapter on defensive force has been offered the opportunity of appending such subsidiary observations as may appear to bear upon its general object he is desirous of stating that all which is thus introduced is on his own responsibility and in no degree involves the authority of any of the rest art   on different descriptions of landservice defensive force first in order of institution and principal in point of magnitude must always or with such inconsiderable exceptions as scarcely to permit notice be the service of infantry the first instinct of man is to take care of himself the earliest efforts of men on foot combined for war will consequently and more especially where the missile weapon is one of great power and effect be in open or dispersed order in which though there may be a considerable degree of unity of operation as for example all may advance on one particular point and at one particular time by the arrangements of one or more leaders the result will be the sum of the efforts of individuals acting under the guidance of their individual courage and intelligence rather than of discipline of such composition in a great measure were the earliest armies of france in the revolution such also were the vendeans opposed to them in the west but when a considerable number of experiments have been made in this kind of war it begins to be generally found out that great effects are produced in favour of whichever side can induce large bodies of men on foot to act together with closed ranks and thereby form themselves into compact military machines moved and directed entirely by the will and intelligence of individual commanders such     bodies may not supersede and totally remove the utility of the other previouslydescribed species of force but they are found to be immense additions to its efficacy in short it is determined by experience by which everything else in this world is determined that a certain and this a very large proportion of a regular army of given numerical strength will produce an increased result in the shape of power by being trained to fight in close order what is close order must be determined with relation to the species of arms in use the ancients thought of nothing less than sixteen deep because though they were not absolutely without machines approaching to the nature of artillery these were feeble difficult to move and on the whole comparatively inefficient but when armies came to be exposed to such powerful agents as modern artillery and musketry their ranks were speedily reduced to three for in addition to the havoc made by the modern missiles on bodies of deeper formation it was discovered that in no ordinary circumstances could more than three ranks employ their own missile weapons at the same time so that so far as the combat was to be decided by these any ranks above three were noneffective when firearms were first introduced into armies it was natural that an overstrained idea should be formed of their effects the opinion therefore gained ground that a combat between two armies of disciplined infantry could be nothing but a mutual slaughter of two lines of men drawn up opposite to each other and trying which should suffer longest but by degrees it was discovered that the power of firearms great though it was had been overrated fear hurry defect of vision from smoke difficulty of hearing orders from noise all tended to make the effect of a direct and continued fire vastly less destructive than might have been expected and in addition to these negative causes diminishing the danger of the attacking party it was found that in the extended positions occupied by great armies the assailant had almost always in some part or other of the field of action the power of advancing under cover of peculiarities of ground or other advantages and moreover of covering himself by troops in open or dispersed order who could draw off the fire of the enemy at the same time that they were themselves comparatively covered or unexposed in these ways it came to be discovered that in spite of the effects of firearms battles of infantry were after all in a great measure reducible to contests between bodies of men in close order and at short distances—sometimes so short as to employ the arme blanche or manual weapon as distinguished from that which acts by means of gunpowder from these circumstances arose the distinction between light infantry and infantry of the line or what in the continental armies are often collected into battalions under the title of grenadiers from their several uses it seems to follow—that the first are the most easily formed and may contain by preference those who have more intelligence than discipline or who from youth want of stature or other causes are deficient in athletic vigour in this way also the radical force is most speedily and easily made to be an effective part of the public defence and the defensive force of communities increased in comparison with the offensive—a consummation evidently contributory to the general happiness of mankind and—that the others or infantry of the line should be constituted by preference of those who from habits education or otherwise are most amenable to discipline or least endued with the qualities favourable for the formation of irregular combatants and moreover should be composed by preference of men of stature and that species of strength which is operative in bodily contests next of the service on horseback when it had been discovered that bodies of infantry might produce striking military results by means of celerity of movement upon various parts of the enemys formation or position it was but a small step to the observation that this power of celerity might be obtained in a much higher degree by means of troops mounted on horseback and the probability is both from general reasoning and from the contents of history that the earliest cavalry was considered as something very dangerous and irresistible by men on foot one of the earliest military improvements however in all nations that have employed disciplined armies has been the discovery that so long as infantry in close order preserved its discipline and coolness it was virtually unassailable by cavalry or at all events could only be assailed with effect by means of such superior sacrifices as amounted in practice to the same thing and the extent of this result has been increased by the introduction of firearms when indeed infantry was intimidated and had lost its union and resolution—when it had ceased to obey the directions of a presiding will and the attention of the individuals composing it had been directed to the means of escape rather than of victory—as for instance when it had been made to give way before the victorious infantry of an assailant—then the power of a body of cavalry was found to be overwhelming and even before the victory of the infantry was decided—or as it may be expressed durante conflictu—the rapid movement of a body of cavalry towards a point that was already vulnerable or that was sure to become so in the event of the superiority of the enemy being acknowledged was found to be a powerful instrument of success in the earliest application of cavraly therefore the mere circumstance of velocity or the power of rapid locomotion may be held to have been the most important agent in the expected result but when cavalry had thus come to be employed as what may be called a flyingpiece on the chessboard of war it was speedily discovered     that there were many circumstances in which the operations of the hostile cavalry could in no way be so well opposed or neutralized as by moving against them with a piece of the same kind if infantry already engaged with an equal force of infantry was disturbed by the rapid approach of a body of cavalry in addition—or if it had given way before the enemys infantry and was in the act of being destroyed by the cavalry that supported it—there was manifestly no practicable way of moving with sufficient rapidity to its relief except by attacking the cavalry with a body of the same kind this therefore led to the employment of cavalry against cavalry and here it was speedily discovered that in combats of this nature not only rapidity of movement but strength was essential to success in effect it was discovered that the horse was the principal part of the machine and that in proportion to its strength and vigour was the power of the whole and this led to the formation of a cavalry délite which is or ought to be what is known by the distinctive names of cavalry of the line heavy cavalry grosse cavalerie—while at the same time there exists another cavalry which for distinctions sake will be here called ordinary cavalry capable of performing the common services of cavalry but less applicable than the other to contests where individual strength is of primary importance if it should be asked why all the cavalry should not be of the best the answer is that all cannot be of the best the demand for cavalry will in every war where a country shall be called upon to put forth its strength be greater than there is a possibility of supplying by horses of the highest strength and quality and so forcibly is this felt that in most of the european armies there is a third kind of cavalry intended principally for the service of outposts and making observations which goes under the name of light cavalry and is mounted on horses of still smaller height and physical force in the british army this last class of horses is nonexistent the quality and number of horses in the british islands with relation to the number employed in war being such as to allow of all the light cavalry being mounted on horses of the second class the artillery as before noted is an accessory to whose agency little that is analogous existed among the ancients since the campaigns of the french revolution its importance has been greatly extended as being the weapon which demands most science it will be always a favourite arm where the intelligence of nations in a more advanced state of society is brought into opposition to the force of such as are in a less and the greater the diffusion of intelligence the greater will be the results likely to be derived from this arm on the whole therefore the advantage is likely to be on the side of those states in which the power of self government is in the hands of the many the great and palpable division of artillery is into that which manæuvres and that which does not in other words into field artillery and the artillery used in the attack and defence of fortresses with respect to field artillery the inferences from modern wars are first that though it may be desirable and useful that all commanders of large divisions of the army should have certain limited quantities of artillery awaiting their disposal the great effects of artillery are to be procured by employing it offensively in great masses secondly which is only a consequence from the other and does not seem to have been so fully appreciated and developed as might have been expected—that all field artillery is or ought to be of the nature of cavalry or what is commonly denominated horse artillery without the power of rapid motion derived from the artillerymen being mounted it is impossible that it should perform the offices expected from it every man who has seen war will have observed numerous instances in which the infantry by reason of its greater power of surmounting obstacles could get over the country faster than the cavalry—still more than the artillery and the only way to enable the artillery in even the ordinary circumstances of action to keep up with the infantry—is to give it the power of compensating for obstacles by exerting the velocity of cavalry after they are overcome next in importance to the artillerymen being mounted is the simplicity of calibres the calibres of field artillery might apparently be reduced to two—exgr the calibre of six pounds for the long gun and of twentyfour for the howitzer intended to act with shells in positions which do not admit of direct fire an observation deducible from tables of artillery practice and which appears to have been much overlooked in the construction of modern artillery is that within certain limits the weight of metal in a gun being supposed fixed the effect for field service or in other words for acting against men and horses not covered by fortifications will be greater when the given quantity of metal is formed into a gun of smaller calibre than into one of greater for proof reference is had to the tables showing that of two guns circumstanced as above the smaller calibre absolutely sends its single or round shot farther with the elevations in ordinary use and moreover expels a greater quantity of the small balls called grape at a single discharge—which is explained by the guns being comparatively stronger and enduring a comparatively greater charge hence if as may often be the case with a defensive force there should be a necessity for opposing a field artillery of brass with one of iron in which the inferiority of the iron is that to obtain the same strength the weight must be increased from a third to a half the best way of diminishing the disadvantage will probably be by diminishing the calibre this therefore is an observation tending to increase the efficiency of defensive force     it is evident that horse artillery considered as a species of cavalry possesses precisely those qualities which the other cavalry has not it can convey to a given point the faculty of overwhelming or helping to overwhelm a body of infantry and when it is in combination with cavalry the same necessity which obliges the infantry to form squares to resist the cavalry exposes it to destruction from the artillery horse artillery therefore in localities favourable to its action has tended to give the advantage to cavalry over infantry or in other words to confine the superiority of the infantry to localities not adapted for the movement of large masses of horse artillery a difference discernible between horse artillery and other cavalry is that horse artillery has the most marked power of deciding victory cavalry of improving it the use of foot artillery or artillery where the artillerymen are not conveyed on horseback appears to be with propriety limitable to the attack and defence of fortresses it is therefore in reality part of the science of the engineer or—the sciences of the attack and defence of fortresses and of the use of heavy artillery should be combined in the same individuals the use of fortresses in modern war appears to be reducible entirely or nearly so to their effects upon communications for example a fortress which secures a certain passage to the possessor and enables him to exclude his enemy from the same passage is of the same value and effect as the possession of a gate which lets in one man and keeps out another it is in just continuation of this metaphor that a fortress is sometimes styled a key the key of a country c a fortress which is the key to nothing is in modern military estimation worth nothing and would be better dismantled many ancient fortresses are thus situated and therefore have been abandoned but to have any effect in the way of a key a fortress must be connected with some extensive local obstacle or difficulty as for example a river or a chain of mountains if there is to be a gate there must also be something of the nature of a wall for a fortress in an open country or on a plain of ice would be like a gate where there was no wall the idea that fortresses might operate as checks to an invading army by the fear of the effect of their garrisons upon its rear may be considered as obsolete if a hundred thousand men retire before a hundred and twenty thousand and as the means of checking the enemy throw fifty thousand into fortresses—the consequence only is that even if the enemy leaves fifty thousand to watch them the inequality of the active forces that remain instead of being as five to six will be in the proportion of five to seven which is worse than before but the invader will not leave fifty thousand he will contrive that for instance thirty thousand collected into larger bodies than the garrisons of the divided fortresses shall keep the latter in check and be ready to fall with a superior force on the first that ventures beyond it walls and the difference twenty thousand he will add to his former superiority in the field making the final proportion that of five to nine fortresses therefore considered merely as places of shelter are not a source of strength to a retreating army in operations on a large scale but the contrary but as keys to communications fortresses have a very considerable effect though less than was anciently attributed to them a fortress that can stop up a point of passage for a certain period against all opposition may oblige an invading force to lose time in taking a circuitous route and several fortresses of the same kind in succession may cause the loss of time to amount to some weeks—and a weeks greater or less delay may determine the fate of a nation hence there is a substantial use of fortresses and there is an imaginary one and it is the business of statesmen and commanders of armies to distinguish one from the other and this proper use of fortresses is evidently an important consideration in relation to defensive war hitherto the subject has been that of different armatures or modes of arming or what the french distinguish more briefly by the word arme the next is of the mode of applying them and these two subjects have manifestly a degree of interconnexion with each other arms of a particular kind are chosen from an opinion that they are the most effectual for the conduct of war and war is conducted in one certain manner and not in another in consequence of a reference to the nature of the arms in use the great division which presents itself in this place is the division into tactics and strategics it is remarkable that after all that has been written on the military art men in general have not yet come to a clear and vernacular comprehension of the difference between these two things even jomini the last military author of name and the only one who has written intelligibly on the rationale of the movements of armies is not clear upon it tactics from τάσσω ordino are the preparation of the instruments strategics from ϛϱατὰeditor illegible character editor illegible characterγω are how to apply them after they are made to     mix colours prepare canvass and choose brushes may be said to be the tactics of a painter strategics are how to paint to know how to form columns lines to advance to retire c is tactics to know when to form columns when lines when to advance when to retire c is strategics there may be a small tactique and a grande tactique—a tactic of companies and a tactic of regiments and a tactic of corps darmée—a tactic of infantry of cavalry and of artillery but they all agree in the definition given the divisions existing in strategics were never clearly developed till it was done by napoleon the strategic of battles was indifferently well understood before his time and had received great improvements as connected with the modern weapons from the king of prussia but the rules for the direction of forces at a distance from the enemy were in a very different state the leading principle of this strategic of battles may be stated as derived from the fact that when a force drawn up as in the greater number of cases since the invention of firearms forces must necessarily be drawn up in long thin lines was attacked by other forces which had placed themselves in the direction of the smaller dimension of the line or in other words upon one or both of its flanks it was almost sure to be defeated or at all events the chances were greatly against it unless counterbalanced by extraordinary activity in the commander and resolution in the troops and the reason of this was evidently that bodies thus attacked in the direction of their smaller dimension are under an incapacity of offering any effectual defence or opposition without at all events a change of position to prepare for it and this change of position when to be effected under the pressure of an enemy and because the enemy makes it necessary is a very dangerous operation and almost sure to end in disorder and rout what was established therefore was that in respect of positions in actual combat the central position was the dangerous one and to occupy the circumference of the circle or in other words to surround or turn the enemy was the desirable one and here began the mistake which napoleon was born to correct and conquered the european continent in setting right what was true of bodies of troops in positions of actual combat was assumed to be true of bodies at great distances from each other because an army was in a dangerous situation when it had another army on each of its flanks within cannon shot it was assumed that an army in germany was also in a dangerous situation when it had one army on its flank in italy and another in the netherlands the first consul was the discoverer of the fallacy contained in this assumption and of the true principle of what may for distinction be called the grande stratégique or mode of directing the movements of armies at a distance from the enemy and he made thereby the same kind of revolution in war that copernicus did in astronomy he saw clearly that so long as there was distance enough for the central army to have time to concentrate its operations on one of the divided forces on its flanks without its movement being instantly discovered and interrupted by the pursuit of the other—the chances were all in favour of the force occupying the central or interior position and this though other causes combined and aided was the leading source of his military success so far as it depended on the movements of armies when his enemies had by experience become acquainted with his system they endeavoured to paralyze it by withdrawing before him without fighting so as to disappoint him in the object of his movement which was to destroy a part—and thereby leave him no result but the labour of his march and this was attended with considerable effect in the particular circumstances of napoleon because time and victory were precious to him at that period but it does not follow that the same system is applicable to general use where circumstances on the two sides approached to equality the very practice of the retreating system would be an avowal of inferiority and the commander of the other army would find opportunities of so directing his movements that to retreat before him should lead him to some object equivalent to a victory it may appear matter of interminable regret that such a discovery which proved itself capable of changing the face of europe should have produced so little benefit to mankind at large but the results are yet to come the discovery of napoleon has decided the ultimate independence of nations by demonstrating that the most civilized and liberal portion of europe possesses the good military position against the less civilized powers which surround it if france for example should ever again be attacked by such a coalition as at the commencement of her revolution the military principle developed by napoleon would give her almost the certainty of repulsing the invaders and finding the way to their capitals in return a practical inference of smaller extent is that in the case of a national resistance in circumstances like those of spain when it rose upon the french forces dispersed over the country in   0  the object of the insurgents should be to unite concentrically into masses superior to the separate masses by which they happen to be surrounded and then assume the offensive without a moments delay for the purpose of overpowering their enemies in detail repeating the same process of concentration and attack as often as circumstances shall direct the first part of the contest must in fact be a race to see which side can execute this kind of process with most celerity and vigour art  — on the rifle for defensive force it has been asserted that the invention of     bombs decided the superiority of standing armies over citizen levies and gave a blow to civil liberty in most of the states of europe the invention of the rifle appears calculated to reverse the superiority on this head question may be the following—if an army of citizen defenders were opposed to an invading regular force in such numbers on the two sides respectively as should balance the difference in the habit of acting in organized masses and make the chances equal—would not a relative advantage be given to the citizens if both sides were to receive the power of arming themselves with rifles at discretion with time for learning the mechanical use of the instrument it may be maintained that there would—  because the citizens being the greatest number the sum of all the additions that could be made to the efficiency of individuals on their side would be greater than the sum on the other—  because the additions to the power of the individual citizens are in the same direction in which the advantage of the aggregate lay before but the additions to the power of individuals in the regular force if extended beyond the comparatively small number who might be employed as irregular combatants before are in a different direction and consequently for every addition to the strength of the aggregate in one direction there is a diminution in another or if it be clearer say—the tendency of the change upon the whole is to transfer the mode of combat from that in which the regular force has most advantage to that in which the citizens the aidemémoire for the use of the french artillery edition of      contains the only known statement of the relative powers of the rifle and the common musket the result of experiments there stated is that the superior efficiency of the rifle circumstances for and against all taken into account is in situations appropriate to its use as thirteen to five for practical evidence of the effect of the rifle for defensive force reference may be had to america who will make any permanent impression on the united states with their population of riflemen who would dictate forms of government to france if in addition to her stipendiary army she had an equal number of volunteer riflemen from her radical force art  — on military economy a point which may be usefully insisted on in connexion with a treatise on defensive force is the great economy so far as relates to the stipendiary branch of having everything of the best that is procurable take for example the armature of the infantry the cost of an infantryman in the stipendiary branch including pay clothing food if supplied distinct from pay and armature with the common musket is ordinarily estimated at £ 0 sterling   0 francs ayear the cost of an ordinary musket is about £  sterling and that of a rifle is on a large estimate £ 0 hence if the rifle is supposed to last only fifteen years which is much under the truth and to require renewing continually at the end of that period the additional expense of arming and keeping a man perpetually armed with a rifle with due calculation of the value of money at five per centum may be estimated     as equal to a continual payment of £  per annum hence by a nation which has considerable capital at command thirty riflemen may be raised armed and permanently kept on foot for the same expense as thirtyone common infantrymen but it has been shown that in appropriate circumstances the advantage of the rifle over the common musket is as    to   hence if riflemen are raised to the extent that can be employed under such circumstances and to no greater   of these riflemen will be as useful as    men with muskets or preserving the same proportion  0 riflemen will do the service of    common infantrymen but  0 riflemen are only the expense of    of other infantry the expense therefore of    infantrymen out of    will be saved or a given expense will be applied with an increased final result in the proportion of    to    or upwards of   to   in the same manner a cavalry soldier is ordinarily supposed to cost about £   ayear let the horse be assumed to last on an average six years and let the question be of the effect of adding £ 0 to the purchasemoney of the horse the additional cost of purchasing and from time to time replacing such a horse may with allowance for the interest of money as before be rated as equal to a continual payment of £  per annum hence    horse soldiers mounted in the improved manner may be maintained for the same expense as    of the other or by striking off six or eight men and horses per squadron the regiments of new cavalry will cost no more than the old the question therefore will be whether for certain services such squadrons will not be more effective than squadrons of the common kind with six or eight men and horses more in each or whether the efficiency of the new squadrons with equal numbers will not be increased in a greater proportion than that of    to    on the same principle if it was proposed to give the rifle to a portion of the mounted troops the comparative expense would only be in the proportion of seventysix to seventyfive these considerations throw light on the expensiveness of anything that is inferior in a permanent or stipendiary force in the arming of the radical force the economy of using the improved instrument is not so demonstrable nor so reducible to practical effect if every man of military age in the united states of america can be induced or obliged by law to arm himself with a musket of the cost of £  it does not follow that it would be feasible or proper to direct him to arm himself with a rifle of the cost of £ 0 but still the advantage derivable from the weapon in the proportion of    to   is capable more especially in a time of public alarm of being held out as an effectual inducement to a great number of individuals to arm themselves voluntarily in the improved manner chapter xi ministers severally section i election

which must remain inviolate the arrangement which has presented itself in this view is the leaving the universal liberty of initiation untouched adding to it at the same time an arrangement which shall secure its passing through the hands of a responsible functionary by whom the matter remaining as little changed as possible it shall on every occasion be moulded into a form such as shall make it quadrate with the form already given to the entire mass to which it is aggregated if the fiat of this functionary were in every case indispensable he would be a monarch with a veto in his hand power must therefore be reserved to and by the legislature to preserve its acts in every instance from the operation of this check to wit on the declaration made by the use of the word urgency already in such extensive and frequent use ratiocinative art    no sooner is the word urgency heard than the public eye fixes itself of course upon the measure and the individual by whom it has been brought upon the carpet the indication of an irreparable evil as about to take place in the event of the usual delay will be universally looked to as a condition precedent to the justifiable use of this important word the sort of laws to which the use of it will under these circumstances be naturally confined     are those which are of a temporary nature and which within the limits of the usual delay will either have been productive of the full effect desired or have received their adequately mature form in passing through the ordinary official channel instructional art    let a case be supposed in which the disposable time of a single legislation minister will not suffice for the quantity of business thus brought before him by the universally applied institution of deputes in the number found requisite any such deficiency is already obviated ratiocinative art    objections i delay in the practice of all other governments in which the business of legislation is in the hands of a legislative body delay is a subject of wellgrounded complaint and to the causes of delay which have place in those cases this arrangement adds a new one ii no one mans time sufficient a greater number would be requisite and the greater the number the greater the room for want of symmetry as between the mode of drawing practised by one man and the mode practised by another iii monopoly as a draft cannot be taken into consideration without having passed through the hands of the legislation minister—by his retaining it through indolence negligence or design the patience of the proposing member may be wearied out and as per ch vi legislature section    term of service the session will not last longer than a year the measure may thus be kept in suspense till the session being at an end the proposer is no longer in a situation to go on with it ratiocinative art    in such sort are these objections connected that in relation to them one and the same set of answers may serve i under no existing government has the legislative body as yet been in the habit of sitting during so large a part of the year as the half under this code it never ceases to sit see ch vi legislature section    members attendance section  0 attendance and remuneration how connected ii as a standard of reference and at the same time as a model for imitation before the eyes of persons in general and all members of the legislature in particular will at all times have been the pannomion in whatever state the proposed amendment finds it familiar the matter not less familiar to them will have been the method and the expression amongst its objects or say ends in view it will have had the giving to it such properties by which the facility of adapting amendments to it in symmetrical form will be maximized iii in all but a comparatively small part of the business of the legislative body the legislation minister will have been anticipated in his operations by a precursor belonging to one or other of two sets of functionaries these are—   the several ministers employed as in so far as a demand for the performance of the legislative service has place they will be in proposing and with the consent of the legislature carrying into effect the several fresh enactments to the extent of this part of the business reference to and report from the legislation minister will unless objection be made by motion follow and thus these operations will not both together consume any sensible portion of time exemplification and proof in the english house of commons the practice in regard to the first second and third readings of a bill in its passage to the character of a law of the twelve other ministers each will have been continually occupied in giving the adaptation requisite to the proposed ordinances drawn for the purpose of the business belonging to his own subdepartment and the process of adaptation being in all cases the same process and they having each of them deputes and subordinates whose assistance will at all times be at his command no deficiency in respect of appropriate and adequate skill can on their parts in so far as depends upon practice be reasonably to be apprehended in particular in the case of the finance minister—with whom in so far as money is concerned the several other ministers will have to act in concert as to which see the several sections in which their functions are respectively enumerated the degree of his familiarity with the business of adaptation will be to theirs respectively as twelve to one   in the case of a proposed ordinance proposed by and from the continuation committee as per ch vi legislature section    continuation committee the person by whom it is proposed will be the functionary who on the occasion in question acts as the organ of that same committee by the supposition he will have had more than one years practice in the business of giving to proposed ordinances the required adaptation and symmetry and to the number of years during which he will have been habituated to this practice there will be no positive limits remains as the only sort of case that can present any probability of a demand for the application of labour of any continuance on the part of the legislation minister—the case where a member not having fallen into connexion with either the appropriate minister or the continuation committee has this or that new arrangement which with his name attached to it he is desirous of laying before the legislature in this case if in his own eyes he is sufficiently qualified for the performance of the adaptative process he will perform it accordingly and in this case likewise     the quantity of time occupied by the exercise given to the legislation ministers function will most commonly be next to nothing supposing a member to such a degree new to legislative business that even in his own eyes he is not sufficiently qualified—scarcely can he be at any difficulty as to the obtaining the requisite assistance by no man with any tolerable prospect of success can a new measure be brought forward without his having as he believes secured the eventual support of fellowmembers in some proportion or other in the shape of speech and argumentation on that side altogether unlimited is the number of those from whom assistance will in this shape be derivable assistance as above being obtained or regarded by him as needless nothing is there to hinder him from applying in private to the legislation minister for his revisal antecedently to the presentation of the drafts to the assembly and with or without corrections supposing the former regarded as apt by the minister the time occupied in the conjunct business of reference and report will as above be next to nothing instructional art    note here that the use and usefulness of this function will consist—not so much in what is done by the legislation minister and his deputies in relation to the process of adaptation as in what under the apprehension of seeing the defects in their drafts laid open to his view and through his to the assemblys will be done towards this end by everybody else instructional art    the office of the legislation minister will thus by the very nature of the case become though without the name and show of a school a school of legislation into this school young men destined for public employment might be admitted at about the same age as in england france and other countries they are admitted into the office for the purpose of being instructed in the business of an attorneyatlaw nor notwithstanding the allcomprehensiveness of its extent would the subjectmatter of the public business the whole of it being continually before their eyes and every part of it continually referred to be by a great deal so difficult of comprehension as the matter which in england at least an attorney finds himself under the obligation of making himself acquainted with his practice being for its success in so high a degree dependent on the degree of his acquaintance with that immense and shapeless mass instructional ratiocinative art    these same conditions will apply of course to all similar communications made or sought to be made to any of the sublegislative bodies acting within their several fields of service instructional ratiocinative art    so many legislative bodies so many schools of legislation accessible to all who by selfregarding interest or public spirit shall at any time feel themselves prompted to seek entrance instructional art  0 note that in the ordinary mode in the case in which the change is made in any other way than by simple repeal or by simple addition no such certainty is afforded in so far as substitution is intended the effect produced on the old matter by the new is left questionable and open to argument and pages in any number are employed to do that which after all is perhaps not done but which might have been effectually done by a line or even by a word exemplificational art    in english practice in relation to statute law an instance has been observed in which the amount of a page is employed in doing what as therein expressly declared would have been done by the substitution of the word or to the word and enactive ratiocinative art    to the legislation minister as per art    it belongs to receive from the judiciary department proposed amendments as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 judges eventuallyemendative function for the conservation of the aptitude of the law in respect of form thus is the same security given in this case as in that in which proposed laws are as above introduced by members motions expositive art    in the case of each judicialamendment report the day on which it is received will be termed its receptionday after the lapse of seven entire days if in the meantime no appropriate evidence of disapprobation has been received by the legislation minister either from the legislature or from any of the judiciary authorities as per ch xii judiciary collectively in this behalf mentioned the amendment thus submitted will by consent given by acquiescence be deemed to have received the sanction of the legislature whereupon if in readyadapted and symmetrical form expressed to wit in either of the two modes the corrective or the reeditive as per ch vi legislature section    members motions the legislation minister will in its appropriate place aggregate it to the body of the laws enactive art    to the printed impression of every amendment thus aggregated the legislation     minister will cause to be added at the bottom of the page in form of a note indication as concise as may be of the names personal and official of the several judiciary functionaries as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 eventuallyemendative function through whose hands it has passed and of the parts in relation thereunto respectively taken by them enactive art    under the care of the legislation minister every day in the government newspaper will be published a list of all such dulyproposed amendments as shall have been received at his office on the day last preceding enactive art    in each such list in relation to each such proposed amendment indications will be given under the heads following— i portion or portions of the existing pannomion on which it is regarded as bearing making reference to the code chapter section and article ii person or persons from whom it was received at the legislation ministers office iii person or persons by whom it was received iv day on which it was so received enactive art    every year within  days after the last day of the last preceding year or if need be oftener the legislation minister will publish his periodical amendment calendar contents of it—notices of the several amendments submitted in the course of the year distinguishing between those proposed by motion in the legislative assembly and those submitted from the judiciary and in both cases between those which have been adopted and those which have been rejected i amendments adopted in pursuance of motions by members adding the names of the mover and seconder and of the other supporters of it if any and of the opponents if any also notice of the days when adopted ii amendments submitted by judges and adopted with the names personal and official of the proposers and the several other judicial functionaries through whose hands as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 eventuallyemendative function arts     they have respectively passed also like notice as to the days and of the approvals acquiescences or disapprovals they have experienced as per ch xii section  0 eventuallyemendative function iii amendments submitted as above and rejected with like indications as above iv amendments which having been received in a symmetrical as well as readyadapted form from members of the legislature ministers or persons at large have on motion made by members been adopted adding names of proposers as well as members and days of adoption as above v amendments which having been received in a readyadapted and symmetrical form but not moved by members have dropt with names of the proposers except in so far as the contrary has been desired by them vi amendments which not having been in readyadapted or else not in symmetrical form have on that account by whomsoever proposed dropt also with names of proposers as above enactive ratiocinative art    when of the pannomion or of any of the codes belonging to it an edition is about to be exhausted—to the care of the legislation minister under the direction of the legislature it will belong as per art    in what parts soever the corrective mode of amendment has been employed to substitute to it the reeditive in every reedition the names as per art    will be preserved to the end that to the people at large it may at all times be known in what manner as to the several matters in question these their several trustees have executed their trusts instructional ratiocinative art    grounds for the expectation that the provision hereby made for the keeping the pannomion clear of unsymmetrical matter and thereby for the conservation of its aptitude in respect of form will be effective— i the option being left to every person to submit his proposed law in the symmetrical form no person can be at a loss to frame his proposed law either in the corrective or reeditive mode for so simple is the form of applying an amendment to an already existing regulation or assemblage of regulations that it varies not from that the observance of which in every community in the management of whose affairs the people at large have any share is habitual ii scarcely in any existing code is there any want of ordinances to such a degree comprehensive as that by any new ones introduced an alteration will in some way or other be produced in the efficiency of some one or more of them for suppose for example an ordinance in these words—whatsover act is not expressly prohibited by some article in this code every person is at liberty to perform so long as an enactment to this effect continues in force no prohibitive law can be passed without bearing relation to this law and applying limitation to the efficiency of it iii in the present code more than ordinary care is taken to secure to the assemblage of ordinances contained in it this all comprehensive quality so therefore will there be in every other code enacted in conformity to it iv it being by the supposition as per art    made the duty of the legislation minister to examine in this view every proposed law on its being proposed scarcely can it be supposed     that he will not sooner or later see on what clause or clauses of the pannomion in its then existing state the several clauses in the proposed law bear in such manner as to alter the effect of them or that in penning amendments he can be at any loss how to keep his language conformable to that which he finds therein employed v he cannot apply his mind to the adaptation of an amendment to any one clause therein without feeling the necessity of applying it at the same time to the looking out for all such other clauses on which it bears as above vi by the knowledge that his draft will thus undergo the scrutiny of the official functionary every person who has to draw up a proposed law will naturally be engaged to give to it to the best of his power the requisite symmetry lest for want of it the progress of such his proposed law should receive obstruction and his own deficiency in respect of appropriate aptitude be at the same time brought to view vii all along in compliance with the provisions in ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 judges eventuallyemendative function amendmentproposing reports will becoming in from the judiciary department and notices of them immediately published in the government newspaper as per art    viii so also will the like demand be producing the like supply by means of the local ordinances emanating as per ch xxx from the several sublegislatures thus on every occasion will the eyes of all persons concerned be directed to the care of securing to the matter of the pannomion with the addition of any such improvements as it may lie open to whatsoever degree of symmetry it was originally invested with instructional exemplificational art  0 of matters which though properly belonging to the judiciary department are in english practice exclusively and constantly taken cognizance of by the legislative department—every code framed in conformity to this present code will be kept clear by appropriate arrangements examples are the following—   laws applying remedy by divorce in individual cases of adultery   laws for authorizing change of property from one shape into another on the occasion of family settlements   laws for the division of common lands instructional art    of matters properly belonging to the local sublegislatures that part of the pannomion which contains the matter coextensive with the whole territory of the state will in like manner be rendered and kept clear exemplificational art    in a monarchy for the allcomprehensive and glaring evils attached to the arrangement which gives to the monarch the exclusive initiative in legislation the obvious but sole howsoever inadequate compensation is the exclusion thereby put upon the confusion resulting from the possession of it by every member in a legislative body to the evils attached to this exclusive initiative an obvious palliative is the allowing to the body if one and to each of the two bodies if two of the legislature faculty of making known in general terms the substance of any proposed law or mass of law which it is its desire to see receive the effect of law to allow this faculty to the body is to allow to individuals and if no exception be made to every individual that introductory faculty without which the principal faculty cannot be exercised to wit the right of motionmaking to the effect of proposing in substance and thence even in terms whatever it be the wishedfor law supposing the people to possess by any means a certain degree of influence in the legislative body—a result not altogether incapable of being sooner or later brought about under such a form of government is a state of things preferable to that in which the liberty of giving introduction to a proposed law is possessed alike by every member examples of a state of things in which something like this effect has been brought about are not altogether wanting in a mixed monarchy and a representative democracy the obvious and for some time unavoidable result of the equal and unlimited faculty of initiation in the hands of every member is that chaotic state of the body of the law which under both these forms of government has hitherto been everywhere visible of this chaos the most eminently conspicuous exemplification is that which is presented by the body of english statute law with this liberty unrestrained supposing the whole rule of action real and fictitious law taken together reduced within that moderate compass within which it is not altogether incapable of being reduced—still sooner or later the liberty in question if no restraint were put upon it would suffice for the production of a fresh chaos section iii army minister enactive art   to the army minister under the legislature and the prime minister it belongs to give at all times execution and effect to the matter of the army code and to the temporary orders from time to time emaning from the prime minister enactive art   in regard to the professional army to

transformative and eliminative functions as to persons and things the inspective as to persons things and occurrences thereto belonging the statistic recordative publicative and officiallyinformative as to states of things ordinances and arrangements the meliorationsuggestive enactive art   so in particular the instructive function as exercised by directions given in relation to the military exercise whether singly performed or in bodies enactive art   in regard to the nonprofessional army it belongs to him to exercise at all times the inspective statistic recordative and meliorationsuggesting functions and incidentally the locative suppletive directive instructive dislocative procurative custoditive applicative reparative and eliminative functions according to the arrangements made from time to time by the legislature as between the prime minister and the sublegislature instructional exemplificational art   examples of the things which are the subjects of these functions are the following— i things moveable   arms used without fire as swords and pikes   small firearms portable by men as muskets and pistols with accoutrements and ammunition   firearms portable by beasts only as horse artillery   large firearms not portable but only drawable as cannon and mortars with their carriages and ammunition   provisions   clothing   horses and other beasts ridden or drawing ii receptacles moveable     baggage wagons     pontoons for crossing rivers and other waters iii receptacles immoveable  0   barracks for lodgment of troops      army hospitals      storehouses      fortifications section iv navy minister enactive art   to the navy minister under the legislature and the prime minister it belongs to give at all times execution and effect to the matter of the navy code and to temporary orders from time to time in relation to navy business emaning from the prime minister enactive art   to this purpose in regard to the stipendiary branch of the sea defensive force armed or unarmed under the direction of the prime minister it belongs to him to exercise as to all persons in so far as employed under him in navy business the locative suppletive directive and dislocative functions as to his own office the selfsuppletive as to things moveable in so far as thus employed but in concert with the finance minister the procurative custoditive applicative reparative transformative and eliminative functions as to persons and things the inspective so as to persons things and occurrences the statistic recordative publicative and officiallyinformative as to states of things ordinances and arrangements the meliorationsuggestive exemplificational art   examples of things which are the subjects of these functions are the following— i things moveable   arms provisions and clothing as per section   art     navigable vessels of all sorts and sizes   naval stores for the equipment of do ii things immoveable     slips for the building of navigable vessels     docks for reparation and outfitting of do after return from service     jetties for giving facility to the approach of large vessels for reparation or outfit     harbours with quays moles breakwaters and all other appurtenances thereto belonging     arsenals     dockyards  0   storehouses      beacons      buoys enactive art   in regard to navigable vessels belonging to individuals or bodies of individuals he exercises the inspective statistic recordative and meliorationsuggestive functions exercising the inspective statistic and recordative functions under any such heads as shall from time to time have been prescribed by the legislature ratiocinative instructional art   in two cases the aggregate of the maritime stock in the hands of individuals is a fund or source applicable in augmentation of the aggregate stock in the hands of the government for the use of the public   on any occasion by free consent on the parts of all parties interested       in case of military necessity even without consent on the part of any party interested section v preventive service minister enactive art   to the preventive service minister it belongs to give under the prime minister execution and effect to all ordinances of the legislature in so far as they have for their object the prevention of calamity or of delinquency otherwise than by exercise of the functions belonging to the judiciary enactive art   to this purpose it belongs to him under the direction of the prime minister to exercise as to all persons in so far as employed in the preventive service the locative suppletive directive and dislocative functions as to his own office the selfsuppletive function as to things in so far as thus employed the procurative custoditive applicative reparative transformative and eliminative functions as to persons and things the inspective as to persons things and occurrences thereto belonging the statistic recordative publicative and officiallyinformative as to states of things ordinances and arrangements the meliorationsuggestive exemplificational art   examples of the principal calamities to which prevention is capable of being applied under the care of government are as follows   collapsion namely of the natural sort in large masses or of edifices in a ruinous state or by means of earthquakes   inundation   conflagration   disease and mortality the results of unhealthy and unmedicated situations   unhealthy employments the unhealthiness of which is capable of being removed or lessened by appropriate arrangements   contagious disease   dearth and famine exemplificational art   examples of arrangements for the prevention or mitigation of calamity in the above shapes are as follows   against collapsion—of earth in hilly or mountainous situations precautionary surveys of edifices particularly in towns precautionary surveys for reparation or demolition of ruinous ones also precautionary arrangements in the construction of new ones   against inundation—surveys of bridges dykes and embankments also arrangements for the draining of lands   against conflagration—precautionary construction of edifices precautionary fabrication custody and conveyance of gunpowder and other explodible substances precautionary stowage and custody of spontaneously combustible vegetable matters in warehouses the employment of precautionary operations and instruments in mines fire insurance associations   against suffocation in mines and manufactories—precautionary arrangements and monitions   against disease and mortality from putrid water naturally accumulated drainage from putrid water artificially accumulated drainage in enclosed tunnels   against disease and mortality from contagion—temporary prevention or restriction of intercourse of persons or goods with the persons receptacles or commodities known or suspected to be the seats of a contagious disease   against disease and mortality from the consumption of articles of food or drink in a state regarded as dangerous to health—arrangements for preventing the vent of them   against disease and mortality from medicinal and other drugs liable to produce the effect of poisons—precautionary restrictions on the vent of them as for example keeping them in cabinets under lock and key with the word poison written on them   against extraordinary scarcity of necessaries—precautionary supplies in so far as freedom of trade is inadequate to the purpose exemplificational art   examples of things belonging to the department of the preventive service minister are the following i things immoveable i against delinquency and calamity by fire   offices for police directors and their subordinates   police stationhouses   receptacles for fireengines ladders and fireescapes ii against inundation   dykes and dams iii against contagion   lazarettos iv against extraordinary scarcity   government magazines ii things moveable   vehicles   beasts of draught and saddle instructional art   in relation to the defensive force service and the preventive service the legislature will consider how far by a mixture of defensive force functionaries with preventive service functionaries the advantages of a stationary with those of a migratory body may be combined and the two branches of the official establishment rendered mutually subservient each to the purpose for which the other is principally instituted   0 instructional art   under the legislature this will be matter of special consideration for the prime minister he will accordingly if he sees reason unless inhibited by the legislature attach from time to time to the preventive service subjecting them for the time to the direction of the preventive service minister certain portions of the stipendiary defensive force land or sea force or both as occasion may require ratiocinative art   i advantages to the stipendiary defensive force more particularly the land force   those from the employmentextending principle as per ch x defensive force section   leading principles   those from the timeoccupying principle as per ch x section     appropriate acquaintance with the territory in a military point of view thence proportionable aptitude as to the purpose of defending it against an invading enemy in point of extent the value of this advantage would increase with the frequency of the migration nor would it proportionably decrease in respect of correctness and completeness within each portion of territory for sufficient for the military purpose would be a much smaller portion of the time of these military auxiliaries than would naturally be applied to the use of the preventive service ratiocinative art   ii advantages to the preventive service   those resulting from the natural preeminence of the military functionaries in respect of the qualities of vigilance punctuality of obedience promptitude of obedience activity simultaneity of obedience and intrepidity   those resulting from the additional security which such admixture will naturally give against sinister connexions between the functionaries and the internal adversaries against whom they are employed to combat of this security the degree and value in the case of each body would be inversely as the length of time during which it continued stationed in the same place ratiocinative art  0 there seems to be but one qualification in respect of which functionaries belonging to the defensive force service land and sea according to local circumstances included would not naturally possess more aptitude with relation to the preventive service than those would who are exclusively attached to this lastmentioned service and this is local knowledge including that of the characters family circumstances abodes and haunts of individual delinquents and persons most in danger of falling into delinquency but if of each military functionarys time one portion being employed in active service in this shape another were employed in the performance of the military exercises appropriate aptitude with relation to military service might thus be continued unimpaired as to the advantage derived from acquaintance with the characters family circumstances abodes and haunts of delinquents and persons liable to become delinquents a due admixture of the migratory with the stationary functionaries might afford this advantage and at the same time obviate the danger from sinister connexion exemplificational art    examples of subjectmatters of such local knowledge are—   statistic circumstances sites of the several habitations thence abodes of the respective householders with their inmates of both sexes and all ages of these particulars an adequate degree of notoriety would be necessitated and effected for the purposes of election service as per election code section  0   moral circumstances disposition of the several inhabitants as resulting from habitual sources of livelihood and other occupations   circumstances purely topographical condition of the territory in respect of plains hills and mountains—rivers lakes and seas—soil whether sandy clayey chalky gravelly rocky c and natural productions—ground woody or woodless of the knowledge of these lastmentioned particulars the use is the giving facility to the eventual accersition or say hithercalling of individuals whose attendance is required with or without such or such articles of his property for the purpose of evidence or justiciability and in case of need the prehension of the supposed delinquent or other defendant with the benefit of all these helps scarcely would any band of malefactors be formed whom the functionaries so employed would not know where to find together with the appropriate evidence requisite for their conviction ratiocinative art    a consideration that will not escape observation is—that as to seduction of functionaries by sinister connexion with delinquents the danger is considerably greater in the case of contrabandists than in the case of delinquents at large in the case of the contrabandist the mischief produced is not so obvious and conspicuous as in the case of most other sorts of malefactors the community is indeed injured but the community is an ideal and invisible being of too aërial a texture to be grasped by a mind of ordinary texture the fair trader injured is indeed a real and visible being but seldom is he determinate seldom is it known to what contrabandist any fair trader is indebted for the suffering which by this or that one of his operations the contrabandist     has produced the consequence is—that against the contrabandist no such antipathy points itself as against the robber the thief or even the obtainer by false pretences much less any such antipathy as has place in the case of the housebreaker or the assassin in whose instance homicide has been employed either for perpetration or for concealment of an enterprise of indiscriminating depredation section vi interiorcommunication minister enactive art   to the interiorcommunication minister it belongs to give under the prime minister execution and effect to all

needful over and above those which belong to the judicial department towards giving execution and effect to the laws made for the regulation of trade and from time to time to report to the prime minister and the legislature any such changes as to him shall have appeared requisite expositive instructional art   how questionable soever may be the usefulness of laws made for the direct purpose of giving factitious encouragement to trade either in the aggregate or in this or that particular branch in addition to the natural and aptly proportioned encouragement given by the effectual demand—need not only for regulations on the subject of trade but also for frequent changes in the matter of those regulations cannot fail to be produced by a variety of causes examples are as follows— i in the way of discouragement and virtual prohibition produced by taxation on the prices absolute and comparative of the subject matters on which the taxes are imposed whereby with or without any such design discouragement is applied to some and encouragement to others and thereby a need produced for effects of a respectively opposite tendency for the purpose of obviating and counteracting such effects ii effect produced on the money prices of commodities—things moveable and immoveable—by variations in the relative aggregate quantity of money of various sorts as compared with the aggregate quantity of commodities destined for sale iii prevention of frauds employed in the giving to things vendible apparent degrees of value over and above the real including cognizance of weights and measures—suggestion of arrangements with that view for the consideration of the legislature iv regulation of the temporary monopoly without which inventions in relation to the subject matters of trade could scarcely take place inasmuch as after having expended capital in the antecedently necessary experiments rivals by whom no such expenditure had been made might by underselling them derive to themselves the whole of the profit substituting loss to profit on the part of the inventors v application of attention to the means of maximizing the quantity of true and minimizing the quantity of false information of states of things and occurrences by the knowledge of which the aggregate of profit in trade is increased and that of loss diminished—as to which see ch ix ministers collectively section   statistic function expositive instructional art   intimate and constant is the connexion between the operations of the trade minister and those of the finance minister proportionably urgent and indispensable the need of converse between these two functionaries but while in the nature of the case the finance minister is incessantly in action in the exercise of the directive function in relation to his subordinates and of the transmissive function in regard to money in relation to his coordinates in obedience to the exercise made of the directive function by his     superordinates

have been received namely by government subheads   the several sources from whence they should have been received   and the times at which they ought respectively to have been paid in   with indications of the causes of the failure definitive or temporary as the case may be   money which should have been paid namely by government subheads   the several persons or classes of persons to whom it should have been paid   the several branches of service on account of which it ought to have been paid and   the times at which it ought to have been paid   with indications of the reasons or causes why in each instance it was not paid   to confront with the foregoing the like statements carried back to the last preceding year as also to other preceding years in so far as to any assignable purpose useful as well as practicable   for this purpose in so far as in the accounts of this or that preceding year the heads under which the matters are arranged are not the same as those under which the matters of the current year are arranged—they are brought into coincidence as far as practicable instructional exemplificational art   iii prospective or estimate branch of the heads and subheads examples are as follows—   demands expected heads and subheads as far as circumstances admit the same as those of the expenditure in the retrospective part under each such subhead the sums belonging to it in the two different years placed side by side   fresh demands expected that is to say demands for heads of services for which there had not been in the current year any expenditure heads the department and subdepartments subheads the several services designative in each instance of the cause of the fresh demand   the like carried on through any number of successive years in so

under the receipts the sums belonging to the first year side by side as above of the differences whether on the side of increase or decrease the causes indicated   extinct sources with their

year within  days after the commencement of the new legislative year he delivers in his supplemental report in which the series of the several matters is carried on to the last day of the expired year inclusive inserting any such observations as in his view may be instructive expositive art   in relation to money the functions that may have place are the following the latin word for money being for distinctions sake prefixed to the name of each respective function     ærefabricative or moneymaking     ærereceptive or moneyreceiving     ærecustoditive or moneykeeping     ærepostulative or moneyrequiring     æreapplicative or moneyapplying expositive art  0 application of money as contradistinguished from custody is performed by emission to wit from hand to hand which may be with or without the intervention of middle hands according to distance or otherwise expositive art    emission of money may have place either in payment of a debt due or without any debt due in the former case it is solvitive in the other case—if for an equivalent procurative if not for an equivalent donative enactive art    the ærefabricative or moneymaking function is under the sole direction of the finance minister expositive instructional art    money is either intrinsically valuable or vicariously valuable vicariously valuable becomes equivalent to intrinsically valuable by the habit and confidence of obtaining property intrinsically valuable in exchange for that which is but vicariously valuable in so far as intrinsically valuable foreign money is exchangeable as well as homefabricated enactive art    under the direction of the legislature and the prime minister it will be among the duties of the finance minister to prevent functionaries in whose hands public money is lodged from deriving any private benefit from it at the expense of the public service instructional art    from misapplication of it thus made detriment may accrue to the public service in either of two ways to wit—   by the eventual loss of the principal in consequence of insolvency on the part of the custodient functionary   by retardation or frastration of the service for the purpose of which it is destined to be emitted out of his hands instructional ratiocinative art    if without preponderant evil in the shape of risk of loss profit can be made by the private custodient in the way of interest so may it by the public instructional art    in relation to the quantity of money of all sorts the legislature will on each occasion consider whether it is its desire that that same quantity should receive increase or not if not it will so order matters that for every sum put into circulation in the shape of vicariously valuable money an equal sum that would otherwise have been in circulation in the shape of intrinsically valuable money shall be kept out of circulation instructional ratiocinative art    in this case by the substitution two distinguishable advantages may be obtained   one is the saving upon the expense of conveyance   the other is the superior security against spurious fabrication but for this purpose it is material if not necessary that the value assigned to the several pieces separately taken should be greater than that of any piece of intrinsically valuable money and the greater the value the greater the advantage in this shape for the greater the value the fewer the hands it will have to pass through and the easier it will be to trace it from hand to hand instructional ratiocinative art    in this way but only upon these terms advantage might be derived and that very considerable to the public from the use of paper money even supposing the nation not to stand charged with any public debt expositive art  0 the velocity of circulation is as the number of times that a piece of money of a given amount passes from hand to hand for an equivalent in the ordinary way of trade within a given space of time—say a year instructional ratiocinative art    the aggregate quantity and the aggregate velocity being given it matters not in regard to prices in what shape the money has been existing whether in that of intrinsically valuable money or that of paper money i e promises of intrinsically valuable money performable to bearer on demand or similar   0 promises at so many days after date or after sight instructional art    modes of payment of which the finance minister may have to make choice are the following—   paying to each creditor a part of his due postponing the remainder with interest to a time mentioned nonpayment of interest is insolvency to the amount so in truth nonpayment of interest with mercantile profit to mercantile men instructional art      establishing an order of priority as between creditors of different descriptions on determinate and adequately notified grounds ratiocinative art    in the first mode the injustice is least to nonmercantile men who can borrow without humiliation none to mercantile men more or less according to their means of profit but no more than they ought to keep themselves prepared for as in dealing with individuals ratiocinative art    great in the second mode is the danger of injustice in the choice of favoured classes two interests require to be considered   public   individual sole class in whose favour public interest requires favour is that of war functionaries in war time actual or impending the evil by deficiency as to them may involve loss of property and all other objects of desire to an unlimited extent as to other classes one exception excepted the evil is comparatively inconsiderable ratiocinative art    excepted class—the lowest paid in all departments and branches examples—   in army navy and preventive service—privates   in the other subdepartments the merely writing functionaries in preference to all specially instructed superordinates   in branches in which all are specially instructed those under direction in preference to their directors ratiocinative art    reason the higher a mans place in the conjunct scales of money power and respectedness the greater in general are his means of supplying temporary pecuniary deficiency from the amity of those connected with him by ties of interest selfregarding or sympathetic instructional ratiocinative art    the operation of paying money shall it be performed by the same person by whom the subjectmatters obtained by it are employed or by a different person answer by a different person better that money should not than that it should be at the disposal of the minister for the service of whose department it is needed better that in each given place all payments be made by an appropriate officer say the paymaster reasons i frugality promoted by saving in the pay of functionaries   the operation of paying money indispensably consumes a more or less considerable quantity of time according to the nature of the money whether in pieces of larger or in pieces of smaller value   the operation of paying money requires no particular talent natural or acquired the operation of giving employment to the subjectmatters obtained by the money will in many perhaps in most cases require talent natural or acquired or both   for engaging the service of a man possessing appropriate talent more pay at the expense of government will commonly be necessary than for the engaging the service of a man not possessing any such appropriate talent for every purpose which while an untalented man could have been employed a talented man is employed waste will therefore be committed to the amount of that sum by which the talented mans pay exceeds that of the untalented instructional ratiocinative art    ii frugality promoted to wit by saving in quantity of time employed and paid for   if by the hand of the functionary for whose use the subjectmatter is wanted the payment of the money in exchange for which it is wanted were to be performed the appropriate business of this talented functionary would be experiencing continual interruption by his passing alternately from the exercise of the appropriate function to the exercise of the moneypaying function for much less time than is necessary for the examining and counting of the money is sufficient for the signing of an instrument or document warranting and ordering the payment of it this reason applies even supposing talented pay were no greater than untalented pay instructional ratiocinative art  0 iii frugality promoted to wit by additional security against peculation and embezzlement   suppose one person only occupied both in procuring the article and paying for it one person alone would be answerable for the propriety of the payment and one person     alone to wit that same person answerable for the fact of its being paid for the public service employ in the business the two persons in question they serve each of them as a check upon the other the orderer by the order acknowledges and witnesses that he has received the subjectmatter for which it is issued the payer must have this same order as evidence that it is not without just cause and sufficient warrant in respect of service rendered to the public that the money is paid by him an instrument of receipt might suffice to show that the money is paid and to whom paid but it could not in general suffice to show that it is on account of the public service that it is paid in either office should the document relative to the transaction be lost that belonging to the other may serve as a memorial of it instructional ratiocinative art    receivers and payers of public money shall they be the same persons or different answer the same so far as they can be reasons case i that of the central place

promoted by saving in fragments of functionaries time unemployed example in the event of two offices the quantity of time habitually needed for the business requires say more than four functionaries time but not so much as five yet must five be paid the time needed in each above that of four is thus half the time of a fifth keep the establishments apart the number of functionaries you must pay is ten consolidate them and the number of functionaries sufficient is nine instructional ratiocinative art    case ii that of a town at a distance from the metropolis the advantages are         as above

then to the office if on the pay or disbursement side then from the office instructional ratiocinative art    taxes which should be interdicted are—   taxes on the means of political information in particular on newspapers by these the justice of the publicopinion tribunal is perverted and its force lessened so likewise by the suppression of evidence or of the diffusion of it injustice in all shapes is promoted   taxes whether under the name of stamps or fees of court on judiciary proceedings involving prohibition of justice—encouragement to injustice   taxes on medicines by these bodily pain is inflicted or even life taken from all who cannot afford to pay the tax it is a tax on indigence a prohibition aggravating the hardships of the indigent   taxes on insurance against calamity by these efficient providence is lessened and thence the number involved in the calamities in question increased instructional ratiocinative art    purchase of instruments of amusement for the rich with money raised by taxes on rich and poor is depredation depredation committed on the poor for the profit of the rich magnificence exhibited by a person at his own expense is magnificence exhibited at the expense of others it is depredation exemplificational art    examples of depredation in this shape are the following the purchasemoney being all along understood to be that produced by the taxes or which might have been employed in easement of the taxes   edifices although for the use of the public in so far as rendered costly by ornament   pictures statues and other productions of the imitative arts   books valuable no otherwise than for their rarity   antiquities   miscellaneous artificial curiosities the minds of the rich should not any more than the bodies be feasted at the expense of the poor instructional art    examples of objects which ought not to be confounded in this view with the above though frequently found in the same collection   anatomical preparations

their respective powers and the detriment which the public service may thence be liable to experience it will be the care of the prime minister by executive or eventually emendative subordinances with reasons annexed to draw such apt lines of demarcation as the nature of the case admits of and the general good of the service may from time to time require enactive art   so where the tenor of this code or the nature of the case requires that the subministers of two or more subdepartments should act on the same subject in concert to take care that through want of agreement no detriment to the service in the way of retardation or otherwise shall ensue expositive instructional art   the case in which such conflict is more particularly liable to have place is that in which for the purposes of their several branches of service different subministers may in their respective departments have need of the service of the same person or the same individual thing at the same time in this case the preference will require to be given to that particular branch of service through which for want of the services of the persons or the use of the thing at the time in question the detriment to the aggregate interest of the community would be the greatest instructional ratiocinative art   evil from foreign adversaries being in respect of extent naturally the greatest hence in time of war or imminent danger of war the claim of the army and navy services will in general require the preference in comparison of all others instructional ratiocinative art   next to this the preventive service having as it has for its object the prevention of evil from internal adversaries as well as from purely physical calamities instructional ratiocinative art   next to this the interiorcommunication

will naturally yield to that of any other is the domain service the domain of the state not being of any use except in so far as the subject matter of it may permanently or incidentally be applied to use in a manner beneficial to one or more of those several other branches of the public service ratiocinative art   note that on each occasion for determining the preference the proper object of consideration is not the general comparative importance of the two branches of service in question but the comparative detriment likely to ensue to the universal interest on that particular occasion for want of the service of the person or the use of the things in question whatsoever may be the branch of service on account of which the demand has place exemplificational art   examples—   for the army service for commencing completing or repairing a fortification dismantle not a public building though it be but ornamental if from other sources materials can be had at little more expense   so for navy service cut not down trees serving for protecting lands or edifices against pernicious winds nor even those serving for recreation or ornament instructional art  0 it would be no small convenience if the office of the prime minister and the offices belonging to the several subdepartments were all under the same roof in this case if the situation of the prime ministers office were central the others forming a ring around it a set of conversation tubes would enable the prime minister to confer with each and each with any other without rising out of their chairs he who writes this held conversation once and without any strain of voice through a tube of nearer four hundred than three hundred feet in length the experiment was instituted by him with a view to a purpose such as this instructional art    the office of the justice minister should rather be remote from than contiguous to the abovementioned cluster of offices between the administrative department and the judiciary the less the communication the better see as to this ch ix ministers collectively section    architectural arrangements note to ch xi on the subject of a religious establishment to be paid for at the public expense for the business of religion there is no department there is no minister of no opinion     on the subject of religion does this constitution take any cognizance it allows not of reward in any shape for the professing or advocating of any particular opinion on the subject of religion it allows not of punishment in any shape for the professing or advocating of any particular opinion on the subject of religion it leaves to each individual after hearing any such arguments as he chooses to hear to decide for himself on each occasion what opinion has the truth on its side no declarations are required averring exclusive and detailed knowledge of things essentially unknowable and in relation to which differences are notoriously universal and interminable in england true political knowledge is the tree of good and evil academical death the penalty for touching the fruit of it manifestation of all such knowledge as derived from the free application of the greatesthappiness principle to politics religion and morals is the abhorred and dreaded evil to the exclusion of which all attention and all exertions are directed for this purpose a secondary endeavour is to keep the time of the aggregate of the juvenile population at the universities of oxford and cambridge divided between comparatively useless study and idleness idleness although debauchery be the accompaniment of it study so it be directed to the comparatively useless—in a word to any but the abovementioned preeminently useful objects—has naturally the preference reason obvious—that by the display of difficulty overcome the reputation of the place and the system may be preserved from decline but to the spectacle of proficiency made in the forbidden branch of knowledge that of debauchery as a less evil will as naturally be preferred to one or other of the two desired classes every student according to his turn of mind is thus aggregated the strongminded to the uselessly learned class the weakminded to the class composed of the stupid the simply idle and the debauched from all participation in the fund to the amount of millions ayear allotted to the purchase of insincerity who was ever excluded by habitual drunkenness who is there that would not be excluded by heterodoxy and what is heterodoxy but nonconformity to the opinions the profession of which is under every monarchical government commanded and which under all those same governments are at the same time more or less different the assumption is that at the word of command opinions can turn to the right and left like legs and arms the grand use of what is established under the name of religion is to secure insincerity to secure untrue assent and to exclude all opposition to opinions howsoever absurd to establish religion is to establish insincerity to establish insincerity is to establish that vice by which not only vice in every minor shape is served and promoted but vice swollen into the shape of criminality nothing can be more uncontrovertible than this axiom—he who by application made of punishment or reward discountenances inquiry into the truth of any opinion declares thereby his persuasion or at the least his strong suspicion of the falsity of it and if by him so simply discountenancing inquiry this persuasion is declared much more by him by whom the creative power of reward is applied to profession made of it still more by him by whom the repressing and extinguishing power of punishment is applied to opposition made to it no opinion is there so erroneous that will not be embraced if for the embracing of it reward is held out nowhere is anything under the name of religion established in the angloamerican united states and where with such extensively prevalent sincerity is religion professed as in those same so happily united states in which of them all is it employed as a state engine in what other political state is it so zealously employed as a support to morality—and in what other state is it a more powerful one on the continent of europe the restraints upon the study of the most important parts of useful knowledge being the immediate work of supreme power are more extensively notorious means employed not only withholding of reward but application of punishment nor yet is the public appropriate examination system undervalued there or unemployed in medicine rulers see the art and science from which they have most to hope and least to fear accordingly in that part of the field of art and science no obstacle being opposed—examination to a more or less considerable degree public is generally in use unhappily for that liberty without which knowledge is not possible medical science cannot be cultivated without close and continual scrutiny into the relation between cause and effect in london in a recent instance certain enemies of liberty and knowledge beheld in the result of a scrutiny of this sort a proof of the truth of atheism the ruin of the author became thereupon the object of their confederated but not successful endeavours direct profession of atheism is profession of atheism and nothing worse endeavour to crush a man for the profession of atheism is virtual confession of atheism coupled with the practice of insincerity and intolerance in proportion to every mans love of humankind and of those virtues on which its felicity depends insincerity and intolerance of difference in opinion whatever be the subject will ever be odious     chapter xii judiciary collectively preliminary observations astonishment and indignation are the sentiments which the perusal of this chapter not to mention preceding and succeeding ones can scarce fail to excite in the breast of every reader who in any country is either in possession or expectation of a situation on any judgmentseat to a certain degree elevated the effect is certain the cause altogether simple in this part of the present code the end in view is the greatest happiness of the greatest number considered in the character of justiciables as in the french language they are so aptly expressed and may henceforward in the english of every code as yet in existence the draughtsman has been some lawyer acting under the conjunct influence of rulers at large and some lawyer or lawyers of the highest grade the persons whose greatest happiness it has of course had in view and to whose greatest happiness the happiness of all other persons has to the utmost possible extent been made a sacrifice have been the persons under whose influence the draught has been penned a remark which will with equal certainty be at the same time made is—that no person possessed of adequate appropriate aptitude or rather forasmuch as that expression will be too precise no person of honour would give his acceptance to an office loaded with such burthens the answer is that for far inferior benefits obligations far more burthensome are by persons in great numbers everywhere not only submitted to but eagerly coveted and aimed at and if moral aptitude be taken into account the least apt would be higher in the scale than the highest of those by whom the situation has commonly been everywhere filled of appropriate aptitude with relation to the business of these several offices which will be the most strongly probative evidence acceptance of the office on these terms or strutting demeanour by looks and boasting phrases declaratory of the indignation pretended to be felt at the thought of a mans being capable of giving acceptance to it on such terms of utter inaptitude with relation to the functions of it what more conclusive evidence can be afforded than the determination not to accept of it upon these terms in england the enormity of the masses of emolument received by hireling advocates from the practice of their immoral profession is held up to view with triumph as an adequate and irrecusable reason for correspondent enormity in the emoluments attached to the office of judge of highest and next to highest grade for this excess though no adequate reason there is still a plausible one the incomprehensibility of the law and the presumption that by the advocate who has had most practice the largest stock not only of appropriate knowledge but of appropriate judgment will be possessed in the present code the grand demand for appropriate knowledge on the part of judges will be done away by the substitution of proposed real law to the at present accepted fictitious law that which mankind may stand perfectly assured of is—that under the present code of real law as under every other by the functionary in the several classes and grades his own interest in every shape and in particular in the shape of ease will be pursued to the utmost of his power whatsoever becomes of that of the greatest number of the proposed code in this as in every other part the object is accordingly so to order matters that in the pursuit of his own interest in those several shapes at the expense of the greatest number the difficulty he experiences may be maximized and the facility given for the effectual obstruction of all such endeavours be minimized if for the accommodation of a single individual matters should be so arranged as that there should not be a moment of time during the whole of his life without his having persons in any number in attendance upon him—in an arrangement of this sort supposing the individual capable of affording the expense scarcely would any person see anything extraordinary—anything to disapprove yet for the benefit of all—of the myriads or the millions a few exceptions excepted and those narrow and recent ones afforded by what is called police in no code of law has any such arrangement been made for the accommodation of individuals service in all imaginable shapes is to be had on all days and at all hours and for ordinary remuneration other individuals there are each of whom is on all days and at all hours ready and glad to render it witness all those whose business it is to supply diet medicine and conveyance from what cause this difference from what but the utter falsity of all those professions of regard for the happiness of subjects of which rulers have in all governments been so lavish professions the utterance of which has been so confident and the contradiction so uniformly true and therefore so intolerable as to the judicial establishment so intimate is its connexion with the system of procedure that in any explanation given of the former it is not possible to avoid bringing into view to an extent more or less considerable the intended purport of the latter having for its superordinate end the maximization of the security afforded by the services of the functionaries belonging to the judiciary system it sets before itself in the first place two conjunct subordinate objects namely maximizing the number of those to whom that benefit is imparted and rendering and keeping at all times adequate to that purpose the number of     the functionaries employed in the imparting of it but here at the outset a great difficulty presents itself to those who for this purpose are called upon to pay attendance on a judge the obligation of paying such attendance will unavoidably be productive of vexation or expense or both to an indefinite extent on the other hand true it is that if it be matter of vexation to be obliged to be attendant at a judicatory in the character of defendant such to a certain degree it cannot but be to attend at that same place in the character of pursuer but a state of things which to an indefinite extent may have place is this—namely that while to this or that man in the character of defendant attendance for the time in question is a very serious evil to this or that man in the character of pursuer it shall be no such evil on the contrary when coupled with the benefit expected in this or that shape from the evil to which the defendant is thus subjected or from the result of it it may in his eyes be a good as for instance where the suit has for its object the obtaining from an individual property in some shape or other by an unjust claim by means of his inability through indigence to employ against it the necessary means of selfdefence or more simply for the gratification of vengeance the reducing him by means of the expense to a state of indigence such being the state of the case if the door of the judicatory is thus thrown open and the faculty is given to each individual in the character of pursuer to compel the attendance of persons of every condition in any number to meet him in the presence of the judge in the character of defendants and no restraint is laid upon the abuse of this faculty the judge by means of his official services may in this manner be rendered how unwillingly soever at the pleasure of any evildoer the instrument of evil to any amount happily to this evil the nature of the case furnishes a remedy alike obvious simple and effectual a remedy the sufficiency of which is to a certain extent demonstrated by universal experience this remedy is the subjecting the author of such vexation to pecuniary loss thus far such is the course which has been pursued in all systems of judicature as yet established and the result is that no vexation approaching in amount to the vexation just above brought to view has in any of them been seen to be produced by every man by whom in the situation of pursuer such vexation is brought upon another man thus forced in the situation of defendant pecuniary loss is sustained in pursuance of the arrangement made for that purpose this loss consists of and is imposed upon him in proportion to the factitious part of the costs of suit of the money employed by him in the defraying of that part of the charges if justice consists in the affording to every man alike in so far as may be the protection of the law by means of the appropriate services of the functionaries of justice employed for that purpose no system of judicature hitherto established has justice for its object if any such system had ever had existence this is what it would have done it would have rendered complete the services of the functionaries employed in the administration of justice it would have avoided with the most scrupulous care the adding any factitious expense vexation or delay to those expenses vexations and delays which are natural and unavoidable it would no more have taken for a subject of taxation a man whose leg had been broken by a fall given him by design than a man who had suffered the same affliction by a fall experienced by accident but that instrument of power which calls itself a court of justice has in every community without exception had for the object of its institution not justice but its opposite injustice injustice in the shape of depredation and oppression as to relief to the injured it has not been the end in view but only a collateral and unintended result what good has been done has been done partly as being with relation to the evil an unavoidable accompaniment partly as a means of reconciling to the infliction of the evil the inconsiderate and deluded multitude the proofs of this are conclusive and altogether irresistible they are shortly these—   imposition of law taxes putting out of the protection of the law all those who are unable to pay the tax   imposition of law fees payable to the functionaries of justice functionaries employed in giving such security as is given against injury from internal adversaries and who might be sufficiently paid by a minute part of the expense employed in the payment of those engaged in giving security against injury from foreign adversaries   audience refused to the parties in the suit the defendant not compelled to meet the pursuer in the presence of the judge nor the pursuer admitted in person to state to the judge his demand and the foundation on which it rests england is of all countries that in which depravity in this shape has soared to the highest pitch it would be alike needless and endless to attempt to investigate the amount of the booty thus regularly made or the proportions in which it has been shared between the monarch and the judge or the proportions in which they have contributed to the extraction of it the arrangements taken for the gathering in the fruits of this depredation serve effectually for the prevention of vexation in so far as the prevention of it is to them an object of desire of those whose desire it would be to inflict vexation on their adversaries all those who cannot afford to have this instrument are     kept from doing so and thus far evil being prevented correspondent good is done but to all those who can and will afford to have this instrument of vexation the use of it is let out accordingly to exclude evil however—to do good in any shape has never been to them an object of desire if it had been they would have excluded all vexatious suits and all vexatious proceedings on each side before any vexation were inflicted by the judge on the defendant the judge would have seen the pursuer and taken from him for this good purpose those securities the uses of which are so abundant for good and bad purposes promiscuously thus then is the separation made the evil the work of design the greatest part of it the good work of design no part of it meantime abstraction made of whatever is factitious and thence avoidable considerable and that to a lamentable degree is in many instances the expense on one side of giving the necessary support to a wellgrounded claim on the other side the expense necessary to effectual selfdefence against an unjust one this bar to justice though not capable of being removed altogether might however by appropriate arrangements be removed in a considerable degree as for the relief of those who would otherwise suffer for want of food so for the relief of those who would otherwise suffer for want of justice—that is to say for want of service due from judicial functionaries funds might be provided if appropriate care were wanting the disposal of such funds might be a source of abuse but the necessary and sufficient care need not be wanting and against the abuse to which relief in this shape is exposed the difficulty would not be near so great as that of preventing abuse in the disposition made of relief against the want of the means of sustenance to those whose desire it were to prevent needless vexation the means of accomplishing it are sufficiently obvious in every instance in as far as possible let the author of the proceeding be the individual on whom the evil of it falls if it be for want of due attention that the vexation has been produced make the author civilly responsible—impose on him in so far as he is able to bear it the burthen of indemnification—of making compensation to the suffering party for the suffering he has sustained if it be not for want of attention but on the contrary by reason of attention employed in the endeavour to produce the evil and without any justificative cause for doing so make him penally responsible to the burthen of compensation if imposed add ulterior suffering in the name and for the purpose of punishment if either the case does not admit of compensation as where there is no individual special sufferer or the author of the vexation has not wherewith to make compensation in this case to the loss of so much as it would have been necessary to disburse to the purpose of making compensation substitute equal suffering in the name of punishment in a word for simple temerity impose the burthen of compensation for evil consciousness add punishment a course of this sort would have answered the purpose of justice but it would not have answered the purpose—it would not have favoured the sinister interest of the authors of any established system of judicature the advice which they gave to one another on this occasion was extremely simple admit all unjust claims and all unjust defences by which anything is to be got exclude all just claims and all just defences by which nothing is to be got never was advice more diligently complied with by the admission given to the injustice they got money by the exclusion put upon justice they got ease section i excepted judicatories expositive art   by the judiciary establishment understand the aggregate of all persons and all things at all

aggression on the part of external or internal enemies instructional ratiocinative art   in the case of this sort of excepted judicatories the proceedings will not be materially different from those of the ordinary judicatories for the best adapted means of coming at the truth in regard to the relevant facts are the same in relation to every sort of act the only change will be that which respects the natural degree of promptitude and that which regards the situation of the temporary judge the time by which a judge whose seat is at a considerable and indeterminate distance can be called in cannot be waited for and the ordinary judge having little or no acquaintance with the details of the office in question would probably in the first instance in respect of cognitional and judicative aptitude be less apt than the special judge here substituted to him true it is that in the case proposed the cause in which the special judge would act might without impropriety be termed his own cause but the facility of appeal being in this case as in all other cases under the present code maximized the evil would be nominal only not real and effective the evil associated in idea with the phrase—judge in his own cause having for its origin the evil which for want of the facility in question has at all times and everywhere been exemplified in such disastrous abundance expositive exemplificational art  0 two other sorts of judicatories which are wont to be regarded as judicatories of exception are those styled in english practice audit courts and those styled in the same practice courts of claims what there is peculiar in them as compared with other judicatories and common to them as compared with one another is this to wit that in their organization there is a sort of imperfection in each wanting a situation which is commonly regarded as a necessary and indispensable element in the composition of a judicatory in the audit court the situation wanting is that of pursuer in the court of claims the situation wanting is that of defendant not that in either case the functions of the deficient situation remain constantly unperformed in both cases a functionary has place by whom they ought to be and at any rate are professed to be with scrupulous exactness performed and with more or less exactness commonly are performed and that is the judge without a judge the functions belonging to judicature cannot in the aggregate be performed at all they cannot be either well performed or ill performed but without a pursuer distinct from the judge they are capable of being performed and so without a defendant distinct from the judge without a pursuer they are performed in the civil field in english practice in this same audit court the business of it consists in calling a debtor to account the question being in every case whether a debt which it is admitted he has incurred has been discharged by him if the decision be in the affirmative     he is pronounced discharged and no adverse proceeding against him can be carried on if the decision be in the negative he may be proceeded against by a demand for satisfaction as in the ordinary case of the proceeding on a demand on the score of debt in ordinary cases of debt the suit being carried on in the ordinary judicatories suits on this ground are carried on promiscuously with suits on all other grounds whereas in this case suits on this ground are the only sorts of suits of which the judicatory takes cognizance in english practice the only instance in which a judicatory under this name is established by government and acts with power from government is that in which the situation of creditor and thence of judge is occupied by government itself that of debtor being occupied by individuals by individuals by whom money moneys worth might as well be added has been received either in requital for service rendered to government by the receiver of the money or in trust to hand it over to some government functionary or to expend it on account of government examples of a judicatory thus denominated are—   the general audit board which sits in somersethouse for the auditing of government accounts in general   the judicatory of which the auditor of greenwich hospital is the judge debtors and the only ones on whose accounts judgment is there passed are those who stand in that relation to the constituted authorities of that government hospital for superannuated naval functionaries   chelsea hospital—has this foundation an auditor so called this receptacle for the entertainment of superannuated army functionaries instances are not wanting in which in the service of an individual another individual is maintained for this purpose and under this denomination in these cases the principal is a great landholder the debtors his tenants what will be the sensation produced in the mind of a frenchman for example when he is informed of an instance in which for a nobleman a duke service in this shape and under this name is performed by a barrister son of another nobleman a lord—and that for this service the barrister receives £  00 ayear full twice as much as the highest paid species of judge in france upon the choice of the debtor it depends in this case whether to appear in this sort of judicatory or not whether to pay the debt or produce evidence by which payment is proved in suits called penal or criminal under romebred law this kind of procedure is carried on over a very extensive part of the logical field of judicature in divers nations under the austrian government in particular it used so to be witness banniza so under the prussian government in courtsmartial in england the function of pursuer is declaredly added to that of the judge judgeadvocate is the denomination by which this functionary is distinguished in the situation of pursuer he acts singly in the situation of judge he acts as presiding member of a manyseated judicatory—a board of judges ratiocinative art    for the designation of a judicatory why employ this term to the exclusion of the more commonly employed word court answer reasons   in this same signification the word judicatory is already in use   the word judicatory is clear from all ambiguity the word court not   the word court besides ambiguity is liable to produce delusion and mischievous error   not that the word judicatory is altogether free from ambiguity but the ambiguity is of a sort from which not so much as misconception much less any evil effect in practice can ensue originally it meant—not a person or persons but a place in which the person or persons acted as in the case of the words dormitory laboratory refectory that is to say the usual place of residence of the functionary acting as such and in conformity to a customary figure of speech from the original and proper signification comes the improper—the derivative   tainted by this same ambiguity is the import of the word court and besides this innoxious feature of imperfection so is it by another and that a noxious one   in monarchies in general and in the english monarchy in particular in addition to the sense in which it is synonymous to the word judicatory in its personregarding sense as above the word court is employed in the designation of the persons following i the monarch ii the persons most immediately attached to the service of the monarch in his private or say nonfunctionary capacity iii any such other persons as are most frequently in his presence   antecedent to the juridical sense of the word court was as above its monarchical sense in the times of original inexperience and simplicity all the authorities in the state were in the supreme grade exercised by one hand by degrees the judicial authority—the monarch not having time for the exercise of it—was transferred to subordinate hands name of this functionary—in england the grand justiciary but his residence was the same as that of the monarch to wit the court in its kingregarding sense and whenever and wherever the monarch travelled as for a great part of his time he commonly did with him travelled the judge and what was called justice       a court is the region of favour of favour in contradistinction to justice a monarch is above justice from his will it is as from its source that what in a monarchy is called justice emanates on that same will depends the nature of it the purport and tenor of the words by which on each occasion it stands expressed witness the maxim quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem—a maxim in every pure monarchy not only acted upon but avowed in the english monarchy sometimes avowed sometimes disavowed but by all more or less acted upon even

much for such judicial assistants for whose services an indispensable demand may have place in every civilized state style them accordingly judiciary assistants naturally and indispensably in demand add now to and compare with these another set for which there is no such natural and indispensable demand style them judiciary assistants redundant or say in redundance in superfluity or in english law language in which the thing itself is in such immense and disastrous abundance in surplusage for a sample of this set turn now to english practice   evidence elicitator bissubspecies of this subspecies of professional substitute—judiciary assistants these—in the judicatories styled common law courts   special pleader at the bar   special pleader under the bar to the functions of both these private functionaries exercise is given by giving utterance to masses of discourse supposed to emanate from a party though unless by accident in fact never seen or heard by him utterance—that is to say in writing and not otherwise evidence is the appellation here given to this species of discourse why evidence answer—because to some purposes the effect of evidence that is to say as to the constituting a ground for judicial decision is given to it though to other purposes not by the judge the elicitation of this species of matter is exacted on pain of loss of suit at the charge of him who omits to cause it to be elicited exacted—though when elicited it is acknowledged as having no claim to credence and spoken of as if not designed for any other purpose than that of serving as an object of reference to other matter to which the effect of evidence as above is avowedly given in every instance it teems with falsehood but by the judge impunity is given to all this falsehood why answer—because he and the partnership of which he is at the head are suffered to exact in the name of fees money in proportion to the quantity of this same falsehood and by any bar opposed to falsehood a check would be applied to the quantity of the whole mass of fees to let in this species of profityielding matter the parties are inexorably excluded from the presence of the judge and a suit which if he would hear the parties might without expense be according to justice terminated in a few minutes is thus spun out for the space of as many years with an expense of more than as many hundred pounds the way in which the commission to give existence and utterance to this mass of mendacious surplusage reaches the special pleader is this the party tells his story to his attorney the attorney tells his to the special pleader—that is to say either the same story or a different one differing to whatever amount presents itself as best suited to that purpose which belongs in common to the two lawlearned gentlemen and this common purpose—what is it it is of course the giving to the suit whatsoever degree of lengthiness and expensiveness can be given to it without too great an expense to both learned gentlemen or either of them in the article of reputation between the sort of business belonging to the special pleader under the bar and the sort belonging to the special pleader at the bar no fixed line of demarcation has place on each individual occasion the matter for the instrument is taken to be manufactured at the lower priced or the higher priced manufactory according as less or more head work is regarded as necessary to the operation exemplificational art  0 in the sort of judicatory styled an equity court superfluousevidence elicitator in the written form an equity draughtsman at the bar or under the bar as above but in this case by whomsoever drawn necessary to its reception is the signature of a draughtsman at the bar and when the time comes that evidenceelicitator is aggregated to the list of argumentators suppose now what frequently is the case in both judicatories the individual demand one and the same—the fact alleged on one side denied on the other side one and the same—the evidence by which support is given to the assertion by the one side to the denial by the other side the same—still the mode of elicitation employed in the commonlaw court and the mode employed in the equity court are as different from one another as they can easily be conceived to be at the opening of the suit in an equity court—evidence which consideration had of its source would not by common law be received—namely evidence of a party—is required to be and must be elicited of this partywitness the station is on the defendants side and in the written mode as above an assistant of the party whose station is on the pursuers side is employed to elicit it but the statements thus elicited being destined to appear in the character of evidence—professing to be all along consonant to truth—the ceremony of an oath with eventual punishment at the back of it is attached to it—namely under the notion of its being a security against mendacity here then would be as in the case of special pleading     a check to quantity were it not that on the pursuers side mendacity—and that without stint is not merely tolerated but absolutely compelled to a set of interrogations or as in technical language the word is interrogatories—in common language questions the draughtsman is obliged to prefix to an extent to which there is no limit a set of assertions which on pain of not producing the effect intended by the interrogation must be false for in order to obtain a statement in relation to a state of things of which he is ignorant he must state himself to be informed of it and make accordingly in relation to it a statement which to his knowledge is false—he himself being the inventor of it on the other hand in answer to this statement and these interrogatories the defendants solicitor so this species of professional assistant is styled when the judicatory is styled an equity court attorney being his name when it is a common law court this same solicitor after taking his instructions in writing or in conversation from his client the defendant—draws up a paper of instructions which he hands over to another equity draughtsman by whom at the expense of truth in as far as is necessary it is modified in such sort as to afford the fairest promise of suiting his purpose without subjecting the defendant his client to punishment for any such parts of it as happen to be false the paper thus fabricated the defendant attaches his adoption to it by means of the ceremony styled an oath in which case what is called wilful meaning selfconscious falsehood is styled perjury and if in the appropriate mode prosecuted for and proved subjects the party on whom it is proved to appropriate punishment but for such proof a separate prosecution and two witnesses testifying on oath in contradiction to some statement of the party so prosecuted are necessary and unless such prosecution be instituted such proof made and conviction and sentence pronounced in consequence the answer such is the name given to the paper this answer let it teem ever so abundantly with falsehood is in every point by the judge how fully conscious soever of these same falsehoods taken for true and acted upon as such of the plaintiffs draughtsman with his interrogatories the object has been of course throughout to extract from the defendant declaration of such facts and such alone as will make for him—the plaintiff—and consequently in proportion against the defendant but into the belly of each such tohisclientunfavourable declaration which he regards it as not safe to avoid making he takes care to insert others one or more the complexion of which is favourable to him if the residence of the party and thence of his solicitor is elsewhere than in the metropolis—in which place alone with exceptions to a comparatively small extent are the judgmentseats of the judicatories called equity courts—if in a word the place of their residence be no other than a country place—to this principal solicitor is added for the performance of such of the operations the scene of which lies in the metropolis another solicitor acting as agent to this his principal moreover interposed between the solicitor resident in the metropolis and those public judiciary functionaries who are purely such is another judiciary functionary styled a clerk in court whose character is of a mixed nature but in such sort mixed that to analyze it belongs not to this place note—that in english practice acting in the character of advocates—evidenceeliciting or argumentating or both—judiciary assistants in number altogether unlimited may on each side be employed employed—sometimes for the benefit of their assistance sometimes for the advantage of depriving the adverse party of that same benefit instances have been known of as many as ten or more appearing at the same time in former days within the memory of the author of these pages the instances of a number as great as this were not altogether unfrequent instructional art    of the enumeration thus made the use is the putting the legislature in a way to satisfy itself of which of those different suites of judiciary assistants the operations are necessary and of which not necessary to justice but to give to this question a complete solution belongs exclusively to the procedure code in which see ch viii and ch ix instructional art    note here in conclusion so far as regards the direct ends of justice—namely execution and effect given to the ordinances of the main body of the law to the exclusion of misdecision and nondecision where decision is due—obviously necessary on each occasion is the attendance of each party in the presence of the judge and this even where in the character of an evidenceholder it is not necessary for the support either of his own interest or of that of a party on the other side the matter of fact not having either immediately or through the intervention of any other person in the character of an evidenceholder come within his view for in the breast of every species of judiciary assistant as abovementioned has place a sinister interest conflicting with the interest of the party to which lastmentioned interest it belongs to the judge in every case to give the benefit of his care but throughout the whole field of judicial procedure conflict or say antagonization has place between the direct ends of justice as abovementioned and the collateral namely minimization of delay expense and vexation and on which side shall be the claim to preference will in each individual instance depend upon the circumstances of     the individual case of which circumstances under the procedure code connected with this code the judge will provisionally form his conception from the examination taken by him of the applicant in the case of a child of an age inferior to the age of reason or in that of a person in a state of complete fatuity no the party being in these cases by the supposition in a state of complete incapacity as to the watching over his own interest but in these cases as in every case the difference between capacity and incapacity depends upon degrees and delay expense and vexation apart it belongs to the judge to obtain as and for the ground of his judgment as to the degree the best evidence which the nature of the case affords in which evidence cannot but be included the testimony of his own senses on the other hand the system of judicial procedure having in every country been the work of men who either at the time of workmanship were in the exercise of the function of professional judicial assistant in one of its modes as above or for the whole time during which they were qualifying themselves for the task had in that way been engaged and in virtue of that profession their interest being in a state of constant opposition to the interest of the parties on both sides of the suit and more especially of those whose side was on each occasion the right side—hence it is—that in the procedure code of every such country it has been an object of uniform endeavour to reduce to its minimum the number of the occasions on which the parties on both sides or on either are compelled or admitted to appear in open judicatory in the presence of the judge hence it is that in addition to the incidentally necessary number of professional actors in the judicial drama the constantly unnecessary yet constantly admitted number has to such a degree been worked up as above only in the case where the evil correspondent and opposite to the collateral ends of justice as above would otherwise be preponderant over the evil correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice—can evidence elicited in the epistolary mode be admitted to the exclusion of evidence from the same source elicited in the oral mode elicited—that is to say in so far as the judge has it in any way in his power to compel attendance at the judgment seat for the elicitation of such oral evidence and even in this case the effect of epistolary evidence need not be conclusive it may be subjected to the being eventually reversed or modified by elicitation subsequently performed in the oral mode so likewise in the case where the proposed evidence holder—being or not being at the time to this purpose in a state of actual subjection to the power of the judge—has at that same time his residence in a distant dependency of the state or on a spot within the dominion of this or

exercised as per ch xxi with relation to the proceedings of an immediate judge as also divers other functions by which in so many corresponding forms written evidence chiefly of the preappointed kind applicable to various purposes receives its expression and is preserved for eventual use as to preappointed evidence see the procedure code and the rationale of evidence as to the species of functionary thus denominated see ch xxvi local registrars enactive expositive art    in case of need for giving effect to the mandate of a judge all persons on requisition from him emaning are bound

such mandate as per art    persons are in certain cases permitted and in certain cases even bound to act in those several capacities or some of them for the purpose of giving execution and effect to the law to wit on the presumption that had the occasion come to the knowledge of the judge—a mandate to the effect in question would by him have been issued for a specification of these cases together with the reasons for the institution of this power in the several cases see the penal nonpenal and procedure codes and see below section    judges sedative function and section    judges aidcompelling function instructional expositive art    note that in and by the procedure code in connexion with this code the arrangements for the application of the necessary checks to abuse of power in these cases being purged of factitious delay vexation and expense—proportioned to the efficiency of the security thus afforded is the amplitude of the power which without preponderant danger may be created and conferred in contradistinction to these occasional the foregoing may be styled permanent judiciary functionaries instructional art    note that to an extent more or less considerable—with great advantage in respect of frugality as well as certainty of intended effect may be united the functions of judiciary mandatebearer and letterpost bearer among the functionaries subordinate to the interior communication minister those acting in the capacity of letterpost bearers being for this purpose and to the extent thereof rendered subject to the direction of the judge     section iv judicatories—their grades enactive art   in every subdistrict is an immediate judicatory with a correspondent establishment of functionaries magisterial and ministerial as per section   enactive art   in every district is an appellate judicatory with its correspondent establishment as per art   enactive art   the immediate judicatories and they alone have cognizance of suits in the first instance

enactive art   subordinate in some sort to the justice minister are as well the appellate as the immediate judicatories for what concerns this functionary see ch xxiv justice minister ratiocinative art   question   why in any case employ as many as two grades of judicatories answer reasons— i general reason this for the more effectually securing on the part of the functionaries in question appropriate aptitude in all its branches ii particular reasons applying to these several branches respectively these— i applying to moral aptitude this—namely exemption from corruption and undue favour   independently of all qualifications and other securities applying to the situation of the judge appealed to whatsoever be the sinister design in question that it should be pursued by two is at the least twice as improbable as that it should be pursued by one especially two in regard to whom effectual measures are taken to prevent their having had any personal communication one with another as to this see section    migration   even supposing on the part of the judge below no matter from what cause a desire ever so strong to show undue favour to a party on either side and thus to produce the effect of a decision varying in any manner or degree from that which the justice of the case requires—still unless the judge below regards himself assured of a determination on the part of the judge above to give effect to this desire no adequate inducement will he have for the commission of the supposed injustice the more flagrant the injustice the stronger his assurance of undergoing legal punishment at the hands of the constituted authorities his superordinates or loss of reputation at the hands of the publicopinion tribunal—one or both and this without reaping the undue benefit he had proposed to himself   true it is that the assurance of the nonsuccess of the supposed criminal designs depends on the ability of the party in question to avail himself of the remedy held out by the power of the appellate judicatory for wheresoever by relative indigence or any other obstacle which without preponderant evil it is in the power of the government to remove a man is rendered unable to avail himself of the relief thus proffered to him by law the proffer thus made to him is a cruel mockery and hence the need of a system of procedure in which expense delay and vexation are minimized as also of arrangements for administering at the expense of government aid as far as needed in the shape of professional assistance and money or moneys worth for the expense necessary to the exhibition of evidence as to which see section    justice for the helpless and ch xx eleemosynary advocates and ch xvii judicial inspectors remains however at any rate the check applied to the judges supposed improbity by the fear of punishment and censure as above finally see section    judges c securities for appropriate aptitude ii applying to intellectual aptitude knowledge and judgment included this—namely the benefit of experience at the commencement of his career the judge immediate will be an untried man untried—that is to say in his situation of judge     principal though by the necessity of his having previously served in the situation of judge depute permanent as per ch xiv or that of judge depute occasional as per ch xv provision for his being endowed with this same desirable quality has been made here then is one course of trial and the case being such that in the situation of judge appellate no person can have place without his having for a considerable length of time served in the situation of judge immediate principal accordingly so it is that to that one course of trial is added a second iii thirdly and lastly applying to appropriate active aptitude—like security for and probability of increase of this branch of appropriate aptitude iv of all these causes of increase of aptitude the existence and the influence being open to all eyes—hence the probability not only of actual increase of aptitude but on the part of the people a general persuasion of its existence and consequently a correspondent confidence in the whole of the judicial establishment coupled with a sense of security in their own breasts ratiocinative art   question   why not more than two answer reasons—   because of the vast increase of expense delay and vexation without any adequate degree of probability of appropriate aptitude on the part of the ultimate decision and correspondent confidence on the part of the people   to come to particulars suppose instead of two such grades three from the immediate judge appeal to a judge appellate from the judge appellate appeal—say to a judge superappellate suppose now the decision of the immediate judge confirmed by the judge appellate then reversed by the judge superappellate here then are in favour of the decision two voices—say accordingly two chances in disfavour of it but one the consequent result is it is reversed of the superappellate judge the appropriate aptitude in all its several branches has more chances in its favour than that of either of his two subordinates true but has it more than both of them put together for if in respect of length of triedness he has the advantage over both his subordinates still has his immediate subordinate the judge appellate no inconsiderable stock of that desirable quality and thus from the vast addition made to the expense delay and vexation by this addition of a third grade to the machinery no other addition would be made to the probability of rectitude of decision than that which would be made by the difference between the lesser degree of appropriate aptitude on the part of the judge appellate and the supposed greater degree on the part of the judge superappellate for in this case by undue partiality on the part of the judge superappellate injustice may be done no less easily and effectually than by the like partiality on the part of the judge appellate in the former case at all events what adequate assignable grounds can there be in this case for confidence in the justice of the decree pronounced by the judge superappellate but as per ch xxii appellate judicatories of several modes of change—all of them equally capable of having place—simple reversal is but one let in the several others and see what endless confusion with addition to expense vexation and delay at each grade would be the consequence suppose then grades of jurisdiction one above another to the number of six or seven think of the confusion and denial of justice which in such a case cannot but have place think of the contempt of the ends of justice which in that same case cannot but have place in the minds of the constituted authorities by whom that same state of things is kept on foot ratiocinative art   question   why thus in every sort of suit answer reasons— because if in the case of any sort of suit such repeated trial and opportunity of investigation as above affords the sort of security in question so in that same degree does it in the case of every other sort of suit between no two sorts of suits does the nature of things admit of the drawing to this purpose any determinate line of separation instructional art   if there were any sort of suit in which to the right of appeal no condition or restriction whatever were applied a denial of justice would in so far have place to the prejudice of every person by whom the expense delay and vexation inseparable from the application of this remedy cannot be endured hence on the part of the legislature the necessity of using all necessary and practicable endeavours—   to minimize in every case the expense delay and vexation attendant on appeal   so to order matters that when he who is desirous of appealing is unable to endure   0 that burthen the necessary aid shall be afforded to him from some other source or sources—as for example from the purse—either of some voluntary contributor or contributors should any such come forward or if the judge think fit from the purse of the adverse party notwithstanding that of him it cannot as yet be known whether he be in the right or in the wrong or lastly from that of the public as a dernier resort   and that in the long run from no ungrounded appeal shall profit in any shape be made by the appellant section v number in a judicatory enactive art   exceptions excepted in no judicatory number of seats more than one as in an immediate judicatory so in an appellate ratiocinative instructional art   for reasons see those which apply to the case of a situation in the administrative department ch ix section   to the present case they will all of them be found applying and if with any difference with increased force ratiocinative art   to the reasons which apply to that case add in this case the additional control applied and information afforded by means of the constant contestational discussion with the assistance of advocates at the pleasure of the parties specially interested—and appeal with like discussion and assistance also at the pleasure of those same parties expositive art   exceptions are—   of necessity for extraordinary occasions the supreme judicatory the legislature see ch vi sections         for ordinary occasions the quasijury as to all the elementary judicial functions but the imperative see ch xvi section     for military suits see ch x section        instructional art   from any addition to number one in a judicatory the only beneficial effect which can be expected with relation to the ends of judicature are those of a check to misconduct and in particular to misconduct in those shapes in which it is the result of deficiency in respect of appropriate moral aptitude on the part of the judge first constituted but against any such deficiency other and ample securities are provided in abundance see section    ratiocinative art   as to this check weak and inefficient will it be seen to be by opposition to his colleague—the judge whose location is the result of the first choice by opposition to the will of this his superior the inferior might lose the whole comfort of the official part of his life by acquiescence no less does he suffer in any shape no greater thought than what to him appears necessary to save himself from positive censure at the hands of superordinates and from being regarded by them as a cypher will be the part taken by him in the business ratiocinative art   from the efficiency of the check thus applied to misconduct through moral inaptitude on the part of the first chosen judge as also from the value of any addition capable of being made to his appropriate intellectual aptitude a cause of defalcation may be seen by that produced in the defalcation made from his own intellectual and active aptitude by the torpor produced for want of adequate motives for exertion as above ratiocinative art   in this way it is that when two judges are placed in the same judicatory with the same powers appropriate aptitude in its several branches in respect of each is diminished by the coexistence of the other ratiocinative art   by the allotment of a number greater than needful in each judicatory or in a considerable number of judicatories the ends of justice will be contravened in another way through the medium of the expense to wit by producing to the injury of a greater or less proportion of the members of the community the effect of a denial of justice and to a yet greater proportion that of increase of delay vexation and expense for denial of justice is the effect in so far as by the length of journeys to and from the judicatory with the addition of the intervening demurrage expense to an amount greater than can be defrayed is imposed upon suitors or necessary witnesses and the greater the length of those same journeys and demurrage the greater is the amount of whatsoever expense is on that account actually incurred suppose now a set of judicatories instituted in such number as shall be sufficient but not more than sufficient to secure the community against all denial of justice from this cause from this aggregate deduct any number how small soever denial of justice in a proportionable degree has place but scarcely in any country is the aggregate number of judicatories so great as altogether to exclude denial of justice from this cause the actual number being reduced below the relatively requisite number by the difficulty of providing for the expense suppose six hundred the greatest number of judicatories for the necessary expense of which provision can be afforded and suppose this number but barely sufficient to prevent as above the denial of justice put an additional judge though it be but in one of the whole number of judicatories you make a defalcation of one from the total number of judicatories and thereby a proportionable addition to the length of journeys and demurrage in the instance of at least one judicatory and to a correspondent amount you produce denial of justice together with increase of delay vexation and expense as above but for whatever reason you make such addition of one judge in any one judicatory for the same reason should you make that same addition in every other judicatory place then in each judicatory two judges instead of one judge you reduce the total number of judicatories to three hundred instead of six hundred the number requisite to prevent denial of justice place in each judicatory three judges you reduce it to two hundred and so on producing by every such addition made to the number of judges in each judicatory a correspondent unavoidable addition to denial of justice together with still greater addition to delay vexation and expense ratiocinative instructional art  0 only by a still more abundantly productive cause namely law taxes and law fees official and professional are these effects of supernumerariousness of judges in the production of denial of justice together with aggravation of delay vexation and expense concealed from general observation ratiocinative art    if of two judges either has by means of corruption or sympathy or antipathy towards this or that individual a sinister interest which will be promoted by delay—he has it in his power not only to produce it to an indefinite extent but to produce it without scandal by pretending doubts and while in this way promoting the sinister interest he may be acquiring the reputation of præterordinary moral aptitude on the score of præteranxiety to judge aright ratiocinative instructional art    to france is confined the inadequate     counterbenefit of a manyseated judicature and in this case the benefit belongs not to judicature but to legislation it consists in a weakly additional control exercised over the sinister interest of the monarch by strength given from multiplicity to the control applicable by the judicial establishment and a sort of virtual negative upon the laws exercised by the members of the judicatory at their peril and never without more or less of self sacrifice under the original form of government this negative was applied to the law itself before enactment under the present form of government it cannot any otherwise be applied than in this or that individual case under the law after its enactment number of judges in the highest and most influential judicatory the cour royale no fewer than fiftysix whereof presidents six salary eighteen thousand francs or £  0 ayear yet under such a constitution who can say but that in the character of a check to arbitrary power and misrule—the power of the legislative assemblies being rather a cloak and a coat of mail for it than a bridle—even this expense may be well employed as to the money were it not wasted in judges it might be wasted in jesuits instructional exemplificational art    in england four judges are paid for doing badly that which as has been seen above would be done much less badly by one the expense to the public consequently thus far quadrupled of course this observation applies solely to that part of the business which is exclusive of that which is called the trial and which if the ends of justice were the objects would not be done at all portions of the business in which this waste of dearly paid labour has no place are—  the business called the trial in which the elicitation of evidence is performed in the best mode   that part which is called the chamber business and which is carried on the whole of it under a veil of secrecy no person being present other than the professional lawyers—men whose interests it is that the ends of justice should be in as high a degree as possible contravened expense delay and vexation maximized† here then on the part of the law added to the reproach of inaptitude is that of inconsistency the mode of performing the business in full court—four judges being present cannot be justifiable or the mode of doing it at chambers must be condemned the mode of doing the business at chambers cannot be justifiable or the mode of doing it in court must be condemned three is the number of these judicatories three the number of the instances in which the superfœtation just described has place instructional exemplificational art    peculiar to those judicatories in and by which the species of pseudonomia—of sham and judgemade law styled common law in contradistinction to equity is administered is this quadruplicity thus preferred and substituted to unity in no instance in which equity is the name of the thing which is administered has it place not in any one of the three superior judicatories so strangely piled up one above another styled the vicechancellors court the master of the rolls court and the lord high chancellors court nor yet in any one of those inferior judicatories in which the judge is styled a master in chancery nor yet is this quadruplicity sufficient in all cases in certain cases it is trebled twelve‡ the number of the judges the judges of the three common law courts being packed together for this purpose and these cases in which the demand for appropriate intellectual aptitude is regarded as being at a maximum what are they they are mostly of a sort in which no man in whose instance the most common sense has place in union with common honesty would regard the case as a fit one for the being argued where for instance the question is whether a man shall be deprived of his right because a lawyers clerk has made a mistake unintentionally or intentionally in the writing of one of the letters in a word to the three puisne pronounced puny meaning junior judges any one of several very advantageous substitutes might be proposed any one or for choice all of them on an occasion on which the opinion of all four are delivered seriatim after the chief has delivered his opinion i am of the same opinion are the words commonly pronounced by each of the three puisnes if then it be necessary that for this purpose on this occasion words should be employed animated substitutes would be necessary on this supposition the substitute would have to belong to that class of animals in whose instance wings with feathers are substituted to arms with hands a parrot for example a mino or a starling but when the import is not over complicated expression may be given to the opinion by visible as well as by audible signs arrayed in judges robes might be the figure of a man     in wax work or a painters layman and wire in hand the office of the puppet showman might be performed by my lord chief justice of the whole four the only one in whose instance any real demand for rationality or what passes for such has place is the chief justice for he being always a lord and generally a peer—a member of the house of lords—sometimes even a cabinet minister—all the authority that depends upon opinion all the influence is to him a subject matter of exclusive property on ordinary occasions by him is said whatsoever is said by the other learned persons either nothing at all is said or the sort of something which has just been mentioned i have not been consulted and i will be heard some    years ago did the author of these pages hear willes puisne judge of the kings bench utter a declaration in these very words in the ears of an astonished audience not least was the astonishment of the lord chief justice—the great earl of mansfield against whose authority rebellion was thus committed by a speech thus audacious and unprecedented instructional exemplificational art    as to the part borne by the house of lords in judicature no other imaginable judicatory can be so unfit for rectifying honest errors   the vast majority of members are ignorant of the law and destitute of appropriate knowledge   they are destitute of judicial aptitude by indolence and carelessness the necessary concomitants of preeminent opulence   thence also destitute of appropriate active aptitude   by extensiveness of private connexion preeminently exposed to corrupt partiality   obligation of attendance none those alone attend with perhaps one or two exceptions who are brought thither by the influence of some particular and sinister interest   to crown the absurdity the chancellor has the direction of this judicatory of which the chief occupation is the sitting in judgment on his decisions a complete mockery of justice instructional exemplificational art    from the highest look at the lowest species of judges—the justices of the peace in quarter sessions they sit in unlimited numbers in comparing the french and english systems together there will be found in the french practice errors in principle but consistency in application in the english practice principle none inconsistency consummate in the french system suits being classed according to the supposed order of their importance those to which the least importance is ascribed are allotted to singleseated judicatories those to which the highest degree of importance is ascribed are allotted to the highest number of judges who also receive the

of the square in such sort that from the spot the most remote from the justice chamber a grown person in a state of ordinary health and strength will be able to travel on foot from his or her place of

the several judicial functionaries answer reasons   to save the expense of attendance at the justice chamber on the part of suitors or say parties and other evidenceholders for to every suitor in whose instance that expense cannot be borne justice is denied   to save the delay which of necessity has place where suitors or other evidenceholders will have to travel from distances as above a

undeterminate form and dimensions with a judge or set of judges for taking cognizance of each as to which see below arts       and    instructional art   of the immediate judicial districts the dimensions as above are determined by the care taken to secure to suitors and evidenceholders the faculty of paying personal attendance at the judicatories during the hours of business without sleeping elsewhere than at home but in the appellate judicatory according to the system of procedure attached to the present code no evidenceholders will have to pay attendance nor yet of necessity any suitor on either side the whole of the evidence being along with the instrument of appeal transmitted from the immediate to the appellate judicatory the whole of the proceeding thereon consisting in argument alone on the subject of the evidence as transmitted from the judicatory below as to appellate judicial districts whether there shall be any and if any what shall be the immediate judicatories respectively subordinate to the several appellate judicatories having their seat in those same appellate judicial districts it will depend in each state upon the extent of its territory and the facility of intercommunication between each part and every other in a country such as england in which the communication between each part and every other whether of persons or papers is in a manner instantaneous neither need nor so much as use would there be for any appellate judicatories elsewhere than in the metropolis nor consequently for any appellate judicial districts and the metropolis being the seat of the best public that is to say the spot in which the number of the most enlightened men capable of acting with more or less attention in the character of judicial inspectors as per ch xvii—here would be abundant reason for taking the metropolis for the seat of all those same appellate judicatories whatsoever were the number of them taking the case of england exclusive of scotland ireland and the distant dependencies for the standard of comparison and setting out from this mark the demand if any for appellate judicatories elsewhere than in the metropolis will be greater and greater as the territory of the state is the more and more extensive the state of the population less and less dense and the intercommunication of persons and papers less and less expeditious as it is with every other thing valuable so is it with the benefit from judicial service—expense when operating as a condition to the attainment of it produces the effect of a denial of it to all who are unable to defray that same expense intended or not intended a further effect which it has is therefore the delivering over to depredation and oppression at the hands of all who are able all who are unable to defray that expense the practical inference is—that either in this case the right of making appeal must be denied or the expense inseparable from it must be laid on the shoulders—either of the public or of the party opposite to that one by whom the appeal is made expositive art   determined by and composed of the sorts of suits of which the judge is empowered to take

number of fractions into which the logical field were thus broken even supposing the limits of them every one of them ever so clearly determined and described   adjusting the boundaries between one sort of suit and another is in its nature a work of the utmost nicety not capable of being performed with any tolerable degree of accuracy without a most correct and allcomprehensive conception of the whole field of law and legislation and even in that case scarcely capable of being performed without giving rise to doubts and disputes and thence to suits in number unlimited and all of them purely mischievous add to which jealousies and conflicts of authority between judge and judge all which conflicts are by this simplicity of contrivance completely obviated   of this partition of the logical field of judicial service—of this splitting of jurisdiction the efficient cause has been in the state of the political rule of action in periods of comparative barbarism in the conflict between power and power and between pretension and pretension among the ruling few among whom the aggregate power of the state was at different times divided from this source has also flowed the evil of uncertainty and increase of uncognoscibility different modes of endeavouring to come at the truth—different sets of rules for this purpose have been among the actual though not the necessary consequences of it in every case the right and proper ways of endeavouring to come at the truth are in fact the same the consequence is that if between any two there be any difference one of them at least must in so far be wrong but on the field in question in no instance has the way pursued in this endeavour been the right one or so much as in any degree approaching to it and thus of this division an accompaniment if not a consequence has been—not only aberration from the line of rectitude but a system of aberrations in vast variety as well as multitudes   under the allcomprehensive system of local judicatories herein established observation has already been made as per art   of the expense saved by the undividedness of the logical field of service behold here how vast that saving is in any one of these judicatories suppose but one such fissure and one additional judicatory the result of it by whatsoever reason the demand for the fissure and the consequential additional judicatory has been produced

suppose  00 make one fissure the number will be  00 make two fissures it will be  00 and so on to a greater or less extent this sort of needless useless and pernicious fissure has place as yet in the

promptest mode in use give notification to the invaded judge for appropriate formularies see the procedure code ch xxi enactive instructional art   if in his opinion consideration had of circumstances such as the above the ends of justice may be more effectually attained in this or that other judicatory the original or say originating judge will dismiss the application made to himself he will in that case point out such other judicatory in which for the reasons by him declared he recommends it to be made instructional art   if on the examination it appears that on occasion of this same demand any petition or informative application has already been made by or on behalf of the same applicant in another judicatory and that no such recommendation as per art   has therein been given it will be matter of consideration for the judge whether to retain the application or as being vexatious dismiss it for the responsibility compensational and punitional which in the case of such virtual appeal if ungrounded may be requisite for the repression of juridical vexation see the penal and procedure codes enactive art   every such invading judge takes with him into the invaded territory his own rank and power subject only to the rank and power of the judge of the territory so invaded enactive art  0 in so far as if the order of the one judge is executed the execution of an     order of the other judge is thereby impossibilized—the prevalence belongs generally to the order to which execution has begun to be given before it has begun to be given to the other instructional art    of the incompatibility thus brought to view examples are as follows— i by an accersitive or say hithercalling mandate of the invading judge the attendance of a certain person at a certain point of time at his judicatory is required by the invaded judge he being ignorant of such order the attendance of that same person at that same point of time at his judicatory is by an appropriate mandate required ii by a prehension mandate of the invading judge for the purpose of securing the means of eventual execution to a demand on the ground of debt property situated within the territory of the invaded judge is required to be prehended and kept in custody by a like order of the invaded judge for the like purpose on occasion of a similar demand by another demandant that same property is required to be so dealt with at the same point of time for the benefit of such other demandant for examples of the case where the subject matter of prehension is a thing immoveable see the procedure code ch xxii prehension so also when it is a thing incorporeal so also as to what ought to be deemed a beginning of such execution enactive art    but in case of disagreement as to the priority in point of time the prevalence belongs provisionally to the mandate of the invaded judge expositive enactive art    jurisdictionadjustive function to this function exercise is given by an imperative mandate declaring on appeal from either of the thus conflicting mandates to which of them execution shall be definitively given this function if the territories are situated both within the same appellate judicial district belongs to the judge appellate if in different appellate judicial districts to the justice minister instructional art    in the exercise of this same jurisdictionadjustive function it will be for the superordinate functionary to take care lest by the one subordinate the invasion be unduly declined or unduly performed or by the other unduly acquiesced in or opposed as also lest by collusion on the part of one or both priority of execution in favour of this or that party on either side be unduly obtained enactive instructional art    provisional only is the prevalence in the above examples spoken of between counterdemandants whether in the same or in different judicial territories—for the arrangements made for ultimate equality or proportionality of distribution as of burthens so of benefits see the procedure code ch xiv suits their sorts ratiocinative art    this intercommunity why instituted answer because in the whole territory of the state there exists not any spot on which for giving effect to a just demand and giving in that respect execution and effect to the correspondent portion of law it may not be necessary for the judicatory applied to whatever it be to exercise its authority within the territory of any and every other judicatory and this whatsoever may be the relation of the individual to the suit whether pursuer defendant witness or the proxy or assistant of a pursuer or a defendant expositive instructional art    consistently with the intercommunity with the correspondent universally mutual power of invasion of jurisdiction as here established how is it that to any immediate judicatory any peculiar local field of service can belong answers   of each suit or other judicial application the cognizance will belong in the first instance to the immediate judicatory of the judicial district in the justicechamber of which the judicial application is made and by any person may judicial application be made to the judicatory in the territory of which at that moment he is in existence   in the ordinary state of things or in the state of things most frequently exemplified to the lot of that same judge will it fall to carry the suit through from beginning to end to elicit the whole of the evidence and after issuing thereupon his definitive decree to give execution and effect to it accordingly and as well for the purpose of the elicitation of the evidence as for the purpose of such execution and effect—the persons on whom and the things on which it will be necessary for him to operate will be situated within that same district   in comparison of this state of things an extraordinary one is that in which for any purpose the suit or other judicial application will have to pass though it be but for a moment into the hands of the judge of any district other than that of the judge first applied to—the originating judge as above   this being the case—it follows that the judicatory in which the suit originates will be the judicatory in which the application in which it originated was made before the applicant had made in any other judicatory an application demanding at the hands of the judge that same service       but it does not follow that for a single moment after the examination of the applicant has been completed the suit will continue in that same judicatory retained there it will be or dismissed as to the judge may seem most fit the applicant being in this case advised or not advised to transfer the suit and make application accordingly to the judge of this or that other district or say judgeshire   under the procedure code appertaining to this code on the occasion of every such original application—it will before the termination thereof have been the care of the judge to ascertain as far as can be done by the examination of the applicant whether in his judicatory without invasion made into any other or transfer of the suit to any other the suit can be carried through from beginning to end and if not at what stage of the suit the invasion or the transfer respectively will have to be made that is to say in all cases with the minimum of expense delay and vexation   to the number of the different judicatories into which at the same time or at different times one and the same suit may upon this plan have to pass no possible limit can be assigned within judicial districts in any number may be situated at any point of time in the course of the suit pursuers in any number defendants or proposed defendants in any number or evidence holders in any number   but from this diversification how prodigious soever no objection to the course here chalked out is deducible be the degree of complication which in these respects has place what it may—by the natural system of procedure here employed this complication with the quantum of expense delay and vexation attached to it may in any degree be diminished but it cannot be in any degree increased for supposing what however will not in any instance be found to be the case that by the technical system the aggregate amount of these same evils will be minimized that same course will the judge have it in his power in the individual case in question whatever it be to pursue and cause to be pursued   yes it may be said in his power it will be but with the power to do so will the will to do so be his likewise answer yes it will and why because i remuneration by fees—or in one word feegathering—being effectually excluded—in no shape will profit be capable of being made by the judge from any undue extension given by him to the field of his service ii by the allcomprehensive system of minutation applied to whatsoever is either said or done in relation to the business in hand by any person present as per ch xxi immediate and appellate judiciary registrars section   minutation how and the scrutinizing inspection of the public eye as per ch xvii judicial inspectors being continually brought to bear upon his conduct in this respect as in all others—an efficient motive for doing right will thus be operating upon him at all times while as above no motive for doing wrong will be operating on him at any time instructional ratiocinative art    but for the determining to which judicatory for the purpose of all suits taken together jurisdiction in the most ordinary case over all persons and things situate within the territory of that same judicatory appertains—the practical need use and reason is this if operated upon at the instance of sets of parties more than one the same person or the same thing cannot always be operated upon with the same advantage to both sets in the character of an evidenceholder for example the same person cannot be examined in the justicechambers of two different judicatories at the same hour nor even in two justice chambers of one and the same judicatory in the same minute one and the same thing moveable or immoveable or one and the same mass of money cannot be disposed of at the same moment of time with equal advantage to one set of suitors in one suit and to a different set of suitors who are such in a different suit hence in these cases of conflicting interests will come the need of articles of law enactive or instructional or both—for determining to which set of suitors that is to say to those parties respectively which in each such suit have right on their side the advantage shall be given instructional art    as to persons if in the district of any judicatory the person in question has a fixed place of residence not having any such place in the judgeshire of any other judicatory—to the power of the judge of that same judicatory will this same person be in a state of subjection on and for all ordinary occasions and for example for the purpose of a suit on the occasion of which the judge of that same judgeshire has been the originating judge but for the purpose of some suit which is in pending in the justicechamber of some other judicatory it may be necessary that this same person should be examined and desirable were it possible that he should be examined at this same moment of time here then is an occasion on which and a purpose for which it may be necessary to distinguish the two different judicatories by correspondently different denominations the one being the originating or say original judicatory and as such having ordinary jurisdiction over the person in question the other extraordinary and casual jurisdiction the one having jurisdiction over him in home suits the other in extraneously instituted suits instructional art  0 in a case of a conflict of this sort it may happen for example that a person     having been brought before the judge of a certain judicatory in virtue of a mandate issued by him in the course and for the purpose of a suit which had taken its origin in his judicatory a claim may be laid to the examination of him or even the extraduction of him by a suitor in a suit which had originated in a distant judicatory that claim having for its ground correspondent mandate issued by the judge of that same distant judicatory in this case it may be necessary that the judge by and before whom this person is so under examination as aforesaid should for the purpose of deciding to which of the two claims the preference is due take cognizance at the same time of the two different suits—namely that which originated with himself and that which had originated with the abovementioned distant judge here then may be seen a demand for divers regulations of procedure neither the tenor nor even the purport of which belongs to the present purpose but of which for explanation of what does belong to it it seemed necessary that this general indication should be made section viii functions common to judges expositive art   nondistinctive and distinctive—into these two classes may be divided in the first place the aggregate composed of the functions belonging in common to judges expositive art   by nondistinctive understand those which belong in common to judges and to ministers as per ch ix ministers collectively section   functions in all enactive art   to each judge as well appellate as

without the instrumentality of any other person—and exercised by the instrumentality of other persons namely the several subordinates in the judiciary department—into these two classes may be divided the aggregate composed of the distinctive functions of a judge expositive art   purely selfexercised is the judges opinative function as to which see section   judges elementary functions expositive instructional art   by the judges transmissive function understand that to which exercise is given by the intervention of some subordinate functionary by whose instrumentality the locomotion of the subject matter sent or say transmitted whether thing or person is produced expositive instructional art   strictly speaking this same function the transmissive does not belong to the class of distinctive functions exercise being necessarily given to it by all the several functionaries belonging to the administrative department as above but so it is—that the things   0 and persons which constitute the subject matters of the exercise given to it are respectively in the case of each subdepartment belonging to that department a different class of things and persons according to the nature of the business of each such subdepartment whereas of the exercise given to this function in the case of a judge the subject matters are—all things and all persons nearly if not entirely without exception which considered—on the part of the legislator accordingly particular care is requisite in marking out the limits by which the exercise given to it is circumscribed expositive instructional art   in every instance in which exercise is given to the transmissive function so far as it is productive of its intended effect a correspondent function to which exercise is given with reference to the same subject matter is the acceptive and with the intervention of the like intermediate and subordinate functionaries to this function also in relation to those same subject matters may exercise be given by a judge expositive art  0 if of the subject matter in question transmission is considered as having on any anterior occasion been made the function to which exercise is given by the succeeding transmission may be styled the retrotransmissive and so in the case of acception and retroacception expositive instructional art    according to the relative situation of the functionary transmitting or say sending relation had to the functionary sent to transmission will be either à suprà ab infrà or ex æquo and so in regard to acceptance of these modifications the à suprà transmission is the one most essential not to say the only one which is absolutely and independently essential to the situation of a judge expositive instructional art    as to the faculties to which in his intercourse with another functionary or with any other person application is made by a judge—they are either the physical or say corporeal or the psychological or say mental the mental

negative act consisting in abstinence from the performance of some positive act enactive expositive art    exercised by all judges are the several functions to which exercise is given by the issuing

particular of the executive function that being the one to the exercise of which the exercise of all the other functions is subservient elementary functions common to every judicatory including both grades of judicatories immediate and appellate and exercised personally by the judge are the following—   auditive function as applied to oral discourse   lective function as applied to written discourse   inspective function as applied to written discourse or any other visible document   interrogative function orally exercised   interrogative function epistolarily or otherwise

especial manner is this function in relation to the registrar he being the officer by whom or under whose direction permanent account is given of every discourse uttered and every other act exercised

incidentally have place instructional art    note that in a case in which use is made of the assistance of a body of men exercising functions in some sort coinciding with those of a jury as at present

the interrogative orally exercised   the commentative the interrogative epistolarily exercised being omitted and   the ratiocinative may with propriety be made exercisable as to the imperativelydecretive or say ultimatelymandative on the principles of this code this function is for the sake of responsibility cast entire upon the judge for his due exercise of it trust being given to the force of the securities here provided for appropriate aptitude in all points and thence against misconduct in this his situation as to which see section    judges securities c expositive art    elementary functions appertaining exclusively to the judge of an appellate judicatory these which follow they are such modes of the abovementioned ultimatelydecretive functions as bear reference to the exercise made of the corresponding functions on the part of his subordinate the judge of the immediate judicatory i primarilydecretive these to wit—   the simply confirmative   the simply nullifactive as where in a penal suit a defendant having been declared guilty by an immediate judicatory is declared not guilty by the appellate   the reversive as where a thing given to a pursuer by the immediate judicatory is given to the defendant by the appellate   the substitutive as where neither the arrangement prayed by a pursuer nor that prayed by a defendant is made but one different from both   the modificative confirming the subordinate decree in part altering it in any of the above ways as to other parts ii subsidiarilydecretive to wit interlocutorilydecretive these to wit—   the suspensive as to the whole or as to a part or parts   the accelerative or say expeditive exercised in so far as in consequence of application made by a suitor greater despatch than would otherwise be is given to the proceedings of a subordinate judicatory   the sistitive or say retardative   the retrotransmissive or say retromissive whether for the purpose   of receiving execution and effect or   of performance of fresh trial or say inquiry in the immediate judicatory and that whether as to the whole of the facts collectively taken or as to this or that fact exclusively or for the purpose of the execution and effect to be therein given to the decrees and mandates of the subordinate judicatory when and in so far as no otherwise than partially confirmed note that in some instances the above modifications may perhaps be found to coincide and that the five first may be considered as being not distinct and elementary being only     so many modifications of the ultimatelydecretive function exercised as above by the immediate judicatory but in practice in whichsoever of these points of view they are considered will make no difference ratiocinative art    objection the imperative has been stated as a function common to all judges the conciliation judicatory invented in denmark has been applauded and the leading principle of it adopted and employed in various other political states in particular in france by buonapartes codes of its beneficial effects the number of cases finally determined by the danish judicatories afford a demonstration admitting what cannot but be admitted that for a large portion of the field of law and procedure the imperative function must unavoidably be given to the judge even on the first inquiry and that in these danish judicatories and all the judicatories derived from them the opinative decree given by the judicatory is not of itself conclusive but leaves the door open to an application to an ordinary judicatory in which the imperative function is added to the rest—still why not imitate an arrangement the usefulness of which has to the general satisfaction of civilized nations been so adequately demonstrated by experience and accordingly why not employ it in so far as employment has been in that case given to it answer by the judiciary system as here detailed with the imperative function attached in every case to the others exercised by the judge will be done all the good which ever can have been done by any one of these conciliation judicatories and moreover a great deal which constituted as they are it has not been possible for them to do in the first place comes the list of those suits to which it was found unable to give termination compared to those to which it did give termination small it is true were they in number but in respect of the aggregate importance relation had to the pecuniary circumstances of the parties there is no saying how great may have been the ratio of this small minority to what it was in that when without expense a chance for justice were it ever so faint was seen to be obtainable no ground of complaint so frivolous as not to send the claimant to the spot where without any expense but that of time and without any part of that vast load of expense delay and vexation which in all other instances they saw manufactured for the sake of the profit this same chance they saw obtainable deficient and partial and deceptive must have been in many a case the stock of evidence compulsory and thence adequate means of procuring evidence—such evidence as in each individual suit the case happened to furnish—none means of securing genuineness on the part of the real and written evidence none means of securing against mendacity negligence and temerity such personal evidence as was found obtainable—of securing to wit by appropriate and adequate remedies satisfactional and punitional—none judicatory manyseated consumed consequently in superuseful discussions on each individual occasion a quantity of time more or less considerable at the same time their attention withdrawn from the subject by a more or less considerable proportion of the judges on the part of all these judges one excepted waste of time more or less considerable had the singleseated system been established so many meritorious men by each of whom supposing him invested with the imperative function in addition to the rest such service as he was capable of might have been rendered in a separate judicatory and so a correspondent quantity of delay vexation and expense saved to the parties expense yes for time consumed in journeys to and fro and demurrage is expense true it is that in denmark at any rate whatsoever good was in this way done to suitors was done without any expense to the public in the article of remuneration for the judge but even as to this saving if thought proper to be made no reason appears for supposing that under the here proposed system it might not be made of the probability of such economy that very example affords very strongly presumptive evidence serving in that way only as one in a crowd—his influence no more than fractionary and unfortified with any imperative and coercive power—would not the same man be equally ready to render that same service when standing alone and endowed by that supremelyinviting attribute but it will be said of all these men there seems no reason for supposing that there was a single one who to this work of generous supererogation ever gave the whole of his time one would attend on one day another on another just as each found most convenient it may be so and for that reason it is that on the present plan remuneration is provided although by the admission of competition in the case of this service as in the case

judiciary registrar one   transmitted to the office of the apellate judiciary registrar of the appellate judicatory to which the judge immediate in question is subordinate one   transmitted to the justice ministers office one   kept by the locator one   delivered to and kept by the locatee one enactive art    in case of emergency—created for example by sudden calamity or hostility—lest time for acceptance be wanting a judge immediate may by appropriate instruments constitute deputes occasional in any number without any such acceptance a second to serve in default of the first a third to serve in default of the first and second and so on but only in case of emergency will he execute any such instrument and on his responsibility so soon as the emergency has ceased he will cancel the instrument having for that purpose called it in enactive art    locable in the situation of judgedepute is any person whatsoever his locator the judge principal being for such his depute responsible as per arts   and       enactive art    dislocable or suspendible at any time is the judge depute by his principal so likewise by any of the authorities by which the principal is dislocable as per section  0 dislocable how and this—without judicial forms such as those made requisite in and by ch ix ministers collectively section    oppression obviated enactive art    possessed of this same selfsuppletive function are—not only the judges but the several other magisterial functionaries in the judicial department as per section   judiciary functionaries and the several ministerial functionaries subordinate respectively to those same magisterial functionaries instructional ratiocinative art    for the beneficial effects resulting from the allottment of this function to the functionaries belonging to the judicial department and for the proof that no ground has place for any such apprehension as that of a deficiency in the number of apt persons ready and willing to serve in the situation of deputes as above see ch ix ministers collectively section   selfsuppletive function arts       the reasons which apply to the administrational department applying also to the judiciary ratiocinative art      by the here proposed deputation system is afforded the only possible mode of providing sufficiency without superfluity in the number of the judicatories of steering always clear between insufficiency and excess emblem the boots which fitted themselves to every leg   thus are conjoined the maximums of amplitude and frugality   still to exclude abuse requires the legislatures and the publics unremitted vigilance   number deficient proportioned to deficiency is delay and delay in so far as being needless it is wilful is denial of justice deficiency and superfluity may exist together deficiency in one spot superfluity in another and if the field of jurisdiction be parcelled out in the way of logical division both may have place on the same spot some judicatories overloaded others idle and proportioned to superfluity in the number of the judicatories is superfluity in the expense   as to what regards expense under this system of frugality deficiency being apparently at its maximum apprehensions on this score will be apt to present themselves no pay given no workmen it may be thought will be to be had but of these same apprehensions further consideration and experience join in demonstrating the ungroundedness   by being left unpaid service in this shape is not left unrewarded to this judicial situation rewards attached by the nature of the case are—  the distinction—  the power—  reputation rising with good desert     distinction—  power for the value set upon reward in these shapes note several examples i english smalldebt courts called courts of conscience field of jurisdiction narrow as low as  0s power not an integer but a fraction and that so small a one numerator   denominator a score or more while in the situation of judge depute the logical field of jurisdiction is boundless the power integral ii danish conciliation courts logical field wide compared with the above english narrow compared with the one here proposed power fractionized iii english justices of the peace courts examples these too conspicuous to be left unnoticed though by the comparatively small fees and the casual emoluments attached to functions other than their judicial ones the case is rendered not so simple as either of the two abovementioned ones   in the present case to reward in the abovementioned shapes in possession is added in expectancy the independent and superior power with pay by this may be procured more strictness of attendance than could be by any other method for to all who have not submitted to this strictness all access to the pecuniary reward with the independent power is barred   nor yet are the evils of monopoly thus let in for deficiency in the number of these functionaries cannot have place without its being the interest of those who have the power that it should be filled up  0 by every hour of his attendance the deputes capacity of promotion will be brought nearer thus will every act of good desert in this shape bring with it its own reward    moreover relatively considered as between each one and his colleagues each one who bestows the hour will gain an advantage over all who do not and the logical field being at its maximum small must be the local field that will not furnish a demand for deputes permanent more than one or even two    a judge depute permanent will thus be in the condition of an apprentice to whom uniform good behaviour affords a proportionable prospect of being taken into partnership    all having this to gain none have any positive loss to suffer hence will naturally be formed two classes—   closely attendant those who look to office with pay and the superior power say stipendiaries in expectancy   loosely attendant those content with the inferior power without pay the occupation     being agreeable to them so long as the burthen of attendance is not too heavy say gratuitously serving or honorary deputes    a check which of itself applies itself to abuse of the patronage by the judge principal is—that the value of the expectant situations will be inversely as the number of the individuals by whom they are occupied thence whatsoever be his desire power of rendering the number excessive will not accompany it thus stands the matter in the case of the stipendiaries in expectancy    not equally so in the case of the honoraries when pure from burthen the slightest token of honourable distinction is to most men acceptable thus but for some remedy the establishment would be infested with sinecures the sinecurists though they cost no money might in various other ways be mischievous a depute might even be appointed for the purpose of showing undue favour to this or that particular individual    for remedy let every depute permanent be bound to a certain minimum of attendance in the year those who failed to bestow it would silently drop out of the list without the harsh operation of dislocation or resignation in form    the two classes not having any distinctive mark would have no determinate excitement to enmity yet of emulation not only as between individual and individual but as between class and class the service would have the benefit    lest by indolence or ill humour attendance when requisite should be withholden and justice thus delayed power of mulcting for nonattendance after summons might be given to the judge principal    by the suppletive or deputation system aid will be afforded towards the minimization of principals pay if the mere distinction and power of a depute suffices to produce a certain quantity of attendance much greater will be the quantity producible by the addition of pay and superior power and so long as the burthen of attendance is not intolerable the pay may be made less and less and thence greater and greater relish for the occupation and in so far appropriate active aptitude may be secured  0 so if by the bare expectancy of a given quantity of pay a certain quantity of attendance is produced—by immediate possession either increase of attendance or acceptance of diminished pay may be produced    objection true number of aspirants may be abundant and yet considering what in this line of service aptitude is apt aspirants may be altogether wanting if pay in possession or expectancy be not in view    answer—quantum requisite not so rare as might be imagined for in comparison of the actual customary demand under the english technical system the requisite quantum of peculiar knowledge will by allcomprehensive codification be reduced to next to nothing    when adequate appropriate knowledge has thus been rendered common adequate appropriate judgment will not be so rare as to require extra pay    of appropriate active aptitude likewise—the difficulties attached to judgemade law and technical procedure not having place under this code a moderate—a comparatively small quantity—will in this official situation suffice in the profession of an advocate it is even under this system of prime importance that is to say to each individual client section xi judges sedative function enactive art   to the judge in each judicatory belongs the sedative function sedative or say disturbancesuppressive relation had to the business of the judicial theatre expositive art   by the sedative function understand that which has for its object the securing the judicative function against disturbance parties against useless delay and actors on the judicial theatre against needless vexation and annoyance enactive art   in the exercise of this function power is given to the judge in case of necessity to cause eliminate out of the judicial theatre any actor by whose misbehaviour any such disturbance is produced enactive art   so in

on regular outdoorduty as per ch xiii section   or incidentally for the purpose of applying to any individuallyapprehended offence a preventive or to any chronical offence a suppressive remedy the judge carries with him the power of giving exercise to the sedative function in the several modes in this section mentioned instructional ratiocinative art    whatsoever be the branch of service whatsoever the office whatsoever the nature of the service whatsoever the condition of the functionary—indispensable is the necessity of his having in hand sedative power adequate to the purpose of securing against disturbance at the hands of all persons whatsoever the function he is occupied in the exercise of persons in situations superordinate to his own and at the same time possessed of directive power with relation to his own alone excepted if in contemplation of lowness of grade and consequent deficiency in respect of appropriate aptitude there be in any other department in the judiciary any description of functionaries to whom it is not thought advisable to intrust this power—it will rest with the legislature to search them out and by apt and adequate description to render them in this respect effectually distinguishable from all others section xii judges aidcompelling function expositive art   to this function exercise is given when for giving execution and effect to any legislative ordinance through the medium of the judicial authority the physical power of the ministerial subordinate of the judicatory being insufficient or not at hand a demand has place for such other assistance as the state of persons and things furnishes instructional art   of the purposes for which the need of the exercise of this function may have place the following are examples—   discovery or pursuit of a latent or fugitive malefactor or other defendant or proposed defendant   prehension of one from whom resistance has been experienced or is on adequate grounds apprehended       giving termination to a course of conjunct maleficence carrying on to the injury of person or property by malefactors rendered by armature or numbers not otherwise subduable expositive enactive art   a person whose aid is thus called in is thereby to the purpose and to the extent of the occasion constituted as per section   a ministerial officer of justice instructional art   exercise or nonexercise of this function—number of the persons on whom the power attached to it shall be employed—manner in which it shall be employed—as to these several points as on all occasions in general so in this in particular minimize evil will be the directing rule instructional art   accordingly as to choice of persons those will be to be preferred whose services may be thus employed with least detriment as well to their individual concerns and those of persons specially connected with them as to the public service instructional art   exceptions excepted every person is bound on requisition to give aid to any functionary for the purpose of giving execution and effect to any part of the law exceptions are—   where in making the requisitions the functionary in question acts in disobedience to the order or in opposition to the authority of a superordinate of his   where the act which by him is represented as one which if exercised would be of the number of those which would operate in giving execution and effect to the law is not in truth of that number being on the contrary an act of disobedience to the law   where the individual so called upon is restrained by the consideration of his or her bodily weakness   where he or she is restrained by timidity or say mental weakness instructional art   for subduing force males will naturally on this occasion be preferred to females but rather than justice should fail females may be called in when a female is the person on whom execution is to be given to the law a person of the same sex should if circumstances permit be employed in preference to a person of the male sex as where in the exercise of the scrutative function the body is to be searched for subject matters instruments or evidences of delinquency instructional art   among functionaries those belonging to the preventive service will for this purpose be in general the most appropriate objects of choice enactive instructional art   where of a man or body of men belonging to the stipendiary or say professional branch of the defensive force establishment the assistance is called in—the judge or other judiciary functionary will if time permits transmit in writing to the commander under whose immediate orders they are an appropriate instrument styled a mandate in aid in this instrument information will be given of the nature of the exigency and of the temporary command so taken of the man or men so impressed this with or without a mandate directing the commander himself to repair to the spot and afford his assistance enactive instructional art  0 on receipt of such instrument or information to that effect nothing but a wellgrounded apprehension of preponderant evil in some determinate and assigned shape will justify noncompliance of such apprehended evil he will in this case forthwith give intimation also in writing stating the facts by the consideration of which the apprehension has been produced instructional art    examples of grounds of such noncompliance are as follow—   hostile aggression in the quarter in question from a foreign enemy actual or supposed imminent   peremptory order from a superordinate grounded as supposed on similar considerations enactive instructional art    in case of noncompliance if excuse be not given the functionary by whom the mandate has been received will be responsible if given so is he for the adequacy as well as verity of the excuse and in this responsibility may be included eventual obligation to make compensation at his own expense for all damage thereby produced enactive art    not only to a judge but to any other judiciary functionary ministerial as well as magisterial belongs the same function with the power attached he acting in the endeavour to give execution to the law with or even without any special order concomitant or antecedent from the judge enactive art    need of the exercise of this function will still more frequently have place without than with the cognizance of a judge this considered—not only by a judge but by any other judiciary functionary ministerial as well     as magisterial may the function with the power attached be exercised enactive instructional art    help to the law is an appropriate formulary of invitation by which notification may be given of the purpose for which this power is assumed and exercised after these words will come if not known to the party addressed a statement made as effectually as circumstances admit of the individual state of things by which the need has been produced instructional art    in certain cases not only by a judicial functionary but by any person of sound mind may this function and the power belonging to it be exercised with preponderant benefit but to give particular description to these cases and to obviate the abuse to which in such miscellaneous hands it cannot but stand exposed belongs to the penal and civil codes section xiii justice for the helpless instructional art   expense in a pecuniary or what comes to the same thing in a quasipecuniary shape and in particular in the shape of consumption of time is on every occasion as on the one side of the suit so on the other indispensably necessary to the obtainment of judicial service and of this expense more especially on the part of him in whose instance the disbursement is involuntary evil is in a proportionable degree an inseparable accompaniment in some instances indeed if no expense over and above what is necessary be employed so small will be the amount of it that except in so far as consumption of time imports loss of the means of subsistence no exertion on the part of the legislator would be advantageously employed in the endeavour to exclude or compensate the expenditure and thus small may perhaps be found the quantity of it in by far the greatest number of individual instances and so far on his part the only care necessary will be that of avoiding to cause or permit the natural and necessary expenditure to receive any factitious increase instructional art   but on the other hand neither are cases wanting in which no determinate limit can be set to the magnitude of the natural part of this evil no limits are there except those set by the earths circumference to the distance which may have place between the abode of a necessary witness and the place at which his testimony may with greatest or exclusive propriety or even by possibility be delivered scarcely are there any even to the number of witnesses whose testimony may eventually be found material and as it is with distance in place so is it with the quantity of time and the quantity of money that may be necessary for the production of the evidence or the quantity of money that may be necessary for compensation for loss of time on the part of the witnesses instructional art   such being in this respect the unquestionable state of things one consequence is—that without any relief other than such as comes to be afforded by the powers of the publicopinion tribunal the effect of every factitious addition to this natural evil is—to constitute a graduated system of depredation and oppression in all other shapes every rank which stands superior in the scale of opulence exercising by this means a tyrannical dominion over every other whose place is below it instructional art   as to the evil in so far as the expense necessary as above to the support of a just demand or a just defence is wanting—it consists of every evil which man is exposed to either by the want of the protection of the law or on failure of satisfactory legal defence by the power of the law by it a correspondent portion more or less considerable of the whole population of the country is placed in a state of outlawry instructional art   to provide for the exclusion of tyranny thus exercisable by means of superiority of opulence belongs to the constitutional code with no less unquestionable necessity than to provide for the exclusion of the same unjustifiable and miseryproducing dominion when exercised by means of superiority of legal power expositive instructional art   by relative indigence understand inability to defray the abovementioned expense the evil attached to it as above takes a different shape according as it is on the pursuers side or the defendants side that the indigence has place on the pursuers side the evil is different according as the indigence is original or incidental original where the effect is to prevent a person who would have entered upon the career of judicial pursuit from doing so—call this therefore moreover the extrajudicial evil incidental when falling upon a person who is actually engaged in that career it prevents him from continuing in it call this the judicial evil in this last case to the suffering from the loss of right and remedy is added the suffering from the impoverishment especially if as is so frequently the case that same impoverishment had the expense of the suit for the sole or principal cause of it instructional art   of every such act of depredation or oppression thus exercised as above the legislator   0 who whether through design or negligence omits to apply such remedy as the nature of the case admits of renders himself thereby an accomplice what if to that mass of expense which of itself grows out of the nature of the case he adds a factitious mass created by him either directly by his own hands or what comes to the same thing indirectly by those of other persons thus acting under his eyes and orders instructional art   thus far as to the mode in which the evil is produced where the indigence is on the pursuers side in so far as it is on the defendants side the law is an instrument of the evil not merely in a negative but actually in a positive way in this case any person who finding himself in a state of relative opulence chooses to take for this purpose a station on the pursuers side is thus by the power which the legislator and the judge offer to his hands enabled to inflict on every person relatively indigent whom he has any desire thus to injure suffering in any shape in which against a demand requiring it to be submitted to whether on the score of alleged guilt or otherwise he is by want of the necessary pecuniary supply bereft of the means of making what would be regarded a satisfactory defence here then is a tyranny of which the powers of the legislator and that of the judge are in a more direct way the instruments instructional art   in this case the distinction between the original and the incidental evil as above has place likewise in neither case however can it be termed extrajudicial in both cases it is strictly and purely judicial in both cases it is exclusively of legal and judicial manufacture by the express ordinance or what comes to the same thing by the tacit allowance of the legislator the power of the judge being the very instrument by which the evil is produced instructional art  0 an exception may appear to be presented by those cases in which for conviction positive proof of delinquency is made necessary the circumstantial and negative proof afforded by nonappearance or nondefence not being taken for conclusive but even when positive proof is thus made requisite the same disastrous consequence may be the foreseen and preassured result of relative indigence in the case of a criminal prosecution the innocence of the defendant would be made manifest suppose by true and conclusive evidence if produced but the production of it cannot be effected without expense and he has not wherewithal to defray that expense much less to defray the expense of a prosecution as for perjury against false witnesses if engaged on the pursuers side in this condition every adversary who is profligate enough to be ready to take advantage of it beholds in him a victim to whom escape from destruction is impossible instructional art    hitherto under every known government the expense which is the instrument of tyranny in this shape stands distinguishable into the two abovementioned branches—the natural and the factitious the factitious the respective rulers will extirpate whensoever it shall have become their pleasure to cease acting as accomplices in every crime it will stand excluded of course in every code the arrangements of which are determined by the principle laid down in the present constitutional code instructional art    to the ulterior task of minimizing the natural branch of the evil a necessary preliminary is—the investigation of the sources from which the expense takes its rise—the occasions on which and the purposes for which the need of it has place instructional art    these ascertained the only courses—which on this occasion the nature of the case admits of for the minimization of evil—will be reducible to these three   minimizing on the several occasions the quantity of expense actually bestowed   as to such part as cannot but be bestowed placing it upon those shoulders on which by a given quantity of forced expense the least quantity of affliction is produced   as to such part of it as is thus applied laying it upon those in whose instance—in compensation or part compensation to the public of which they are a part for the affliction thus produced—the disposition made of it produces in the way of repression of greater evil by the spectacle of that same affliction the beneficial effect of punishment instructional art    the operations by which the quantity of forced expense being given the affliction is diminished and minimized are these two to wit   the imposing the burthen upon the public fund that is to say upon the whole community in the aggregate   as between two litigants occupying different stations in the scale of opulence imposing it in proportions correspondent to the height of their respective situations expositive art    of any such monies as shall have come to be provided by government for the defraying of the natural and necessary portion of the expense of litiscontestation on both sides—the aggregate mass will compose what may be styled the equal justice fund     expositive art    in this fund may be comprised two distinguishable branches   the regular or say the principal   the incidental eventual or supplemental branch expositive enactive art    i regular branch this will be composed of the produce of pecuniary penalties imposed for transgression in any shape by any person whose presence ranks him among the actors on the judicial theatre as per section   but more particularly on parties on both sides in case of transgression in any shape in which it is susceptible of the denomination of an offence against justice more especially in the case of those transgressions to which the several denominations of wrongful juridical vexation and juridical falsehood or say juridical false assertion are applicable expositive art    i wrongful juridical vexation—its modifications are   juridical vexation criminal—accompanied with criminal consciousness or say consciousness of wrong   juridical vexation culpable—accompanied with culpable inadvertence thence with temerity or say with rashness in this case not accompanied with actual consciousness of wrong but carried on in such circumstances that if accompanied with that sort and degree of care which ought to have been bestowed upon the case and may without undue hardship be exacted would it is presumed have sufficed to prevent the vexatious conduct from taking place in each of these two shapes wrongful juridical vexation may have place alike on the pursuers and on the defendants sides expositive art    ii juridical false assertion juridical vexation is a species of transgression not commissible to any considerable extent by any person other than a party to the suit juridical false assertion is a transgression into which a party in his character of witness and an extraneous witness are equally liable to fall incidentally also any other of the different sorts of actors on the judicial theatre modifications are—  mendacious assertion   insincere assertion   temerarious or say rash assertion between mendacious and insincere assertions both being accompanied with evil consciousness to wit on the part of the assertor consciousness of the falsity of his own assertion—between these two modes of falsehood the difference is—that in the case of insincerity the subject matter of the assertion is a fact belonging to that class of which his own mind is the field in the case of mendacity any other sort of fact whatsoever as to mendacious assertion under the as yet established systems seldom is it made punishable unless where the name of perjury has been given to it this is where in the instance of the assertor it has been accompanied by the ceremony called the making oath or taking an oath but in this case to the making a beneficial application of the matter of punishment neither this nor any other ceremony it is evident is necessary confining the application of the punishment for mendacity to the case where this ceremony has been performed is licensing and by means of the profit which the evildoer is enabled to reap from it rewarding encouraging and suborning mendacity in all cases in which while consequences beneficial to the false assertor are given to the assertor the performance of the ceremony is not exacted instructional ratiocinative art  0 the expense of remuneration for the service of judicial functionaries constitutes it may here be said a portion of the aggregate expense of a suit and for this item it may be observed no provision is included in the plan of the abovementioned fund considered in either of its branches only however in outside appearance does this portion of the expense belong to any one suit any more than to another only in outside appearance are the benefits derived from it enjoyed by one description of litigants more than by another or by litigants in the aggregate more than by nonlitigants in fact of the two classes in the aggregate mass of benefit derived from the services of this class of functionaries the class of nonlitigants enjoy by much the greatest share since whatsoever security they enjoy for their respective possessions is enjoyed by them altogether free from those drawbacks which have place in the case of litigants insomuch that were the separation possible equal justice would require that every litigant to whose proceedings on the occasion of the suit no blame could be imputed should be exonerated from his portion of the expense of such remuneration and the whole burthen of it be cast upon those by whom their share in the aggregate benefit of this same security is enjoyed without being subjected to any such afflictive alloy to throw upon litigants the whole or any superior share of the burthen of the judicial establishment is no more reconcileable to justice and the greatest happiness principle than would be the throwing on the occasion of every war the whole burthen of the military establishment and military defence upon a thin line of frontier or the imposing a tax on sickness in each shape so much for every fit of the rheumatism so much for every stone extracted or endeavoured to be extracted in addition to the tax on medicines—see protest against law taxes vol ii p     et seq instructional expositive art    this considered whatsoever portion of the government receipts is employed in defraying the expense of this remuneration     together with that of the stock employed in the same service may be denominated by the appellation of the ordinary justice fund while the portion of those same receipts employed in facilitating the access to justice on the part of the otherwise helpless may be distinguished from it by the appellation of the extraordinary justice fund instructional art    in the application of punishment on this occasion to the repression of the evils produced by means of a pernicious direction given to the hand of justice no more reserve need be used than in the application of it to the repression of evil in the like shape produced by wrongdoers at large without the aid of any such irresistible hand of the quantum of the pecuniary burthen imposed as yet on this occasion in all established systems and with very little of that discrimination which from the very first might and therefore ought to be made between the injurer and the injured—imposed that is to say by that part of the expenses called costs of suit which is purely factitious a small portion would in all probability be found sufficient if confined in its application to such wrongdoers whose delinquency operates in one or other of the shapes justmentioned expositive art    ii supplemental branch this will be composed of such monies as in case of deficiency in the regular branch the government shall have provided from other sources instructional expositive art    to these supplies to both of which the employment of the coercive power of government is necessary may come to be added such as may be afforded by a supplemental and voluntary branch added to this same equal justice fund expositive art    by the voluntary branch of the equal justice fund understand the aggregate of such monies as for this purpose shall have been furnished by voluntary contributions instructional ratiocinative art    in ordinary cases the two government branches will it is assumed suffice and for these cases any such fund as the voluntary fund would be manifestly needless and thence of course unproductive but cases there are in which though in a certain point of view supplies would be useful supplies from the government fund would be inapplicable of the government fund the application must necessarily be lodged in certain official hands but what will every now and then be happening is that in the eyes of this or that individual in his quality of member of the publicopinion tribunal supplies out of this fund having been refused by the appointed public functionaries the refusal has been ill grounded so many as there are of these instances so many are the occasions on which contributions to the equal justice fund may with more or less assurance be looked for from voluntary hands and by the establishment of this resource a more or less efficient security against partial or otherwise undue refusals will be seen to be afforded instructional art    as to the official hands to which it will on these occasions belong to apply for and eventually obtain allowances out of the public funds—see ch xviii government advocates section   moneyrequisitive function and ch xx eleemosynary advocates section   moneyrequisitive function instructional art    of the occasions on which in the breasts of individuals the disposition to make such contribution may be expected to be called into action examples are as follows—   injurers funds insufficient for compensation to the injured   pursuit or defence just and need of evidence real but the evidence remote and in the opinion of the public functionaries—guardians of the public purse—the evil of misdecision its degree of probability being taken into account likely to be outweighed by the evil of the expense necessary to obviate it supposing the expense charged on the public   in regard to appeal the losing party unable to defray the expense but in the opinion of the public functionaries the ground for appeal not sufficiently strong to warrant the charging the public with it for the course here pursued for minimizing the expense of appeal see ch xxii appellate judicatories instructional ratiocinative art    by supplies inappositely allotted to this purpose evil might be created in such quantity as to outweigh the good resulting from the exclusion of the evil thus endeavoured to be excluded for the arrangements taken for the obviating of danger from this source see the procedure code such would be the evil effect if for want of sufficient means of repression mendacious assertion employed in support of applications for money for the purposes here in question were permitted to have their designed effect but as on other occasions so on this mendacity is capable of being in an adequate degree repressed by appropriate arrangements and in the procedure code connected with the present constitutional code arrangements of hitherto unexampled efficiency will it is believed be found comprised instructional art  0 as to the provision made of an eleemosynary advocate for litigants of this     class the principle from which the arrangements proposed under this head and those in ch xx eleemosynary advocates and also in title costs ch xx in the procedure code are derived—is now for the first time offered to universal notice it is the same which in anno      in the work on the judicial establishment written and printed for the use of france though not then published in england gave birth to the justmentioned proposed official situation under the not altogether apposite appellation of defender general instructional art    in all hitherto established systems of judicial warfare—partly through negligence partly by design the relatively helpless have in the lump been left without defence the relatively helpless that is to say everywhere the vast majority of the people although in relation to judicature to leave a man without defence is on the part of government to deny him justice instructional art    under these same systems not only have those who of themselves are destitute of the necessary means of supply for the natural expense of litiscontestation been left unprovided with those means but to that same natural expense factitious expense has in various shapes and in various degrees of enormity been added instructional art    here then is injustice—injustice in the shape of sinister partiality—established by express law—established upon an allcomprehensive scale injustice to the many to and for the benefit of the few exemplificational art    in monarchies pure and mixed but most of all in the mixed monarchy of england oppression in this shape is manifestly and undeniably the result of design and system in the only representative democracy as yet fully established in the angloamerican united states—in so far as it still has place it is the mixed result of design and negligence design on the part of the lawyer tribe on the part of nonlawyers design in some namely the richer classes negligence and ignorance on the part of the rest instructional art    the present proposed code has therefore for its objects not only the keeping excluded all such factitious expense but also the providing means for defraying on every occasion as far as may be the natural expense after having done as much as the nature of the case is found to admit of towards minimizing it enactive art    in every justice chamber let there be kept in a conspicuous situation accessible to the actors on the judicial theatre an instrument of appropriate relief namely a receptacle provided for the receipt of voluntary contributions and designated in conspicuous letters by the words equal justice box instructional art    additional means of productiveness to the equal justice fund are these—i instructions from the legislature to judges instructions to give in each individual case assigned reasons to the contrary excepted preference to pecuniary punishment as compared with punishment in other shapes saving the preference due to compensation and satisfaction in other shapes to individuals wronged for rules and reasons see penal code title remedies instructional art    ii instructions in like manner to government advocates instructions to keep watch in this point of view over the conduct of litigants and as often as delinquency in any one of the shapes here in question presents itself as having had place to call for punishment in this shape exceptions as above excepted at the hands of the judge section xiv publicity recordation and publication instructional ratiocinative art   special demand for secrecy excepted and that never otherwise than temporary of which see the penal civil and procedure codes the leading principles of this constitution require that for the information of the several constituted authorities—of every judicial proceeding as well while carrying on as thenceforward the publicity be maximized in the darkness of secrecy sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate where there is no publicity there is no justice instructional art   to the purpose of contemporaneous but evanescent publicity serves the presence of the several actors on the judicial theatre as enumerated in section   and in particular that of the appointed judicial visiters as per ch xvii judicial inspectors instructional art   for the purpose of subsequential and indefinitely permanent publicity a system of registration to be pursued on all occasions under a preappointed set of heads will be seen in ch xxi immediate and appellate registrars     and more fully in the procedure code attached to the penal and civil codes as to the principle and the mechanical means see ch viii prime minister section  0 registration system section    publication system see also ch ix ministers collectively section   statistic function instructional art   for the exclusion of evil in various shapes exclusion of contemporaneous publicity will on various occasions be found necessary but in these cases the light of publicity will be but covered up for a time it will not be extinguished section xv secret intercourse obviated enactive art   in no private missive addressed to or designed to be read or heard by a judge should any discourse be inserted tending in any way to influence his conduct as a judge on the occasion or for the purpose of any individual suit or other application instituted or contemplated enactive art   any missive having for its design or tendency the exercising any such undue influence the judge will not fail to make known at his next sitting or at the time in art   hereinafter mentioned enactive art   if of such missive the whole has such design or tendency he will forthwith communicate it to the registrar that it may be read as above in open judicatory and the original kept with the register books if only a part or parts he will communicate to the registrar every such part and cause him to make entry of a copy of it enactive art   if after having received any such missive the judge omits to give publicity to it as above—any person by whom the same was written or any person by whom before or after its having been received by the judge it was seen may upon his responsibility appear in open judicatory in the character of an applicant and put questions to the judge as to his having received it enactive art   if in any such missive there be any portion of discourse having for its design or tendency the influencing the conduct of the judge as such by hope of good or fear of evil at the hands of the writer or any person on whose behalf he thus writes—the writer and every person privy to the intention of its being conveyed to the judge will be deemed to have thereby intended and endeavoured to practice corruption on the part of the judge and in the character of a conniver the judge unless he makes the receipt of such missive known as above will be deemed to have participated in the offence enactive art   periodically to wit on the first day of every week the judge at the opening of the judicatory will make known every such undue address as in the course of the preceding week shall as above have been received together with all such others as although received have in any former week whether by design or accident failed to be made known if no one such has been received he will make declaration to that effect enactive art   if with any such design as that of wasting the time of the judicatory and thereby producing to the damage of persons known or unknown denial or delay of justice—missives composed of or containing impertinent matter be addressed as above to the judge—every person by whom or by whose procurement or instrumentality such missive was written or knowingly conveyed will be responsible compensationally or punitionally or in both ways as the case may require in the same manner as for a personal application having the same sinister purpose enactive art   at the time of such periodical declaration as above or earlier the judge should any such undue address as per art   have been made to him by word of mouth or otherwise than in writing will in like manner make the same known mentioning in each instance the individual addressing together with all such others as are known or believed by him to have been present or otherwise at the making of the address and in so far as the importance of the matter shall have warranted the time and labour necessary he will be expected to have made a minute of the tenor or purport of the address at the time or so soon after as convenience would admit section xvi partiality obviated enactive art   if in any judicatory immediate or appellate a suit should arise in which the judge has a known and acknowledged interest he will of course transfer the cognizance of it to a depute choosing some one in the choice of whom the parties on both sides are agreed if any such there be if not some depute originally located by some preceding judge in preference to any one originally located by himself if it be in an immediate judicatory     the judicatory it is transferred to will for minimization of delay vexation and expense be some of the contiguous judicatories but by consent of all parties the transference may be made to any judicatory whatsoever should it happen that no depute not regarded as impartial can be obtained the suit will on the petition of any party be transferred to another judge if it be in an immediate judicatory by the judge appellate if it be in an appellate judicatory by the justice minister expositive instructional art   partiality may with reference to the person in question be either favourable or otherwise in every case it will have had for its internal cause some interest if favourable a selfregarding or sympathetic interest if adverse an antipathetic interest of a partiality adverse to one side the effect may be the same as a partiality in favour of the other in any one of these cases be the particular cause known or unknown the existence of some such corruptive cause may in some cases be conclusively inferred from its effects instructional art   on the conduct of the judge the effect may be the same or nearly the same whether the seat of the interest be in the judges own breast or in that of some other individual with whom he is connected by some special tie whether of selfregarding or sympathetic interest—for example a wife offspring parent or other near relation in the direct or collateral line a patron a protêgé or an intimate friend enactive art   if by exposure to the action of seductive interest in any shape as above partiality is by a party on either side of the suit regarded as liable to have place in the situation of the judge—to such party belongs the power of putting to the judge all apt questions by which the existence or nonexistence of such exposure may be established so also to every other party on both sides as in an immediate so in an appellate judicatory enactive art   on this occasion the judge removes from the judgmentseat to the seat appointed for that side in favour of which partiality is regarded as liable to have place at the same time for the deciding as to the existence of the exposure the government advocate the eleemosynary advocate and the registrar place themselves on the judgmentseat and constitute a judicatory a majority determining the decrees enactive art   if the decision be in affirmance of the exposure the judicatory locates some other person for the cognizance of the suit as per art   unless trusting to eventual appeal all parties concur in a petition that the suit may remain in the cognizance of the judge notwithstanding or—in an immediate judicatory a party on one side applies to the judge appellate to transfer the cognizance of the suit to the judge of some other immediate judicatory in an appellate he applies to the justice minister to transfer it to some other appellate judicatory instructional art   if to any such cause of partiality his situation stands exposed as above—the judge will do well to consign of his own accord the suit to some depute on this special ground stating at the same time the nature of the situation and of the temptation to which it stands exposed and this—whether the depute be the object of his special choice or one on whom the cognizance has devolved in virtue of some general rule enactive instructional art   on the occasion of the examination of a judge by a party as above—whoever officiates as judge will have to consider and inquire whether it may not be productive of material delay especially if for counterevidence to the declaration of the interrogated judge extraneous evidence be adduced or tendered if so he will thereupon take such measures as may be necessary to prevent predominant evil in consequence of such delay enactive art   rather than a suit should be heard and determined though it were only in the first instance by a judge suspected of partiality—if it be a judge immediate the appellate judge will therefore on petition from a party on either side transfer the cognizance to some other immediate judicatory choosing by preference one if such there be which all parties concur in preferring and employing on the occasion the facilities afforded as per section   by intercommunity of judicial service if it be a judge appellate the justice minister as above enactive art  0 if before the termination of an appeal the judge appealed from is constituted judge of the appellate judicatory in such sort as that a decree could not be passed without his having to sit in judgment on his own acts—cognizance of the appeal will have place as follows—   if it has been already assigned to a depute of the judge appellate it will remain with such judge depute enactive art      if not it will be taken by the judge appellate depute if there be but one or if there be more than one by the senior in service     enactive art      if there be no judge depute capable of serving it will on petition of any party be transferred to another appellate judicatory as per art   instructional art    if to the action of any cause of partiality the situation of a judge depute permanent to whom a suit is about to be consigned is recognised by him as standing exposed—he will do well spontaneously to declare it and on that account decline cognizance enactive art    if for the purpose of ascertaining the existence or nonexistence of such exposure questions as per art   be put to him the principal or some other depute will take his place and unless in consequence of the examination the cognizance be remitted to him hear and determine the suit in his stead instructional art    to no considerable extent have these measures of prevention been applied in the established law of any state their efficacy if applied accounts for this the assumption always has been that at a certain height in the scale of authority the functionary is temptation and corruption proof exemplificational art    in france not only in the modern postrevolutionary but in the ancient anterevolutionary codes a judge whose situation is not in the highest grade is declared liable to be pris à partie as the phrase is—presented on the ground of his having conducted himself as a party in the suit but on the part of a judge in the highest grade all such injustice is tacitly assumed to be impossible the greater the facility of transgression the less the probability such is the logic of this assumption instructional exemplificational art    under the english system on the part of certain inferior grades the capacity of transgressing is admitted and thence exposure to eventual punishment is in form established but the supreme grades in which no such capacity is admitted but impeccability assumed are abundant examples—   house of lords judicatory members not punishable but by a majority of their own body the consequence is the majority are unpunishable   so in the house of commons   the judges of the westminster hall judicatories next below the house of lords of these though declared punishable none can be punished but by the commons with the concurrence of the king and the lords thus then though in form they are declared to be peccable they are in effect still more assuredly unpunishable as to any question relating to exposure to seductive and corruptive influence on the part of any public functionary nothing could be more shockingly indecorous the blood would boil at the bare mention of it justice has its use and value in some cases and at the charge of the lower orders it should be executed with inflexible strictness but when opposed to decorum and dignity it shrinks into insignificance   applied to the inferior situation of justice of the peace considered as such the objection of indecorum and indignity applies not with such force it is not however but in a case peculiarly flagrant nor then but with extreme reluctance that in case of a complaint of any injustice exercised by them the sort of redress such as it is is administered by the court of kings bench nor can any such complaint be made but at an expense which not one out of some hundreds exposed to the injustice are able to defray section xvii migration instructional ratiocinative art   the judicial migration system has for its object or end in view the obviating the danger of misconduct in respect of any of the ends of justice on the part of a judicial functionary in consequence of connexions formed by him in the way of selfregarding interest or affections contracted in the way of sympathy or antipathy from length of intercommunication in the territory in which he is judge instructional ratiocinative art   it applies in a more particular manner to the situation of judge appellate as well as immediate but it includes moreover the several situations of government advocate and eleemosynary advocate in both grades principally in consideration of the influence which by their conduct may be exercised on that of the judge enactive art   under this system in no judicatory will any judge remain or say be commorant more than three solar years with the addition of a fraction of another the immediate judge will migrate from subdistrict to subdistrict the appellate from district to district expositive art   such migration will be either stated or incidental the stated migration is that which takes place on a certain day of every year this day is styled the stated periodical or annual judicialmigrationday an incidental migration is that which being produced by some intervening cause has place on any     other day of the year the period of time of which such day is the first day and the last day of that same solar year the last day constitutes the fragment which in such case will be added to the three solar years to constitute the commoration time of the judge in that judicatory enactive expositive art   justice ministers migrationdirective function in the exercise of this function the justice minister gives directions to the course taken by the migration system in its application to all the several functionaries comprised in it at all times by such direction transference is made of the several functionaries from one judicatory to another and their migration thus effected expositive art   the stated migration day which as applying to all the several functionaries may be termed also the general migration day is the first day of every solar year enactive art   of incidental transference and migration causes on specific grounds in each case assigned may be the following—   representation from the prime minister   representation from any sublegislature   petition by any judgeable of the judge in question   petition from any other magisterial functionary belonging to the same judicatory   in the case of a judge immediate representation from his judge appellate   in the case of a judge appellate petition from any one of his judge immediates   petition from the judge himself in case of his desiring to be transferred enactive art   every such representation and petition will be on grounds assigned of which mention will be made in the instrument of transference to wit the mandate by which the migration is directed the judge having liberty and opportunity to contest the transference enactive expositive art   migration mandate this is the denomination given to the instrument of transference by which the judicatory to which the judge to whom it is addressed is to migrate is declared in it the ground of the transference in the mind of the minister—the considerations whereby he has been disposed to accede to the request are also declared in the first instance it will only be provisional liberty and sufficient time for contestation will be allowed to the judge instructional art  0 in pursuance of the object of this system as per art   it will be among the cares of the justice minister that on the occasion of each migration between the territory from which and the territory to which a judge is transferred there be in so far as the system of territorial division permits one such territory at least intervening in the case of the immediate judge one subdistrict in the case of the appellate judge one district instructional art    on the other hand for obviating needless delay vexation and expense on the occasion of the removal he will avoid giving unnecessary increase to evil in those several shapes by any needless magnitude of distance between the territory from which and the territory to which the migration is made to take place expositive instructional art    in the case of a functionary transferred as above for the first time his commoration time will of course be reckoned from the day of his location in such his office in the case of a functionary transferred for any other than the first time it will be reckoned from the time of the last of his migrations if more than one or if not more than one from that one instructional art    in determining the length of commoration which upon the whole it may be advisable to allow and the distance which it may be advisable to require between the place of a former and that of a subsequent commoration—consideration it is evident will require to be had of magnitude in respect of territory population and judges remuneration the larger the territories in proportion to the density of the population the less the danger from length of commoration and the greater the inconvenience attendant on removals instructional art    among the checks meant to be applied to the conduct of every judge is that which may eventually be applied by the observation made thereof by his comrades in office—to wit the government advocate and the eleemosynary advocate in conjunction with those other constant inspectors provided in and by ch xvii under the denomination of judicial inspectors lest by a too long continued association the efficiency of this check be impaired—it will be among the cares of the legislature so to order the migration that no government advocate or eleemosynary advocate shall by commoration or transference be located in the same judicatory with the same judge for any greater length of time than the maximum of his commoration time as per art   enactive instructional ratiocinative art    for carrying into effect this design     with the greater convenience the justice minister may assign to any number of government advocates and eleemosynary advocates a shorter commoration than that which in art   is mentioned as the minimum but on any such occasion lest inferences unfavourable to the reputation of any of the persons concerned should be deduced he may do well to cause to be determined by lot the places to which the transferences shall respectively be performed enactive expositive art    annual judicial service calendar this denomination is given to the instrument by which in pursuance of the migration system the justice minister makes declaration of the judges government advocates and eleemosynary advocates who in the several judicatories immediate and appellate will have to serve during the coming solar year enactive instructional art     days antecedent to the general and annual migration day of the ensuing solar year—the justice minister will cause an exemplar of the judicial service calendar for that year to be transmitted in print to each of the several judicatories immediate and appellate in such sort that in that judicatory which is the most distant from the seat of government it shall have been received  days before the day on which in and for that same judicatory the migration journey is to take place enactive art    in every such annual judicial service calendar appropriate matter will be entered under the heads following—   name of the territory of the judicatory of the subdistrict in the case of an immediate judicatory of the district in the case of an appellate judicatory   names of the several judges government advocates and eleemosynary advocates serving for the ensuing solar year   mention made whether by commoration or migration   year month and day of the commencement of their respective commoration terms in that judicatory   days on which migrations are expected to commence   in case of migration—judicial territories and judicatories to which the migration is to be made   days on which they are expected to have arrived at those several judicatories enactive instructional art    mode of determining the migration after the commoration has expired in such number of instances as he thinks fit the justice minister will by his own choice determine into what other territories each functionary whose commoration term in the situation occupied by him has expired shall be transferred and migrate in such other instances if any as he thinks fit he may cause such determination to be made by lot for which purpose he will cause an appropriate lottery to be drawn on some such day as may afford time enough for the transmission of the annual service calendar as per art    enactive instructional art  0 at all times antecedent to such day of transmission as per art    an application containing reasons in writing or print for or against the transference or nontransference of any such functionary to the judicatory and the situation therein mentioned may be transmitted by any person or persons to and received by the justice minister such application will be either a transferenceproposing a transferencesupporting or a transferenceopposing application but of every such application adequate information must be contained in the aforesaid judicial calendar as in the case of a missive having for its object the influencing the decision of a judge as per section    secret intercourse obviated and section    partiality obviated instructional art    of the matter of the information contained in the judicial service calendar as above described as much will be exhibited at a view that is to say on one side of the same sheet of paper as can be so exhibited consistently with convenience in respect of legibility the whole if within that space the whole can conveniently be contained if not the separation may be made—either by separating from the matter which belongs to the immediate judicatories the matter which belongs to the appellate judicatories or by separating that which belongs to the grade of judicatories in one portion of the whole territory of the state from that which belongs thereto in this or that other portion of the whole territory of the state enactive expositive art    incidental location and migration report in this document is contained a statement of the instances in which during a certain portion of time in pursuance of mandates of transference at times other than the general migration day migrations have taken place enactive art    on the first day of each solar year for the information of the legislature and the public at large the justice minister will cause to be exposed for sale in print exemplars of an incidental location and migration report stating the incidental migrations which have taken place in the course of the last year     enactive art    in this document will be contained matter under the heads following—   in alphabetical order names of the subdistricts and districts into which in the course of that same year migrations have taken place   under the head of each such territory names of the several judiciary magisterial functionaries whether judge government advocate or eleemosynary advocate so transferred   day on which in virtue of the transference the functionarys commoration term took its commencement   cause of the change of possession whether it was by location for the first time that the new possessor came in or by migration if by migration the territory from which the transference and consequent migration took place   in case of transference the cause of it if a vacancy occasioned by death of the predecessor mentioning the death if by dislocation of the last occupant mentioning him and the cause of the dislocation if by transference and migration of the last occupant mentioning the cause or ground of the transference as per art     so likewise the person or persons by whose application it was produced   also the day on which such application was received   also the grounds on which it was made   the day on which the decree of the justice minister on the subject of those grounds was declared  0 if it were without any such application that the transference was made mention will be made of the considerations on which in the mind of the justice minister it was grounded enactive art    in the migration system the registrar is not comprised instructional ratiocinative art      the reasons which apply to the situation of the judge do not apply to the situation of the registrar the decision is in every case that of the judge only the acts of the registrar being subject to his direction no decision of his is in any direct way or to a certainty in any case determined by the will of the registrar   it is of importance that the business of registration be as far as conveniently may be carried on in one uninterrupted stream on one uniform plan by one and the same locally experienced hand   unless by undue influence a document of this sort is not liable to be vitiated by him to whose keeping it is consigned otherwise than by some flagrant and never probable crime instructional art    but forasmuch as under favour of the talent acquired by experience an old established registrar might possibly be capable of exercising with sinister effect an influence on the decisions of a succession of judges—it might perhaps be advisable that the power of transference for specially alleged cause should in the case of this situation also be given to the justice minister a power to this effect would not be likely to be frequently called into exercise still less to be abused the bare apprehension of it would be sufficient to secure the effect desired instructional art    in the several cases of the government advocate and the eleemosynary advocate—forasmuch as scarcely on any occasion will the decision of the judge depend directly and purely upon any act of either of these functionaries migration is accordingly in their several situations also of less importance than in that of the judge as to any sinister connexion between him and them or either of them it might perhaps therefore be sufficiently obviated by his migration alone they respectively continuing stationary in the same judicatory for a longer commoration time or even during life instructional art    as the system of stated migration cannot if adopted take effect till at least three years after the institution of a judicial establishment upon any such plan as that here proposed there will necessarily be that time at least for the making of the preparatory arrangements but if even though not determined upon it were contemplated—it might be proper in each instrument of location to make mention of it as capable of being put in force and acted upon instructional art  0 as to incidental transference the utility of it will stand upon its own grounds whatsoever be the determination in regard to stated migration instructional art    all this while an inconvenience inseparable from the migration system—nor that an inconsiderable one—is that which will to a certain extent be necessitated by the concomitant transference of one and the same suit from one judge to another the evil consequence is—that to the succeeding judge any orallydelivered evidence and arguments that had been presented in that immediate way and best shape to his predecessor cannot without dilatory and expensive repetition be presented in that same best shape along with those presented in that same way to himself instructional art    but if ever so considerable never can it constitute a ground of objection in the  00 mouth of any partisan of any as yet existing judicial establishment and correspondent system of judicial procedure under no such system does the lessening of it appear to have in any instance been in any degree an object of endeavour or so much as desire instructional art    on the other hand in the here proposed judiciary system and the procedure code connected with it provision is in divers ways made for the minimization of this same inconvenience instructional art    by the allpervading practice of minuting down as per section    all the evidence which in an oral form ever comes to the ears of a judge together with the arguments in so far as shall be thought material and this in a mode the expense of which is minimized as per ch viii prime minister section  0 registration system—all evidence delivered in a judicatory is in the best shape possible delivered to the judge that hears it and to every succeeding judge in the next best shape instructional art    by the institution of judge deputes as per ch xiv xv means are afforded for minimizing the number of the instances in which such transference will have to take place in the case of every stated migration the term having been long foreseen—it will be among the cares of the migrating judge to avoid as much as possible the giving in his own person commencement to suits to which he is not in this same way likely to give termination it will be an object with him to clear his hands as far as may be of all those to which he has given commencement turning over fresh ones as they occur to his deputes section xviii incidental complaintbook expositive art   incidental is the attribute given to the species of complaint in question in contradistinction to any which would be of such a nature as to form the matter of an appeal i e a complaint calling for a decision opposite in the whole or in part to a decision pronounced by the judge appealed from expositive instructional art   examples are as follows—   vituperative language employed by a judge in speaking to or of a party or an extraneous witness   menacing language if expressed in terms of wrath or giving intimation of an intention actual or eventual to subject the party to any infliction other than that which the tenor of the law and appropriate use made of the latitude allowed by the law to the discretion of the judge admit of   with perplexing and vexatious frequency interrupting a party in the course of his pursuit or defence   forcibly putting a final period to the speech of a party or his substitute or assistant in the course of his pursuit or defence such speech not having in it at the time of the interruption matter irrelevant or in any other way improper   letting pass unrepressed treatment injurious to a party or witness in the above or any other ways by a party or a substitute or assistant gratuitous or professional to a party on either side of the suit or by any functionary magisterial or ministerial attached to the judicatory ratiocinative art   for security to all persons against incidental vexation by judges and other judicial functionaries—in the exercise of their respective functions or otherwise by means of the power attached to their respective situations—and in particular while any proceeding in a justice chamber is carrying on—for this cause it is that the remedy afforded by the incidental complaintbook is provided enactive art   to the registrar it belongs to provide and keep at all times accessible to all persons a separate and appropriate register book thus denominated enactive art   if by a judge in the exercise of his functions or with reference express or virtual made thereto any discourse be uttered or any act done whereby any individual regards himself or any other individual or the whole community or any class thereof aggrieved or about to be aggrieved it is the duty of the registrar at the instance of such individual forthwith to make or cause make entry of the minute thereof in the incidental complaintbook having special care in so far as discourse is the subject of complaint to set down the very words accompanying it in every case with a statement made of all such states of things discourses and other acts and events information of which shall be necessary to a clear correct and complete conception of the true nature of the case enactive art   of every such incidental complaintminute if it be in an immediate judicatory exemplars written in the manifoldmode as per ch viii prime minister section  0 registration system will on the responsibility of the judge and the registrar be disposed of as follows—     transmitted to the appellate judge one  0      transmitted to the justice minister one     delivered to the complainant one     kept in the registry one enactive art   if it be in an appellate judicatory—     transmitted to the justice minister one     delivered to the complainant one     kept in the registry one enactive art   so if on the part of any other actor on the judicial theatre as per section   any such transgression having place the judge on being apprized thereof fails to administer adequate satisfaction to the party aggrieved adding if the case requires it ulterior punishment—in this case to the other exemplars disposed of as per art   will be added one delivered to the alleged offender complained of in every such wrong which after witnessing he leaves unredressed without having done what is in his power towards redressing it the judge is an accomplice enactive art   should the registrar refuse or wilfully delay to make or cause make such entry—in such case rather than any such information as above should be suppressed it belongs to any other actor on the judicial theatre as per section   to make such recordation of the matter in question as he is able taking in testimony of the correctness of it the signatures of any persons present enactive art  0 of every such entry made in the incidental complaintbook lection shall be forthwith made to the assembled audience and inspection allowed to every person desiring to inspect it for the purpose of ascertaining and securing the correctness clearness and completeness of it if thereupon by any person imperfection in respect of any of those qualities be imputed to it such person may on the spot draw up and tender to the registrar a minute of amendment stating such alleged deficiency together with such forms of words as shall be deemed by him requisite for the appropriate supply substitution or defalcation to this minute the registrar is thereupon bound to give authentication to wit either by his signature on the original or by a transcript entered in the incidental complaintbook instructional art    to any such minute it rests with the writer or any one else to give publicity in what form and to what extent he thinks fit and the writer will do well if it be an immediate judicatory to cause deposit in the appellate judicatory one exemplar and transmit another to the justice minister if it be in an appellate judicatory an exemplar to the justice minister enactive expositive art    every person who for the purpose of eventual complaint makes or causes make any such minute does so under his responsibility satisfactional and punitional as for wrongful mental vexation should the complaint be deemed frivolous or false especially should the falsehood be deemed to have been accompanied—not with mere rashness but with criminal consciousness that is to say the consciousness that the statement is in the whole or in any part materially false instructional art    instructions explanatory of the design of and connexion between this and the four last preceding sections to wit sections          and    as also in some sort of sections       and  0 respecting location and dislocation on the part of a judge suppose inaptitude in any shape or degree reference had to the several branches of appropriate aptitude—the cause of it may have had place either before or not till after his location to the exclusion of it in the first case apply the provision in section    locable who followed by those in section  0 dislocable how to the other case those in section    publicity recordation and publication and those in the present section relating to the incidental complaintbook those in section    applying to the whole series of operations intended to be performed by him in the ordinary course of his business those in the present section to casual and unintended occurrences instructional art    of these occurrences the most important are those petty mental and verbal injuries which in that situation love of power is so apt to indulge itself in inflicting on those whom it sees subject to it injuries which though occasioned by the suit have no particular connexion with the particular interests at stake upon the event of it in the established system transgressions of this sort have very generally been left unnoticed and unrepressed between the possessors of supreme power and their principal instruments in this department as in every other there exists a natural community of sinister interest according to his calculation the superior cannot do too much to augment he cannot do too little to diminish the fear inspired by the instruments of his will and so long as his own authority

other actors on the judicial theatre to one another have been left without special notice so even  0  those to the judge himself to determine the power of the functionary on these occasions would have been to limit it and a natural assurance was that in the obvious necessity of the case he would never fail to behold a sufficient warrant for whatever exercise of his power should at any time prove necessary for guarding his operations against disturbance on the part of a public functionary or other trustee during his continuance in such his trust corruption may be produced either by intercourse between the corruptee and a corruptor or by the mere force of some corruptees situation without any such intercourse the corruptees situation being such as without assistance from any external application naturally inclines him in this or that way to violate his trust to the case first mentioned applies section    secret intercourse obviated to the other section    partiality obviated instructional ratiocinative art    by the corruption which requires intercourse the utmost effect produced and consequently the utmost mischief is as nothing compared with that which it produces by mere situation without the need of intercourse in an absolute monarchy all other functionaries are by force of the two correlative situations—by the dependence of their situations on that of the monarchs—kept in a constant state of corruption—ready instruments of wrong in every shape in his hands in a limited monarchy those trustees by whose location the limits such as they are are set to the power of the monarch will always be for the most part in the same state the expectation of the good which in such variety of shape they are capable of receiving at his hands sufficing for this purpose without the apprehension of evil in any shape other than that in which it is produced by the subtraction of the good thus it is that in every monarchy the office of corruptorgeneral is attached to the situation of monarch that of subcorruptor to every known instrument of his and every known favourite and forasmuch as to the reaping the fruit of the corruption no act on the part of a corruptor is in any such situation necessary every such corruptor may if he but act with common discretion enjoy the full benefit of the corruption without suffering any of the odium which were the corruption observed would be attached to it in company with this benefit he may at the same time and without difficulty give himself at the hands of the unreflecting and deluded multitude the praise of purity instructional art    bribery is corruption by intercourse and the monarch who while asleep on the throne by the mere act of sitting on it keeps in a state of continual corruption and mischievous obsequiousness both the selfstyled trustees of the people by whom his power is supposed to be limited and their electors who in their small number occupy the place of the whole people—joins with

provision hereby made for amendments originating in the judicial authority in respect of matter enactive art   here follows the mode of bringing forward the proposed amendment when in any part of the

to  0  wit the directive or the reeditive—the amendment which to him seems most suitable in open judicatory the government advocate and the eleemosynary advocate being present he thereupon consults them by reading or causing to be read to them the tenor of such his amendment with his reasons annexed and calls upon them respectively to mark on the paper one or other of the several responses signified by the words approved acquiesced in or disapproved giving to each of them if desired any such consideration time as upon their application respectively he shall have deemed requisite

amendment by the instrumentality of an individual special applicant—the individual having taken note of the article or articles which to him appear as standing in need of amendment and being desirous to procure by the authority of the judge immediate under the eyes of his superordinates the adoption of such amendment accordingly—he frames his proposed amendment employing either the directive or the reeditive mode as per ch xi ministers severally section   legislation minister this proposed amendment the judge after hearing what he thinks fit to hear from the mouth of the proposer in support of it either rejects simply or adopts simply or adopts with any such superamendment subtractive additive or substitutive as to him seems proper the result becomes the proposition of him the said judge immediate and is dealt with as above per arts       enactive art   on receipt of his exemplar the registrar of the appellate judicatory marks on it the day when received describing it by the designation of the article or articles to which it applies he sends notice to the justice minister of the reception given to it by the judge appellate as signified by the words approved acquiesced in or disapproved which words are expected to be written by the hand of the judge so likewise another such notice to the legislation minister if within consideration time as per art   and ch xi section   art    no such notice to the contrary has been received by the legislation minister the amendment is considered as acquiesced in by the judge appellate and justice minister respectively enactive art   in like manner the justice minister after receipt of his exemplar causes notice to be given to the legislation minister enactive art   if within consideration time as per art   notice of disapproval has been received by the legislation minister from either the judge appellate or the justice minister rejection is the consequence if from neither adoption enactive art   so if within such consideration time a motion for the taking the amendment into consideration has been made by a member of the legislature and by another seconded the aggregation of it to the body of the laws remains suspended until the result of such motion has been determined enactive instructional art  0 when an extraneous amendment is thus submitted to the judge it matters not whether the applicant has or has not a particular interest in its adoption enactive instructional ratiocinative art    nor yet whether any explanations given on the occasion be true in fact not but that for the purpose of giving additional clearness to the conception conveyed by him of the nature of the demand for the amendment the applicant may on his responsibility in case of falsehood state the details of any individual case in which he himself or any other party has a particular interest but as to the adoption or rejection of the thus proposed amendment the judge need not regard himself as bound by any opinions formed by him respecting the truth of any such statements for only to the species of the case not  0  to any individual fact separately considered will any such amendment apply itself accordingly not being considered as constituting evidence the matter of such statement need not unless the judge thinks fit be entered on the record enactive art    if however his adoption of the proposed amendment depends in any degree on the truth of any allegation of the proposers in relation to any matter of fact such allegation will be considered as evidence and for ensuring the verity of it the same securities will apply as in the case of a piece of evidence delivered on the occasion of a suit enactive art    to an amendment proposed as above by an individual applicant his name will be attached of course unless the contrary be his desire enactive art    an amendment proposed by a judge depute permanent or occasional will not be transmitted without the approval or acquiescence of the judge principal as attested by his signature enactive ratiocinative art    only for some alleged oversight in the wording in consequence of which the words employed fail it is supposed of being expressive either of the desire actually entertained by the legislature or of the desire which it is believed would have been thereby entertained if the circumstances mentioned as forming the ground of a justificative cause of the demand for the amendment had been respectively present to its mind—only for amendments of this description is it expected that any such proposition if made will be received by the judge for if it be in respect of the design and policy of the law that a change presents itself as beneficial an appropriate authority more competent to the reception of the supposed amendment is the legislature enactive ratiocinative art    in the event of its being deemed frivolous by the judge immediate to whom it is submitted lest by accident or design the disposable time of the judicatory should be occupied in waste and with or without design denial or considerable delay of justice be produced every person whose signature is attached to such proposed amendment is responsible for it satisfactionally or punitionally or in both ways as the case may require in like manner as for a frivolous and vexatious suit as per procedure code instructional art    if at any time in any judicatory or judicatories such extraneous proposed amendments should increase in number in such sort as to occupy a greater portion of the time of judges than can be conveniently allotted for this collateral purpose it will be among the cares of the legislature to repress the excess by annexation of such conditions as shall be deemed apposite requiring for example on every occasion in addition to the applicant responsible law practitioners at his choice in number proportioned to the exigency of the case instructional art    in the exercise of this same eventually emendative function the judge will have in consideration the local extent which it appears to him proper to be given to any regulation on that occasion proposed by him observing whether the circumstances by which the demand for it is constituted are peculiar to his own territory common to all the judicial territories of the state or peculiar to such or such other territory or territories and these distinctions she will bring to view in his meliorationsuggesting or say emendationsuggesting report instructional art    on this occasion he will pay particular and separate attention to the field of procedure instructional art  0 to these same distinctions reference will moreover be made by the judge appellate in the report made by him upon the judge immediates emendationsuggesting or meliorationsuggesting reports instructional art    so likewise by the justice minister in the reports made by him thereupon to the legislature enactive instructional art    on the occasion of any such proposed amendments or new regulations on the subject of procedure the justice minister will have special regard to the demand for uniformity as in the case of contested interpretation as per section    contestedinterpretationreporting function to the end that in the particulars in question uniformity and diversiformity according to the demand for these qualities respectively may in the several judicial territories of the state be created and preserved ratiocinative art    objection supposing this function conferred it will be in the power of a justice minister without need of assistance other than that of one judge immediate and one judge appellate to go out of his proper sphere and form a party in opposition to the legislature by bringing on the carpet this or that arrangement—on this or that part of the field of law on which the public mind is already taking  0  or may be brought to take an interest—dangerous to public tranquillity evil consequence the community kept in a state of perpetual ferment answer the evil will work its own cure to any annoyance from this source it would remain in the power of the legislature with every desirable facility to put an end at any time measures of severity necessary none a simple determination not to take the matter in question for a subject of discussion would suffice once expressed it would without difficulty be renewed as often as the obnoxious proposition made its appearance sufficient for the production of this effect would be the motion of one member seconded by one other and acceded to by a majority of the remainder no impression could the supposed turbulent functionary—the justice minister—make on the legislative body unless there were in that body a party actuated by wishes to the same effect and if there were of no evil in this shape would the function thus conferred on the functionary in question be productive the case being that it would equally have place without him his means of influence are not so great as those which belong to every member of the legislature to every member belong the rights of audition argumentation and motion in the assembly to the justice minister not one of those rights and had he even every one of them he would be little higher than upon a par with every other member of the assembly instructional ratiocinative expositive art    examples of the topics which present themselves as being in a more particular manner liable to give birth to inconvenience in this shape are as follows—   topics belonging to political economy instance quantity and quality of encouragement and discouragement absolute and comparative proper to be applied to the several distinguishable branches of productive industry—to be applied—whether directly for that same purpose or indirectly and unavoidably on the occasion of taxation for the purpose of revenue   topics belonging to the relation of the state in question to foreign states   in the case of a federative government topics belonging to the relations between this or that state and this or that other or between this or that state and the whole nation instructional expositive art    examples of topics in relation to which the allowance of such extraneous applications affords the best promise of being conducive to the melioration of the body of the law are as follows—   topics relative to the laws having for their object the affording security to the person property reputation or condition in life of individuals   topics relative to the interpretation authorization and execution of contracts as between individual and individual   topics relative to the interpretation authorization and effectuation of conveyances enactive ratiocinative art    in case of emendation by appointment of punishment where as yet there is none to wit on the discovery of a maleficent quality as being possessed by an act of this or that description not yet by prohibition aggregated to any class of offences—apply not any retroactive punishment do not apply pain in the character of punishment to any one by whom such act of newly discovered maleficence has been performed   the only use of punishment is prevention of similar maleficent acts maleficence having place in this case by the supposition which otherwise would have been committed but this good effect may as surely be accomplished by prohibition without punishment i e by the announcement of punishment as about to be inflicted in the event of any repetition of the maleficent act as by prohibition with punishment   on the other hand of the infliction of punishment without warning in any one such case an effect liable to be produced is the sense of insecurity resulting from the breach of the general rule—no punishment for any sort of act to which in the existing state of the law punishment may not be seen to be already attached the supposed maleficent act being already included under some denomination of offence enactive art    but the inhibition as to the infliction of retroactive punishment does not extend to the abstraction of the profit from the maleficent act ratiocinative art    correspondent to and concomitant with the profit to the maleficent agent from the maleficent act will be loss or say pain of privation or suffering in some other shape to some one else the consequence is that by forbearing to produce suffering on the part of the maleficent agent suffering and probably to a greater amount would be produced on the part of some person to whom no maleficence is so much as imputed and thus by forbearance to produce on the part of the maleficent agent the suffering attendant on the obligation to disgorge the profit no net saving of suffering would be produced in so far as from the maleficent act in question damage to an individual is produced the provision thus made for the extraction of the profit of the maleficent act for the purpose of transferring such profit to the party wronged is in other words a provision ordaining compensation to be pro tanto made accordingly in this case for the reason just assigned making of compensation ought to be ordained  0  in a word though in such a case application will not be to be made of the punitive remedy yet application will be to be made of the satisfactive and thence in so far as the nature of the case admits of the compensative remedy but moreover in the case in which by the maleficent act in question no loss or suffering in any shape had been produced on the part of the individual the maleficent act being of a purely public nature as for instance an act by which a defalcation from the mass of public property had been effected still even in this case extraction should be made of the profit of the offence for in the first place to the public at large from the addition made from this source to the aggregate of the public stock the same benefit is produced as is produced by a profit to the same amount from any other source but whatsoever may be the danger produced by this abstraction of profit scarcely can any correspondent alarm be said to be concomitant with it where is the alarm that would be produced by the persuasion though it were universally shared—shared by every man—that in the event of his succeeding in the reaping of a profit from a maleficent act at the expense of the public though he will not be subjected to any ulterior suffering he will not be left in possession of any such undue profit in a word that though he will not be a loser by the mischief which he will have done yet neither will he have been a gainer as to the application of the preventive and suppressive remedies in this case see section    judges sistitive or say executionstaying function section xxi judges sistitive or say executionstaying function expositive art   by the judges executionstaying or say sistitive or suspensive function understand the exercising for special cause the function by the exercise of which a stop and eventually an end is put to that execution and effect which he would otherwise hold himself bound to give to this or that provision of the pannomion expositive enactive art   such special cause is the observation made by him of something in the law which having appeared to him to be an imperfection such as in case of execution and effect thereto given will be productive of injustice and thence of contravention to the intentions of the legislature has as such given exercise to his eventuallyemendative function as per section  0 in such case it is not only allowable to him but on his responsibility rendered incumbent on him to stay execution accordingly enactive art   in this case he will proceed thus if at the time when the supposed injustice has manifested itself to his eyes the whole of the evidence which the individual case as stated by the applicant furnishes has been elicited he will issue at the same time three pair of decrees each pair composed of an opinative and the correspondent imperative decree as per section   one pair for giving execution and effect to the law as it stands a second for giving execution and effect to the law as it will stand if the amendment which he thereupon proposes is adopted a third for stopping the execution of both until the will of the legislature shall have been made known it is by the issuing of this last pair that the judges sistitive function will have been exercised of the two first mentioned the one or the other follows according to the decision of the legislature as made known by the reception given to the emendationsuggesting report enactive art   conditions necessary on each occasion to warrant the exercise of this function are the following—   that from execution if given to the law damage and injustice which but for such stoppage would not be excluded would in some of the therein assigned shapes or probably might ensue   that from the exercise so given to this function no damage so great seems equally likely to ensue as from the nonexercise of it   that of this same sistitive function the exercise be accompanied by a corresponding exercise given to the eventuallyemendative function in such sort that express reference of the case to the will of the legislature be made as above enactive art   in the tenor of the sistitive decree or mandate the description of the time of its continuance may be in these words—unless and until on view of this order the legislature shall have ordained otherwise enactive art   of every such pair of decrees as per art   exemplars will accompany those of the corresponding emendationsuggesting report as per section  0 art   instructional art   on whatever occasion exercised the earlier the stage at which in the course of the suit it is exercised the better for example upon the bare view of the law antecedently to any inquiry in the way of contestation as to the question of fact enactive art   if at the time of the observation  0  made by the judge as above the elicitation of the evidence has not been completed he may in the ordinary course of procedure to save vexation and expense stop such process until as above the will of the legislature shall have been made known enactive art   if however by the result of the judicial examination of an applicant or otherwise it shall appear to him that evidence material to the giving effect to the application should the order of the legislature require him to give effect to the law as it stands would by the delay in question be in danger of being lost—he will at the instance of the applicant continue the collection thereof until it shall have been completed but in this case he will give warning to the applicant that it is at the peril of costs of suit and compensation for the delay and vexation that what he so insists on will be done and for securing eventual payment he will as upon occasions in the ordinary course as per procedure code take such arrangements as the nature of the case and the situation and circumstances of parties may require ratiocinative art  0 when by exercise given to the judges sistitive function execution to a portion of law as it stands has been as above refused the effect of such refusal will be liable to be retroactive disfulfilling thus an engagement which though as supposed through oversight had been entered into by the law here then comes a dilemma giving execution and effect to the law as it stands the judge by the supposition renders himself in his own conception instrumental in the commission of an injustice refusing so to do he disfulfills an engagement entered into by the law and thereby also commits an injustice weakening in a certain degree it may be feared the confidence reposed by the people in the general trustworthiness of the law but that which the people look to at the hands of the legislature and the judiciary together is—the fulfilment of salutary ordinances and no others not the production of evil by admission or omission of this or that word in a law through inadvertence or otherwise what may therefore be reasonably looked for is—that by giving execution and effect to the imperfectly expressed portion of law in question a severer shock would be given to the public confidence than by forbearing so to do instructional exemplificational art    under this dilemma—for minimization of the evil the judge will take such course as shall have been indicated by the circumstances of the individual case examples are as follow   case i a penal case the law so inappositely penned as to subject to punishment a medical practitioner who seeing a person attacked in the street by a disorder to the cure of which immediate bleeding is necessary or contributory has accordingly performed on him that operation by an adversary he is prosecuted under this law by the judge execution of it suppose is refused now by this refusal is produced a retroactive effect and in consequence in the breast of the adversary a pain of disappointment less however will be the evil composed of this pain than the evil composed of the punishment if inflicted on the practitioner by whose intervention a life has been preserved and by whose punishment the public mind would naturally be impressed with sympathy as towards the sufferer antipathy as towards all those concerned in the production of the suffering and terror on each ones own account and that of his friends in respect of their exposure to the operation of laws so framed instructional exemplificational art      case ii a contract the contract for example between the merchant and the jew of venice fabulous it will not be less explanatory than if real money lent on failure of repayment by a certain day power to creditor to cut from debtors body a pound of flesh from any part at creditors choice regarding this contract as being of the number of those by observance of which greater evil would be done than by the breach the judge proceeds as above transmitting proposed amendment as per section  0 and for suspension issuing the three pair of decrees as above art   true it is that of these suspension decrees if confirmed by the legislature namely by tacit consent given to the proposed judiciary amendment the effect will as in case i be retroactive but in this second case the retroactivity is at the least not less irreproachable than in case i instructional art    by these means will and by no other means can the practice of strained construction in judicature with its allpervading and boundless evils be eradicated by that practice in proportion as the prevalence of it is known mens confidence in the effect of the law and in the disposition of the judiciary cannot but be proportionably weakened to lawyers this is no evil but a good for by it encouragement is afforded to the maintenance of litigation on the wrong side but to all but lawyers it is an evil of the first magnitude the sense of security being in proportion to the extent to which its existence is known or suspected weakened by it neither is it in any tolerable degree adequate as to any good purpose by which it can be supplied with a reason or a pretence at one time the judge will not employ this faculty his responsibility real or imaginary deters him while of any evil which may ensue from the nonemployment   0 of it the odium will fall he sees not upon him but upon the legislature at another time you have a judge who would employ it in favour of a suitor to whom he were favourable but will not employ it in favour of the suitor in question to whom he is adverse instructional expositive exemplificational art    a case alluded to in art    may afford an example it is that of a law against assassination converting by looseness of expression into a mortally punishable crime the act of him who has drawn blood in the streets thus a surgeon who on seeing a man fall into a fit bleeds him is prosecuted—the judge if honest and timid construes the law according to the letter reluctantly if adverse to the surgeon and to such a degree dishonest gladly instructional expositive exemplificational art    this sort of case will have place as often for example as in a penal law a requisite justificative or exemptive cause has been omitted to be established or in a nonpenal law having for its subject contracts in general or a particular species of contract an exonerative clause instructional ratiocinative art    objections answered objections liable to present themselves are the following—   in this way the legislative and judicial powers are confounded—united in one and the same set of hands—and of the legislative power itself the two elementary powers the initiative and the consummative   the legislative power thus given to the members of the judiciary extends over the whole field of legislation no limits are or can be set to it   by the eventuallyemendative and sistitive functions together the preinterpretative as to which see section    is rendered useless instructional ratiocinative art    such are the objections in each instance the incongruity pointed out will be found to be only apparent and not real as to the initiative function here given to judges this is no other than that which is given not only to these same functionaries but to every inhabitant of the state and every inhabitant of the globe given it is without any the smallest risk or inconvenience for with the exercise given to the power by the making of the proposal the power ceases no further power has the proposer whoever he be for the support of it in the case of the immediate judge true it is that coupled with the opinion of his superordinates in the two grades the mere inaction of the legislature suffices for giving to his proposal the effect of law in appropriate language for adding to his initiative the consummative but neither can the judge any more than any foreigner contribute any political power to the adoption of what he has thus proposed and besides his two superordinates abovementioned any two members when the proposal comes before the legislature which is what it cannot fail to do—any two members each at the expense of no more than three or four words will suffice for defeating the proposal altogether nor can it take effect during the sleep of the legislature for directly delivered and perpetually renewed mementos are provided for keeping that body awake instructional ratiocinative art    as to the unlimitedness true it is that on the field of legislation to this power such as it is no limits are here set no less true is it that an attempt to set any such limits would be a task of no small difficulty on the other hand not less true will it be seen to be that as to any such limits there would be neither need nor use that which could not be done without great difficulty and complication by definition will be done without any difficulty by practice—by experience instructional ratiocinative art    wherever through oversight a clause or a word adverse to the general design of the law has crept in all persons whose views the design suits will be glad to see the oversight repaired this is what without trouble to any of them the judge could do for all of them this is what without more or less trouble if at all they could not do for themselves so far therefore as a judge is seen to be thus occupied so far his amendments will be well received and employed on the other hand should it ever happen to a judge to be seen abusing this liberty by employing it in making encroachments from his own region into that which is above him jealousy would be awakened and the project crushed this would this or that member say to this or that other this is not serving us this is setting up against us this must be stopt i will move rejection if you will second me instructional art  0 to judges all this will be no less manifest than to legislators every judge will feel assured of being admitted to correct oversights and save himself from being seen acting in the odious character of an instrument of injustice no judge can hope to give birth in this way to any independent and extensive measure any little miscalculation which on such an occasion a man may have fallen into the event will in all quietness immediately set to rights instructional ratiocinative art    neither to judges appellate nor even to the justice minister does it seem necessary that this power should be granted     not that it is not desirable upon occasion that it should be exercised by them what is desirable is that it should be exercised by both of them but by both under the same checks as those which apply to the situation of the judge immediate in that of judge appellate whatever alteration may happen to have presented itself to a mans mind in the character of an amendment it is not in the nature of things that he should be at a loss for a judge immediate to propose it for him still less in the still superior situation of justice minister instructional ratiocinative art    in the text against abuse in every shape in which the powers attached to these functions are exposed to it appropriate warnings are given but supposing these warnings ever so much beyond expectation ineffectual never could abuse approach to the height at which it as yet stands everywhere nowhere so conspicuously as in the field of english law legislators and judges being by habit alike steeled against sensibility to the evils to which they are continually giving birth what the eye does not see says the proverb the heart does not rue necessary were all these functions to the giving to the forensic the intended simplicity of the domestic system of procedure and the appropriate aptitude which to the extent of its powers the only familiar yet so craftily and pertinaciously neglected system possesses all this supposes the dominion of the only real law established over the whole field of law all this supposes sooner or later completely extirpated the spurious substitute sprung from necessity nursed and kept on the throne by artifice—the chimera called by such a multitude of names of which common law is one section xxii preinterpretative function expositive art   to this function exercise is given in so far as an application is by any person made bringing to view a particular portion of the pannomion and requesting to know of the judge what in case of a suit thereupon grounded will be the import by him ascribed to it and the opinative decree pronounced in consequence all such other points in the pannomion as are deemed to bear upon the point in question being at the same time contemplated enactive art   in this case if reasonable cause of doubt appears the judge will not refuse to the public the security which by the removal of it would be produced nor to the applicant—if so it be that he has any special interest in the import ascribed to the portion of law in question—the like security together with exemption from the vexation and expense inseparable from litigation in particular from whatsoever might have otherwise been produced by elicitation of evidence enactive art   if to the judge it shall on this occasion appear that by a correspondent amendment ambiguity or obscurity may be cleared up and that by the benefit of such clearance the evil produced by the addition if any made thereby to the bulk of the rule of action will be outweighed—he will accordingly make transmission of such proposed amendment to the superordinate authorities as per section  0 and ch xi ministers severally section   legislation minister instructional ratiocinative art   note here that need of interpretation may have place without deficiency on the part of the legislator in any point of appropriate aptitude without either sinister policy on his part or relative ignorance or erroneous judgment or so much as oversight for it may be that at the time of enactment the reason of the case requiring a certain species of objects to be included in the law the existence of no individual belonging to that species was at the time realized or could so much as have been anticipated instructional art   on this occasion an evil against which the judge and the several superordinate authorities will be on their guard is—the danger of doing injustice to other interests which by or in consequence of the statement made by the applicant may not have been sufficiently brought to view accordingly no such preinterpretation will the judge ever afford without having taken effectual measures for preserving all such interests from being injured for want of adequate faculty of contestation and counterevidence instructional ratiocinative art   at any rate if the response being in disfavour of the applicant he acquiesces in it here is a saving of evil on both sides to the applicant whatsoever vexation and expense would have accompanied the elicitation of evidence on his side and the contestation thereof with or without counterevidence on the adverse side to him who would otherwise have been a defendant the correspondent vexation and expense together with that of the contestation on the point of law enactive instructional art   against frivolous applications on this as on other grounds for sinister purposes such as that of inflicting vexation on the judge or preoccupying his time for the purpose of extinguishing evidence or delaying justice in     relation to this or that other suit or suits—provision by responsibility compensational or punitional or both as the case may require will be seen in the procedure code of the pecuniary responsibility the produce may be paid into the equal justice fund as per section    justice for the helpless art    instructional ratiocinative art   neither by the eventuallyemendative function nor by the sistitive function nor by both together can this same preinterpretation be said to be rendered useless need of preinterpretation may have place where neither in matter nor in form can imperfection be justly imputed to the work of the legislature at the time of enactment suppose the state of things in question though lying within the reason of the law neither was in existence nor could have come under the contemplation of the lawmakers moreover what is clear to one man may be obscure or ambiguous to another and many a man to whose anxiety it would be an inestimable relief to be assured what on the point in question the opinion of the judge would be—might feel himself altogether incompetent to sit in judgment on the work of the legislature and declare that it is or is not welladapted to the purpose no amendment will a judge take upon himself to propose to the legislature where he himself sees not any ground for doubt nor hesitation as to the course be ought eventually to take yet in a case of this sort by a response howsoever unfavourable to his hopes the mind of an applicant may be set at rest and to parties on both sides as above the eventual vexation and expense of litigation saved instructional art   so where for the point in question no particular provision appears to have been made in any part of the law in this case the subject matter of preinterpretation will be—not this or that particular article of the law but the whole body of the law taken together the interpretative function cannot plant certainty in any part of the field of law without the previous toil of litigation by the preinterpretative function that same benefit may be obtained without being clogged with any of that hitherto inseparable burthen section xxiii application of sections     0    and    to the several codes of the pannomion and to unwritten law expositive art   in these four sections taken together completion is given to the design commenced in ch v constitutive section   continued in ch vi legislature section   and further continued in ch xi ministers severally section   expositive art   taken together the cases provided for by them comprehend every shape in which imperfection can be imputed to any portion of law take the passage in question whatever it be if the party in question be dissatisfied with it it is either because he does not clearly conceive the import nor therefore the consequences of it—or because entertaining a conception correct or more or less incorrect of the import he regards it with disapprobation in the first case either he finds himself unable to assign to it any import at all in which case obscurity is the appellation of the imperfection he ascribes to it or he finds his judgment and expectation hang in suspense between two or more imports in which case ambiguity is the appellation of it instructional art   beneficial effects endeavoured and expected to be produced by these arrangements and in the character of reasons operating in recommendation of them are the following—   preserving for ever from deterioration whatsoever symmetry comes to have been established as between the several codes in the pannomion and their several parts   minimizing and indefinitely retarding the need of consolidation laws remedies which how necessary soever can never be applied without more or less difficulty and inconvenience   preserving the pannomion in proportion as the parts of it are brought into existence from being infested and its usefulness impaired by masses of that very sort of spurious and excrementitious matter which it was originally employed to take the place of matter composed of masses of the so called common law in the shape of reports of judicial decisions professed to be grounded on the law together with dissertations grounded partly on the genuine text partly on this spurious matter and succeeding one another without end it is for want of such an institution that in this respect the condition of france since the prodigious improvement received from buonapartes codes has been continually growing worse and worse not more than a dozen years have those five codes been in authority and already the field is crowded the conception of the people perplexed and uncertainty continually rendered more uncertain by swarms of commentaries instructional art   other good effects but presenting themselves in a shape less tangible and ponderable are the following—   in matter as well as form the general texture of the code improved improved to wit by the necessity which all persons who engage in the task of endeavouring to apply     alteration or give initiation to law will find themselves under of applying their attention with care and precision to the very tenor of every portion of the existing law on which the proposed new matter bears thus rendering necessary to the hope of acceptance a certain degree of skill on the part of the operator and in a proportion more or less considerable repelling from the employment those who fail of being qualified for it   by the publicity of the proceedings the attention of all persons by whom the judicatories are frequented and in and by ch xvii judicial inspectors it will be seen how numerous and influential they cannot fail to be will be so much the more frequently and closely applied to the business and forms of legislation in this particular the magnitude of the advantage gained is as the number of the immediate judicatories to the number of the bodies occupied in the exercise of the powers of legislation that is to say the legislature and the several sublegislatures   of the members of the legislature itself the attention so much the more frequently called to the details of the process of legislation   in regard to the whole body of the pannomion maximizing the facility of its melioration from all imaginable sources   disarming judges of the arbitrary power of frustration and alteration under the name of interpretation disarming them of the power by divesting them altogether and for ever of the pretence hitherto in all places and at all times has this power been exercised and forasmuch as in the effects of the exercise given to it a mixture of good with the evil being frequently to be found and the good the most prominent of the two—never without unanswerable objections could it be either condemned or justified by the here proposed means now for the first time the evil may be effectually excluded and the good left pure under the existing system scarce can imagination suggest the improper liberty which a judge will not take with the declared will of a legislature under the here proposed system none will any judge ever dare to take for the sources of excuse elsewhere so abundant will here be altogether wanting   securing identity to the import ascribed to the law in all judicial districts and subdistricts—instead of a diversity with no limit to it other than that of the number of subdistricts securing thus a perpetual and all embracing uniformity of decision as between subdistrict and subdistrict note that the functions which in the production of these six good effects have the principal share are the contestedinterpretationreporting and the eventuallyemendative   enabling each and every individual on every occasion to learn in time what he may do and what he cannot do with safety and what benefits he may expect from the law without being disappointed   liberating the people from the yoke to which they have hitherto been subjected by the opinion trade a trade carried on by law practitioners selling at high prices guesses at what in the case in question the judge whoever he may happen to be will peradventure do the simple course would be to ask the judge himself and this is what under the here proposed system any individual is on any occasion authorized to do and this by a question to which with or without reference to the legislature the judge is bound to give response the functions which in the production of these two good effects have the principal share are—the eventuallyemendative as above and the preinterpretative   excluding or at any rate minimizing the evil producible by execution given to this or that particular ordinance rendered by oversight adverse to the general design of the whole body of the law taken in the aggregate perhaps even to the design of that same ordinance itself necessary to the production of this effect was the addition of the preinterpretative to those two other functions to the infinitely extensive mass of future contingent evil apply the eventuallyemendative and preinterpretative functions to the present and to the impending and paulopostfuture evil the sistitive instructional ratiocinative art   under unwritten or common law itself pure will be the benefit produced by exercise given to this same sistitive function pure from all danger of becoming alloyed with injustice for common law being in the whole unreal is in every part of it unknowable and of every judgment pronounced on the ground of it the effect is accordingly retroactive not more indisputably nor more perniciously retroactive can be any such proposed sistitive rule too deplorable in every country would the condition of the people be if the benefit derivable from the system of improvement were condemned to wait for so distant an era as that of the complete extirpation of so grievously oppressive and afflictive an intumescence instructional ratiocinative art   the reason is no less decided in favour of sistition where without any such warrant as that which is here supposed to be given by real law stoppage of a decision that would have been given on the ground of a supposed article of common law is made by the mere authority of a judge true it is that in this case uncertainty is produced but by this uncertainty no certainty is destroyed for that which has no existence cannot be destroyed and some good is at the same time done whereas by doing otherwise nothing but evil would have been done     exemplificational art   in english practice a known distinction has place between deciding according to the strict rules of law and deciding according to the merits by deciding according to the strict rules instead of according to the merits is meant—deciding according to some rule devised by sinister interest as a pretence for deciding in direct opposition to the justice of the case on the ground of a mistake made perhaps for the purpose by a copying clerk or of something else which has not anything more to do with the nature of the case by deciding according to the merits is meant deciding according to what by any reasonable person to whom the judicial practice is unknown would be regarded as being according to justice exemplificational art   a practice has of late sprung up of making decisions according to what is regarded as the merits in opposition to what by the judge who so decides is declared as being according to the strict rules of law of this practice true it is—that the effect is better than that of deciding otherwise than according to the merits but how much better the effect would be if the innovation were authorized by real law and accompanied by the obligation of making communications to the legislature as in the here proposed mode—is sufficiently evident proportionably so would be the merit of the judge who on pronouncing his discourse should declaredly give to the here proposed sole instrument of certainty the authority of his name ratiocinative exemplificational art   a foreign admirer of english judicature little thinks how effectually it is in the power of a copying clerk or his master to sell a pardon to the most atrocious criminal or to give to a defendant property to any amount belonging to a plaintiff by the instrumentality of these same strict rules of law ratiocinative exemplificational art  0 on this occasion as on others as often as any new arrangement for the promotion of the public benefit is proposed comes the question—if such be its utility how happens it that in all this while it has not under any established system been ever carried into effect or so much as proposed to give a specific answer to any such question must be left to the historian all that in this place can be done towards it is to say in general terms that of this imperfection as of all others the cause may be seen in the want of identity of interest between governed and governors in these four sections taken together by a slight addition made as above to the labours of the judge will be seen to be given not only a vast assistance to the legislator and an easy path for the admission of an endless mass of improvement but in return for this small labour no small additional dignity to the situation of the judge himself in the here proposed code all imperfections in the rule of action are by all such means as the nature of the case affords endeavoured to be as fast as they anywhere present themselves to notice forwarded to the notice of the legislature and the public to the end that as soon as possible they may be removed in the hitherto established systems all such imperfections are anxiously kept out of sight that such of them as in the eyes of rulers are favourable to their particular and sinister interests may be preserved even in the angloamerican united states with the exception of the constitutional branch of law into which irresistible necessity forced improvement—under the guidance of the lawyer tribe the great majority still keep themselves on their knees before the emanations of the corrupt despotism from which they have emancipated themselves the imperfections of which are covered from observation by a chaos of common law through which their optics have never as yet been able to penetrate section xxiv judges noncontestationalevidenceelicitation function enactive art   to the judge

and lasts till   oclock in the afternoon containing thus eight hours the second part commences at   oclock in the afternoon and lasts till  0 oclock in the evening thus also containing eight hours the night service commences at  0 at night and lasts till   oclock in the morning thus containing also eight hours instructional art   this for example in the several judicatories the legislature will settle this division of time according to climate temperature and national habits as general convenience shall be deemed to prescribe for an appellate judicatory in particular the hours of attendance will probably be taken partly from the time of the first part partly from the time of the second part of day duty enactive art   excepted days excepted for the judge principal days of attendance are

presumptive aptitude for location in the situation of principal may be as near as may be coextensive with the experience of the principal—the principal will bear in mind the giving the correspondent diversification to the employment of each depute instructional ratiocinative art    in this or that judicatory the legislature if by reason of the quantity of judicial business and the smallness of the number of persons willing to serve as deputes it sees need will provide pay for one or more deputes permanent instructional ratiocinative art    but in that case it will it is supposed see sufficient reason to avoid impairing the simplicity of the system by relaxing the dependence of deputes on principals or by admitting on the part of the stipendiary depute less closeness of attendance than what is exacted of the judge principal instructional exemplificational art    of the sort of uninterruptedness here required examples are not altogether wanting in english practice in respect of origin they are but recent and in extent over the field of law narrow—limited as they are to that part of it which is covered by the jurisdiction given to the subclass of justices of the peace distinguished by the appellation of stipendiary magistrates that which in this case expectation points to is uninterruptedness but for the degree in which the expectation is fulfilled the business

guardianship of chance instructional exemplificational art    exception is the sort of judicatory composed of the sort of judges called in imitation of the english system justices of the peace instructional exemplificational art  0 the number of sitting days in a week are settled by each judicatory for itself by regulations which for their validity require the signature of the justice minister—garde des sceaux instructional exemplificational art    but in a criminal suit of the highest class the suit once begun sitting days are undiscontinued until it is concluded in the choice of the first day endeavour is however used to avoid including a sunday in the sequence     instructional exemplificational art    general vacation time two months in the year viz from  st september to  st november inclusive but during or in the course of this nominal vacation time—the entire judicatory being in general divided into several judicatories—each containing judges more than one—one of them during the repose of the rest sits under the name of a vacation chamber and thus out of the vast disorder constituted by this conglomeration ofmanyseated judicatories is deduced an imperfectly compensative remedy instructional exemplificational art    in some cases too small is the aggregate judicatory to be regarded as capable of bearing to be thus divided in these cases the whole sits in continued sittings in vacation as well as term time and all the repose the judges enjoy extends not beyond a few days instructional exemplificational art    in most judicatories has place on the part of all the judges together the practice of enjoying now and then by stealth a few holidays at easter three days at whitsuntide three at christmas three or four allowed by law these indulgences are not but neither are they repressed instructional exemplificational art    sitting time in a day generally but one hours in it three but in a case of urgency another sitting time is added with hours in it from   to  0 but in this case for refreshment a small interval is taken by judges and jurors instructional art    as between dayservice and nightservice the division thus made of the whole solar day or say interval between one midday and the next will of course require to be modified according to the time of the year and the climate as per art   what is ordained as above in the enactive articles must not be considered as amounting to anything other than an exemplification of the principle of the hours comprised in the dayservice first half and second half taken together—some will not be of the number of those in which the people in general are engaged in their ordinary day occupation and so far as this is the case the transaction of the judicial business will not at those times be consistent with general convenience instructional art    on this occasion a distinction will require to be made between casual service and appointed service expositive art    by casual service understand that the demand for which is constituted by cases of urgency such to wit in which at any moment of the twentyfour hours it may happen that by the indispensable regard for the ends of justice demand shall be produced for the exercise of the functions of a judge those cases will commonly be understood to come under the head of cases of police but be the custom anywhere what it may—regard for the ends of justice can never either require or admit the establishment of two sets of judicatories—all over the territory of the state or in any part of that territory—one for the sort of justice which has at all times gone under the name of justice another for the sort of justice which has in modern times received the name of police expositive art    by appointed service understand that which is performed during a portion of the day the commencement of which is determined by a special ordinance of the judge in this way will be marked out whatsoever time is employed or to be employed in hearings with a quasijury and on each individual occasion or by a general rule for the commencement of such service that hour and minute may be and of course naturally will be so marked out which is regarded as most consistent with general convenience instructional art  0 as on all other occasions so on these—for cases which are not regarded as cases of urgency such hours of commencement will in every political state and may in any judicial territory in the state—be appointed as are regarded as most consistent with general convenience leaving for sitting in casual cases all hours antecedent and subsequent to those employed in these appointed sittings instructional art    during a proportion of the year more or less considerable—it may happen in the judicatory be it what it may that on this or that day no individual casual case shall take place during the time left as it were vacant for the reception of such casual cases and whatsoever may be the amount of the total quantity of time thus left unemployed in actual service—the obligation of being thus in attendance for and during that same quantity of time may at first view be apt to present the idea of hardship as resulting from the imposition of this obligation on the judge but so long on further consideration—so long as a sufficient number of relaxation days are allowed nothing of hardship it will be seen has place so as he is but on the spot the judge will occupy himself in the manner most agreeable and     convenient to himself and thus it is—that so far from being less eligible his condition will be more eligible than that of a person whose time of labour coincides with and occupies the whole of his time of attendance instructional art    two standards of reference applicable alike to all political states and all climates suggest the two following rules— i among public functionaries in the several departments in all grades from the lowest to the highest whatever is the number of the days in the year and of the hours in the day by custom or regulation occupied by any individual without detriment to health that same number is the least which ought to be occupied in the department of justice instructional art    ii in the instance of whatever grade how low soever without detriment to health the number of days and hours of attendance on duty is greatest—as in the case of every other department so in that of the judicial that same number may without hardship be exacted of those functionaries whose situation is in the highest grade instructional ratiocinative art    if there were any difference it is in the case of the functionaries of the highest grade that the closest attendance should be exacted why because in respect of remuneration and thus of compensation if even the pecuniary part is not superior that which consists in power and dignity cannot but be so for the contrary practice so far as it has place justificative reasons there cannot be any of historical or say æteological reasons or in one word causes there is this obvious one to wit that it is by the most powerful classes that the proportions have been determined those next in power to themselves are of course those which are most favoured by them to the prejudice of all still inferior classes instructional exemplificational art    in england the result of a superficial glance would give to this æteology a peremptory falsification it would present to view the highest class of judges in the character of martyrs to their zeal for the public service and discharge of their official duties and the superiors the members of the legislature persevering with apathy in the practice of keeping them in the state of martyrdom by a more particular inspection the illusion would be dissipated instructional exemplificational art    while judicatories of various fields of service and divers grades swarm in countless multitude and while in each of the three common law judicatories which occupy the grade next below that highest which is constituted by the house of lords four judges are employed in doing badly what would be done much less badly by a single one the number of these individual judicatories is to a most flagrant degree inadequate to the demand for notwithstanding the immense number of suits which are prevented from coming into existence by the impossibility which those who would have been suitors are laid under by the price exacted for their admission into that situation of which number upon a very moderate guess ninetenths would be too low an estimate—still the number of those which are actually instituted in those judicatories is so great and the quantity of business in them is so great as to exact at the hands of these judges and in particular of the chief of every four a greater quantity of labour than their constitutions are able to endure without manifest and frequently exemplified detriment to the health of several of them to apply to this deficiency an adequate remedy would require more skill than the class of those on whom it depends affords the applying anything in the guise of a remedy could not be so much as attempted without incurring the intolerable reproach of innovation instructional art    the result is—the bespeaking and purchasing at the expense of the people by high premiums this slow suicide impunity for transgression in every shape enormous salary and for the continuance of this enormous salary continuance in office notwithstanding intellectual inaptitude—such are the principal items of which this bounty is composed instructional art    of such a chaos whatsoever can be predicated subjects the censor to a most perplexing dilemma predicating unfavourably without exception he exposes himself to the reproach of insincerity and injustice undertaking to give all the exceptions he engages in a labyrinth of dissertation without end instructional exemplificational art    that the suffering to which the twelve judges are thus subjected is the result of anything rather than a regard for justice is proved by the exceptions which have place judge of his singleseated judicatory the lord high chancellor in whom the twelve judges behold their creator bestows upon the business of justice just as much and just as little of his time as is convenient and agreeable to him the remainder of his officiallyemployed time is employed—in allaying the squabbles and helping to organize the corruptionoperating measures of an impenetrable and irresponsible cabinet such in a greater or less degree has been the state of things at all times and in the course of the five or six and   0 twenty years reign of the late chancellor to atone for his inaptitude in every shape and for the insufficiency of the quantity of time bestowed by him upon the business of judicature the suitors were saddled by him with the delay vexation and part of the expense and the population at large with the other part of the expense of an additional grade or say stage of judicature inserted in the midst of the oldestablished ones from the master in chancery to the master of the rolls from the master of the rolls to the chancellor from the chancellor sitting alone to the same chancellor sitting with three or four reluctant ignorant heedless living appendages stuck down by him for appearance sake in the house of lords—was not enough between the master of the rolls and himself did this creator and preserver of all judicial abuse cram in a vicechancellor lest the number of the snares and plagues rained down upon the people on pretence of administering justice should be incomplete instructional art  0 under these circumstances—what in regard to these functionaries is actually the state of things answer that no hardship is felt—the functionaries receiving that which is the most agreeable to them—namely money—in lieu of that which is less agreeable to them—namely ease as to the offices and the functionaries taken together what then ought to be the state of things answer to the offices such number given and to each functionary so occupied such time of attendance prescribed as shall afford to this department of government a sufficiency of appropriate labour or say functionarypower in this case judgepower as men say steampower without detriment to the health of any of the individuals so occupied instructional art    as to what is the requisite number of the judicatories—antecedently to experience not in any state—and in particular not in any state by which the principles of this code may come to be adopted can any adequate indication be given of what that number will be antecedently to experience alike impossible will it be found to determine the number of the persons who will be able and at the same time willing in the several judicatories to serve upon the proposed gratuitous terms in the capacity of deputes to the judges and to the several other judicial functionaries in this state of things—another state of things the existence of which cannot consistently with any knowledge of human nature fail to be anticipated is—on the part of those on whom it immediately depends a general disposition and endeavour to produce in the aggregate number of these gratuitously serving ministers of justice a deficiency real or apparent to wit for the purpose of bringing about an augmentation in the number of the salaried situations of which the justice minister will have the disposal and to which the individuals who dedicate themselves to this branch of the public service may aspire such are the moral forces with which on this occasion the legislature will have to contend instructional art    under the actually established english system though in some parts so highly redundant in other parts thus lamentably deficient is the number of the judges hence in the chain of official service those vast gaps—those solutions of continuity—of which injustice by inaction and oppression by positive action are at once the results by the inaction for so long as it lasts—justice is in all cases in all sorts of suits—denied but it is in the field of penal law and in that to a vast extent that the oppression and consequent evil produced by an exercise of the judicial power is in a more particular degree flagrant for what is called a bailable offence—that is to say an offence for which if he could find persons willing to bind themselves for his appearance he would not be committed to prison—the defendant guilty or innocent must if he cannot find such bail be committed to prison committed and for what purpose for no other purpose than that of securing his forthcomingness at the next sitting of that same judicatory or any other whatever it may happen to be to which his lot is consigned as to the length of this interval of undue sufferance it depends upon a variety of accidents not one of them having any connexion with the conduct of the accused it depends upon the nature of the judicatory and upon a variety of local circumstances accordingly the duration of it is of various lengths from a single day to two hundred days or more all that time guilty or innocent the man is kept in a state of equal sufferance ruined probably in mental constitution by converse with the associates into whose company he has been thus forced and whether so ruined or not ruined in reputation as well as in pecuniary circumstances instructional art    the demand continually apt to arise for the exercise of the legislative function would of itself suffice to demonstrate the inadequacy of every system of law under which any intermission of the exercise of that paramount and allembracing duty is allowed it will of itself be a proof that under all representative constitutions as yet established the universal interest has in the eyes of the legislature been eclipsed by the particular interest of the legislators everywhere for their own personal accommodation regardless of the interest of their constituents have those bad and unfaithful servants given themselves     long periods of inaction as schoolmasters but with much less lack of reason give long holidays really to and for themselves nominally to and for their scholars monarchy even the most absolute—monarchy with all its still greater evils has the advantage of being exempt from this under that form of government at no time is the power wanting—at no time anything more than the will—to provide for any accident whatsoever to apply to every oversight and every mischance the best remedy which the nature of the case admits of ratiocinative art    what would be thought of the founder of an hospital who during half or a quarter of the whole number of months in a year should provide for its being shut up and the patients turned into the streets or left to perish for want of relief but in the case of the hospital the evils the cause and the authors would all be more or less extensively visible whereas in the case of the legislature how extensively soever visible the evils may be the cause lying buried in the wisdom of dark ages the evils are not traced up to it and the authors of the continuance of the evil not being the authors of the commencement of it are screened by their predecessors from the reproach so justly due ratiocinative art    for so flagrantly mischievous and absurd an institution as that of a regularly sleeping legislature only from the book of fallacies could anything in the shape of the shadow of a justification or even so much as a palliative be produced instructional ratiocinative art    if with any degree of reason these observations are applicable to the business of legislation with still more manifest reason are they to those of judicature but flint is the matter of which as yet the hearts of all ruling functionaries have been composed section xxvi judges c term of service enactive art   a judges term of service is for life unless in case of dislocation as per section  0 dislocable how enactive art   so that of a government advocate enactive art   so that of an eleemosynary advocate     enactive art   so that of a registrar ratiocinative art   why are not the functionaries here in question continued in office during good behaviour reason answer because continuance in office during good behaviour is continuance in office during ill behaviour by continuance in office during good behaviour is meant continuance in office during life or so long as the functionary pleases subject only to dislocation by judgment of a judicatory grounded on such evidence as is required by a judicatory but in any office whatsoever the functionary may be rendered completely inapt in respect of every one of the several branches of appropriate aptitude and may therefore without the possibility of being dislocated produce evil to an extent altogether unlimited first as to moral inaptitude not to speak of moral inaptitude in other shapes moral inaptitude in the shape of corruption may have place in any office to any extent without possibility of adequate proof by judiciarily receivable evidence of this position the most perfect demonstration has been given elsewhere to the corruptee it is known by circumstances what on the occasion in question is the wish of the corruptor say for example—the acquiring or retaining an estate in litigation between a son of the corruptor a man of wealth—and a son of the corruptee a judge—it is settled that upon the corruptees adjudging to the corruptor the estate in question the corruptor shall give to the son of the corruptee a lucrative office or his daughter to wife with a large fortune and to the father—by whom is made to his son a certain allowance which on his receipt of the provision in question he withdraws—it makes no difference whatever whether the hand into which the money is paid be his own or his sons of neither of the sons is it in the least degree probable that he will spontaneously come forward in a judicatory and give evidence of the transaction—thus spontaneously calling down upon himself the indignation of his father and covering the whole family with disgrace but this is but one out of an infinity of other ways in which the same corrupt purpose might be effected ratiocinative exemplificational art   by this phrase during good behaviour an exemplification is given of two things the power which by long connected association words have of producing delusion and the influence exercised over the understanding of the people of the united states by the practice of a government the yoke of whose oppression they have shaken off ratiocinative art   on the part of public functionaries good behaviour is on this occasion regarded as a thing of course if on this occasion and on the part of the functionaries in question why not on every occasion and on the part of functionaries in all departments and of all ranks absolute monarchy would on this supposition be the simplest and require the least expense of thought to institute ratiocinative exemplificational art   on the direct contrary supposition was founded the general plan of the constitution of the united states although the judges there retain their office during good behaviour what seems to be forgotten is—that in that government there is not as in that from which that country has so happily made its escape any such monarch from whose dislocative power it was so necessary that the functionaries in question should be secured seeing how assuredly it would be exercised for the advancement of his sinister interest and by the sacrifice of that of the people ratiocinative art   note that under the here proposed constitution—it not being a federal one over all functionaries in question dislocative power by the hands of the constitutive is capable of being exercised with much less difficulty than under the united states constitution and this is one among the disadvantageous circumstances attached to a federal government which however was in their case the only practicable one ratiocinative instructional art  0 in the case of good behaviour the way to secure its existence is to take for granted the existence not of good behaviour but unless excluded by adequate prevention the very opposite of it ratiocinative art    next as to intellectual aptitude or inaptitude perfectly compatible with complete absence of ill behaviour as above is the most perfect absence of appropriate intellectual aptitude ratiocinative art    lastly as to active aptitude not less compatible with complete absence of ill behaviour as above is the most perfect absence of appropriate active aptitude section xxvii judges c remuneration enactive art   the pecuniary remuneration is—     of a judge immediate  per day of a judge appellate  per day of a government advocate immediate  per day of a government advocate appellate  per day of an eleemosynary advocate immediate  per day of an eleemosynary advocate appellate  per day of a registrar immediate  per day of a registrar appellate  per day enactive art   at the charge or by favour of no individual can any such functionary or any depute of his lawfully receive money or moneys worth or benefit in any other shape on account of anything done or expected to be done or forborne by him by means of his official situation from unwilling hands any such receipt will be extortion from willing hands corruption instructional ratiocinative art   from money or moneys worth received to the use—not of the judge himself but of this or that person connected with him by this or that tie of interest selfregarding or sympathetic the benefit accruing to the judge thence also the corruptive effect produced in his mind may be of any magnitude not exceeded even by that which it would be of if received by the judge with his own hands to his own use nor would any participation on the part of the judge be always necessary to the production of that effect yet for the act of any such other person to inflict punishment on the judge would be altogether unjust and highly mischievous it would give to persons at large in an indefinite number the power of consigning to poverty and infamy functionaries in any number whose conduct in that situation had been pure of blame enactive art   but if of any act done by a judge the justice be to a certain degree dubious—benefit in any shape or promise thereof conditional or unconditional received by any connexion of his as above may serve or help to form a ground for appeal for appeal and in case of participation proved with or without dislocation and with or without punishment in the name of punishment and compensation to party or parties injured enactive art   on his responsibility compensational and punitional in case of frivolous and vexatious accersition and interrogation through insincerity or temerity—any person may put questions tending to the manifestation of the receipt actual or expected of any such benefit by the functionary or any person so connected with him as per art   and this as well to any person so connected or supposed to be connected with him or to any person at large as to the functionary himself in like manner as per section    partiality obviated and for procuring upon occasion by accersition prehension and adduction or epistolary interrogation as the case may require the requisite sources of evidence the same means will be employed as in the case of a suit at law ratiocinative art   as to the judge if no such occurrence has taken place no harm results to him if any such occurrence has had place still no wrong is done to him by the divulgation of it if in his conduct there be nothing wrong nothing done by any other person howsoever connected with him can render it so instructional art   in the case of the immediate functionary—added to the pecuniary remuneration and the natural and inseparable power and dignity is the encouragement afforded by the exclusive prospect of promotion to the correspondent office in an appellate judicatory with its superior power and dignity and its comparative ease as per section    judges c attendance namely by immunity from night and outdoor duty and from the obligation of holding personal converse with the promiscuous multitude the subject matter of decision being in an appellate judicatory composed exclusively of the matter of the record transmitted from the immediate judicatory with or without argumentation thereupon instructional art   in the case of the depute permanent added to the inseparable power and dignity is the encouragement afforded by the exclusive prospect of location as principal in an immediate judicatory and thence of promotion to the correspondent situation in an appellate judicatory enactive instructional art   no services no remuneration for the manner in which service and remuneration are knit together see section    judges c attendance instructional art  0 by the pecuniary competition as to which see section    judges c locable who antecedently to experience no assurance could be given that how large soever the appointed salary it might not be reduced to 0 or even to less than 0 more than the salary was worth being given for it instructional exemplificational art    in france under the ancien regime in the sort of judicatory styled a parlement scarcely it is believed did the emolument in all shapes attached to the situation of judge amount to ordinary interest upon the     capital expended in the purchase of it extortions it is true were enormous £  is incidentally spoken of by linguet in one of his plaidoyers as exacted for the copy of a decree a sum which in that place and time would go at least thrice as far as a sum of the same name would now in england this exaction is faithfully copied by their fellow disciples of the roman school in scotland enormous the extortion but correspondently enormous the multitude of those among whom the produce came to be divided instructional exemplificational art    supposing the amount of inducement to stand exactly at 0 here then would be what is regarded as the case of the class of functionaries known in england by the denomination of the unpaid magistracy an institution against which and with so much force and justice so much has of late been urged as to this matter in the country which is the scene of it true it is that it swarms with evils of the greatest magnitude with oppression and depredation in an infinite variety of shapes with corruption at once the cause and among the effects of those more immediately felt and tangible evils but it is not to the circumstance of the services being unpaid that is to say not paid by money levied by taxes imposed upon the whole people in some proportion to their means that the mischievousness of it consists instructional art    it is composed of a variety of other circumstances   the badness of the laws to which the class of judges in question are employed in giving execution and effect those laws having for their object and effect—and in a very large proportion—the advancement of the particular and sinister interest of the ruling one and the aristocracy sinister because promoted at the expense and by the sacrifice of the interest of the vastly greatest number of a whole people instructional art      the almost total absence of the applicable securities for good conduct those securities of which so ample and it is hoped efficient a list is to be seen in section    of this same chapter instructional art      of these same judges the situation is such as to add to the power the inclination to put to the most mischievous uses these same mischievous laws imposing in a variety of ways not less but more burdensome by being indirect taxes to and for their own particular benefit on the whole people instructional art    suppose for arguments sake instead of being in appearance which however as will be seen they are not in reality unpaid they were paid would the mischief they are productive of be done away or so much as lessened on the contrary it would be increased increased it would be by the whole amount of the tax it would be increased not only by the burden of the tax but by the additional badness of conduct of which the additional opulence would be productive as to this see ch ix section    remuneration instructional art    but putting aside casual emolument to casual receivers as above from impure sources taking for the subject of consideration the state of universal practice it is not true that strictly speaking they are altogether unpaid unpaid by salaries yes unpaid by fees no instructional art    somebody esq or sir somebody something or my lord somebody does not it may be said receive the money into his own hands or convey it into his own pocket in general probably not the hands it is received into the pocket it goes into are those of his clerk but this same clerk is a protegé a dependant of the squire the baronet or the lord the fees if they add not to his opulence add to that portion of his power which is in the shape of patronage instructional exemplificational art    many is the man who under the name of a justice of the peaces clerk receives in this worst form at the peoples expense pecuniary remuneration to a greater amount than that which is received in its least bad form in france by the judge whose title juge de paix has been copied together with the functions in some respects from that of the english justice of the peace instructional art  0 what belongs to this subject is—the question between the receipt and nonreceipt of emolument as to the corruptive nature of the source its effect as to increase given to expense to the impoverishment of the relatively indigent and to the denial of justice see ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration ratiocinative art    for remuneration for the service of judicial functionaries of all classes—magisterial and ministerial why give salaries at the expense of the public to the exclusion of remuneration in every shape at the expense of individual litigants because exaction of remuneration at the expense     of parties litigant would as against them be the height of oppression instead of imposing on litigants the expense of litigation or any part of it from which they could be exonerated to the exoneration of nonlitigants it is on nonlitigants alone as has been already observed to the exoneration of litigants that it should rather be imposed for the security which litigants do not enjoy without alloy that is to say without the expense and vexation which their situation as such imposes on them nonlitigants enjoy pure and without any such alloy because exaction or permission of remuneration at the charge of individuals in the situation of suitors is a certain source of corruption corruption unpunishable and ever increasing and through this corruption of correspondently increasing expense vexation and delay in contravention of all the appropriate ends direct and collateral of judicature and judicial procedure to authorize a judge to exact in this manner for himself his own remuneration is to authorize him to impose taxes though under the name of fees to an unlimited amount and put the proceeds into his own pocket no less defensible would be a law authorizing the head of the army to pay himself what he pleased for so being than to authorize the head of the law so to do ratiocinative art    objection payment by fees is recommended in ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who art    to  0 in the case of instructors yet condemned in the case of judges these opinions are they and if yes how are they reconcileable in opinions thus opposite is there not an inconsistency answer no not any of the reasons by which in the situation of a judge remuneration in this mode stands condemned there is not one that applies to the situation of an instructor in arts and sciences whether the instruction be or be not accompanied with board or lodging or both by giving increase to the number of the occasions on which by himself or his locatees fees are receivable the judge if fees constituted the whole or any part of his remuneration would by this means have it in his power to give to the aggregate of it an unlimited increase that is to say by giving a correspondent increase to the number of the occasions on which the fees allowed would be to be received to the number of the operations performed and to the number and respective lengths of the written instruments issued thus it is that by the allowance of such fees in judicature the interest of the judge is placed in a state of diametrical opposition to instead of unison with his duty an arrangement by which a bounty is given on the production of delay expense and vexation in the case of the instructor in question in no one of the diversifications of which in and by the arrangements in question that official situation is susceptible does the functionary see it in his power to make any addition to the quantum of his remuneration ratiocinative exemplificational art    in every case in which by any unpunishable means whatsoever it is in the power of any man for service in any shape to give increase to the number of the occasions on which that same service comes to be rendered this same opposition between interest and duty has place and the mischievous efficiency of it is more or less considerable duty is sacrificed to interest the evil sustained by the customer by whom the service is bespoken and paid for is more than equivalent to the good obtained by the dealer by whom the service is performed and sold this state of things to no inconsiderable degree has place in the relation between patient and medical practitioner in consideration of it an arrangement not altogether uncommon in england is that of an annual salary given by the patient to the practitioner section xxviii judges c locable who instructional art   to render a person locable in the situation of judge immediate necessary are two qualifications experience and irreproachableness experience that is to say appropriate experience when under the operation of this code there has been time for the acquisition of it irreproachableness from the beginning and at all times follow here the mode in which the experience will be ascertained and that in which the irreproachableness will be proved

person in question the service has actually been performed enactive art   during the original preparation period as per art    during which no person can have as yet fulfilled the two service years as above any person who as per arts       has given proof of irreproachableness may at the discretion and on the responsibility of the justice minister be located in the situation     of judge immediate

ascertaining and making known at all times what individuals have become qualified by experience a complete set of judge deputes individual service calendars and an annual aggregate service calendar will be framed and preserved the aggregate being composed out of the individual calendars enactive expositive art   in a judge deputes individual service calendar on each day of the year on which the individual has served in that character entry is made of the number of hours during which he has on that day served enactive expositive art   in this calendar a mans years of service are determined—not by the interval between the day on which he first began to serve and the day in question but by the number of hours during which he has served days in two years say   0 serving hours in a day suppose  0 to complete the two service years service during   00 hours is on this supposition necessary of these two service years fulfilment may have taken place in the time of two solar years

the course of that day served is among the duties of the registrar and on the day in which the two service years have been completed he enters notification thereof in these words—on this day naming the individual his two service years were completed for the mode in which entry is made of the facts forming the materials of this calendar see section    and ch xiii judges immediate enactive art   if after serving in one judicatory a judge depute serves in another as often as such migration takes place he carries with him a copy of his service calendar authenticated by the registrars signature enactive expositive art  0 within  days after the termination of each solar year the registrar of each judicatory transmits to the office of the justice minister a list of the several persons who in the course of that year have been serving in that judicatory whether as judge deputes permanent or judge deputes occasional adding to their respective names the number of hours during which in the course of that year they have respectively served reckoning from the day on which they respectively began to serve of such part of this matter as regards each person is formed his individual service

will be caused to be drawn up and in types of as large sizes as conveniently may be printed and by him copies thereof will be transmitted     to the several judicatories as well appellate as immediate in each judicatory they will be kept hung up in the several justice chambers so as that the contents with the manuscript entries in proportion as made shall be as easily visible as may be to all eyes enactive art    ii irreproachableness how proved a vacancy having place in the situation of judge immediate antecedently to the locating of a successor the justice minister by letter addressed to the registrar makes known the proposed successor at the judicatory in which he is or has last been serving as likewise if it be a different one in the judicatory in which he is proposed to be located in the judicatory in which he is or has last been serving on the next day after receipt the letter is by the registrar proclaimed and attached to that same judge deputes individual service calendar therein kept with invitation in writing and time sufficient given to all persons so disposed to come forward and make any such objections as they respectively think fit to make to the intended choice and to this invitation publicity is given by all such means as the circumstances of the two several places afford enactive art    from the day on which such proclamation has been made the proposed locatee being present in the judicatory in which he is or has last been serving and the judge principal or in case of his necessary absence some judge depute taking the judgment seat any person who has any objection to make comes forward in the character of pursuer and the inquiry is conducted on the same footing as in the case of a penal suit in conclusion report is thereupon made by the registrar to the justice minister the justice minister thereupon by an appropriate instrument declares his perseverance in the proposed location or withdraws it as to him seems most meet enactive art    from the very commencement of this code the test thus afforded of irreproachableness will be applied on every vacancy in the situation of judge immediate the justice minister when he sends to the judicatory a probationer will place on the judgment seat along with a person to officiate as registrar a person who during the probation shall officiate to that purpose as judge enactive ratiocinative art    iii comparative inaptitude excluded in the situation of judge an early formed habit of impartiality is an essential security for the exercise of that virtue on each succeeding occasion a security not only for right inclination but for right judgment—not only for the moral but for the intellectual branch of appropriate aptitude when for a judicial situation superior aptitude can be secured—to admit inferior instead of it would be to act in direct repugnance to the ends of justice so soon therefore as in sufficient number there are persons in whose instance the best security that the nature of the case admits of for a formed habit of impartiality has been afforded by appropriate practice—no person by whose habits a reasonably presumable comparative inferiority in respect of that quality has been demonstrated by corresponding inexperience can therefore be admitted into this same situation consistently with due regard to those same ends ratiocinative art    nor of the consequent exclusion will hardship be in any case the result persons preferably disposed for these occupations respectively will seek employment each of them in that to which in his own judgment by appropriate aptitude in every shape and at any rate by inclination he is best adapted neither in the case of the government advocate nor in that of the eleemosynary advocate can his remuneration in all shapes taken together pecuniary included be inferior to that with which he is himself well satisfied as to the professional lawyer in compensation for honour his prospects hold out to him pecuniary remuneration in a quantity to which it is scarcely in the power of competition to set any limits while in the case of those to whose labours in the same field but performed for different purposes public honour is attached what remuneration is allotted in a pecuniary shape will necessarily be confined within limits which to any degree may be narrow ones ratiocinative art    nor yet

injustice in favour of delinquency in all manner of shapes—delinquency of which these advisers and assistants cannot in general any more than the delinquents themselves fail to have been conscious—an indifference as between right and wrong as between justice and injustice and an habitual endeavour to cause wrong and injustice with the natural accompaniment and instrument mendacity to prevail—cannot but be naturally and not unreasonably expected at the hands of persons so circumstanced nor the less true is it—that the stronger the natural sinister propensity the greater the honour to him by whom it is overcome enactive ratiocinative art    iv ulterior intellectual aptitude secured in future in ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who and section    located how—is exhibited a general scheme of public instruction for functionaries of the erudite class in the several administrative subdepartments of which distinction notice is also taken in ch x defensive force section   and ch xvi quasijury section   whether by functionaries belonging to the judicial department this same benefit shall or shall not be shared can scarcely be a matter of indifference in the whole field of human action no imaginable occupation can be assigned the business of which is not in some way or other liable to come within the cognizance of the functionaries employed in judicature most particularly of those from whose situations the matter in dispute whatsoever it be receives its effective decision instructional art    accordingly a thing to be desired is—that so soon as the number of those by whom this benefit has been shared is risen to such a magnitude as to contain in it a number able and willing to afford an adequate supply to the several magisterial situations in the judiciary department deputes permanent as well as principals included—no person who has not shared in that same benefit should be locable in any one of those same situations to make observation

advocates enactive art   so likewise eleemosynary advocates as per section    and ch xx eleemosynary advocates enactive art   so likewise registrars as per section    and ch xxi immediate and appellate judiciary registrars ratiocinative art   why not leave the function of locating all the several judiciary functionaries in their respective official situations in the hands of the members of the supreme constitutive—of those in whose hands the function of locating the possessors of the supreme legislative authority is located instead of in those of a single functionary himself located by the executive chief answer reasons first as to the not locating it in the hands of the supreme constitutive want of time namely for receiving adequate information as in the case of the function of the executive chief that with relation to the location of the members of the supreme legislative the here proposed members of the supreme constitutive are not unapt but on the contrary in an exclusive degree apt has been already shown but to the case of the class of functionaries here in question this same appropriate aptitude does not extend for by league with a candidate for the judgeship a single leader might in the event of his success acquire means of gratification for sinister interest to an indefinite amount ratiocinative art   on this supposition between the leading individual in the character of patron and the candidate for the judgeship in the character of protegé there would be a corrupt   0 connexion a connexion constituted by a community of particular and sinister interest both acting in diametrical opposition to the line of duty and universal interest by the judge on every occasion undue favour would be shown not only to the leader himself but to all persons specially connected with him by any tie whether of selfregarding interest or sympathy ratiocinative art   here then would be a judge who being located by the influence of the head of a party and moreover by that same party continually exposed to be dislocated such at any rate is the arrangement here proposed would be in a state of constant dependence on that same party being in a state of dependence upon that same party taken as a whole and at the same time they individually in a state of dependence upon him here between the powerful functionary in question and the most influential persons in the district would be a sort of league defensive and offensive against all the rest by partiality in their favour impartiality in his breast would pro tanto be destroyed and the maximum of partiality substituted he making himself an instrument of depredation and oppression in every other shape for their benefit they would all the while give him their support while exercising depredation and oppression for his own benefit and for the benefit of the several other individuals specially connected with him ratiocinative art   on condition that the locative function be not in these same hands an arrangement herein proposed is that the dislocative function with relation to this class of functionaries should be in those same hands by this means against malpractice in every shape a security in favour of those whose interest is the universal interest will be placed in their own hands but in the case here in question that same security has no place by that same sinister interest by which the corrupt and supremely unapt functionary has been once located in the situation in question by that same interest will he at all times be located—at all times preserved from being dislocated and at the same time all those by whom he has been injured excluded from the faculty of obtaining relief ratiocinative art   true it is that especially under a form of government arranged in other particulars in the manner here proposed sooner or later the depredation and oppression having become intolerable the evil would find its own remedy under favour of that liberty of discussion which could not immediately be extinguished those who suffered by the malpractice being assiduous and united in their complaints to all other constituted authorities and to the publicopinion tribunal a party in opposition to the supposed ruling party would thus form itself between party and party here then would be a constant struggle if the locating party were successful there would be no redress if unsuccessful then one party judge would succeed to another thus then instead of partiality at the expense of one side would be substituted partiality at the expense of both sides true it is that by both sides a bridle or check applied by the opposite interest and power of the other would be felt not less true is it that in favour of neither of them would the power of that check be found adequately effectual mutual animosity would be kept alive by mutually and continually repeated injury ratiocinative art  0 true it is that in all subordinate judicatories there would be the faculty of appeal but altogether insufficient would be this remedy   in the first place in the very nature of the case the benefit of appeal can scarcely by any means be placed within the reach of every individual such is the quantum of delay vexation and expense with which after everything has been done that can be done towards the extinction of evil in these several shapes access to this remedy will continue to be obstructed   in the next place the disease as it has place in the subordinate judicatory so by the operation of the same causes will it be seated in the superordinate at any rate unless a different mode of location be applied to the superordinate one ratiocinative art    so much as to want of moral aptitude as to appropriate intellectual aptitude it is possessed by the supreme constitutive in sufficient amount with reference to location as applied to the supreme legislative but as to the point here in question the constitutive is altogether debarred from competing with the justice minister ratiocinative art    next as to the not locating it in the hands of the supreme legislative the reasons which apply to the case of the members of the constitutive authority as above may be seen applying to those of the legislative with a force equal in quantity not but in species the same ratiocinative art    lastly as to the not locating it in the hands of the executive chief reasons see those applying to the question why not locate in the hands of the executive chief the location of the justice minister see also the functions of the justice minister which the executive chief would have to     look to the exercise of in addition to his own and those of his subordinates the ministers ratiocinative art    in the case of the several functionaries of the administrative department placed under the absolute direction of the executive chief as to what regards official duty contestation is neither desired nor expected impartiality is therefore a quality that belongs not to the case not so in the case of the judges in their case impartiality is an essential and indispensable attribute were they in a state of dependence on the executive chief their impartiality would be much weakened by this arrangement only in so far as there is no contestation with regard to the right is it desired that the absolute dependence of all the several ministers on the executive chief should have place in the case of judiciary functionaries contestation is certain only for the termination of it are their offices instituted here it is essential that in relation to functionaries so abounding with power as the executive chief independence should be as decided as the nature of the case will allow it to be instructional art    one class of cases may be seen for the cognizance of which the most apt or even the exclusively apt provision will be made by a set of judicatories composed each of them not of principal functionaries but of deputes and these deputes located—not by their respective principals but in an immediate way by the justice minister to this class belong those sorts of cases in which incidentally and casually a larger quantity of business is apt to flow in than can without waste be provided for by any permanent establishment larger than can be provided for even by the hereinprovided newlydevised source of supply the unlimited power of location given to the several principals a circumstance which would oppose additional difficulty to an adequate supply for any such extraordinary demand is the need of employing one and the same spot as the seat of the greater part of the whole of the number of these simultaneously constituted judicatories and of this case the seat of government would naturally afford an exemplification were it only on account of its affording the most efficiently inspecting public instructional exemplificational art    the plan on which for all such casual and temporary demands the most apt provision is capable of being made is by the rest of the system rendered sufficiently obvious in the whole number of judicial territories taken together with how near an approach soever to the maximum of adequacy the actual supply of deputes may have adjusted itself to the demand a number of these several functionaries ready to accept ulterior employment will at all times be visible greater than the whole number of those who have actually been in the habitual receipt of full employment this considered whenever an influx of business of this sort happens to come in the justice minister issues an instrument of invitation stating the nature of the business in question together with the number of the judges and other functionaries necessary to the maximizing the despatch of it and calling upon all qualified persons who feel disposed to send in their proposals on this plan the most exact agreement has place between all interests concerned between the interest of the public in respect of the ends of justice and the interest of the individual functionaries the ends of justice to wit as indicated by the evils by the avoidance of which they will be fulfilled   as to nondecision in these cases as in all others the interest of the public and thence of government requires that the nondecision should as to every part of the business be minimized in other words that despatch be maximized but so does that of each individual functionary if in this situation his labours continue beyond a certain length of time the limitation of them to a portion thus comparatively narrow of the logical field of service would render him as well in reality as in appearance less qualified for traversing the whole field as a principal than if with even less assiduity he had been in the habit of giving to his attention that same allcomprehensive and desirable extent hence moreover both interests require that the number of these judicatories employed at once be maximized   as to misdecision in these cases as in all others by and in proportion to want of publicity misdecision would of course be probabilized in what instances soever business of this description has in practice been assigned to special judicatories constituting with relation to the ordinary ones so many judicatories of exception whatever portion of the light of publicity has been suffered to shine upon the proceedings of ordinary judicature has been withdrawn from these extraordinary ones their proceedings have been carried on in hermetically sealed recesses natural dens of corruption fraud depredation and oppression but to the interest of the individual the maximum of publicity is not less favourable than to that of the public that he may not be forgotten or considered as laid aside it will be for the interest of each to be seen continually in action and that his mode of action be as conspicuous as the comparatively limited nature of the business will admit of its being made over whatever part of the field a demand may have place for indication of exceptions—the cases here in question will not be found comprised in it of the demand presented by the army service and the navy service as     also the grounds of it a view has been given already of all those grounds with the exception of that which applies to the demand for a special locator not one it may be seen has place in the present instance exemplificational art    in english practice the provision made for business of this sort stands exemplified in two sorts of judicatories termed audit courts and courts of claims already mentioned in section   in both these instances but for the requisite explanations the composition of the judicatory might convey the idea of a system more favourable than the one here proposed to the joint interests of economy and justice no eleemosynary advocate not even so much as a government advocate the more profusely overloaded with emolument that office is in other instances the higher is the value that will be apt to be set upon the saving made by the omission of it in these but were even economy everything and justice in other respects nothing loss to an incalculable amount rather than saving would be the natural not to say the necessary result such would be the case were there in each judicatory but one judge from this total darkness he would derive the uncontrolled power of ministering to the sinister interest and desires signified or anticipated of the patron by whom he was located oppression would thus be exercised on this or that individual depredation consummated in favour of this or that other but in practice the number runs above one in an indeterminate degree and by and in proportion to the number the abuse instead of being checked is more likely to be multiplied the majority has in this case the power of preventing it at the hands of the minority but who of them all has the inclination by opposition no one would gain anything but illwill and discomfort to himself by connivance at the malpractices of his several colleagues success to his own may be secured by every one in all such harmony the presence of another instrument of government in the character of an advocate would suffice to plant disturbance with him would unavoidably come in more or less of a public by those other instruments of government otherwise than at the instance of this one in favour of any sinister interest on the part of the ruler to the prejudice either of the public or of individuals nothing how well soever inclined could they thus venture to propose—nothing for which a ground ostensible and more or less plausible could not be made section xxx judges c dislocable how enactive art   a judge whether immediate or appellate is at any time dislocable by the justice minister he proceeding in the

first day of the ensuing solar year eliminated from the list of judge deputes permanent the conclusion being formed—that either the requisite closeness and punctuality of attendance is greater than he can endure or in the eyes of the judge principal he is deficient in appropriate aptitude absolute or comparative enactive art   a judge depute permanent is moreover dislocable by the several causes of

ratiocinative art   use of this instrument as in other high official situations so in the present case the use of an inaugural declaration is this—to direct the attention of the public at large     to those points in the conduct of the functionary in respect of which by the nature of his situation he stands in the greatest degree exposed to the temptation of swerving from the line of duty and in a more especial manner to those on which the force of the political including the legal sanction not being so easily or effectually brought to bear aid from the popular and moral sanction is most needed under this description come in a more especial manner those cases in which the aberration has place—not in toto but only in degree on the face of the instrument they will easily be distinguished i execution and effect promised art   i will in all things so long as i continue in the exercise of the functions belonging to this my office pay obedience to the law i will on each occasion use my best endeavours to give execution and effect to every part of it according to what shall appear to me to be the intent of the legislature for the time being not presuming on any occasion to substitute any particular will of my own to the will of the legislature even in such cases if any where the provisions of the law may appear to me inexpedient saving only the exercise of such discretionary suspensive power if any with which the legislature may have thought fit to intrust me ii impartiality in the general exercise of power promised art   on every occasion in the exercise of this my vocation sincere and anxious shall be my endeavour to keep my mind as clear as may be of undue partiality in every sense of partiality in favour of any class or individual to the injury of any other of partiality through selfregarding interest of partiality through interest inspired by sympathy of partiality through interest inspired by antipathy more particularly will i be on my guard against partiality in favour of superiors to the prejudice of inferiors of superiors in whatsoever scale of comparison—opulence power reputation talent—natural or acquired iii bribery dispromised art   i will not at any time accept any gift or favour that shall have been offered me in the view either of influencing or recompensing my conduct on any particular occasion in the discharge of the functions of my office in case of my suspecting any benefit to have been conferred on me or offered to me or to any person supposed to be connected with me or intended to be so conferred with any such view i will forthwith declare and make public such my suspicion nor will i knowingly and wittingly suffer if it be in my power to prevent it any such offer or recompense to be made on any such account to any person dependent upon or connected with me but that on suspicion of any such offer or recompense i will forthwith make public such my suspicion together with the grounds thereof and the names of all parties concerned iv secret intercourse with applicants dispromised art   i will not on any account give ear to but indignantly reprove any application that may be made to me in any manner or place other than on the judgment seat and in the hearing of all in relation to any cause in contemplation of its depending or coming to depend before me much less will i give any opinion or advice relative thereto and should any such application be made to me in writing i will forthwith produce and read the same in open judicatory although it should be contained in a private and confidential letter so likewise if having been addressed to any one else v publicity promised where due art   i will not endeavour to keep secret but on the contrary study by all suitable means to render in the most extensive degree public the proceedings in all cases except those in which the law shall have ordained them to be kept secret vi secrecy promised where due art   on every occasion on which in relation to any part of the proceedings belonging to my office the legislature shall have ordained secrecy to be observed my sincere endeavours shall be applied to the giving full execution and effect to every ordinance directed to that end vii nonrevenge for obloquy art   whatsoever reproach may happen at any time to be cast upon me or any other functionary of the judicatory whether in respect of my demeanour in the exercise of the functions belonging to my office or on any other account never will i by means of any power or influence derived from my office cause or seek to cause or willingly suffer evil in any shape to happen to any person concerned in the casting of any such reproach saving only in case of mendacious or culpably temerarious falsehood designed or tending to the production of such evil effect my right of applying to some other judicatory for such satisfaction for wrong or punishment or both as in the eyes of the judge the case shall appear to require viii

authority of my station to obtain any advantage to myself or any other     ix nonelectioneering art  0 i will not take any part whatsoever in any election nor use any means direct or indirect to

willingly absent myself from duty except to the extent of the time allowed me by the law or in case of unavoidable necessity resulting from sickness or otherwise nor then without making the best provision in my power for keeping my place supplied xi despatch art    i will as far as depends upon me give to every cause that comes into my hands the utmost despatch that shall appear to me consistent with the purposes of justice nor will i put off any cause or give to any cause the priority over another but for special reason publicly declared xii nonprecipitation art    i will at no time through impatience or otherwise knowingly cause or permit justice to suffer by undue precipitation and in particular i will not bestow less attention upon the cause of the poor than of the rich considering that where small rights are seen to be contemned great ones will not be deemed secure and that importance depends not upon nominal value but upon the proportion of the matter in dispute to the circumstances and its relation to the feelings of the parties xiii expense minimized art    i will not through favour to those who profit by the expense of the administration of justice connive at much less promote any unnecessary expense but on the contrary study as much as in me lies to confine such expense within the narrowest bounds compatible with the purposes of justice xiv nonimpatience art    i will not through impatience or favour to the official or to the professional advocate show discountenance to him who pleads his own cause or to him who pleads gratuitously the cause of his

a view to favour or prejudice any suitor otherwise than according to justice but for the common convenience of suitors and only to the extent of the number which shall appear to me requisite to that end xvi falsehood for elicitation of truth dispromised art    on no occasion nor for any purpose although it were for the elicitation of material truth will i employ any untrue assertion direct or implied for any such purpose as to cause any witness to believe or suspect that by any other witness some matter of fact has been disclosed that has not been disclosed yet while thus avoiding the utterance of falsehood for the elicitation of truth i will avoid at the same time by disclosure of any evidence which has been delivered the affording to any witness any positive facility for the fabrication of false or other deceptious evidence on every occasion it shall be among the objects of my endeavours to keep my own discourse and as far as depends upon myself the discourse of others as pure as may be from the taint of fallacy in every shape xvii urbanity to parties and witnesses art    on the elicitation of testimony whether from party or extraneous witness it shall on every

having place in his instance or be indicative of anger or contempt as having place towards him in my breast or of menace in the event of his comporting himself in a manner otherwise than in accordance with my wishes of no power or influence attached to my situation will i ever avail myself to any such personal and sinister purpose as that of creating dependance or exacting or receiving homage to avoid wounding by haughtiness of demeanour the sensibility of such of my fellowcitizens whose business brings them into communication with me shall be among my sincere and constant cares xviii repression of advocates c inurbanity art    careful to avoid inflicting any such unnecessary wound on my own part i will be no less so in repressing as soon as observed all such disposition on the part of any other person possessing any authority or performing any part on the theatre of justice to wit any quasijuryman or registrar any government advocate or eleemosynary advocate or professional

aid to brother judges art  0 where on the occasion of a suit having its origin in the judicatory of another judge the function of eliciting evidence for the purpose of that same suit is committed to     me i will use my best endeavour by means of such evidence as i shall thereupon elicit to complete the necessary and sufficient ground for such decrees and mandates as the nature of the case may require and for giving thereto full execution and effect where for the purpose of eventual execution and effect to such decrees as he shall have seen reason to issue on the occasion of a suit originating in his judicatory any other judge has issued for any purpose a mandate to which for such purpose it is necessary that execution in part or in whole be given within my judgeshire—far from obstructing my endeavours shall in so far as needed be applied to the facilitating of such execution applying myself in aid of and so far as requisite in concert with such my colleague by the

whom it has happened to address themselves to my own judicatory on the other xx reasons given to audience art    so far as may be without uneconomical expenditure of judicial time i will on every occasion employ my best endeavours in affording to the surrounding audience in their quality of judicial inspectors and to the quasijury on the occasion of a recapitulatory examination a conception as clear correct and comprehensive as may be of the nature of the case in hand and of the considerations on which in the character of reasons the several operations performed by me in relation to it are grounded xxi legislationregarding functions art    on every occasion i will pay due and solicitous attention to the legislationregarding functions allotted to my office i will be on the watch for

eventual amendment it shall be my care to the best of my ability so to frame it as to render it in as perfect a degree as may be well adapted to its proper end and intended purpose when applied to for exercise to be given by me to the preinterpretative function i will with indulgence submit to any such inconvenience as may be the result of deficiency of appropriate instructedness on the part of a consultant suitor yet not so as to concur with him in the uneconomical consumption of that official time for the beneficial application of which other suitors are in waiting at the same time in case of a purposed design on his part to give existence to such waste it shall be my care to apply such appropriate punishment as may be needful for the repression of evil intention seeking its accomplishment by such means enactive art    the above declaration will be made by every judge and a similar one in so far as it appertains to their respective offices will be made by every government

this stock is composed will belong partly to the class of things immoveable partly to the class of things moveable and to divers things immoveable will be attached so many appropriate aggregates of things moveable     enactive expositive art   belonging to each judicatory will be immoveable things following—   justice chambers one or several   repositories for books and papers and materials for writing   official habitations of any such judiciary functionaries to whom the legislature shall have thought fit to allot such abodes at the public expense   waitingrooms and rooms for any such parties and witnesses as for prevention of sinister concert it may on this or that occasion be deemed fit to keep in a state of separation from such or such other persons—may for that purpose be provided   places of confinement attached to or otherwise allotted to the use of the judicatory enactive expositive art   of moveable things belonging to each judicatory examples are as follows—   the furniture of the justice chamber or the several justice chambers   the official habiliments or ensigns of the judges and such other of the actors on the judicial theatre to whom distinctive habiliments or ensigns of office are allotted   the arms of such judicial officers by whom on occasion the bearing of arms of any kind comes to be necessary to enable them to exercise their respective functions   instruments of repression applicable in case of necessity to the bodies of refractory persons in the exercise of the sedative function   instruments of punishment   instruments of

chamber understand a chamber in which judicial suits and other judicial applications are heard enactive art   in each judicatory if besides the judge principal there be one or more judge deputes sitting at the same time—to each such depute must of course be allotted a separate justice chamber during that same time instructional art   these same supplemental justice chambers may be either appropriated or occasional appropriated are all such as by original construction purchase or hire for a term certain stand allotted to this purpose instructional art   an occasional justice chamber will be every apartment in which by reason of deficiency in the number of appropriated justice chambers a judge depute whether permanent or occasional at the time holds his sittings enactive art   every justice chamber of the immediate judicatories will be provided at the expense of the subdistrict those of the appellate judicatories at the expense of the district in both cases by the sublegislature of the district in concert with the justice minister enactive instructional art   on whatever occasion any apartment is employed as an occasional justice chamber it will be the care of the registrar under the direction of the judge principal to cause it to be fitted up and stocked in so far as may be without preponderant addition to the expense on the same principle and in the same manner as the principal justice chamber enactive instructional art   so order matters that between every person to whom for the exercise of his right it is needful to hold converse with any other—he may with the greatest facility hold converse with every such other and this without disturbance to the business of the place enactive instructional art   so order matters that of the discourse held in the chamber between one person and another all opportunity of concert for a sinister purpose be as completely as possible excluded enactive expositive instructional art   in this view consider on what occasions for what purpose and between what persons such intercourse will naturally be subservient to the purposes of justice consider moreover on what occasions such intercourse may naturally be liable to be repugnant to the ends of justice as between actor and actor on the judicial theatre what will generally be necessary is that in the judicatory itself they should incidentally hold communication with one another what exceptions excepted does not seem to be necessary in any case is—that the matter of that communication should be a secret to any of the others for publicity there is the general reason—prevention of concert for the purpose of promoting private interest at the expense of public   the judge might seek to bring over the jury to his purposes by considerations which being addressed to their prejudices and passions     shame would prevent him from submitting to a more enlightened part of the company present such as his comrades in office and the professional section of the judicial inspectors and this or that one among the miscellaneous portion—the suitors waiting for their turns   by concert with his comrades in office—the registrar the government advocate and the eleemosynary advocate he might indulge in a greater degree of despatch than would be consistent with a due regard for the main and direct ends of justice expositive instructional art  0 of the aggregate company of those actors one class there is in whose instance prevention of secret intercourse will frequently be an object of particular importance this is during the period of elicitation that of the witnesses whose interests and affections are on the same side in this case the evil to be obviated is information given by a party witness to another either during examination or antecedently to his examination on the occasion of suits styled criminal there is in general no want of disposition to employ precautions of this sort but the demand for them is frequently not less urgent in cases styled civil in which no party on either side is exposed to any suffering that bears the name of punishment but as in a case of this sort the amount of the largest mass of property may be at stake—there exist no other bounds than those which limit this property to the magnitude of the bribe which he who stands in need of an article of mendacious testimony may be willing to give and he in whose power it is to furnish it be no less willing to receive here then is an instance among so many others in which difference in respect of precautionary arrangements should not be too blindly and absolutely determined by the distinction expressed by the words penal and civil in regard to suits enactive instructional art    legends for the justice chamber printed in large placard types should be hung up in every justice chamber whenever so employed— examples of such legends are—   greatesthappiness principle   ends of justice   truthsecuring monitions   warnings against falsehood   elementary functions of judge and quasijury   judges deportment rules   suitors deportment rules   judges inaugural declaration if not too long enactive instructional art    in the construction and arrangement of a justice chamber the following considerations and rules should be kept in view—   maximize the number of those by whom everything that passes can be heard   maximize the number of those by whom everything visible that has place or passes can be seen   maximize the convenience and comfort of the several actors on the theatre according to their respective functions and stations   if all cannot in equal perfection exercise the faculty of hearing let it be exercised by those in whose instance it is of the greatest importance to justice that it be exercised   so in regard to the faculty of seeing note that from the sight the hearing and thence perception and conception in all their parts receive assistance   convenience includes not only the faculty of occupying the situation in question without annoyance but with it the faculty of making to the best advantage application of what has been seen and heard and in particular the faculty of minutation instructional art    stations which may with propriety be elevated are—   the judges   the registrars   the quasijurys   the government advocates   the eleemosynary advocates   the pursuers   the defendants   the witnesss instructional art    while contributing to the examination of witnesses the government and eleemosynary advocates stations might be under the judges while addressing the judge opposite to the judges in the area of the justice chamber may perhaps be to be included steps into the several elevated stations on each side enactive art    opposite to the elevated seats as per art    will be less elevated seats for visiters each seat has a slight back for support of the individual sitting and a desk for him to lean and occasionally write on enactive art    a box or boxes will be provided for the waiting witnesses belonging to the suit which is being heard these might be either distinguished from the visiters seats in which sit the parties and witnesses belonging to other suits together with the probationary lawyers or not enactive art    for visiters at large galleries should be erected on each side of the area and at right angles to it   0 section xxxv judiciary habiliments instructional art   as instruments of discrimination not as traps to catch respect are peculiar habiliments here meant to be allotted to judiciary functionaries enactive instructional art   as instruments of discrimination that on every occasion each by every other actor on the judicial theatre casual visiters included may at first glance be seen to be in respect of official situation or occupation what he is and not regarded as being in any such respect what he is not by the word distinction a conception opposite to that intended might have been conveyed for in the english language distinction though originally meaning nothing more than discrimination is come to denote a source of respect instructional art   by this means whosoever has need of service in any shape at the hands of a member of any one of these classes sees at once and without loss of time in inquiry or danger of mistake the individual from whom such service can be obtained the characteristic habiliment is as a sign to a shop at the same time with equal rapidity if any deviation from the appropriate course of action belonging to each actor on the scene should in the instance of any one of them take place observation may be made of it by every other enactive instructional art   not as a source of respect in this character a distinguishing habiliment would either not operate at all or operate as an instrument of delusion—an instrument of factitious dignity in this case as in every other an enemy to all natural is all factitious dignity of whatsoever appendages composed it operates as a bounty upon an encouragement to and a cause of misbehaviour keep excluded all such marks and every individual is judged according to his works apply those marks every individual is judged otherwise than according to those same works he is judged according to the works looked for at the hands of all individuals belonging to that same class of all the classes here in question that of the judges is the only one—in the instance of which under a system such as that here proposed the effects of any such delusion would be apt to be productive of any considerable mischief but for the caution here given long flowing robes such as among civilized nations have been in use to be thus employed would naturally be allotted to the functionaries of the higher grades in so far as these marks of distinction have had their intended effect they have procured for the worst man the same quantity of respect as for the best instructional art   respect in a proportionate quantity on the one part will by the nature of man be among the inseparable consequences of power on the other so likewise with respect to appropriate intellectual aptitude in whatever shape it cannot fail to be possessed by every one to whom it can happen to have been located in the situation of judge but by the sort of certificate afforded by habiliments of a form and texture similar to those customarily worn by persons belonging to this class his habitual good behaviour will be certified as being at least equally good with that of an average man of that same class and of this certificate every unapt individual will avail himself in such sort as without fear of consequences to indulge in the practice of those pernicious habits to which by the possession of the power belonging to that commanding situation he stands exposed by haughtiness of demeanour it will be his endeavour to maximize the quantity of respect bestowed on him by all who are subject to his power and whatsoever is claimed by apparent knowledge is naturally conceded by selfconscious ignorance instructional exemplificational art   in english practice for the production of every good effect producible by judicature no peculiarity of habiliment is necessary if not the highest the privy council is among the highest among english judicatories sitting on the judgment seat no habiliments does a privy councillor wear distinct from those which are worn by other gentlemen at the quarter sessions of the peace sit amongst other gentlemen members of the house of peers none of them wearing any other than their ordinary dress enactive art   if gowns are employed the difference between that of the judge and that of the law practitioner should be conspicuous colour of the judges plain that of the lawyers partycoloured the judges rather brown than black black gives an air of gloom and severity rendering the wearer an object rather of terror than of amiable regard functionary advocates should in this way be distinguished to the eye from the nonfunctionary ones in every instance the costume of the deputes whether permanent or occasional should be the same as that of their respective principals enactive art   for the quasijurors discriminating habiliments such as to cover their ordinary garments are provided at the public expense     in this way the comparatively indigent members will be preserved from contempt and their comparatively opulent colleagues and the other actors on the scene from disgust enactive art   common to all functionaries a sash with a legend indicative of the particular function in a different colour section xxxvi prisons chapter xiii judges immediate section i night attendance enactive expositive art   of cases presenting a demand for night attendance examples are the following—   a person—charged with or suspected of some crime to the judicial pursuit of which provisional confinement of the person is deemed necessary—is apprehended and brought before the judge need thereupon has place for lodging him or her until the hour arrives for day attendance in some place and manner suitable to what from appearances may be supposed to be his or her condition in life and accustomed habits and that in such sort that no avoidable annoyance from incongruous association may ensue   a course of criminality injurious to person or property or both is going on at the time for giving termination to it the presence of the judge on the spot is deemed necessary   so any calamity for the prevention or termination of which the ministry of the judge is capable of being employed more speedily or more effectually than that of the preventive service minister enactive art   of the registrar the functions are on this occasion exercised by the judge under appropriate heads he makes a minute of what passes in the course of the next day exemplars of it for distribution are made of it under the care of the registrar name of the book in which the operations performed in the performance of night duty are entered together with such instruments as are the result of those same operations the night register enactive art   out of the matter entered in the night register night attendance registers weekly monthly and annual corresponding to the day attendance registers as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    attendance will be made out by the registrar and his signature thereto attached of the presence of the judge in the night justice chamber as per art   attestation will be made by his signature as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    attendance

performance of the night duty lest in the time generally allotted to repose exercise of judicial functions for cases of urgency be wanting attached to every immediate judicatory is a night justice chamber in which the judge or some depute of his passes the night what is expected is not that he shall throughout the night keep himself awake only that for the purposes of his duty he shall be liable to be awakened enactive art   with or without the intervention of a court the door of this night chamber opens into the street attached to it on the outside is a watchbox in which a ministerial officer or succession of ministerial officers—to wit a doorkeeper or doorkeepers—relieving one another whose duty it is to keep awake are stationed for the night over the door is an inscription in conspicuous characters—the judges night chamber illuminated during the whole of the requisite time by a lamp on one side of the door in a tabular form in like characters and in like manner illuminated is a placard containing and intituled—rules concerning admission on night business expositive instructional art   of the manner in which night duty may be performed with least inconvenience to the functionary an example is as follows— by a partition glazed and grated and a curtain attached that part of the chamber in which the bed is stationed is separated from the entrance part of the glazed frame the upper part is made to slide down and the curtain is undrawn when any person makes his appearance before the judge to persons coming in a peaceable manner and without annoying clamour desiring to be heard on business that would suffer by delay till day time admittance will be given to one or upon occasion two at a time by the doorkeeping watchman as far as to the partition if armed into his custody their arms must first have been delivered so to persons after lawful prehension thus     adduced to the end that they may be disposed of as per art   section ii outdoor attendance enactive art   on whatever occasion for giving execution and effect in the most apt manner to the law it is become necessary or desirable that at a distance from the justice chamber the judge immediate in person or by some apt depute should exercise any of his functions—he is bound to do so the duty which on such occasions he performs is styled the judges outdoor duty ratiocinative expositive instructional art   of the purposes for which it may be necessary or desirable that outdoor duty should be performed examples are as follows—   maximizing the instructiveness of evidence   preservation of evidence from deperition   prevention or termination of damage by delinquency or calamity ratiocinative instructional art   purpose i maximizing the instructiveness of evidence the instructiveness of evidence is at its maximum when the perceptible objects which enter into the composition of the grounds of the judges decision have come under the cognizance of his senses as in the case of any other person so in the case of the judge—only in default of the faculty of taking such cognizance or for the purpose of making known to the superordinate authorities the grounds on which he acts can the decision consistently with the due regard to the ends of justice direct and collateral together be placed on the comparatively inferior ground constituted by reports made by other persons in the character of witnesses ratiocinative instructional art   in relation to one of the two direct ends of justice to wit avoidance of misdecision—the advantage gained by performance of outdoor duty—that is to say by migration to the spot in question for the purpose of inspection—consists in the difference in point of instructiveness between the ground on which the decision rests in the two opposite cases to wit   where the conception formed by the judge in relation to the object in question has for its sole ground a report or reports made to him by some other person or persons to whose senses in so far as their declaration is correct and complete the object did at the time and place in question present itself—  where his conception has for its ground the impression made by that same object on his own senses expositive instructional art   of the case in which performance of outdoor duty may be necessary to the accomplishment     of this purpose the subject matter of inspection being in all three cases a thing immoveable examples are as follows—   where the boundaries between the property of one person and that of another are to be ascertained or adjusted   for the purpose of compensation where the amount of damage produced on a certain spot by physical or human agency is to be ascertained   where the question whether a contract of which a certain spot has been the subject has or has not been duly performed is to be determined ratiocinative instructional art   the judge by whom the decision is framed must be the same judge by whom the visit to the spot has been made or the advantage in question will not have been reaped if it be by the judge principal that the decision is to be framed by the judge principal must the visit have been made if it be by a judge depute by that same judge depute a case may indeed be in which it may be of advantage upon the whole that the visiting and inspecting judge be a person other than the deciding judge but in this case the advantage if any will consist in the superiority in respect of trustworthiness on the part of the report made by the visiting to the deciding judge in comparison of the report that would have been made by other alleged percipient witnesses or in the addition made by the report of that same visiting judge to the reports made by other alleged percipient witnesses expositive ratiocinative exemplificational art   purpose ii preservation of evidence from deperition of the cases in which performance of outdoor duty may be necessary to the accomplishment of this purpose examples are as follows—   of the proposed witness the testimony being necessary to rectitude of decision he is not capable of coming of himself on accersition or of being adduced to the justice chamber without danger of death or serious and lasting detriment to health as where for conviction of a murderer or intended murderer necessity has place for the elicitation of testimony from the lips of the person wounded by him and so for whatsoever purpose the testimony happens to be needed whether for proof of a wrong in a penal case or for proof of a right in a nonpenal case expositive ratiocinative exemplificational art     a ship on the point of sailing the testimony of certain proposed witnesses on the occasion of a suit penal or nonpenal being indispensable they cannot in the requisite number during the time necessary for the journey to and fro with the intervening demurrage quit the ship without danger of destruction or of preponderant damage thereto or to the value of the cargo to the freighters by the journey of the judge to the ship the time of the journey and more or less of the demurrage as well as all danger to ship and cargo will be saved expositive ratiocinative art   purpose iii prevention or termination or say suppression of damage by delinquency or calamity for examples of such damage see ch xi ministers severally section   preventive service minister of the judges outdoor attendance so far as regards delinquency the exercise will be no other than that exercise of his sedative function as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    extended to outdoor cases the reasons for the imparting to the judicial department this branch of power are—that in a case of such emergency it may happen that the ministry of a judge may be capable of being employed more promptly than that of a preventive service minister or of any subordinate of his and that by the superior authority of the judge the requisite physical cooperation of persons at large may be more effectually obtained than by the authority of any inferior functionary in the preventive service subdepartment instructional art  0 where the subject matter of inspection be it a person or a thing is not physically or as per art   prudentially incapable of being adduced to the justice chamber the question will arise—object to judge or judge to object object to judge will of course be the general rule judge to object a case of exception to give a detailed description of the exceptions proper to be made belongs to the penal and nonpenal codes with the procedure codes thereto respectively attached instructional art    to the same codes will belong the task of framing arrangements having for their object in cases where for the making of such visitation expense is necessary the making provision for such expense taking at the same time the requisite precautions for preventing on these occasions the undue consumption of the public time and money by application made thereof to private purposes enactive art    under the care of the registrar on the occasion of each visit is framed and kept the judicatorys incidental outdoor register to wit under the heads following together with any such others as may come to be prescribed in the penal and nonpenal codes   time—to wit year month day of the month and day of the week   purpose for which the visit was

time section ii relation to principal enactive expositive art   at the requisition of the judge principal a depute permanent is at all times bound to commence his sittings at the place day and hour in

collectively section    attendance it being understood that the depute is not bound to do judicial service other or more severe than that to which the judge principal is himself bound enactive art   if without just excuse after such requisition received with time sufficient for compliance he omits to attend and serve or departs before the appointed time of service is expired entry of such his default will be made by the registrar in the register of the day and the defaulter will stand compensationally and punitionally responsible as to excuses for noncompliance with judicial mandates on the part of public functionaries see the procedure code enactive art   by any confirmation expressed or implied given by the judge principal to the proceedings of the judge depute it is not to be understood unless so expressed that he has taken personal cognizance of such proceedings or any of them all that is meant is—that by him nothing erroneous in them has been known or suspected to have had place for error in the proceedings of the depute appeal to the judge appellate affords the same remedy as for the like in the proceedings of the principal enactive art   for relief against oppression of a judge depute permanent by his principal appeal lies to the appellate judicatory instructional art   oppression in a particular shape—constituting an abuse—in which the guarding against it is attended with a particular degree of difficulty—is this— to the fulfilment of deputes service time two years as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    locable who and thence to his locability in the situation of principal the principal to an unlimited extent applies undue retardation namely by purposed forbearance to assign to him his due proportion of the aggregate number of suits instructional art   inducements adequate to the production of this injustice are at all times in the nature of man and things   illwill for example towards the depute in question   undue partiality in favour of this or that other depute   jealousy of superior talent or appropriate aptitude in some other shape in the instance of this same depute   on the part of the judge principal desire of recommending himself to the favour of the superordinate locating functionary namely the justice minister or any other high functionary under the notion of the deputes being to them respectively an object of disfavour well or ill grounded or a rival depute of undue favour instructional art   such being the abuse now as to the remedy two obvious ones present themselves rotation and lot but by either of these the public service in this shape might be left exposed to detriment in an unlimited degree namely by inaptitude on the part of a depute to a corresponding degree instructional art   although against abuse in this shape scarcely does the nature of things admit of any completely effectual remedy yet the following palliatives will be seen to be of no inconsiderable efficacy and quite sufficient to preserve the institution of deputeship against rejection   the depute submits to the injustice till the migration of the unjust judge principal into another judgeshire as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    migration takes place of which migration the time cannot be later than three years and may have place at any day   the depute himself migrates into another judgeshire if in the judicatory in question his conduct has been irreproachable no considerable objection to his aptitude in any shape having become apparent complaints against him on the part of his principal will have the effect of drawing attention to his suffering the rendering him an object of sympathy and the engaging the judge of this or that other judgeshire to make choice of him for depute   on the ground in question the depute makes his appeal to the judge appellate of the judicatory or to the justice minister who thereupon if he thinks fit addresses to the principal an admonition or recommendation having for its object the application of the appropriate redress   through the medium of the press the depute makes his appeal to the publicopinion tribunal     instructional art   as to the two last of these remedies such is the natural uncertainty of their success and such on that and other accounts on the part of a party injured the natural reluctance to having recourse to them that such recourse does not present itself as likely to be in any considerable degree frequent but of the eventual recourse to one or other of these four remedies the existence of an effective apprehension on the part of every judge principal presents itself as being in every instance in a high degree probable and that in such a degree of strength as to be sufficient for confining the abuse within bounds as narrow as the nature of man in any case admits of enactive art  0 judge principal deputes serviceregulating function in the exercise of his eventuallyemendative function subject to the control and direction of the appellate judicatory and the justice minister—each immediate judge principal from time to time by the light of experience frames regulations respecting the manner in which the various portions of the business of his judicatory as determined by the species of suit shall be distributed among the several judge deputes permanent attached to that same judicatory enactive art    no judicial business will remain unproceeded upon so long as there exists upon the list a judge depute permanent by whom proceedings thereupon can be carried on enactive art    if at the same time there be divers persons in waiting each of them in the character of an applicant to give commencement to a suit and at the same time divers judge deputes permanent within call and unoccupied the several applications will be distributed among them by lot saving such choice as the judge may see reason to make for special cause assigned enactive art    when in any judicatory by any cause whatsoever a vacancy has been produced in the situation of judge principal—the judge depute permanent if there be but one or if more than one the senior in service as per ch xii section    located how takes his place and until the vacancy is filled up by the presence of a successor occupies it but without the pay enactive art    so in case of any temporary disability of the judge through sickness or any unexpected prolongation of his stay upon distant outdoor service enactive instructional art    at the request of a party on either side or of his own motion any particular point may by a judge depute permanent be referred to the cognizance of the judge principal but it will be for the care of the judge principal and that of his judge appellate that such reference be not made to have the effect of an engine of preponderant delay vexation or expense enactive instructional ratiocinative art    forasmuch as appeal will lie from the decisions of the judge depute as well as from those of the judge principal appeal to the judge principal is not allowed from any decision of the judge depute lest such interposed stage of appeal should be employed as an engine of undue delay vexation and expense but if in a case of doubt and difficulty request of any such reference as in art    be made—and in the declared opinion of the judge depute such reference may be made without preponderant delay vexation and expense—he will do well to comply with the request mention thereof and of the consequent compliance or noncompliance will of course be entered on the record enactive ratiocinative instructional art    as when it is before the judge principal so when it is before a judge depute permanent that the suit has been commenced—after the original inquiry—a recapitulatory inquiry will have place in any of the cases mentioned in ch xvi quasijury section   fields of service on this second inquiry the judge depute should in general be the same as on the first because to any second judge the evidence that had been elicited on the first inquiry cannot otherwise present itself in the most apt shape unless the percipient witnesses be examined over again by which correspondent delay expense and vexation must be produced nevertheless for preponderant reasons assigned the judge depute permanent may on this occasion of his own motion transmit the recapitulatory inquiry from himself to the judge principal who in such case will either perform the inquiry himself or transmit it to some other one of his judge deputes permanent and on the application of any party with or without reason assigned it will in like manner be transmitted to the judge principal but in this case it will be for the judge principal to consider whether the application had     not for its cause a hope entertained of the deception capable of being produced by the comparatively unapt shape of the first edition of the evidence and if yes to declare such his opinion or suspicion and act accordingly on the occasion of his decrees enactive art    contestedinterpretationreporting function when the ultimate decree on the occasion of which—the demand for a legislative interpretation presents itself is the decree of a judge depute he it is by whom if at all this function will have to be exercised but in this case the report must at or before the time of its being transmitted to the judge appellate be transmitted to the judge immediate principal for the purpose of receiving any such observations as he may think fit to add before his fiat is attached to it enactive art    eventuallyemendative function by a judge depute permanent may this function also be exercised but in this case likewise the proposed amendment must at or before the time of its being transmitted to the judge appellate be transmitted to the judge immediate principal to receive his observations as above enactive art  0 sistitive function by a judge depute permanent may this function also be exercised but in this case exceptions excepted the mandate must be countersigned by the judge principal or his substitute in case of vacancy or in case of sickness or distance from the judgmentseat as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 selfsuppletive function exception is where before the decision of the judge principal or of such his substitute could take effect—irreparable damage would probably ensue in which case a clause giving indication of the damage and of the evidence on which the apprehension of it is grounded must be inserted in the appropriate mandate enactive art    preinterpretative function by a judge depute permanent may this function also be exercised but in this case also the proposed interpretation must at or before the time of its being transmitted to the judge appellate be transmitted to the judge immediate principal to receive his observations as above instructional ratiocinative art    if by reason of the multitude of the persons to whom by this means the exercise of the contested interpretation reporting eventuallyemendative sistitive and preinterpretative functions is thus imparted—the demand made upon the attention of the legislature or upon that of the judges appellate or upon that of the justice minister shall at any time be found to be inconveniently increased—the legislature will make the appropriate arrangements for lessening it instructional expositive art    of the ways in which such demand may be lessened examples are the following—   confining to the judge principal the exercise of these functions respectively   requiring on each occasion the concurrence of judge deputes permanent more than one   in the case of the preinterpretative function interdicting applications on the same subject by the same person to judicatories more than one enactive art    for cause assigned and subject to appeal to the judge appellate to a judge principal belongs the power of dislocating at any time any judge depute permanent serving in his judicatory in which case the name of the depute is by the registrar eliminated out of the list formed from the individual service calendar as per ch xii section    locable who enactive art    of such elimination the effect is—to exclude the person so eliminated from the capacity of being located in the situation of judge principal and from that of officiating in any other judgeshire in the situation of judge depute enactive art    in case of appeal to the judge appellate and thereafter to the justice minister belong to them respectively the options following—   to confirm the dislocation altogether   to annul it altogether   to confirm it as to the particular judgeshire in question annulling it as to the incapacity of serving in this or that other judgeshire or in this or that number of judgeshires and so as to the incapacity of being located in the situation of judge principal enactive art    on the occasion and for the purpose of such dislocation the judge principal proceeds in the same manner as in the case of any subordinate functionary enactive art    if the dislocation be for ulterior punishment or for compensation to a party wronged or both—the judge principal will proceed and decree accordingly on the same evidence instructional art    for the care to be taken by a judge principal as to the enabling his depute to acquire aptitude for location as principal see ch xii section    judges c remuneration     section iii term of service enactive art   for the purpose of his locability in the situation of judge principal a judge depute permanent unless dislocated as per section   relation to principal or in the same mode as a judge principal as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 dislocable how continues in such his situation for life unless and until located in the situation of judge immediate principal or that of immediate registrar enactive art   in the judicatory in which he first received his deputation he continues unless dislocated as long as he chooses and from thence passes into any others successively in which he finds a judge principal disposed to employ him as depute section iv attendance enactive art   in the situation of judge depute permanent the attendance will in respect of days and hours be in general the same as in that of the judge principal as per ch xii section    or in such other degree of assiduity as on the occasion of the location or afterwards shall have been agreed on between the principal and each depute yet so as for want of some judge depute permanent or occasional no business shall remain undespatched instructional art   for particulars see section   relation to principal section v remuneration enactive expositive art   distinction power and in proportion to appropriate aptitude reputation—of these elements is composed the remuneration of a judge depute permanent add to these if the situation of judge principal with superior power and remuneration in a pecuniary shape but charged with closer obligation be among the objects of desire the prospect of being therein located as per ch xii section    locable who from unwilling hands receipt of other remuneration is extortion from willing ones corruption instructional art   the eligibility of the prospect in this case is much superior to the case of the articled clerk of an attorney or of a law student before he is called to the bar five years is the term of their apprenticeship with prospect of uncertain and variable remuneration at the end of it the apprenticeship of the judge depute is no more than two years with prospect of certain and fixed remuneration instructional ratiocinative art   on this occasion a question which cannot fail to be put and to which particular and sinister interest will be eager to make answer in the negative is this—is there any sufficient probability that upon such terms under obligation to so close an attendance under such strict responsibility and without salary or remuneration in any other pecuniary or quasipecuniary shape—apt persons will constantly be found willing to serve in this capacity in adequate abundance to this question apply the following answers—   judging from extensive and notorious custom there seems no reason for regarding the requisite acceptance as being in any degree improbable   were pay in any shape to any amount attached to the office the whole plan would be frustrated this will presently be made manifest   in the character of an adequate cause of demand for expense insufficiency of inducement should not be assumed upon the ground of such insufficiency it will be time enough to act after the existence of it has been demonstrated by experience   supposing it demonstrated by experience that upon these terms an adequate number of apt persons are not procurable—in that case a course which in the first instance would be more eligible than the attaching of pay to the situation of depute would be the attaching of additional pay to the situation of judge principal for in that case the amount of the expense would be determinate whereas in the opposite case it would be indeterminate   on the ground of economy were that the only one the nonnecessity of pay would in this instance as in every other be sufficient reason for withholding it   but in this instance by every penny needlessly thus applied a step is made towards the creation of delay and denial of justice for procurement of the quantity of judge power sufficient to shut the door against those evils the quantity of money capable of being applied to this object is suppose sufficient but barely sufficient add now more pay—call in consequence for more money—by the supposition it is not as yet to be had—it is not to be had till a law for the raising of the money has been enacted what then is the consequence suits present themselves for the cognizance and termination of which no judge power is at hand     instructional ratiocinative art   so much for the several distinguishable reasons for which to the situation of judge depute pecuniary emolument should not in any shape be attached now for the way in which by any such arrangement the whole design would be completely frustrated from the allowing to the judge principal an unlimited power of locating deputes in any number in which he can find persons willing to accept the office no evil consequence in any shape can under the responsibility provided as per ch xii judiciary collectively section  0 selfsuppletivefunction in any case ensue attach emolument to the situation the inlet thus given to abuse is manifest and to the evil capable of being produced by it no limit can be assigned why not answer even because no limit can be assigned to the multitude of the suits or demands for suits which on this or that particular occasion may chance to be rising up and calling for judge power for taking cognizance of them on which consideration are grounded the provisions made in the next chapter ch xv for judge deputes occasional to be located as occasion calls if then to the situation of judge depute permanent pay were attached say in the shape of salary here would be so many salaries so circumstanced that on the part of the judge principal to the interest would be added the power of loading the community with the expense of conferring this benefit on persons in whatsoever number it were agreeable to him to confer it what then would be the ulterior consequence answer that as the several particular occasions ceased to have place here would be so many situations remaining in a state of sinecure instructional ratiocinative art   if in this shape the bounty of fortune were not adequate to his wishes little difficulty would he find in the supplying the deficiency by art how should he the whole history of the judicial establishment with its procedure—in england not to speak of other countries—is the history of art applied to this same purpose in the situation in question the majority of men not to say the totality would by this sinister interest be tempted—would be induced as above to create judge depute power in excess nor is this all for among men in this situation suppose in the judge of this or that judgeshire public virtue of so rigid a texture as to be proof against this temptation then comes another and an opposite danger the danger—lest of this number a proportion more or less considerable should for fear of the imputation forbear to create to a sufficient amount the additional judge power requisite and thus it is—that in every or almost every judgeshire there would be either too much of it or not enough on the other hand lay out of the question all pecuniary emolument—all interests concur in securing the universally desirable result—providing a sufficiency of this power and avoiding to provide it in excess be the supply ever so great on no man is any burthen imposed by it no man is in any way a sufferer by it be it ever so small still no deficiency is there in the quantity of it the supply is in a word elastic it possesses one of the properties of the fabled boots it fits itself to every leg add pecuniary emolument the supply becomes rigid the good becomes volatile and flies off with the moment the evil—the pecuniary burthen remains fixed instructional ratiocinative art   of the here proposed arrangements one natural result seems to be at any rate in a judgeshire of a certain extent and thence furnishing a certain quantity of judicial business—the formation though in a manner scarcely perceptible of two classes of deputes permanent already alluded to in ch xii characterizable by the denominations of expectant stipendiaries or for shortness say stipendiaries and honoraries by this distinction considerable advantage seems to be promised and no considerable inconvenience threatened between the two a sort of emulation seems likely to take place emulation and thence the competition for good repute good repute in the joint estimation of the fountain of promotion above and of the publicopinion tribunal all around a sort of auction in which the biddings would be in the shape of good desert of good desert in the first place in the article of punctuality of attendance that being in the power of every individual not incapacitated by sickness and which in the present case may be considered as a modification of appropriate moral aptitude in the next place so far as in the power of each competitor in the shape of appropriate intellectual and appropriate active aptitude instructional ratiocinative art   nor in this case does competition threaten to be productive of any such ill humour as in all cases is more or less liable to be the accompaniment of it by no external mark will the distinction be characterized on no man will either denomination be in such sort fixed as that if it should sit heavy upon him it may not be in his power to withdraw himself from under it the transition from the one class to the other will be insensible and as circumstances and inclination change may have place successively in both directions considerable in this respect will be the influence of the magnitude allotted to the minimum of the quantity of attendance less than which will not be consistent with continuance on the list compared with that of the quantity of the attendance exacted at the hands of the judge principal the less the quantity of   0 attendance exacted the greater would naturally be the number of those in whose estimate the distinction and power would outweigh the burthen of the labour the greater the quantity exacted the smaller the number of those in whose estimate the prospect of the still superior power coupled with the remuneration in expectancy would be necessary to the production of that same effect if by an advantageous change in his pecuniary circumstances a functionary to whose acceptance of the office the prospect of the pecuniary remuneration had originally been necessary should have been led to set a lower value upon this expectancy than before or at the same time a higher value on the labour than before although a moderate degree of exercise might not be unpleasant to him the result might be—his suffering himself to slide down into the honorary class on the other hand if either by a disadvantageous change in respect of pecuniary circumstances or by an increased relish for the occupation a person whose place had originally been in the honorary class should feel disposed to give increase to the quantity of this exercise he might thus if on the part of the judge principal he found no repugnance pass without eclât and without attracting any decided observation out of the honorary into the expectant stipendiary class in this way might public benefit be in perfect unison with private convenience a union on which not only the utility but the stability of every institution so materially depends section vi locable who enactive art   except as here excepted each judge principal upon his responsibility as per ch xii section  0 in addition to such as on his entrance into office in the judicatory in question he finds already in existence locates in the situation of depute permanent such others as he sees need to locate enactive ratiocinative art   so soon as an allcomprehensive code nonpenal and penal branches included together with the system of procedure thereto belonging shall have been established the sole exception to locability in the situation of judge depute is that which regards the profession of an advocate of every person belonging to that profession the name ere he is permitted to practice is set down upon the list of those who are admitted into that profession no person whose name is or has been upon that list is it lawful for a judge principal on pain of dislocation to locate in the situation of judge depute permanent unless his name has for one entire solar year reckoning from the commencement of the then last solar year been eliminated from that same list section vii dislocable how enactive art   if in any one solar year the service time of a judge depute permanent as per ch xii section    locable who falls short of one fourth part of the maximum of a judge principals service time during that same period as per ch xii section    attendance his name is at the first day of the ensuing solar year eliminated from the list of judge deputes permanent the conclusion being formed either that the requisite closeness and punctuality of attendance is greater than he can endure or that in the eyes of the judge principal he is deficient in appropriate aptitude absolute or comparative thus in an immediate judicatory so also in an appellate enactive art   in other ways a judge depute permanent is dislocable by the several causes of dislocation by which a judge principal is dislocable as per ch xii section  0 thus in an immediate judicatory so also in an appellate section viii partiality obviated instructional art   if to the action of any cause of partiality as per ch xii section    the situation of a judge depute permanent to whom a suit is about to be consigned is recognised by him as standing exposed he will do well spontaneously to declare it and on that account decline cognizance of it enactive art   for the purpose of ascertaining the existence or nonexistence of such exposure if questions as per ch xii section    be put to a judge depute the judge principal or some other depute will take his place in consequence during the examination and unless the cognizance of the suit be remitted to him hear and terminate it in his stead for other matters see chapter xii chapter xv judge immediate deputes occasional section i fields of service enactive art   the fields of service or jurisdiction     of an immediate judge depute occasional are on the occasion of each suit marked out and determined by the act by which he is located and thence by the suit or suits for the hearing and determination of which he is located instructional art   of judge deputes permanent the institution has but one final cause—namely the prevention of delay by whichsoever of its two causes produced delay in respect of the progress made in such suits to which commencement has been already given and delay in respect of the commencement of such suits to which commencement has not been given of judge deputes occasional the institution has two final causes namely the minimization of delay as above and the giving the judicial cognizance of the suit in question to a person other than the persons occupying in the judgeshire in question the several situations of judge principal and judge depute permanent a desire to this effect may have had for its cause either of two opinions   an opinion of the inaptitude of those official judges in the aggregate or of that one by whom it is foreknown or conjectured that the suit would be taken in hand or   an opinion of extraordinary and comparatively superior relative aptitude as having place in the instance of this or that individual at large of whom for the purpose in question proposition is accordingly made section ii term of service enactive instructional art   of an immediate judge depute occasional the term of service is on each occasion marked out by the act by which he is located he may be located either for the suit or for the day if for the day it will be for the hearing and determining such suits as shall come before him in the course of that same day or any such suit as after having been commenced on a former day shall contrary to expectation at the close of it remain undetermined instructional art   exceptions excepted a judge principal will avoid giving unless in case of necessity to a proposed depute cognizance of a suit which does not present a promise of its termination in the course of that same day enactive instructional art   an exception is where it is on application or by free consent of the parties on both sides that a depute occasional receives his deputation for in that case whatsoever be the number of days that the suit requires following or not immediately following one another sittings may be continued by him till the suit has received its termination instructional art   exceptions excepted as per art   only in case of an extraordinary influx of suits so great that the time of the deputes permanent if more than one will not suffice to prevent accumulation with the consequent delay—will the judge principal in addition to such deputes permanent locate any occasional depute thus is provision made against superfluous and sinecurist judge deputes permanent instructional expositive exemplificational art   of the subject matter of the sorts of suits the individuals of which are most likely to be apt for being committed to the cognizance of a depute occasional in the expectation that on one and the same day suits in considerable numbers may be made to receive their termination examples are the following—   simple corporal vexation in any of its ordinary shapes   simple vituperation as distinguished from specific defamation   small debts on any of the ordinary accounts for definition of nos   and   see penal code section iii locable who instructional art   in the choice of a judge depute occasional for the purpose of this or that individual suit the judge principal it is expected will locate by preference a person proposed or freely approved by the parties on both sides if any such person not manifestly unapt can be found willing thus to serve ratiocinative art   if not approved by all parties the approbation of one or more will be a reason rather for rejection than for choice since by such partial approbation on the part of those who choose ground will be afforded for suspicion of a correspondent partiality on the part of the object of their choice section iv powers enactive instructional art   coercive powers whether for means of execution or for means of probation the judge will in the deputation instrument either communicate or not to

examples those mentioned in ch xii section   functions common to judges enactive art   if it be by consent of parties that the individual in question is located the judge is by such consent exonerated from compensational responsibility as towards any such consenting party for any misuse or nonuse of any power so communicated enactive instructional art   in cases in which such coercive powers whether for means of probation or for means of execution are conferred—they will be conferred by mention made of them respectively in the deputation instrument by which the depute is located enactive instructional ratiocinative art   that no needless delay be caused either by his death sickness or absence from the principal justice chamber on outdoor duty as per ch xiii the judge principal will take care that there shall be always one depute permanent at least furnished by him with appropriate powers for location of deputes occasional with requisite powers as above enactive art   of his own authority neither on the body nor on the property of any individual other than the parties joining in the request or consent for his appointment can a judge depute occasional exercise any act of power

defendant in the wrong might by mere inaction produce the effect of a decision in his favour enactive ratiocinative art   neither of a purely public penal nor of a publicoprivate penal case as to which see the penal code can the cognizance be committed to referees the security of the public against malefactors must not be placed at the mercy of those to whom it may happen to be of the number of those same malefactors enactive instructional art   the proceeding before referees will stand in the place of the original inquiry before a judge principal it may accordingly if the judge thinks fit at the instance of any party or a majority of the referees be followed by the recapitulatory inquiry before the judge with a quasijury as per ch xvi section   enactive ratiocinative art

inaction of any two of them be for an indefinite length of time or for ever stayed for remedy the judge at the instance of a party on either side may proceed either in the way of original inquiry or

establishment encumbered with useless matter the legislature will make the requisite arrangements for the elimination of these records as well as others so soon as all demand for them for the eventual proof of falsehood or of wrong in any other shape or right in any shape shall have been at an end saving any such memorandums as may be of use towards an allcomprehensive statistic history of the

not for if yes parties might by a collusive suit instituted for the purpose or on the occasion of a really contested suit elicit from persons at large under the name of evidence information productive of wrong in all manner of shapes to the proposed evidenceholders or others instructional ratiocinative art    arbitration is thus a species of arrangement which cannot under any code without very pernicious deficiency be left unprovided for in a code framed upon the principle of this present one true it is—that the frequency of the demand for the application of it to practice will not naturally speaking be near so great as under any as yet existing established system of law still the demand for it cannot altogether be superseded particularly in cases of complicated accounts between commercial men or of distribution of large masses of property among claimants by different titles instructional ratiocinative art    under arbitration unless the requisite support be given to it by law two deficiencies unavoidably have place want of power to secure the attendance of witnesses and want of power to give execution and effect to the award of these two defects the first will not be productive of any evil consequences in those cases where there are no extraneous witnesses or none but what can be made forthcoming without the aid of the compulsory power of the judge but the other may have place in any case against this latter defect the english law provides a remedy such as it is by adding to use the phraseology of the present code the imperative decree of the judge to the opinative decree pronounced by the arbitrator but this mode of escaping from the clutches of the lawlearned brotherhood could not but be in no small degree unacceptable to them it was the work of statute law and not till the reign of william the third was it forced upon them they have accordingly embraced every occasion for clogging it with technicalities diminishing the efficiency of it by factitious expense and delay and thus bringing it into disrepute section vi remuneration enactive art   if proposed or freely agreed to by the parties on both sides a depute occasional located by consent of parties does not stand inhibited from the acceptance of remuneration to any such amount and in any such lawful shape as shall have been agreed on enactive art   so neither a referee

augmentation of reward     enactive ratiocinative art   lest more reward be secretly received from the one side than from the other the amount of what is given on each side will on this occasion be judicially ascertained receipt of remuneration in any shape or quantity other than what has been judicially declared will be corruption section vii partiality obviated enactive art   in relation to any supposed interest selfregarding or sympathetic a judge depute occasional is subjectible to interrogation and in consequence liable to be divested of the cognizance of the suit in like manner as a judge depute permanent as per ch xiv section   instructional ratiocinative art   but for the restriction thus imposed with or even without confederacy with a judge depute occasional appointed at their instance for the purpose illdisposed persons might in this way by a fictitious suit obtain undue advantage in any one of a variety of shapes to the injury of third persons against any such mischievous enterprise the judge principal will accordingly be on his guard for other matters see chapter xii chapter xvi quasijury general preliminary observations being in its leading features different from every mode of judicature as yet in use in which men without appropriate experience are admitted into any share of judicial power it became matter of necessity to employ for the designation of it a new and appropriate name having then in common with the jury system this characteristic feature the word jury is accordingly employed in the composition of it but the powers allotted to the body thus designated being different in several and these very material respects from those allotted to any body of functionaries as yet designated by the name of a jury the latin adverb quasi is employed for the purpose of giving advertisement of the difference in the framing of this part of the code as of every other submission to the ends of justice as herein all along designated has been the only guide usage being no otherwise referred to or employed than as a source of evidence evidence to wit of the beneficial effects of such parts of the practice in relation to the subject matter in question as have been found beneficial in their character and tendency and of the pernicious effects of such parts as have exhibited marks of an opposite nature and tendency for this purpose with the ends of justice for constant guide the institution of a jury in all its several forms has been the subject of constant scrutiny taking these ends in the manner that reagents are employed in chemistry the endeavour has been all along to effect between good and bad a clear separation to put aside the bad to preserve the good for use adding to it such new and ulterior elements as the contemplation of those same ends has on the several occasions been able to suggest compared with the power of a jury in the english style the power of a quasijury will in respect of effective force be found much narrowed on the other hand in respect of extent over the field of law and legislation much enlarged rendered in a word coextensive throughout with that of the judicial power itself antecedently to entering into particulars the reason why the power of this body of functionaries is comparatively speaking rendered thus narrowed is that the demand for it which under the english government is so urgent has in the constitution delineated in the present code no place in the english form of government the medium in which judges as well as almost all other functionaries live and move and have their being is an atmosphere of corruption the judges are in effect dependent creatures of the monarch whose interest is so completely hostile to that of the people and at the same time in regard to responsibility as well in respect of dislocability as punibility virtually essentially and according to all experience irresponsible the rule of action having for its makers in all its parts a set of men whose interest is in every branch of it in a state of correspondent hostility to the people one great and perhaps the principal use and good effect of the institution consists in what it does towards rendering of no effect every part to which it applies itself in the body of the laws in a word to undo what legislators and lawyers have done is the great use of juries in so far as what is done by those highest constituted authorities is right—conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number—the institution of a jury cannot but be prejudicial—detractive from the sum of that same greatest happiness i the apt features observed in the jury system and on that account retained under the quasijury system may be thus enumerated   the general end in view namely the applying limits and checks to the power of the judge   the degree of publicity which is in fact attached to the jury system and which with or without design has spread to other suits in which no such body of unprofessional judges is called in       the sort of obligation which in virtue of the obligatory powers given to the jury over the result of the cause the judge finds himself subjected to—namely the obligation of giving to the jury and thence to the public at large explanation and reasons having for their object and tendency the rendering the nature of the case clearer to the public as well as them than it would be otherwise the affording such grounds as can be found for such decision as avowedly or unavowedly it is his desire they should adopt and thus rendering it more difficult than without such explanation and reasons for a judge to pronounce or cause to be pronounced a decision palpably unjust and indefensible   the effect which it has had in relation to evidence causing it to be exhibited in a better shape than any in which it is generally exhibited in a judicatory into which no such body of ephemeral judges is introduced ii the unapt features observed in the jury system and from the quasijury system on that account discarded may be thus enumerated i evils correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice   the corruptness of the situation of the persons locating in this case the functionaries by whom these alleged and supposed intended limitators of the powers of the judges are located are the sheriffs of counties or other functionaries alike exposed to monarchical influence to the naturally irresistible influence of that same allruling functionary by whose influence over the judge the chief reason is afforded for the endeavour to apply this or any other check to his power in virtue of this origin a jury comes into existence with a principle of corruption involved in its essence   the solemn promise forced upon the members of this body coupled with a compulsory declaration of unanimity which declaration is in frequent instances unavoidably and necessarily false   the pernicious use made on this occasion of the religious sanction the force of which has in practice been sought to be added on this occasion to the other sanctions   the arbitrary power given over the result of the cause to a set of men who by their situation are demonstrated to be in comparison of the judge the authority with which theirs antagonizes in respect of appropriate knowledge judgment and active aptitude palpably inferior while by means of the habit of perjury forced upon them as above sensibility to the force of the bridle supposed to be applied by the several sanctions in question cannot but be diminished   the circumstances by which the tutelary power of the publicopinion tribunal is in great measure prevented from bearing upon their minds these are—  the secrecy in which the deportment and discourse of every one of them while in the state of confinement in which they are kept upon their retiring for the purpose of discussion is involved a circumstance by which in respect of everything which belongs to that same deportment and discourse their responsibility to that tribunal is nearly done away   the magnitude of their number by which in respect of the aptitude of the conjunct decision the sense of responsibility is so much weakened on the part of each   the scantiness of the application made of this supposed instrument of control with reference to the power of the judge the nonapplication of it to more than one out of many spots in the field of judicature and the nonapplication of it to any more than one out of all the stages through which any suit is liable to be carried if to the pernicious effects of this incongruity there be any circumstance of alleviation it must be to be looked for in those circumstances by which as above its utility—its contributoriness to the ends of justice is so much reduced but where in those suits and stages this institution how unapt soever has no place the opposition of the system of procedure to the ends of justice is still stronger and more mischievous ii evils correspondent and opposite to the collateral ends of justice maximization of expense of justice in the shape of delay vexation and pecuniary expense   needless quantity of vexation or expense or both produced by the multitude of the actually serving jurymen in each suit   much greater vexation and expense produced by the still greater multitude of the obligatorily attending jurymen out of whom in each suit the actually serving are drawn   the vexation and expense and mischievous complication produced by the operation called challenging an operation the object of which is to keep excluded out of the actually serving list of jurymen such number as are on one side or other suspected of partiality in favour of the respective adversaries   vexation attendant on the state of confinement and suffering to which in case of disagreement the whole twelve are kept involved to confinement which has for its avowed object the compelling them in an unknown number to make a false declaration and violate that solemn engagement on which their efficiency is supposed to depend iii feature beneficial under the government under which the jury institution originated prejudicial under the government here proposed therefore hence discarded this feature is the weakness which by means of some of the abovementioned features this portion of the adjective branch of law keeps infused in certain portions of the corresponding substantive branch namely those which have for their object the maximization     of the power of the few at the expense of the security of the many iv features supposed apt which not being found in the jury system are here in the quasijury system introduced   division of every quasijury into two sections   the more erudite   the more popular the more popular the more numerous thence in case of disagreement the will of those who belong to the more numerous section may preponderate over the will of those who belong to the less numerous section those who belong to the more erudite section are introduced in order that by the influence of understanding over understanding those who may be presumed to excel in intellectual aptitude may guide those in whose instance appropriate moral aptitude is more probable in so far as they think it proper to be so guided   allotting to the quasijury by law in express terms and thence with surer more comprehensive and more constant effect than has place in the case of a jury the several functions herein designated by the several adjuncts auditive interrogative and opinative or censorial   stating in express terms the nature of the explanations expected at the hands of the judge for the use of the quasijury as also for the use of the members of the publicopinion tribunal   ordaining the registration of the discourses of the quasijurymen as well as those of the judge namely for the purpose of subjecting to responsibility those assessors of the judge in case of unapt discourse on their part and also the judge himself in case of disregard shown to their discourse when its title to regard shall appear unimpeachable   into the register admission secured to any alterations proposed by the quasijury or any member of it in the terms of the decision delivered by the judge yet so as the judge shall remain at liberty to pay what regard to it he thinks proper remaining thus with his responsibility undiminished the proposed amendment going up of course to the judge appellate for his adoption rejection or modification   power to the quasijury at the instance of a party to send up to the judge appellate the decision of the judge for confirmation or alteration in a class of penal cases in which appeal is not allowed where a quasijury is called in cases in which from the assured multitude of groundless appeals it would otherwise be productive of preponderant evil by useless vexation to parties injured and quasijurors   power to the quasijury to allow to the pursuer the faculty of appealing as well from a judgment of acquittal as from a judgment of conviction   power to the quasijury to allow to a pursuer in case of conviction the faculty of appealing against the sentence on the ground of deficiency as well as to a defendant on the ground of excess in the quantum of the punishment   power to the quasijury to call in the assistance of the government advocate or the eleemosynary advocate at their option to assist in the wording of the amendment proposed by them to the judgment or the sentence of the judge as per no    0 pay—provision made of regular pay for indemnity to those whose pecuniary circumstances would otherwise render the service of the public in this department an intolerable hardship the quantum is such as will render the compensation adequate to the majority of the whole number of the members of the community to render it adequate in the case of the few would render the correspondent burthen intolerable to the many as to the erudite section such pay as could be afforded would be no adequate compensation the distinction attached to their situation will be of more value in their eyes than any pecuniary compensation section i fields of service expositive art   by a quasijury understand an everchanging body of assessors convened from the body of the people for the purpose of serving by the exercise given to their functions in the character of checks applied to the power which but for these and other checks as per ch xii judiciary collectively would be arbitrary in the hands of permanent judges enactive art   attached to every judicatory whether immediate or appellate is a quasijury coextensive with that of the judge is its local field of service enactive art   so with the exceptions in this section expressed is its logical field of service enactive expositive art   the occasions for its service are of two sorts—principal and incidental the principal occasions are those on which the recapitulatory inquiry or say recapitulatory examination otherwise called the quasitrial is performed for the incidental see art    enactive expositive art   the recapitulatory examination supposes the anterior existence of a different one—call this anterior the original inquiry or say original examination if all persons concerned are satisfied with the result of it no recapitulatory examination has place it is the only one it is conducted by the judge his alone being the imperative function the quasijurors     sharing with him in the exercise of the other elementary judicial functions as to which see ch xii judiciary collectively section   enactive expositive art   the recapitulatory examination is performed by the reexhibition reconsideration and if from sources more than one confrontation and comparison of all evidence delivered on the original examination with or without evidence which on the original inquiry was not whether it could or could not be adduced enactive art   the judge has power to perform a recapitulatory examination of his own motion for the satisfaction of the public or of his own conscience he is bound to do so on petition presented by a party on either side security for eventual compensation for the delay vexation and expense being found by the applicant as per procedure code ch xxvii enactive art   when it is of his own motion he pronounces not any definitive decree till after the quasitrial has been performed when on petition decrees such as but for such petition will be definitive—say eventually definitive decrees are pronounced by him and to these decrees the petition has reference enactive art   when on petition it is in this wise—the judges eventually definitive decrees having been pronounced he addresses himself to the parties thus is it the desire of any one of you that there should be a recapitulatory examination if by any one answer be given in the affirmative a day and hour for the purpose is appointed by him after hearing that which they respectively have to say as to the time enactive art  0 in case of necessity the recapitulatory examination is carried on through any number of sittings but unless for obviating some casual and pressing inconvenience no adjournment from one sitting to another has place until the regularly employable quantity of time has been exhausted without the suits being ripe for the definitive decrees saving at all times to the judge the power of continuing the sitting indefinitely to prevent the breaking the thread of the inquiry to the detriment of justice enactive instructional art    should it ever so happen that by the number of sittings expended before the suit is ripe for decision the regular length of service appointed for a set of quasijurors as per section   has been exhausted—they must be detained for whatsoever further number of days is necessary unless by consent of parties matters can be so ordered as that a decision on this or that point shall have been made with the aid of that one quasijury the decision on what remains of the matter of the suit being reserved for another quasijury note that facts in such sort independent one of another may for proof or disproof without preponderant prejudice to right decision be allotted each to a different jury and accordingly such distribution may in any suit be made enactive art    exceptions excepted at the recapitulatory examination no evidence is exhibited that was not exhibited at the original examination if of any part so exhibited deperition actual or virtual has had place supply to the deficiency is made from the minutes and with consent of parties the reexhibition of any article of evidence may be omitted enactive art    exceptions are   where since the issuing of the eventually definitive decree appointing the quasitrial evidence has been discovered the existence of which was not at that time known in this case however to warrant the admission of it timely information in relation to it must have been afforded in default of which it may be either rejected or referred for reexamination by the same or another jury at another time   where in consideration of the length of time that must elapse before the pieces of evidence in question can be obtained the elicitation of it is thus deferred enactive art    the subject matter appointed for quasitrial may be—matter of fact alone or matter of law alone or both together enactive expositive art    the incidental occasions on which a hearing before a quasijury may have place are those on which antecedently or even subsequently to appeal as for definitive misdecision appeal as for quasimisdecision as per ch xxii appellate judicatories section   subject matters of appeal has been made expositive art    quasimisdecision has place in so far as by the conduct of the judge in any other way than by a definitive decree—for example by undue delay or by precipitation—the effect of misdecision has been produced instructional art    on both occasions petition for quasitrial is in effect appeal from the judge acting without a quasijury to the same judge or to another judge acting in that same judicatory with a quasijury for the difference     between appeal so called and this quasiappeal or home appeal or rehearing as it may be called see ch xxii appellate judicatories section   subject matters of appeal enactive art    on any of these same incidental occasions the quasijurors give or refuse their approbation to any petition by which the hearing on which they serve has been produced this approbation they give either simply or with any such modifications as they think fit so likewise their opinion with or without proposed amendments on the subject of any decree or mandate which on that same occasion the judge may have thought fit to issue enactive instructional art    whatsoever opinative propositions have thus been made by a quasijury having in the immediate judicatory been of course entered on the record go up with it in case of appeal to the appellate judicatory for the optional forms capable of being given to such their opinions see the procedure code ch xxvi quasijury section  0 opinative function works vol ii p     so for the particulars of the effect given to them so as to the form of recordation instructional ratiocinative art  0 main uses of a quasijury two—  serving as a check upon the power of the judge thence as a security for his appropriate aptitude   on the part of the quasijurors deriving appropriate instruction to themselves as scholars in the judicatory in its character of a school of justice were the first use the only one defaults would be less material substitutes might in considerable proportion serve as well as principals and thus accommodation might be afforded to both classes to principals by exemption to substitutes by remuneration received from principals instructional ratiocinative art    so far as regards appropriate intellectual aptitude such substitution will in proportion to the extent of it be productive of advantage but in this case service in the character of a substitute might become in a preponderant degree prejudicial in respect of moral aptitude it might become a regular source of livelihood—a profitseeking occupation—in a word a trade in this case though the original aptitude would so far as depended upon experience receive increase yet of this increase a deficiency in respect of the more influential element of appropriate aptitude namely moral aptitude would be a but too natural accompaniment the fraternity composed of the traders would be apt to fall into two divisions arranged against one another by this or that party interest thus arranged they would constitute a known or knowable body and in this body by rich or otherwise powerful individuals such influence might be acquired as might cause these functionaries to exercise their functions according to a regular system in a manner prejudicial to justice and altogether unsusceptible of remedy in a penal or any other direct shape instructional ratiocinative art    in this state of things a corruptive influence might naturally be exercised each upon the other by the substitutequasijuror and the judge the substitute—the frequency of his becoming so depending more or less upon himself—might on the one hand by offensive yet unpunishable demeanour render himself an object of apprehension or by undue obsequiousness of favour to the judge thus there might be a mixture of strife and corruption by either of which still more by both together the beneficialness of the institution and the public confidence in it would be lessened instructional art    so far as regards the corruption this consequence has been made manifest by english experience in the case of jurors as to strife evil in this shape is under that form of government but too effectually obviated by that corruptive influence and ascendancy by which pretended and supposed checks are so uniformly converted into subservient instruments instructional ratiocinative art    of the service rendered by the institution in the character of a check upon the judge the effect depends—not so much upon actual aptitude on the part of jurors on each individual occasion as on his apprehension of what for aught he can know it may be in the one case knowing on each occasion by experience what it actually is he can in proportion as in respect of moral aptitude it is inferior to what it ought to be act accordingly in the other case unprovided with this knowledge prudence will incline him to take for the constant ground of his proceedings the supposition of the maximum of aptitude ratiocinative instructional art    thus it is—that on this occasion antagonization has place between universal interest and particular individual interest—individual interest acting upon an uncommonly extensive scale the universal interest requiring that the number of the individuals serving in this situation be maximized individual interest that it be minimized between these conflicting interests to effect a composition as far as local circumstances admit will in each political state be among the legislators cares     section ii composition and number enactive expositive art   a quasijury is composed of quasijurors of two classes the ordinary and the select for shortness say ordinaries and selects enactive ratiocinative instructional art   that a casting voice may never be wanting the number of both together is odd the number here established is three whereof two ordinary one select by the legislature addition if deemed necessary will of course be made to it but what is expected is that of the ordinary the number will be at least twice as great as that of the select ratiocinative instructional art   looked to more particularly for appropriate moral aptitude thence for the determining will are as per section   the ordinaries theirs being the interest of the greatest number for appropriate knowledge judgment and active aptitude—thence for aid and guidance to ordinaries the selects note—by the necessity of eliminating certain classes indication is given of the course which if not the only apt seems at any rate the most apt that can be pursued produce the selection not in a direct way by the location of those who present themselves as being fit to be charged with this compulsorily imposed function but in an indirect way by the elimination of those in relation to whom it appears that for one reason or other they are not fit to be charged with it instead of addition the operation by the result of which this great class will be filled will be subtraction and of the remainder left by and after the performance of it will the class be composed meantime for the composition of this class two operations correspondent but opposite in their nature present themselves as necessary to be performed the first of a general nature—of the legislative cast—designation of the eliminative classes the other of a particular nature—of an executive and thence of an administrative cast—the filling up of these eliminative classes the dislocation of individuals from the appropriate locable class in the exercise of the first of these functions there will be little difficulty to the charge of partiality it will be in but a slight degree obnoxious what difficulty there is attaches itself almost exclusively to the executive function to that which exercises itself upon individuals in their individual capacities in truth when looked upon a little nearly in so far as reason not favour or disfavour is taken for the guide it will in the instance of certain classes be seen to be of the judicial character where the fact constituting the efficient cause of title to exemption is of a nature to be put out of doubt by conclusive evidence as in the case of quantity the difficulty will in general be comparatively if not absolutely inconsiderable not so where as in case of quality it admits not of any such conclusive evidence take for example the case of superannuation for the efficient cause of title to exemption take the number of years the person has lived say for example sixty—here in general there will be little difficulty on the other hand if instead of this quantity you take the appropriate quality viz the capacity of serving in this branch of public service without preponderant hardship to the individual here comes the difficulty one man at sixtyfive or seventy shall be more capable of serving without preponderant hardship than another man at sixty or even fiftyfive but in company with and in proportion to such difficulty comes the arbitrary power and with it the facility of applying it to sinister purposes in every imaginable shape to the purpose of extortion on the one hand to the purpose of corruption on the other hence it is that to avoid a very considerable real evil which does not readily meet the eye it becomes necessary to leave open the door to a quantity nor that an inconsiderable one of apparent evil for such will always be the case in so far as quantity in contradistinction and preference to quality is assumed and employed as the standard and object of reference what it may be asked with your eyes open will you give introduction and establishment to this double injustice in so indefinitely large a multitude will you give exemption to those who being so perfectly fit have no just title to it while to the injury of another large multitude you refuse the benefit of the exemption notwithstanding that by the reason of the case they are so justly entitled to it answer yes this evil whatever be its magnitude i find myself under a necessity of introducing on pain of finding myself under the necessity of introducing a much greater evil taking for the efficient cause of title as above the faculty of enduring the burthen without preponderant hardship i force upon the functionary whoever he is the exercise of a judicial function so many individuals as there can be any reason or so much as a pretence for charging with it so many suits has he to take cognizance of and make decrees upon if not in the name yet with not only all the power but much more than the power of a judge of a judge and in what state of things in a state of things in which all evidence of a sufficiently conclusive character will in general be altogether wanting debarred thus by necessity from deciding according to justice he will be enabled and in the eyes of all who see for themselves an advantage in his possessing the licence justified in deciding according to favour and disfavour in oppressing   0 those whom it is agreeable to him to oppress in favouring gratuitously or for a price those on whom it is agreeable to him to confer this benefit when for the diminution and restriction of arbitrary power all is done that can be done still be the power what it may some hands there must be in which it is lodged and these must be the hands of a single individual for the allcomprehensive reason which should never be a moment out of sight viz maximization of responsibility of the official individual in question what shall be the official name say for example compositor—the quasijury compositor for as by the functionary of that name in a printing house the contents of a printed sheet are in the first instance determined so in the case of the sort of list here in question in each individual case though in a way which is the reverse of that mechanical mode are the contents of that same list having thus fixed upon our workman with the sort of work on which he is to be employed—upon which list shall he in the first instance be employed answer—upon the possibly attending list for the purpose of extracting out of it the eventually attending list as to the possibly attending list it is the same with that of the electors in the subdistrict in question for though between the one list and the other it might be possible to make some difference no particular benefit presents itself as being capable of being preponderant over the general evil of complication with which any such distinction would be attended remain for determination the hands by which and the term of service for and during which our quasijury compositor shall be located fitter ones than those of the sublegislature of the district in which the judicial district of the immediate judicatory is contained have not presented themselves term of service say one year or to speak strictly the remainder of the year at the commencement of which the location viz by election has been performed this quasijury compositor if circumstances favoured would bring with him into office a propensity to come to a mutually commodious private understanding with the judge on the part of the judge the correspondent propensity would by the like causes be made to have place my fears however of any such sensibly maleficent alliances are not very considerable to my judge for the purpose of keeping him out of temptation in this as in all other shapes i have given a quantity of official and beneficial occupation sufficient to fill up the whole of his disposable time while on the other hand in the situation of the quasijury compositor the occupation given to him does not in so far as conjecture can reach it present itself as likely to afford any considerable quantity of maleficentlyemployable leisure if for all the several individuals actually attending in the course of a year one and the same quasijury compositor is made to serve viz by forming out of the possiblyattending list the eventuallyattending list for all the several immediate judicatories within his district his abode cannot be in any near vicinity to more than one or some other small number of the judicatories comprehended in that same district and if it were worth while his abode might even purposely be fixed in a place in which it should not be possible to him without the notorious formality of a visit to come in actual contact with any one of those same judges as to fortune when once it is determined that to the decision of this same fictitious personage an affair of this sort will be committed the faculty of obtaining that decision without danger or fear of misdecision has nothing in it but what may to universal satisfaction be secured when in a general way as above the determination has thus been made who those individuals are who in each judicatory are fit to be called upon to attend and shall attend accordingly the mass of difficulties is unhappily by no means cleared away in the instance of any individual the call being made what if it should not be obeyed unhappily and unavoidably here comes matter for another suit the judge indeed in this case not the unavowed and undeclared but the avowed and expressly constituted official judge the judge of the judicatory in which the individual has been called to serve here too however comes the so frequently recurring difficulty the difficulty of determining in relation to the nonattending eventual quasijuryman whether the circumstance stated by him as a justificative cause of his nonattendance really at the time and place in question was in existence in the course of the eliminative process one circumstance there is the aptitude of which to constitute an efficient cause of title to exemption seems incontestable but which lies exposed in no slight degree to the difficulty and objection of which so much has been said this is the case of those in whose instance indigence is at such a pitch that if admitted into the judicatory their presence might be productive of annoyance obstructive in a serious degree of the course of the business of this difficulty no solution will be afforded by the observation that in the possibly attending list no individuals can have place but such as are in possession of the art of reading and with the possession of that art indigence such as that in question cannot with propriety be regarded as compatible to this there are two answers in the first place introduction of the quasijury system may be possible and thence necessary before the time when the art of reading has made any progress so extensive as to afford a sufficient number of     jurors after the eliminations that are indispensable have been performed on this supposition some qualification other than the possession of this art may be of necessity to be appointed the other answer is that if the possession of this all intellectualizing art is as amply diffused as it can be and therefore as it ought to be—in this case within the number of those who are in possession of it may be those whose condition in respect of the means of subsistence is at the lowest pitch for there are none but what may be and therefore ought to be made to read and what can scarce in any political community have place is that there should not be some in it in whose instance indigence in the degree here in question has place section iii functions enactive art   functions of quasijurors are these which follow—     the auditive     the lective     the inspective     the orally interrogative     the commentative     the opinative     the appeal warranting or say licensing enactive art   of these functions exercisable by each individual are all but the opinative and appeallicensing these no otherwise than by the body enactive art   the appeallicensing excepted all these functions belong in common to quasijurors and the judge of the judges elementary functions as per ch xii section   the imperative and that alone belongs to him to the exclusion of quasijurors enactive expositive art   i auditive function in the exercise of this function a quasijuror hears all discourses capable of serving as grounds for the formation of the judges decrees and moreover all discourses of the judge whether addressed to the quasijury or any one of them or to any other actor on the judicial theatre enactive expositive art   ii lective function in the exercise of this function a quasijuror shares with the judge in the reading of all written or otherwise visibly expressed discourses capable of serving as grounds for the formation of the judges decrees enactive expositive art   iii inspective function in the exercise of this function he shares with the judge in the inspection not only of all visible instruments of discourse but of all other visible objects whether things or persons capable of serving in the character of sources of evidence for the formation of his decrees enactive expositive art   iv orallyinterrogative function in the exercise of this function he puts by word of mouth questions to parties to witnesses and to the judge and incidentally as occasion calls to any other of the actors on the judicial theatre as to whom see ch xii section   as to the qualities which should have place on the part of the discourse expressed by such questions with a view to produce responsion see procedure code ch xxvi quasijury section   interrogative function works vol ii p     enactive expositive art   v commentative function in the exercise of this function he gives expression to such comments or say remarks or observations as occur to him whether as to the discourse or deportment of parties and witnesses or as to the conduct maintained on the occasion whether by the judge or any other actor on the judicial theatre for the mode of obviating obstruction by the undue exercise of this function see ch xii section    judges sedative function enactive expositive art   vi opinative function on the principal occasions abovementioned the quasijury in the exercise of this their function by the mouth or hand of their foreman give expression to any such amendments as they think fit to propose to the judges eventuallydefinitive decree in both its branches—opinative and imperative put together—pronounced on the original examination so likewise to any such absolutelydefinitive decree as in consequence of the recapitulatory examination he may have thought fit to substitute enactive instructional ratiocinative art  0 vii appeallicensing function the sort of occasion by which this their function is called into exercise is as follows—criminal cases there appear to be in which if the execution of the sentence were delayed of course until the decrees of the appellate judicatory have been pronounced and its sanction given to the execution of the imperative decree of the immediate judicatory the certain evil of delay vexation and expense to parties injured and other actors on the judicial theatre might in the eyes of the legislature outweigh the possible evil of effective misdecision for want of such appeal particularly if the appeal with the consequent stay of execution     were placed absolutely within the power of the defendant in these cases the legislature may perhaps it is supposed think fit to give to the quasijury the option of granting or refusing their fiat to the consequent stay of execution where by the defendant declaration of appeal shall have been made to this their appeallicensing function exercise will in such case have been given by the grant or refusal of such their fiat name of this fiat an appeal license on the signature of an appeal license by the quasijurors or a majority of them the judge will send up the appeal in course and stay execution accordingly on the refusal of it he will cause execution to be made as if no such license had been prayed for the enumeration of those cases see the penal code under the heads of the several offences and the procedure code ch xxviii appeal and quasiappeal expositive art    cases of indigent rapacity or say of rapacious or predatory indigence by this appellative may be designated the class of cases which on this occasion is principally in view in these cases the nature of the offence being such that without the stimulus of relative indigence seldom is a person led into the commission of it expositive art    of offences of this description the following may serve for examples for adequate denominations and definitions see the penal code   fradulent obtainment that is to say obtainment with consent procured by deception without supposition of title on the part of the delinquent or intention of making restitution or of being amenable to law   theft that is to say caption without consent or supposition or pretence of title or intention of restitution or of being amenable to law   robbery at large that is to say caption by force or obtainment by consent extorted by means of immediate or unpreventible injury to body mind property or reputation   highway robbery that is to say on a much frequented road street or other public and open place   day robbery in conjunction with housebreaking   night robbery without housebreaking   night robbery with housebreaking   day or night robbery with or without housebreaking but in conjunction with homicide that is to say with homicide intentional as to that effect as well as the act and whether in relation to the robbery preparatory concomitant or consequential preparatory for preventing resistance concomitant for subduing resistance consequential for punishing resistance or for security against justice   housebreaking with intent to rob instructional ratiocinative art    circumstances by the consideration of which it may happen that in the mind of the legislator a demand for the institution of the restriction thus put upon the faculty of appeal may have place are as follows—   on the one hand the magnitude of the mischief of the offence   the comparative multitude of offences and offenders relation had to the species of offence   the comparative improbability even of prosecution much more of conviction in the case of a person completely innocent as to the sort of offence charged   the otherwise certain multitude of groundless appeals for the chance of ultimate impunity and the certainty of intermediate respite   the exclusion if put by the penal code as upon the principles of this

exercise of this function see the penal code and the procedure code so as to the form of the instrument by which expression is given to it instructional art    in cases such as the above it will be for the consideration of the legislature whether to authorize or no the judge at his discretion to make after the initiative application but one inquiry and that before a quasijury or to make two inquiries namely the original without a jury and the recapitulatory with a jury as in other cases the more simple the case appears on the initiatory application especially in respect of the quantity

those on the exempted list cannot be put thereon but on their own application enactive expositive art    of those if any by whom such application is made is composed the voluntarilyserving liable list of the liable list those who are not upon the exempted list are distinguished by the appellation of the obligatorilyserving liable list instructional art    of exclusion what shall be the grounds will in some measure be the result of local considerations of proposable grounds examples are as follows—   disreputableness on the score of criminality evidence the delinquency register as to which see the penal code   preoccupation in public business as in the case exceptions excepted of all public functionaries evidence the official register instructional expositive art    of exemption proposable grounds are as follows—       habitual infirmity of body   habitual infirmity of mind   superannuation—to wit on presumption of relative incapacity through infirmity or in respect of extraordinary

ground of infirmity whether of body or mind as also on that of private preoccupation the demand will require to be received on the first day of each solar year if it be not received on or before that day the name of the individual will be entered in the liable list enactive expositive art    relative unaffluence understand thereby either   relative untidiness that is to say want of such habiliments by the want whereof annoyance would be caused to colleagues or   relative untrustworthiness that is to say in such sort and degree that the necessary expenses of the journeys of the individual to the place of judicial attendance could not without too much hazard be advanced as per section   subsistencemoney adequate evidence is in both cases either   exemption demand as per art    or   certificate by local headman as per ch xxv and local registrar as per ch xxvi expositive art  0 the exempted list constitutes an appendage to the liable list where the ground of exemption is temporary the name of the same person may of course be in the same year at one time on the exempted list at another time on the liable list and so in the course of the year any number of times enactive art    in time of peace apprehension of imminent war excepted as per ch x defensive force section    powers of military as to nonmilitary situation in the stipendiary army or navy is not a ground of exclusion nor—except on special application by a quasijury exemption demand as per art   —of exemption enactive expositive art    out of the liable list will be formed by the minister two distinct lists to wit the country liable list and the town liable list to the town list belong all inhabitants whose habitations are within the precincts of the town in which the justice chamber of

defaulters belonging to the country list or for the purpose of completing the weeks service as per art    to the country list belong all the other liable inhabitants of the judicial territory of the judicatory whether it be immediate or appellate enactive expositive art    out of the country liable list are formed the select liable list and the ordinary liable list so out of the town liable list enactive expositive art    to the select liable list belong among those whose names are in the general liable list all those exceptions excepted from whom as per art    appropriate application to be admitted thereupon has been received by such application a man disqualifies himself from receiving subsistencemoney as per section   on the other hand he enjoys the distinction conferred by the functions attached to his situation as per section   functions enactive expositive art    to the registrar of the judicatory whether immediate or appellate it belongs out of the country liable list as furnished to him by the quasijury minister as per arts    0    to frame for the several quasijury examinations the several destined attendance sets for the several weeks or the year and time after time in such number as the service shall have required to accerse or say summon them respectively and each time in case of default to accerse town liables to take the place of defaulters     enactive expositive art    as in the immediate so in the appellate judicatory to the registrar it belongs from time to time to accerse the several individuals by whom the service of the several weeks in the solar year is to be performed to this end the state of the liable list will be made constantly known to him in manner following— towards the close of each solar year time enough to be received by the several individuals before the first day of the ensuing year—the quasijury minister having caused to be framed and printed transmits to the habitation of each individual liable a printed exemplar of the liable list for that same year as also on the earliest day one or more exemplars to the registrar this list will be divided into as many sublists as there are bissubdistricts or say local headmans and local registrars territories in the subdistrict or say immediate judges territory on each such sublist the individuals will stand indicated in the alphabetical order of their surnames enactive expositive ratiocinative art    in the course of that same ensuing year he will in proportion as the information reaches him transmit to the registrar notice of the several individuals who by death expatriation exclusion exemption or otherwise cease to become liable of these the registrar will frame a list which will constitute an appendage to the liable list of that year name of it efflux liable list use of it preventing his transmitting accersition mandates to those in whose instance their incapacity of serving has been thus made manifest enactive expositive art    in like manner he will give notice of the several individuals who by becoming entitled to give votes become liable to serve as quasijurors of these will be composed another appendage name of it the influx liable list amalgamated with the liable list of the year this appendage after deduction of the names in the efflux list will constitute the liable list of the next year enactive expositive art    from each liable list thus constituted the individuals constituting the several sets will as occasion calls be determined by the registrar in open judicatory by lot as per ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who supplement the time of the several operations being so adjusted that between the day and hour of the delivery of the accersition mandate at the habitation of the individual and the day and hour appointed for the commencement of his attendance at the justice chamber an interval sufficient for journey and preparation shall have place enactive instructional art  0 the day and hour of the drawing being foreknown any person who seeing his name in the liable list has a legitimate excuse for not paying attendance on the coming week transmits to the registrar at his office an appropriate excuse paper for the truth of which as per section   attendance he is compensationally and punitionally responsible for the several allowed excuses see the noncompliance excuse list in the procedure code ch x section   in it are contained the several excuses by which exemption is given from the obligation of compliance with the several accersition and other judicial and authoritative mandates authorized by the legislature enactive art    of the several individuals from whom within the time in question excuse papers have been received the names are transcribed into a list which is kept hung up in the justice chamber in conspicuous characters and places on the drawing of the lottery if the name of any such excuser is drawn out the registrar points to that same name in the excuse list and another is drawn out instead his name is again put into the lottery at the end of  weeks enactive instructional art    to the quasijury minister the appropriate facts in question as above will have been made known as follows— i of the deaths such as have happened in the several local registrars territories will have been made known to him by so many deathindicating certificates transmitted to him as per ch xxvi local registrars section   deathrecordation function by the respective local registrars effluxes produced by other causes will have been made known to him from such other sources of information as his situation has furnished him with enactive instructional ratiocinative art    ii of the individuals whose names belong to the influx list the accession will in the instance of those by whom votes have been delivered or are intended to be delivered have been made known to him to wit in his quality of votetaking clerk of the subdistrict as per art    by the applications respectively made by them for the blank instruments by the filling up of which as per election code section   voters titles how preestablished their respective titles to vote will have been constituted in the other instances from such other sources of information as his situation has furnished him with note that of the several individuals whose names are upon the liable list there is not any one     who may not have an interest in maximizing the number of those who will be sharers with him in the burthen which it is the unavoidable effect of the institution to impose enactive ratiocinative art    for the better securing the completeness and correctness of the information thus furnished attached to the printed liable list of each year will be the efflux list and the influx list of the last preceding year and in each list will be added to the name indication of the source from which the channel through which and the day on which the information was by the registrar received enactive instructional art    of the sets to be drawn out for each ensuing week the number will have been predetermined by the judge from the number of quasijury trials destined to be performed in the course of the week as to their probable respective duration and thence as to their aggregate number grounds of inference will in the instance of each have been produced by the original inquiry enactive instructional art    corresponding to the number of the judge deputes permanent if more than one will be the number of quasijury trials capable of being upon occasion performed in so many justice chambers principal and occasional at the same time enactive instructional art    if before the end of the week it has been clearly ascertained that of the sets in attendance there are one or more whose service will not be needed every such superfluous set will as soon as it is so discovered be dismissed enactive instructional expositive art    if on the other hand and so soon as whether by experience or by well grounded anticipation it has been determined by the judge that the number in attendance is not sufficient for the completion of the service—other sets in sufficient number will be forthwith accersed from the town liable list as per art    these numbers will in the nature of the case be indefinitely variable sitting time in a day being say eight hours on this or that day may have been performed quasitrials eight or more on the other hand in this or that instance by one and the same quasitrial eight or more hours may have been occupied enactive art    when in any judicial territory immediate or appellate a man has paid due attendance he is not in and for that same territory liable to serve anew until all other persons in the liable list of that same territory have served at the end of such his term of service a mark indicative of the fact of his having served together with the day on which his service was completed will by the minister be entered upon the printed liable list of that year and continued on the lists of the several succeeding years until it has been duly eliminated enactive art  0 any person may serve by substitute the substitute being a person whose name is on the liable list in this case the substitute brings with him the accersition mandate addressed to the principal he stands bound to answer any questions as to his being the person whose name is on the list and as to his not having been chosen for any sinister purpose such for example as the showing undue favour or disfavour towards any party to the suit the principal is thereupon exempted from taking his chance in the lottery as per art    for  weeks to come and the substitute stands excluded from serving again until as per art    the stock of those who remain liable to serve has been exhausted enactive expositive art    to keep watch against abuse in every shape in this department will be among the special tasks of the publicopinion tribunal of these shapes a principal one would be the species of fraud called packing by packing understand in this case an arrangement under which—in consequence of an agreement express or tacit between the quasijury minister on the one part and men of wealth or influence on the other part—by means of a system of absentation and corresponding substitution individuals one or more attending for the purpose of serving the interests of a party at the expense of justice are on this or that occasion introduced into the composition of a quasijury as to this danger see section   fields of service art    instructional ratiocinative art    in a newly constituted state in which population is thin territorial divisions in proportion extensive appropriate journeys long and on the part of the ordinary class even with reference to this function appropriate aptitude in its several branches rare—the legislature will probably find itself under the necessity of confining the selection out of this same class to towns extending the range from time to time in proportion as those several obstacles give way to the correspondent and opposite features of convenience note—on this occasion it would be among the objects of consideration for the legislature whether anything and what can be done for the alleviation of the tyranny hitherto in a     greater or less degree so universally exercised over the weaker by the stronger sex suppose for this purpose amongst other things a modification of the quasijury the number of the males the total number being minimized as it has been would scarcely it would be thought admit of retrenchment if so the next least number affording a certainty of a majority is five reserving in every case the predominance to the stronger sex here then would be the foreman as before a male erudite ordinaries two males of the female sex erudite one ordinary the other logical field of exercise those cases in which the interests of the two sexes antagonize for particular instances see the table of private offences in the penal code under the penal head of offences against property will be included several nonpenal heads respecting rights instances are   reciprocal rights and obligations of male and female in the married state   shares as between sex and sex on occasional succession   encouragement for medical practitioners of the female sex for cases of parturition pregnancy and other complaints peculiar to that sex   equal but appropriate partition of the female sex in whatsoever encouragements are given at the public charge for the melioration of education on the occasion of the election code secrecy of suffrage being secured much reason was found for giving to the female sex an equality of suffrage as compared with the male no reason found on the other side no argument but what was grounded on the assumption of the thing in dispute from this source as from every other corruption must be guarded against on this account as well as on account of experience females should not be admitted till after the childbearing age so on account of comparative want of experience an exclusion should be put upon nevermarried females in favour of married women and widows for more assured freedom better perhaps that upon women under the power of husbands an exclusion should be put in favour of widows in domestic society as between man and wife in case of contrariety of wills in respect of the occurrences of the day the determining power cannot be lodged in any other hands than those of the male the hands in which power on whatever occasion exercised must be reposed are those in which physically speaking it can at all times be exercised but for some time before and after parturition the female although by a comparatively rare accident she were in respect of physical strength the stronger of the two could not possibly be so nor yet when encumbered and with increased sensitiveness with an infant at her breast but far from affording reason against the female sex being let into a participation of political power exercisable on political occasions this consideration affords a reason in favour of this advance towards equality inadequate as it cannot but be section v subsistencemoney enactive instructional art   the subsistencemoney of an ordinary quasijuror is  per day of attendance

quasijurors     enactive art   on receipt of an appropriate instrument of requisition signed by any  town liables who have served the government advocate will institute pursuit on the ground of default enactive art   on receipt of a like instrument signed by any  such liables alleging falsehood to have been committed by an assertion contained in any excuse paper particularizing the alleged false assertion and binding themselves on their responsibility compensational and punitional to make sufficient proof of the falsity—he will institute a suit demanding the appropriate punishment

thus be secured in the case of culpable inaptitude so on the other hand appropriate distinction and honour in case of appropriate aptitude in any shape in any extraordinary degree manifested enactive art   for unconscious error in judgment no quasijuror is ever punishable but if on any occasion compared with his means of information the error is clearly so gross that unconsciousness of wrong on his part is not credible in such case he is punishable nor in such case will any acquiescence or even concurrence on the part of the judge suffice for his exemption enactive art   so for wilful connivance at breach of duty in any shape having place in his presence or with his knowledge on the part of the judge in whatever shape delinquency has place on the part of a judge a quasijuror having knowledge of it and not declaring it is an accomplice enactive art   for corruption whether in the shape of bribetaking or in any other shape he is punishable and this although the part he takes be in other respects right enactive art   for his protection against unjust punishment at the hands of the judge he shares with every other person the benefit of appeal to the appellate judicatory namely by means of the incidental complaint book as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    enactive art   to the judge in the exercise of his sedative function as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    it belongs to take care that in the exercise of their several functions whether severally or collectively exercised the members of the quasijury do not designedly or inadvertently produce useless and pernicious obstruction delay or vexation in the process of judicature expositive art   examples are as follows—   in the exercise of the auditive function insisting on the hearing of useless documents or arguments or the useless repetition of useful ones   in the exercise of the inspective function as applied to discourse in a written or other visible shape one of the members keeping the document to himself to the prejudice of the right of another or one or all of them keeping the business unnecessarily at a stand while the lective function is or is supposed to be exercising by him or them   in the exercise of the inspective function at large keeping the business at a stand by needlessly prolonged inspection especially if where a person is the subject of the inspection needless vexation be inflicted on the person   in the exercise of the interrogative function persisting in the utterance of irrelevant questions or in repetitions of the same question or persisting in exacting an answer when by the judge the question has been decreed to be such that answer thereto is not exigible   in the exercise of the commentative function obstructing the course of the business by irrelevant or frivolous observations or repetitions of the same observation instructional art   for occasional assistance in the formation of his judgment a quasijuror of the ordinary class has before him the appropriate knowledge and judgment that may naturally be expected at the hands of his colleague whose place is in the select class enactive ratiocinative art   in a week for the service of which divers quasijury sets are in attendance should it so happen that during any part of the time sets one or more are not in actual service their appropriate place will be in the inspectors gallery

the hands of parties and their adherents     chapter xvii judicial inspectors section i who and wherefore expositive art   by judicial inspectors understand all persons whatsoever who not appearing

occasional and unpaid functionaries is among the objects of this code enactive ratiocinative art   in this view it is that in the justice chamber it provides for them an appropriate situation under the name of the inspectors or inspection gallery with the intent that in that situation for the commodious exercise of this their office the necessary and effectual means may at all times have place instructional art   at outdoor sittings it will be the care of the judge to make for their accommodation the best provision which the nature of the place and the occasion will admit instructional art   so even at night sittings in so far as may be without disturbance and without prejudice to security expositive instructional art   of the description of persons whose service in this situation for the advancement of justice is desired and expected examples are as follows—   probationary law practitioners serving in the inspectors gallery for the purpose of entitling themselves to admission on the list of professional lawyers as per ch xxiii section     parties litigant in other suits waiting their turn for audience   persons in attendance as witnesses in expectation of being heard in any such other suits   persons in attendance as proposed witnesses or other evidence holders waiting to be heard in the suit which is on the carpet those excepted who for prevention of concert in falsehood have been ordered to withdraw   persons brought by curiosity of these the number will naturally be as it is desirable it should be proportioned to the importance real or apparent of the business in hand its importance whether with reference to the interest of the public or of individuals specially interested   nonadults attending whether spontaneously or by direction of parents or guardians in this theatre and school of justice   persons brought by request of parties or by interest taken in their fate enactive instructional art   for every hearing by appointment admission tickets for the inspectors gallery the registrar will on application deliver to litigants the same number to litigants on one side as to those on the other to wit for the purpose of their locating in the most commodious places their respective friends but under the precautions necessary to prevent annoyance enactive instructional ratiocinative art   what on this occasion is desirable is that no litigant should be without some one friend at least watching over his interest and able upon occasion to make report but forasmuch as in certain cases it may happen that on one side of the suit or on each the number of parties is so great that if each were to locate a friend visiters of other classes might stand excluded and in particular those of the probationary professional lawyer class the judge may at his discretion limit the number thus admitted so as it be the same on each side and if the number of litigants claiming tickets be greater than the maximum number so appointed the registrar will determine by lot to which of them tickets shall be delivered section ii functions enactive art   to judicial inspectors belongs of right the auditive function as in the case of quasijurors enactive instructional art   so though at the discretion of the judge the inspective the interrogative and the commentative and to the exercise of these functions by these same functionaries in so far as may be without obstruction to the business he will rather give encouragement than hinderance enactive art   to them belongs not the opinative function nor the appeal warranting and in   0 these may be seen the principal differences between their functions and those of the quasijury chapter xviii immediate government advocates section i fields of service enactive

exceptions excepted in a penal case purely public the government advocate is the established and in the ordinary course of things sole pursuer enactive art   exceptions to his being sole pursuer are—   where on his own view of an offence committed in the justice chamber the judge has taken upon himself to convict and sentence issuing the correspondent decrees opinative and imperative this case will naturally be a rare one   where on receiving an informative application from any other person the judge authorizes such person and on his consent orders him to continue it   where by not regarding himself as having need of assistance from the government advocate the person in question has in the first instance applied to be admitted as pursuer and has been admitted accordingly   where for the special purpose of the suit in question the government advocategeneral has deputed to serve as government advocate in any judicatory a person other than the government advocate of that same judicatory instructional ratiocinative art   if in the case of any such offence it depended on the government advocate alone whether suit should be commenced or when commenced whether or in what manner it should be continued—the power thus possessed by him being thus arbitrary would be much more efficient than the limited power of remission given as per ch xxiv section       dispunitive function to the justice minister to apply to it the above together with all other apt checks will accordingly belong to the procedure code see ch viii judicial application enactive instructional art   in every purely public penal case in which a person at large has been admitted pursuer it is the right of the government advocate and if in his opinion the public service requires it his duty to act in that capacity in conjunction with such person so likewise to the exclusion of every such person if on application for reason assigned he has been thereto authorized by the judge enactive instructional art   of the purely public cases in which it may be of use to the public service that a person at large should be admitted to act as pursuer in lieu of or in conjunction with the government advocate examples are as follows—   if and where on condition of his bearing the expense of pursuit the law has given to a person at large on condition of the conviction of the defendant remuneration in any shape at the charge of the convicted person or from any other source   where from any motive public or private a person at large for better assurance without any such reward is willing to defray the expense and in this case where no preponderant objection has place regard for the public purse will dictate such admission instructional art   on every such occasion as well the government advocate as the judge will be upon their guard lest at the commencement or in the course of the suit the pursuer with or without concert with the defendant should be purposely acting in any manner in the view of frustrating or obstructing the effect or any part of the effect professed to be aimed at by the suit section v functions in publicoprivate penal cases enactive art   in a publicoprivate penal case the government advocate has concurrent authority with the person or persons specially injured enactive art   in a publicoprivate penal case from and after hearing the evidence as it comes out in the course of the original inquiry it will belong to the judge to determine whether the continuance and termination of it shall be allotted to the individual or individuals in question alone or to the government advocate alone or to the one and the other in conjunction enactive art   if on the occasion of any such suit an individual alleging special injury to have been received by him or one for whom he applies demands at the charge of a defendant money or moneys worth in compensation for such injury his application for leave to act as joint pursuer will not be refused instructional art   in this case if he be able to defray the unavoidable costs of pursuit the judge will prefer allotting to him the conduct of the suit unless for prevention of undue favour towards a defendant he deems it necessary to transfer it to the government advocate section vi functions as to offences against justice enactive art   whether the case be nonpenal or penal to the government advocate it belongs in a more especial manner to watch over the interests of justice by demanding at the hands of the judge in the case of an offence against justice committed by an individual on either side of the suit a pecuniary mulct the magnitude of which shall be in the joint ratio of the magnitude of the evil of the offence of the profit reaped or aimed at by the offence and of the pecuniary sufficiency of the offender see ch xii judiciary collectively section    justice for the helpless expositive art   by an offence against justice understand an offence by which the attainment of any one of the ends direct or collateral of justice is prevented or impeded expositive art   to the attainment of the direct end of justice impediment is opposed by falsehood accompanied with evil consciousness insincerity or temerity of assertion for expository matter correct definitions included see penal code and procedure code expositive art   to the attainment of the collateral ends of justice impediment is opposed by needless delay and by all endeavours to obtain it so by needless expense imposed or endeavoured to be imposed by any one party upon any other so by needless vexation in any shape see penal code and procedure code as above section vii moneyrequisitive function enactive expositive art   for engaging at the hands of individuals     service necessary to the giving execution and effect to the law in this or that shape and in particular in the shape of evidence the matter of reward at the disposal of government will in various cases be found necessary and in divers of these cases either the quality or the quantity of that same matter will necessarily remain unfixed by law for this purpose a fund having been provided by the legislature and placed at the disposal of the finance minister such portions excepted as under ch xii judiciary collectively section    justice for the helpless are provided for the service therein mentioned to the government advocate of the immediate judicatory in which the need arises it belongs so far as is needed for the occasion in question to make application to the judge requesting his moneyrequisitive mandate—requiring at the hands of the several persons exercising the custoditive function in respect of the appropriate part of the abovementioned fund payment of the sums deemed proper to the use of the person or persons for whom it is needed enactive instructional art   in the instrument of requisition according as at the time of issuing it the service in question has or has not been performed entries will be made under appropriate heads case i the service needed as yet unperformed object of the reward procuring performance heads in this case will be the following—   nature of the service needed   occasion of the need   reward proposed its quality   reward proposed its quantity enactive art   on receipt of any such petition the judge forthwith delivers it into the hands of the party or parties on the other side calling upon them for an appropriate instrument styled their paper of observation on the government advocates moneyrequisitive petition enactive instructional art   in this observation paper the heads will be the following—   simple approbation or acquiescence   simple disapprobation—or   modified approbation   in case of disapprobation or modified approbation appropriate reasons from silence at the end of a time appointed acquiescence is inferred enactive art   the judge thereupon will either refuse the reward simply or issue an appropriate instrument containing such description of the service and the reward as the occasion shall appear to him to require name of the instrument a rewardoffering mandate enactive art   case ii the service already and without any such invitation

other cases open as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    publicity c cause for exception by temporary secrecy may in this case be—danger lest from publicity a delinquent derive means of evasion enactive instructional art   this function a government advocate is bound to exercise wheresoever in his opinion preponderant evil in the shape of failure of justice would otherwise have place or with an adequate degree of probability be likely to have place so if directions to that effect have been received by him from the government advocate general enactive instructional art   in every case to prevent abuse in all shapes from the exercise of this function will be among the judges as also the government advocates and the eleemosynary advocates especial cares in particular abuse in respect of undue advantage openly or secretly reaped by individuals from needless reward thus paid at public expense as for public service especially in publicoprivate cases enactive instructional art  0 on this as on other parts of the field of government it may be that reward as per ch ix ministers collectively section    remuneration may on occasion consistently with justice and economy be conferred for extraordinary service even though not invited but already and spontaneously rendered if on the field of justice—to the immediate government advocate the eleemosynary advocate or the government advocate general as the case may be it will belong for reason assigned to make requisition for such retroactive reward ratiocinative instructional art    in regard to the matter of reward considered as employed in this branch of the public service there are several dangers that require to be guarded against one is the giving reward where the service might be obtained without reward obtained consequently without expense in that shape     or to a greater amount in any other shape say reward needless another is where reward to a certain amount is necessary and in a preponderant degree beneficial the giving it in an amount greater than that same necessary and beneficial amount a third is the giving it in such sort as to give birth to offences of the very same species as those which the reward is employed in the endeavour to suppress another point to be considered is to what species of service the reward shall be attached on this occasion these species of service present themselves namely   information i e original evidence   subsequential evidence   prehension   information of means of prehension   information of means of securing execution   prosecution meaning legal pursuit instructional art    as to information or original evidence by the practice of attaching reward to service in this shape two effects of an opposite nature maleficial and beneficial are liable to be produced   the maleficial is the giving birth to the offence by inducing one person to draw another into the commission of it for the purpose of obtaining the reward by information given of the offence when committed   the beneficial effect is the throwing difficulty in the way of criminal confederacies by preventing men who otherwise might become confederates in criminality from reposing in one another the confidence necessary for that purpose an object of endeavour will here be—how to exclude the maleficial retaining at the same time with as little loss as may be the beneficial effect much will depend upon the class of offences to which the offence in each case belongs instructional ratiocinative art    in regard to a publicoprivate offence the injury will naturally of itself furnish an informer and in his person in so far as it has happened to him to have been with relation to it a witness—an agent contributing to the prehension of the offender or of anything capable of serving as a source of convictionpromoting real evidence it will at the same time have a tendency to furnish in the person of that same individual a prosecutor—a pursuer but to this tendency there will always be a check more or less efficient according to the condition in life and pecuniary circumstances of this same injured party namely the delay vexation and expense attached to the exercise of this function—attached whether by natural only or by artificial superadded to natural causes the less the quantity of evil which in this shape stands attached to the function the less will be the need and thence the use of reward attached to public service in this shape if matters can be so managed as that from burthen in the shapes abovementioned the injured party shall be exonerated altogether all such exoneration will with no small degree of efficiency operate in the character of reward the reward held out by the chance of compensation will in so far as a fund capable of affording it is in existence and within the reach of the hand of justice be a branch though but a contingent one of the natural reward of the reward naturally attached to the service the pleasure of vengeance will at the same time afford another and that a neverfailing one a reward valuable in proportion to the strength of the corresponding appetite in the breast of the individual injured the result is—that so far as can be avoided whatever matter of reward is thought fit to be granted for convictionpromoting information should if determinate in quality not be fixed or limited in quantity by any general ordinance nor at any rate the receipt of it made virtually absolute and clear from all condition over and above the delivery of the information or testimony and the conviction of the delinquent if not only the shape be determined but the quantum fixed as also the condition determined as above the natural consequence is that regular and determinately grounded calculations will be made from the practice of such calculations two distinct evils will take their rise instructional ratiocinative art      in a case in which the reward will be clearly seen to be inadequate it will be plain to all concerned that no information will be given and thence that so far as depends upon the mutual perfidy as between confederate and confederate no danger will attach upon confederacy from this source   in a case in which the reward is clearly seen to be adequate it will operate as a source productive of delinquency in the shape in which it is employed under the notion of preventing it by the more artful of two malefactors another who but for him might have remained in innocence will every now and then be inveigled into the commission of the crime for the purpose of his being informed against and convicted that the reward held out for information followed by conviction may be earned instructional art    if the service for which the reward is proffered is that which is rendered by judicial pursuit—pursuit carried to the length of conviction—evil consequence in a variety of shapes is the result the quantity of the expenditure in this     shape must be profusely large large in itself absolutely considered large when relatively considered relation had to what would suffice for the production of information or convictionproducing evidence or both the quantity how profuse soever will still be insufficient in many an instance instructional expositive art    now as to the plan to be pursued for the production of the beneficial without producing the maleficial effect for the production of the beneficial effect namely the preventing of those who would otherwise be confederates in crime from reposing in each other the confidence that would be necessary for that purpose it is not necessary that any one should stand absolutely assured that at all events any other would in case of effective information stand assured of receiving the matter of reward in a determinate shape and quantity without prejudice to this effect the receipt might be left subject to a variety of contingencies chosen for the purpose of putting an exclusion upon the maleficial effect let it be but understood that in case of sufficiently assured need the reward will be offered and given though it be at the same time understood that if need do not have place no reward will be given this persuasion will be sufficient to create and preserve the salutary apprehension in minds in a certain degree disposed to calculation while in minds to a certain degree indisposed and unused to calculation no degree of determinateness given to the proffered reward would suffice to produce this same salutary effect section viii attendance enactive art   in a nonpenal case in which government is a party the government advocate on every occasion in person or by depute attends of course enactive art   so in a purely public penal case on every occasion after the initiatory application if made by any other person as per procedure code ch xii enactive art   so in a publicoprivate penal case when thereto required by the judge enactive art   such attendance may be required by the judge either of his own motion or in compliance with a petition from a party specially interested section ix locable who enactive art   exceptions excepted when among those who have

office of government advocate until he has so attended for two years when there are those who have attended for three years no person who has not attended for three years and so on to five years after which all must have attended five years enactive art   an exception is—the case of those who antecedently to the existence of persons so qualified as above have served in the situation of government advocate principal for not less than one year for other matters see ch xii judiciary collectively chapter xix government advocate general section i government advocate general enactive art   residence

his directive function     he will in relation to any supposed offence or connected body of delinquency as often as occasion calls issue to the government advocates of different immediate judicatories directions for instituting and carrying on pursuit against supposed delinquents in any number at the same time instructional expositive art   the cases in which this complex mode of pursuit is most apt to be called into exercise are those in which the same forbidden end has been pursued in concert at the same time by different delinquents in mutually distant places examples are—   treason   rebellion   contrabandism   forgery and utterance in relation to public money instructional ratiocinative art   in determining the immediate judicatories in which in each instance pursuit shall have place he will not forget the collateral any more than the direct ends of justice—the minimization of delay vexation and expense to the supposed but perhaps erroneously supposed wrongdoer as well as to parties wronged and witnesses—any more than the conviction and punishment of the supposed wrongdoers in the event of his being found guilty accordingly he will not except in case of necessity regard being had to the interests of all other persons interested issue a direction in consequence of which a defendant will have to be conveyed to a distance from his home or his family connexions instructional ratiocinative art   lest the time demanded for more extensive be absorbed by less extensive duties he will not himself act in ordinary as government advocate at the immediate judicatory

direction of the justice minister in the exercise of his inspective function he makes inspection visits for the purpose of inspecting and taking cognizance of the conduct of the several government advocates or any of them of each such visit will be stated and made public the reasons that is to say the events or states of things by which a demand regarded as adequate for the exercise of that same function had been created enactive art    term of service subject to dislocation his term of service is for life enactive art    located how he is located by the prime minister enactive art

in which he thinks fit his order for secrecy being entered on the record by the word secret written by him with his names proper and official the record will be a journal of his official proceedings enactive art    exemplars of this journal will be disposed of as follows—     kept in his office one     transmitted to the justice minister one     transmitted to the prime minister one in both instances the journal of the day will be transmitted on the same day when minuted ratiocinative art    question why over and above a government advocate in and for each immediate judges territory as well as one for each appellate judges territory establish one for the whole territory of the state answer reason because there are many sorts of offences in regard to which as well cooffenders as witnesses on both sides may have their abodes fixed and occasional in the like number of different subdistricts and in various districts and in no such subdistrict or district would there be a government advocate so well qualified by situation to take an allcomprehensive view of the whole field of judicial action as a functionary with the same functions stationed in the centre of the territory of the state and habituated to the making of such allcomprehensive surveys question why give to the prime minister the power of locating the government advocate general     answer reason because next under the legislature the business of the prime minister being to give on every occasion execution and effect to the will of the legislature as expressed by its laws and he being responsible on that account to the legislative and constitutive authorities—to no other functionary or set of functionaries can with equal aptitude be allotted the choice of the functionary on whom in contested cases is reposed the care of taking appropriate measures for securing the effectuation of that purpose question why with relation to the same subordinate give to the prime minister the power of dislocation answer reason because without the power of dislocation the power of location would not be sufficient to produce the effect especially as on the prime ministers coming into office he would commonly have for this his immediate agent in the judiciary department an individual located—not by himself but by some predecessor in office section ii government advocate generals registrar enactive art   attached to the office of government advocate general is that of government advocate generals registrar enactive art   his relation to the government advocate general is the same as that of the registrar of an immediate judicatory to the judge as per ch xxi section   enactive art   his term of service is for life enactive art   his attendance is the same as that of the registrar of an immediate judicatory and enforced by the same means enactive instructional art   his remuneration is  per day received by him from unwilling hands ulterior emolument is extortion—from willing ones corruption enactive art   he is locable out of the list of immediate registrars enactive art   he is located by the justice minister enactive art   he is dislocable by the government advocate general but on appeal relocable by the justice minister enactive art   in other particulars the sources and causes of dislocation are in this case the same as in the case of the registrar of an appellate judicatory ratiocinative instructional art  0 question why in regard to the situation of government advocate generals registrar give the power of location not to the prime minister as in the case of that of the government advocate general himself nor to the government advocate general—principal in the office—but to the justice minister answer reasons   to the end that the authority of the registrar may serve as a check upon that of the government advocate general this it will do partly by throwing upon occasion the light of publicity upon every act of the active functionary partly by the danger which he would see impending over him in the event of his exercising any act which in the view of this constant and irremoveable inspector were an unwarrantable act at the same time the registrar not having a veto upon any act whatsoever exercisable by the active functionary neither frustration nor so much as delay could be applied to any official act which the advocate might see reason to exercise   the justice minister having this power together with the inspective function with reference to all other registrars in the judiciary department will in respect of appropriate cognitive and judicial aptitude be naturally possessed of a greater share of aggregate appropriate aptitude in relation to the choice than could fall to the lot of a person occupying the situation of prime minister   if the power of locating a successor were in this case in the same hands as the power of dislocating with reference to the functionary in possession the result would be a double interest in making a sinister application of the power of dislocating namely the advantage of getting rid of a troublesome inspector and eventual adverse witness coupled with the advantage of locating in the person of a relative or other dependant an ever ready accomplice the benefit of the patronage operates as a bounty upon the exercise of tyranny and oppression for other matters see ch xviii chapter xx eleemosynary advocates section i fields of service enactive art   the same as that of the judge is in an immediate judicatory the local field of     service of the eleemosynary advocate or

other occasion on which a person is admitted to make application to a judge acts as assistant or substitute as the case may require to every person who on that occasion having need of such aid is not of himself able to procure it at the hands of a professional lawyer or any other person possessed of sufficient appropriate aptitude enactive instructional art   it may be that on each side of the suit there exists a person having need of his assistance in this case he will locate two deputes one on the one side the other on the other or he himself may be on one but in any case he will in open judicatory determine by lot on which side they shall respectively serve saving to the judge the power of determination for reasons assigned enactive art   rights of the eleemosynary advocate exceptions excepted in every suit he has a right to interpose on either side and offer his assistance enactive art   an exception will be if the case being declared nonpenal and government not a

this case as in that enactive art   so obligation need of caution and power of making requisition of retroactive reward section v supertutelary function enactive expositive art   supertutelary or say guardianshipinspective function in the exercise of this function the eleemosynary advocate keeps a watchful eye on the conduct maintained by guardians of all sorts on the occasion of suits of all sorts and on observation made of a     deficiency on the part of a guardian in respect of appropriate aptitude in any shape on the occasion of any suit or other judiciary application he gives intimation thereof to the judge and demands at his hands all such apt judicial operations as may be necessary to obviate the apprehended detriment instructional ratiocinative art   on all other occasions in case of any such apprehended deficiency to apply for relief to the judicatory will belong to any welldisposed person under whose observation it may have happened to fall in which case the applicant will be either the ward himself or some friend of his according to circumstances but on the occasion here in question should any such deficiency take place no person were it not for this functionary would in general be so situated as to be capable of making observation of it instructional ratiocinative art   at the same time this is the sort of occasion on which above all others it might be in the power of a guardian by deficiency in appropriate intellectual or active aptitude to occasion to the ward the greatest detriment and by deficiency in appropriate moral aptitude to himself the greatest sinister benefit for for example by confederating with this or that other person and demanding by a suit the whole property of the ward he might by means of a purposely weak defence share with such person in the amount of it or by needless addition with or without confederacy with a professional law assistant derive to himself or others undue profit out of the expense instructional ratiocinative art   true it is that the judge should such malpractice fall under his observation would of course do what depended on him towards obviating it but symptoms which might escape the observation of the judge might be descried by a functionary whose duty it were made in a more especial manner to be on the watch for their appearance and moreover should the judge have been the first to descry them here is a functionary who with undivided attention might act as advocate of the party while in relation to this same business the judge would with undivided attention continue acting in his peculiar and more appropriate character of judge enactive expositive art   correlative to the condition of guardian is that of ward wards or say persons in wardship or under guardianship

persons who on the ground of deficiency in intellectual or active aptitude in respect of the conduct of their own actions or in the management of their own property have been placed under the authority of some guardian in the same manner as a nonadult under that of his father or other guardian   prodigals convict or suspected persons if any such there be whose property to preserve it from

course of all those qualities the only ones for which in the nature of the case he can be responsible enactive instructional art   the registrar is bound to make entry of every portion of discourse of which the judge requires him to make entry but in such case if to make entry thereof would not in his opinion otherwise belong to his office—as to everything thus entered he notes upon the face of the entry all the several words thus set down in compliance with the requisition so made by the judge calling upon the judge by his signature to attest or contest the correctness of such note   0 expositive art   to cause obliterate any word entry of which has been made by or by direction of the registrar would exceed the power of the judge enactive art   if when a judge depute permanent sits the registrar does not either sit with him or provide a registrar depute to sit with him the judge principal or depute appoints a registrar depute to sit for that days sitting entry is made of the deficiency and the registrar is compensationally and punitionally responsible for it enactive art   so when a suit is allotted to a judge depute occasional section iii effective functions enactive art

individual suit or of an application which being made to a judge may terminate in a suit see procedure code ch viii judicial application expositive art   by the providentiary functions understand those which are exercised—not on the sole occasion of any individual suit commenced or intended to be commenced but in contemplation of some future contingent suit individually contemplated or not on the occasion of which it may happen that the matter in question if recorded may be of use it is by the exercise of these functions that existence is given to the species of evidence styled preappointed evidence expositive art   by preappointed evidence understand evidence by which information is preserved concerning any fact which as to a right of any kind is of a nature to produce or to contribute to produce either a collative or an ablative effect expositive instructional art   of this species of evidence the effect and object is the preventing wellgrounded rights from being frustrated—thence wellgrounded expectations from being disappointed and pain of disappointment from being produced—for want of the creation or preservation of the appropriate grounds on and by which they would and should respectively be established hence the appellation providentiary applied to distinguish the functions by the exercise whereof existence and duration are given to this species of evidence enactive art   exceptions excepted such preappointed evidence having its birth—not in the judicatory but in the office of the local registrar as to whom see ch xxvi local registrars the

moment in the judicial theatre subjects of subsequentially statistic minutation are those which having come into existence at some other time and place have no otherwise been brought under the cognizance of the registrar than by means of information furnished to him at times respectively subsequent to those at which they respectively took place the entries made of them respectively will be made either in different books or of the one species of occurrence on the left hand page of the other on the right hand page of the same book expositive art   certain acts there are whereby existence

the comparative unimportance of the matter in dispute the legislature will determine whether suits of any and what description may be heard and determined without minutes taken of the evidence as above always remembering that in so far as money is concerned importance is not absolute—depending solely on the magnitude of the sum—but relative relation had conjointly to the magnitude of the sum and the pecuniary circumstances of the parties such suits style unminuted suits expositive art   of demands to which it may happen to be regarded as fit to be heard and determined on as unminuted suits examples are as follows—   demands on the ground of simple corporal vexation vexation not accompanied with permanent bodily harm inflicted or intended   demands on the ground of ordinary debt demands claiming money on the ground of service rendered in the most frequently exemplified shape examples are as follows—   goods sold and delivered   serviceable labour whether of body or mind or both performed for a price whether determined or undetermined   lodging with or without board afforded enactive art  0 but forasmuch as by reason of the situation of a party concerned or other circumstances it may happen that a case belonging to a sort not commonly worth recording may present an adequate demand for recordation—care will be taken that to any individual case ranked in the class of unminuted suits minutation shall be applied at the instance of any party on payment of a price to the equal justice fund as per ch xii section    justice for the helpless or if on     account of the pecuniary circumstances of the party requiring it or on any other ground the judge sees reason without payment of a price enactive art    in an unminuted case the evidence alone will be omitted but of all other relatively influential circumstances and occurrences such as the name of the judge the registrar the day the names of the parties the subject matter of the demand the ground of the defence if any and the decree—entry will be made and moreover an incidental complaint book as per ch xii section    ready for the eventual reception of complaints will be at hand section vi attestation how enactive expositive art   necessary is this operation and the exercise of the corresponding elementary function as per section   to the securing of full and sufficient credence to the genuineness of a portion of discourse delivered by any person other than the registrar himself the mode of exercising it is as follows— whensoever by word of mouth a portion of discourse has been uttered which is deemed to be of a nature to require that it be expressed in writing and that entry be thus made of it in some book belonging to the office the registrar for the better assurance of the correctness and completeness of such entry will present to the person whose discourse it was or is supposed to have been the minute in which expression is thus given to it calling upon him either to admit or deny the correctness and completeness of it enactive expositive art   this being done by the registrar now as to the person whose discourse it purports to be relation had either to the whole of the minute so tendered or to this or that part of it one or another of the three following courses he cannot fail to take the alleged correctness and completeness of it he will either admit refuse or evade the admission of evade by silence for example or irrelevant or insignificant discourse enactive expositive art   in case of admission the registrar will call upon him to give thereto in writing the appropriate expression to wit at the end of the portion of discourse in question writing his name in all its parts if unable to write making instead of his name the mark of a cross as thus  or any other simple mark such as no person who has the use either of hand or mouth can be at a loss to make and to this mark the registrar will in his own hand add the name of the person in question as recognised by him followed by the words his mark enactive art   so likewise if it be a portion of written discourse delivered in by him as his in this case to his name he will prefix the words this discourse is mine or simply my discourse enactive art   so likewise if it be a portion of discourse delivered in by him as and for the discourse of some other person or persons known or unknown and if known instead of the word mine inserting respectively the name or names description or descriptions of these same persons enactive art   in case of refusal or evasion as per art   the registrar will inform him that unless the faculty of amending it be desired by him and afforded to him as per section   minutation—amendment how the correctness and completeness of the minute will be considered as having been nevertheless inwardly and virtually recognised by him enactive art   the judge will thereupon either concur in testifying the recognition—for example by his signature to the words virtually recognised—or after hearing any such declaration on the subject as any of the persons present shall have been desirous to make he will take such course as the circumstances of the individual case shall have suggested for establishing the existence of the matter of fact the acknowledgment of which was thus evaded enactive art   in so far as the individual denies either the correctness or the completeness of the minute in relation to the discourse actually uttered by him by word of mouth the registrar if nevertheless assured of its correctness and completeness will make entry of such his assurance and call upon any of the persons present to express by his signature each of them his assent to dissent from or ignorance in relation to its possession of those qualities respectively section vii minutation—amendment how expositive instructional art   of this operation the eventual need grows out of the minutative and attestative functions on the occasion of any discourse uttered as per section   what may happen is that though by the utterer the correctness or completeness of the account given     of it in the minute is not questioned he himself on recollection for the purpose real or pretended of giving additional correctness or completeness to the statement made by himself or at the suggestion of some other person—the judge or the registrar for example—may be desirous to make therein in the way of addition subtraction or substitution to wit in any one or more of these ways a more or less considerable change enactive art   exceptions excepted in any such case the registrar will afford the requisite facilities but for a standard of comparison he will in every case keep in the registry an exemplar of the minute in its original state and of this original minute he will add an exemplar to every exemplar which he anywhither transmits of the minute by which the amendment is exhibited enactive art   on any such occasion the mode of proceeding will be in manner following—antecedently to his departure from the justice chamber if time and the quantity of the written discourse will allow if not as soon afterwards as may be the registrar at the requisition of the individual delivers to him an exemplar of such part of the matter of the record as purports to be composed of his statement as above enactive art   to this minute within a time allotted on the delivery thereof by the judge of which time entry is made the witness is at liberty to make amendments in any one of three ways to wit—   by giving in the exemplar itself expression to the several intended alterations whether by addition subtraction or substitution   by delivering a separate paper giving instructions for the making thereof   by delivering another paper with his desire as expressed on the face of it that it may be accepted instead of the paper delivered to him or instead of such sheet or sheets of it as he points out enactive art   on receipt of such amendments or instructions the registrar causes make a fresh set of manifold exemplars of the matter of the amendments retaining for confrontation the minute in its original state to the individual he delivers to be retained by him a manifold exemplar of the evidence in each of its states enactive instructional art   the expense occasioned by such amendments will according to the determination of the judge be borne either by the individual or by the public regularly by the testifier by whom it was occasioned but in consideration of his pecuniary circumstances or of the exigencies of the case it may by the judge be placed to the account of the public enactive instructional art   if it be not by the registrar or a depute of his that such scription is performed the expense will in either case consist in the remuneration given to some appointed scribe who will be paid at the rate of such or such a sum for such or such a number of words to the judge it will in this case belong to take care lest for the undue augmentation of the profit to the scribe or by wantonness or sinister design on the part of the individual in question the quantity of the matter receive undue increase enactive instructional art   if and in proportion as through carelessness wantonness or sinister design—obstruction and thence evil to a preponderant amount to the proceedings of the judicatory is produced or endeavoured to be produced by any such individual as above—to wit either on the occasion of authentication performed by attestation as per section   or on the occasion of amendment as per this section—the judge for the repression of such abuse will apply such punishment as in his judgment is necessary and sufficient subject to any ordinance made in relation to this matter in the penal code for the mode of proceeding see ch xii judiciary collectively section    incidental complaint book enactive instructional art   for a more precise particular and complete enumeration description and particularization of matters destined on this occasion to be entered in the register see the procedure code see also ch ix ministers collectively section   statistic function section viii securities for appropriate aptitude enactive art   when once by or by direction of the registrar a word has been entered on the register to obliterate it or allow it to be obliterated in such sort as to be no longer legible or to alter it or allow it to be altered into any other word would be an act of falsification and as such punishable so likewise     the making addition of any word at any succeeding time by drawing a line of a different colour across correction may however at all times be in so far applied to error in any shape when discovered but in every such case entry must be made of the fact of the correction with the year month day of the month and hour when made and at length or by initials the name of him by whom the correction is made enactive art   whatsoever entry is made by the hand of a registrar depute is signed by him with a sufficient designation of the person in the same hand at the same time enactive art   to cause make on the register any portion of written discourse without the consent of the registrar belongs not to any other actor on the judicial theatre but to any such actor it belongs to frame or cause frame a minute of his own and to tender it to the registrar for his assent or dissent as to its relevancy and correctness and such assent or dissent the registrar is bound to signify namely with his family name and name of office at length or by initials in the margin enactive art   on the ground of alleged irrelevancy injuriousness or even criminality in any shape it belongs not to the registrar to refuse or omit making entry of such assent or dissent if the discourse be injurious or criminal it will stand as evidence of the impropriety of him by whom it was made enactive ratiocinative art   designed to act as mutual checks upon each other are the several official situations of the judge and the registrar if on the occasion of any suit by negligence or collusion the registrar were to omit providing a depute of his own to act with the judge the judge by the location of any person of his choice to officiate in the character of registrar depute might on every such occasion deprive the interests of justice of the benefit of this check to this reason it is that while by section   to prevent denial or delay of justice provision is made against any such deficiency the registrar who by acceptance of his office undertook for the prevention of it is by section   art   made responsible section ix migration none enactive ratiocinative art   a registrar does not migrate to prevent the formation of sinister connexion between two parties it is not necessary that both should change place the more intimate his acquaintance with the matter exhibitive of the proceedings of anterior times in the same place the greater will be a mans aptitude as to the functions of this office for other matters see ch xii chapter xxii appellate judicatories section i appellate judges who expositive art   by an appellate judge understand a judge having cognizance of appeals expositive art   by an appeal understand an application made to a judge superior in grade and power by a suitor in an immediate judicatory subject to his authority alleging error in a specified shape as having had place in the conduct of a judge immediate in relation to a particular suit and thereupon claiming relief in some form specified according to the nature of the case at the hands of the judge so appealed to enactive expositive art   a ground for appeal may be constituted by inaction as well as by action of the one as well as of the other on the part of a judge injustice may alike be the result as to this see section   section ii fields of service enactive art   of the service of an appellate judicatory the local field includes in it the local fields of service of a certain number of immediate judicatories enactive art   so the logical field except in so far as modified by the provisions contained in this and the ensuing sections enactive art   exceptions excepted to no appellate judicatory belongs any immediate jurisdiction enactive art   exceptions are—   complaints of misconduct in any of the shapes mentioned in ch xii section    incidental complaint book   nontransmission of the record or vicious state thereof as per section   art   here ensuing     section iii subject matters of appeal enactive expositive art   of an appeal and thence of the service of a judge appellate the subject matter is either ordinary or incidental enactive expositive art   by the incidental subject matter of an appeal understand misconduct in any shape mentioned in the provisions relative to the incidental complaint book as per ch xii section    enactive expositive art   the ordinary subject matter of an appeal is either alleged misdecision or alleged quasimisdecision on the part of the judge immediate expositive art   by quasimisdecision understand any act of the judge negative acts as well as positive included whereby otherwise than by definitive decision wrong the same in effect as might have been produced by definitive misdecision is produced enactive expositive art   of the ways in which without definitive misdecision the wrongful effects producible by it are capable of being produced examples are as follows—   denial direct or virtual by act positive or negative of necessary or material means of proof or disproof by virtual denial understand nonfeasance in any instance in which feasance is prescribed by justice   or of any such eventually necessary means of execution for the execution of such judicial orders as the nature of the case calls for provisional prehension of the person or goods of a defendant for example   or of the judicial service necessary to the enforcing of compliance with any such judicial orders compliance whether at the hands of parties witnesses judicial functionaries or persons at large   in particular of any means of mutual communication necessary to such compliance on the part of any such persons as above as between one another or between any of them and the judge   or of due execution of definitive decrees actually pronounced supposing them such as the nature of the case demanded note that in every instance necessary to communication whatsoever be the objects between which it is to have place is the appropriate quantity of time requisite enactive expositive art   of the means whereby in an indirect way ultimate misdecision is producible as above examples are as follows—   undue delay vexation and expense   delay practised or permitted in consequence of which means of probation or execution perish are deteriorated or become unobtainable   vexation inflicted or permitted to be inflicted   expense imposed or permitted to be imposed on persons destitute of the means of defraying it and of thereby keeping themselves in the way of obtaining justice   precipitation namely by this or that judicial operation the performance of which has for its effect the preventing the performance of this or that other operation the performance of which was necessary to right decision for example the obtainment of the necessary means of probation enactive art   for explanations and provision in detail as to these several matters see the procedure code section iv grounds of decision enactive art   exceptions excepted in an appellate judicatory the sole grounds of decision receivable are as follows—   the matter of the record as transmitted from the immediate judicatory in which matter is contained the whole of the evidence belonging to the case   argumentation heard from the mouth of the parties or their assistants gratuitous or professional on both sides of the suit or parties and assistants likewise which argumentation has for its sole basis as above the matter of the record or any portion of it enactive art   exceptions are—   if no record at all has been transmitted from the immediate judicatory   if by an appellant the matter so transmitted is objected to as being in a material degree incomplete or incorrect in these two cases also appeal may be received enactive art   for supply of evidence the existence of which has not been discovered till subsequently to the definitive decree pronounced in the immediate judicatory the judicatory to be applied to is—not the appellate but the immediate judicatory enactive art   so if not till subsequently to the delivery of the definitive decree of the appellate judicatory or even subsequently to execution given to it     enactive art   at the immediate judicatory itself must have been delivered all evidence on which appeal therefrom complaining of alleged quasimisdecision is grounded unless the receipt recordation or transmission of such evidence or any material part thereof be directly or virtually refused section v quasijury necessary enactive art   as on the occasion of a recapitulatory examination in an immediate judicatory so on the occasion of the examination in an appellate judicatory necessary to the validity of what is done is the presence of a quasijury as well as of such judicial inspectors as the place and time afford enactive art   exceptions excepted from no definitive decree pronounced otherwise than on a recapitulatory examination as per ch xvi quasijury section   can any appeal be received from a definitive decree pronounced at the close of an original inquiry the only appeal being the appeal from the judge without a quasijury to another or the same judge with a quasijury as per ch xvi section   enactive art   exceptions are—   if by the immediate judicatory procedure with a quasijury be expressly or virtually refused   if on the original inquiry quasimisdecision has had place as per section   in both these cases appeal may be received section vi optional functions as to decrees enactive art   functions of the exercise of which in the delivery of his definitive decrees an appellate judge has the option are these which follow—   the confirmative by the exercise of which the decrees of the immediate judicatory are confirmed and order for execution thereof sent down to that same judicatory   the reversive by the exercise of which an order is given prescribing an arrangement the direct reverse of that which was decreed by the imperative decree of the immediate judicatory   the modificative by the exercise of which the arrangement decreed as above by the immediate judicatory is confirmed as to part reversed or changed as to other part   the substitutive by the exercise of which an arrangement is prescribed different from that prescribed by the immediate judicatory the substance of the order bearing no reference to the decrees of the immediate judicatory enactive art   for the several diversifications which the exercise of these several functions may require according to the nature of the suit in question see procedure code enactive art   of functions exercised by the issuing of incidental orders such as those the need of which may be called forth by quasiappeals examples are as follows—   the mandative when the alleged cause of complaint is noncommencement or noncontinuance   the inhibitive when it consists in doing something which ought not to be done at all   the sistitive when it consists in doing something which perhaps may require to be done but ought not to be done so soon section vii vexation by appeal obviated enactive art   exceptions excepted in case of an insincere or rash appeal that the blame may more effectually fall upon the appellant the judge appealed from may at the instance of any party take order for the attendance of the appellant at the appellate judicatory on the hearing who thereupon may be in case of need subjected to fresh vivâ vocé interrogatories in case of noncompliance the appeal may be dismissed for cases of exception see procedure code ch xxviii appeal and quasiappeal enactive instructional art   if the pecuniary and other faculties of a proposed respondent be not adequate to the support of his cause at the appellate judicatory and no adequate assistance gratuitous or professional will it appears be there obtainable the immediate judge appealed from may of his own motion or on the application of the respondent himself or of the eleemosynary advocate or even of the government advocate of his judicatory transmit along with the record a certificate to the above effect addressed to the eleemosynary advocate at the appellate judicatory whereupon the eleemosynary advocate will in virtue of his office make argumentation on the respondents side section viii seats where instructional ratiocinative art   of the several appellate judicaiories     shall the justice chambers be stationed in the several districts or all of them in that one only which is the seat of government or what other shall be the plan employed in regard to their location i reasons for the distribution in preference to the agglomeration plan are these—   between the immediate and the appellate judicatories the communication will on the distribution plan be upon the whole much more speedy than in the agglomeration plan of the advantage the quantum will be directly as the extent of the territory of the state and inversely as the facility afforded by roads and other instruments of communication   in concurrence with the sublegislative assemblies the appellate judicatories will compose a powerful instrument of universal information they will contribute to the formation of so many enlightened and watchful sections of the publicopinion tribunal instead of contributing as the agglomeration plan would to condense all such light into one spot thus leaving the rest of the territory in a state of comparative darkness   on the distribution plan the migration system which forms a part of it presents a powerful preservative against the contagion of corruptive local attachments on the agglomeration plan true it is that the efficiency of these same causes of evil would in appearance be diminished but in reality it would more likely be increased applied to functionaries in these situations the corruption would be the more efficient the more influential the corruptor and in the metropolis would naturally be collected the most powerful and most influential families   by the agglomeration plan all the functionaries would naturally be brought into the closest and most familiar contact with the justice minister—the subordinates with their common superordinates with this familiarity the strictness of inspection necessary to justice would scarcely be compatible they would indeed be more immediately under the eye of their official inspector but unless in so far as accidentally kept awake by casual antipathies that eye would be in a naturally connivent state to inflict punishment on a man at whose table you have been sitting or he at yours is not especially in any such elevated sphere a thing endurable instructional ratiocinative art   ii reasons for agglomeration in preference to distribution   these judicatories would every one of them be under the eye of the most intellectual and populous section of the publicopinion tribunal   the advantage from the diffusion of instruction in matters of judicature would indeed be in this proportion narrowed but what must not pass unnoticed is that in an appellate judicatory the mass of instruction is narrow in comparison of what it is in an immediate judicatory it is confined to what may be afforded by the matter of the record together with the argumentation which has for its subject matter that same matter it includes not the oral examination of witnesses nor the arrangements for securing execution and effect to decrees and thence for securing the efficiency of the means employed for the necessary communications   by the agglomeration plan alone can the aggregate expense of all these judicatories be minimized on the distribution plan while some of them will be saturated with business others there will probably be whose whole workingtime will not be filled up out of every two whose time were not above half occupied the expense of one might be saved so out of every three whose time was not above a third part occupied of the sum of these reasons the comparative force may be varied more or less by the local circumstances of different states instructional art   supposing the distribution plan preferred thereupon comes the consideration—what shall be the relation between the results of the division made for the purpose of subordinate legislation and those of the division made for the purpose of superordinate judicature were symmetry and consequent facility of conception the only objects of regard exact coincidence would without hesitation be the answer the best public obtainable is desirable for the one purpose and so is it for the other but from this maximum of simplicity departures in indefinite numbers may come to be prescribed by considerations of a local nature and of weightier import not improbably one homage to simplicity may however be found capable of being paid without any very considerable sacrifice supposing in one or more instances divers sublegislative portions of territory comprised in an aggregate of immediate judicatory territories which have been put together for the purpose of composing the territory of an appellate judicatory or conversely divers appellate judicatory territories put together to form one sublegislative territory still in either of these cases may the coincidence be thus far preserved that no sublegislative territory shall be cut into two or more pieces by the boundary lines of one or more appellate judicatory territories nor any appellate judicatory territory by those of one or more sublegislative territories the elementary parts of the one will throughout be in either case so many integers of the other without any admixture of fragments for other matters see ch xii     chapter xxiii professional lawyers section i professional lawyers who expositive art   by a professional lawyer or say law practitioner understand a person who for remuneration serves as agent or say helper or helpmate to any other person on the occasion of his being engaged or in contemplation of being engaged in a course of litiscontestation or in the framing of written evidentiary instruments composed of the matter of preappointed evidence and as such framed with a view to eventual litiscontestation or on the occasion of application made to a judicatory for any purpose for the several occasions on which and purposes for which application may be made to a judicatory see procedure code ch viii expositive art   litiscontestation is a term employed to signify indiscriminately the course of operation gone through on the occasion of a suit at law by him whose station is on the demandants side and that gone through by him who is on the defendants side expositive art   coincident in signification wholly or partially with demandant are in englishbred law claimant plaintiff complainant orator pursuer prosecutor and perhaps others one employed in one judicatory another in another expositive instructional art   upon clearness as well as completeness in anything like an adequate degree an absolute veto is on this occasion put by the nature of the case improved by sinister industry what is here seen is the nearest approach that can be afforded expositive art   coincident in like manner with defendant is defender perhaps also some others expositive art   coincident in signification with litiscontestation in some sort that is to say partially is litigation and this last is the term most commonly employed but to the import of the word litigation has become attached in the mind of him who employs it a sentiment of disapprobation in relation to the act or practice designated by it litiscontestation being the neutral litigation the disapprobative or as it has been styled dyslogistic or cacologistic appellative applied to the same course of action expositive instructional art   out of the association has grown a most pernicious vulgar error or fallacy error on the part of those who are not aware of the misrepresentation thus made fallacy on the part of those who are he whose endeavour it is to obtain redress for errors and he whose endeavour it is to do wrong by force of law are confounded by it and represented as being persons of the same character he whose endeavour it is to save himself from an unjust demand and he whose endeavour it is to save himself from a just demand are involved in the same opprobrium and thus it is that under the notion or on the pretence of repressing litigation the rich and powerful combine with one another in consummating the oppression of the poor and helpless expositive art   in this class of practitioners the nature of the case admits of four principal subclasses or what comes to the same thing the same person may as occasion calls act in any one or more of so many distinguishable capacities exercising in the service of individuals individually considered or considered as united in bodies so many distinguishable functions these subclasses are or may be thus denominated   attorneysatlaw—or say law managers in this character the professional helpmate of the party conducts the proceedings in the suit on his side in its original signification this appellation is not coextensive with the term manager for it supposes the party not to be attendant in the justice chamber in the presence of the judge in a word it is synonymous to substitute or proxy suppose the party present the lawyer who acts as his helpmate acting in this case as well as the other as manager is not his substitute or say proxy but may with propriety be termed his assistant   advocates or say law administrators pleaders or argumentators this term though employable in both cases brings to view more readily the case where the pleading is performed by word of mouth than the case where it is performed by writing   counsellors or say law advisers to wit in relation to the commencement the continuance and the termination of a suit   notaries—so styled under romebred law under englishbred conveyancers in this character the lawyer frames or assists in framing evidentiary instruments as per art   and in particular instruments of contract and other instruments of law conveyance by which rights and obligations are created and conveyed between one person natural or fictitious and another   0 section ii litiscontestational class one only enactive art   into whatsoever elementary functions the aggregate of the functions of a professional lawyer has as per section   been elsewhere considered as distinguished under this code whosoever is entitled to exercise any one of these functions is entitled to exercise every other for the manner in which a persons title to exercise them is constituted see section   locable who enactive expositive art   in this as in other professions and occupations persons may act

make a charge on their common client or in case of costs defrayed by an adversary on the adversary for putting a state of the case to another partner for his instruction in pleading before the judge nor to the same or a third partner for giving his advice as to the commencement continuance or termination of the suit or for the purpose of his framing an instrument of procedure on the occasion of the suit or an instrument of conveyance at large or an instrument of contract ratiocinative instructional art   exclusion why put upon the division of the profession into the customary classes two or more namely the attorney and the advocate with or without ulterior division made of each answer reasons   the greater the number of these divisions the more completely is all responsibility and feeling of responsibility done away   the more effectually is the system of falsehood—licensed falsehood—and by the license rendered effective as well as unpunishable falsehood in its several shapes of insincerity and rash assertion established   the greater the number of these mercenaries the greater the number of assistants who in one and the same suit must be paid   not only in proportion to their number must the pay be increased but in a higher proportion for among these mercenaries distinctions in respect of rank naturally and necessarily have place and the higher the rank the more expensive the remuneration remuneration of the highest rank for the same quantity of time and labour or even for much less being several times the amount of remuneration for the lowest not to speak of the intermediate ones   the more numerous the higher paid and thence the more opulent the body of these mercenaries taken in the aggregate the stronger is the resistance which while they cannot but be disposed and prepared they cannot but be able to oppose to every alleviation of the evil by which they profit and out of which that which to them is good is extracted instructional art   for rendering it the more clear how the mendacity license is established and acted upon a few words of explanation may have their use suppose no such assistants to have place the party standing alone speaking with the instrument of punishment hanging over his head with the thread capable of being every instant cut upon the appearance of the offence the danger of mendacity and consequently the evil flowing from it is at its minimum remove now from off the stage the party himself and bring on in his place the mercenary assistant and constitute him his substitute the party let him have uttered ever so many falsehoods cannot be punished for any one of them for it is not to the judge it is only to the partys own assistant hired by him and dependant on him that the falsehoods are uttered what they are and how many they are are matters utterly unknown to the judge in the person of the party they are therefore all of them unpunishable to all these several falsehoods if there be no punishment to restrain him the hired substitute will of course give utterance i e to all such as in his eyes are of a nature to give support to his clients cause which by the hire has been rendered his cause as the principal with whom they originated cannot be punished for them so neither can the substitute by whom they have been adopted uttered and put to use for as to the fact of their having been stated to him by his client—in the assertion of this fact by the supposition there is nothing but what is true false as they may have been it was not for him to presume their falsity it was not for him to cast this stain upon the character of this his customer this his benefactor if considering the nature of them the credence given by him to them was too easy here was nothing more than an error in judgment and an error in judgment is not among those things for which punishment can reasonably and usefully be inflicted enactive instructional art   to evil in this shape the established systems afford not any of them any tolerably efficient remedy but to this same evil the here proposed system affords a remedy nor that an inefficient one in the first place if to the judge acting     under the check imposed upon him by the circle of judiciary inspectors it is from the nature of the case sufficiently manifest that in the intercourse between client and lawyer falsehoods were uttered by the client to the end that through the lawyer they should find their way to and make their impression on the faculties of the judge and that of these statements the falsity could not but be recognised by the experience and discernment of the man of law here on the part of this said man of law is insincerity and for falsehood in this shape the substitute may with as much facility and justice be made to suffer as the principal for the mendacity and so in case of rash credence supposing the consciousness of the falsity not sufficiently certain and the misrepresentation to have had no other cause than an error in judgment though that error so clearly the result of a culpable want of attention as to be in consideration of the injury to the parties on both sides not unjustly punishable upon occasion justice to a degree still more extensive and more effectual may be done interrogatories having been put to the professional substitute and his answers set down the principal his client might afterwards be convened before the same judicatory and be in like manner examined examined in the first place separately and afterwards in confrontation with the man of law effectual arrangements being in the meantime taken to prevent them from giving themselves the benefit of any falsehoodassisting intercourse section iii fields of service enactive instructional art   coextensive with the logical fields of service of the judges taken in the aggregate is that of every professional lawyer of the whole field of law actual and possible no part is there on which professional and thence remunerated help to a party may not be indispensably necessary to the attainment of the ends of justice enactive art   coextensive likewise with that of the judges taken in the aggregate is his local field of service he who has been admitted in any one judicatory may serve in any other instructional art   as between immediate and apellate judicatories essentially necessary to aptitude of service in an appellate will previous service in an immediate judicatory be but so manifest will be this necessity that while any professional law helper who has served in an immediate judicatory is to be had in an appellate judicatory none who have not previously served in an immediate judicatory will naturally speaking be employed not unfrequently to wit when in the eyes of a client able to bear what additional expense may be necessary the importance of the suit warrants that same additional expense he who is helper to the party in the immediate will in case of appeal migrate with the suit to the appellate judicatory instructional art   where two or more law practitioners act in partnership one partner may on the occasion of a particular suit make this migration without interruption and thence without detriment to the general course of the partnership business instructional exemplificational art   under englishbred law under which both logical and local fields of judicial service are broken down into such an indefinite multitude of fragments the confusion has produced a correspondent though not an equal degree of diversification and complication in those of the professional lawyer an attorney in this or that judicatory cannot make his appearance in this or that other and so as between barrister and barrister section iv locable who enactive art   when the period of preparation as to which as applied to the case of judges see ch xii judiciary collectively section    locable who has elapsed no person is admissible to serve as professional lawyer whose name does not stand upon an

any person is thus locable on the probationary professional lawyers list by the government advocate principal or the eleemosynary advocate principal as per art       enactive art   in the case of a probationary professional lawyer the service time is composed of four service years for the meaning of a service year as contradistinguished from a solar year see ch xii judiciary collectively section    locable who enactive art   of the four service years the two first are served in the judicial inspectors gallery as per ch xvii enactive instructional art   of the two others any portion may be served—either in the inspectors gallery as above or by serving gratuitously in the character of eleemosynary lawyer in the service of helpless litigants as to these see ch xii judiciary collectively section    justice for the helpless and ch xx eleemosynary advocates enactive instructional art   whatsoever time has been served by such eleemosynary lawyer in the judicatory will have been entered of course on the record whatsoever has been so served by him elsewhere than in the judicatory will be ascertained by examination to the judge it will belong to have care lest in any instance a portion of time stated as having been so employed has not been so employed or has been needlessly so employed for the purpose of its striking off so much service time in the inspectors gallery enactive instructional art   after the expiration of the preparation period as above—the age at which a person will be locable on the probationary professional lawyers list will be nineteen years this will give for the age at which he may commence service as eleemosynary lawyer say twentyone years and for the age at which he is locable on the professional lawyers list twentythree years the same number of years as that which as per ch xii section    is necessary to render a person locable in the situation of immediate judge principal this will leave for his taking the benefit of the general official instruction system as per ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who a period having for its commencement an age dependent on the particular circumstances of each individual and ending at the abovementioned age of nineteen years section v capacity as to offices expositive art   a probationary professional lawyer if he has not commenced acting in quality of eleemosynary lawyer as per section   his service being as yet confined to that of judiciary inspector is not thereby disqualified for any office enactive art   but if he has commenced acting in that quality certain offices and situations there are from which he is thereby disqualified these are those of—   judge principal or depute permanent   registrar principal or depute permanent expositive art   for certain judiciary offices and situations he remains not disqualified these are those of—   government advocate principal or depute permanent   eleemosynary advocate principal or depute permanent enactive expositive art   if it be with consent of all parties he is not disqualified from serving as depute occasional in any one of those abovementioned offices till located in the professional lawyers list his hired and unavoidable course of partiality has not as yet commenced ratiocinative instructional art   why exclude professional lawyers from the capacity of being located or officiating as judges answer because in quality of his profession a law practitioner in the pay of a litigant party acts under the impulse of an interest incurably adverse to the several ends of justice the whole train of his thoughts and occupation engages him in the perpetual endeavour to promote injustice by injustice in that shape in which it stands opposed to the collateral ends of justice his personal and sinister interest may be served in the most immediate way and in this case at the expense of his client as well as that of the adverse party by injustice in the shape in which it stands opposed to the direct ends of justice his personal and sinister interest is served by him in a less immoderate though not less extensively effectual way and in this case in conjunction with the personal and sinister interest of his client instructional art   in the case of a judge this may be in a no less degree true but in the case of the judge the correspondent propensity is susceptible of checks such as when united afford a promise of being effectual not so in the case of the assistant of a party litigant engaged in his service by hire in the case of the judge disrepute is attached to the exercise of partiality adverse to the ends of justice not so in the case of the hired law practitioner     in the case of the judge acting under the eye of the publicopinion tribunal unjust partiality can scarcely have place and act with effect without being manifest and in such sort manifest as to be perceptible to several authorities in the power of any one of which it is to remove him out of his situation whereas in the case of the hired law practitioner whose intercourse with his client is carried on in secret unjust partiality having for its effect and object the assisting him howsoever widely in the wrong to gain the suit as if he were in the right may have place and to an unlimited extent without being to any other eyes perceptible instructional ratiocinative art   only in so far as in the exercise of this profession it is the effect of disrepute to diminish the quantity of his professional gains can disrepute be regarded as affording to this propensity any effectual check but it is not in the nature of the case that by any disrepute which can in this case attach itself any such diminution should be effected to insincere litigants the greater the effect with which the propensity appears to operate to the advantage of his clients the stronger is the inducement it presents to them for engaging him in their service as to the sincere litigant dishonest means it is true he has not as such in his own eyes any need of nor therefore any adequate motive for employing in preference a law practitioner whose disposition affords an assurance of his readiness to employ such means but that same propensity which affords an assurance of his readiness to employ even dishonest means affords an assurance of corresponding energy and activity in the employing of honest and unexceptionable ones and few indeed are the litigants howsoever sincere who seeing as they think the party who being adverse to them is in the wrong about to gain the suit by dishonest means would not rather than see the wrong to prevail and feel it prevail at their own expense be content under a reasonable prospect of success to see him employing similar dishonest ones in their favour instructional ratiocinative art   for the situation of judge under this code preparation is made of a class of men whose interests when the checks to injustice that apply to them are taken into account will be seen to be in a state uniformly conducive to the ends of justice from injustice opposite to the direct ends of justice they can have no tolerable chance nor therefore any natural hope to gain profit in any shape while at the same time they have everything to suffer and to apprehend from it and so as to injustice opposite to the collateral ends of justice they are men who must have served an apprenticeship and that an active one in the school of justice—the justice chamber such being to be had palpably absurd would it be to take any whose interests have been in continual opposition to these same ends trained in the two schools of injustice the attorneys office and the advocates chamber instructional ratiocinative art   true it is that besides being employed in the endeavour to give success to the enterprises of a wrongdoer or saving him from condign punishment he is also employed in the endeavour to obtain for the injured compensation and for the public the benefit of the example afforded by punishment at the charge of the wrongdoer accordingly of the two parts which the law practitioner is with equal constancy employed in acting this is the only one which on the occasion of the land which is continually poured forth on the profession is ever brought to view but whether it be in this way that he is employed or the other is in every instance matter of chance and to him it might seem would therefore naturally be matter of indifference but on a nearer view it will be seen that it is on the side of the wrongdoer that the bias of his affections will be sure to lean for the clearer a mans right is the less is the need he has of such support and the more atrocious a mans criminality is the greater is his need of it and the higher is the reward which may naturally be looked for in return for it instructional ratiocinative art  0 to the indiscriminateness of the hire and the support and not to the occupation does the necessity of the habitual insincerity stand attached it applies not to him in whose instance the service is gratuitous for in this case it is not so natural as to be generally presumeable that a man will render his assistance to one who in his eyes is culpable unless it be in the case of a particular friend to ward off excess in the suffering to which he stands exposed and no sooner does the conduct of his protegé present itself to his eyes as being to a notorious degree blameable than public opinion will approve rather than condemn him in the event of his withdrawing it by his affection for his friend suppose him even led astray from the path of sincerity and probity the deviation is but the work of a moment whereas in the case of the law practitioner without any deduction worth bringing to account it occupies one half of his life by absurdity and improbity coupled with the grossest inconsistency exclusion under a variety of pretences has been put upon evidence in consideration of the impurity of the source no case is there in which it can be reconcileable to reason but if there were a case it would be that of the law practitioner and more particularly when raised into power and impunity by the office of judge under the denomination of a felon a man who has     been guilty of a single act of robbery or theft is thus deemed incapable of ever speaking truth but without uttering so much as a single falsehood a man may have passed his whole life familiarized in the practice of robbery whereas without having passed it in the continual practice of wilful falsehood never in england could a man have been raised to the dignity of judge not on the man who is hanged but on the man by whom he is hanged would the exclusion be put if reason not prejudice were the guide instructional ratiocinative art    for bringing the particular interest of the judge as near as possible to coincidence with the universal interest every expedient that could be found has been employed and it is hoped not without success but to bring the interest of the law practitioner into a direction other than diametrically opposite to the universal interest is what the unalterable nature of the case has rendered absolutely impossible it is the interest of the law practitioner to raise and foment to the utmost disputes and quarrels among relatives and neighbours among the duties of the judge will be the putting litigants upon their guard against this sinister interest and as often as he finds it at work to hold it up to public view but the judge who was himself a law practitioner and whose circle of intimates is composed of law practitioners—what reasonable expectation can there be that he will thus join with strangers against his familiar friends that the wolf will thus join with the sheep against the wolves look at the english bar and benches special and casual of quarrel excepted what confederates were ever more indefatigable than are those lawyers of the two classes—judges and barristers—in singing the praises of each other instructional ratiocinative art    to the relation between the qualities possessed by the able advocate and the qualities desirable on the part of a judge—sufficiently close for instruction is the relation between those possessed by a procuress or the keeper of a house of ill fame and those desirable on the part of a governess or mistress of a boardingschool for young ladies the procuress being conversant in the arts employed in the destruction of female chastity will be possessed of the experience capable of being applied to the preservation of it by this same experience is any special security afforded for its being exclusively so applied no on the contrary the result probabilized by it is rather the sale of the article in question to the best bidder than the preservation of it the advocate being conversant in the arts employed in the misrepresentation of law and fact—of everything a correct conception of which is necessary to the exercise of justice will be possessed of the experience capable of being applied to that uniformly desirable purpose but in this same experience is any special security afforded for its being exclusively so applied no on the contrary the result probabilized is—that it will be for the advancement of any purpose indicated by this or that particular and sinister interest of his own in preference to the fulfilment of the ends of justice where competition has place that the extraordinary mental power in question will be applied instructional exemplificational art    in some parts of italy there used to be a sort of man whose profession it was in consideration of a fee to lend his assistance to any man whose desire it was no matter for what cause to ease any other man of the burthen of life a bravo was the appellation by which this species of professional assistant was denominated by what points was the brave gentleman distinguished from the learned gentleman answer by these— in a direct way the life only of the adversary is the subject matter of the service rendered by the brave gentleman to his client property only in this or that particular case for example where the client happens to be next in succession to the victim indicated to the subject matter of the learned gentlemans professional service no such nor any other limit applies the learned gentleman is not sure of hitting his mark but this is no fault of his to the hitting it no endeavours on his part are ever wanting read those hightreason trials by which a learned gentleman in reward for his services on that occasion became not only a learned lord but moreover the head of the law see whether on his part any endeavours to cause the men in question to see their bowels torn out in due form of law were wanting read the trials of hardy and horne tooke the instrument of service employed by the brave gentleman is the hand the instrument employed by the learned gentleman is the tongue the brave gentleman if he can be laid hold of is for the service rendered by him deprived of life by the conjunct services of a learned gentleman in his capacity of advocate and another learned gentleman in his capacity of judge neither loss of life nor suffering in any other shape is the learned gentleman exposed to experience in either of these his capacities for the sort of service rendered by the brave gentleman a certain degree of disrepute never failed to attach upon the character of the brave gentleman notwithstanding that one of the four cardinal virtues namely fortitude which his profession necessitated and by which he was so preeminently distinguished instead of disrepute transcendant honour is the reward which the learned gentleman receives not only at the hands of the political but at the hands     of the popular or say moral sanction not only at the hands of the ruling portion but by the suffrages of the publicopinion tribunal and so will he continue to do until the bandage is taken off the eyes of that judicatory and the difference between right and wrong is become perceptible to it instructional exemplificational art    neither to the brave gentleman nor to the learned gentleman is his honour his good reputation by any means without its value of the brave gentleman the reputation consists in the fulfilment of his duty as to two descriptions of persons to wit   his clients   his professional brethren with whom on each occasion he is in alliance in league in confederacy towards his client his duty on each individual occasion consists in killing the troublesome person whom he stands engaged to kill it would be violated if instead of that same troublesome person he were to kill his employer towards his client the learned gentlemans duty consists on each occasion in subjecting to capital or other punishment the troublesome person on whom he stands engaged so to inflict suffering it would be violated if instead of that same troublesome person he were so to deal with his client or if by design or negligence he were to suffer the troublesome person to escape so his duty consists in the endeavour to save his client from merited punishment whether in the shape of mortal or less afflictive suffering that same duty would be violated if he neglected to use any means in his power to produce that same salutary effect if he omitted for example to give utterance or support to any false assertion tending to the production of that same effect how completely soever conscious of its possessing that same quality instructional exemplificational art    in england on the part of the judges of all classes of men that are anywhere to be found disregard to truth love of injustice and hatred of justice have place and are in force and operation to a degree as will have been seen altogether incapable of being equalled in any other country civilized or uncivilized of mendacity nowhere has any such use been made from mendacity nowhere has any such profit been derived out of whom are these english judges chosen out of those professional lawyers who have been for the longest time habituated to the practice of profitseeking and profitreaping mendacity instructional exemplificational art    of the two irreconcileable enemies to justice and happiness force and fraud—force is the first that falls into disrepute so at length though after a long interval will fraud your occupation sir—what is it—a pirates or what other was according to homer among the questions put to a stranger by menelaus in his observations on the english statutes—curious enough says judge barrington must have been that state of society in which a question to this effect could be put without design or apprehension of giving offence worded a little more in detail the question might have stood thus you are a plunderer and for carrying on your business a strong and lawless arm is the instrument habitually employed by you force was then and there the chief arbiter of human destiny instructional art    from the time anterior to homer and the territory of ancient greece transfer the scene to england or englishbred america you are of the bar sir if i do not mistake is a question which nowadays in england or the united states a gentleman may with as little fear of giving offence put to any other gentleman whom he meets you are of the bar—that is to say the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong and that for hire is your occupation and for the purpose of that occupation falsehood—selfconscious falsehood is an instrument which without stint and without scruple you are in the continual habit of employing thus it is in the existing order of things and thus of necessity in every order of things it must at all times continue to be but that which is not of necessity is that for filling the situation of judge the individuals selected should in every instance be taken from this class—nor so much as in any single instance section vi remuneration instructional ratiocinative art   minimize expense as to all other parts of the expense of recourse to the power of justice so as to this such is the general rule the less the remuneration given to persons of this class so much the better for persons of all other classes for unless the services rendered by the functionary in question in his capacity of notary constitute an exception by whatsoever is given to a functionary of this class is expense added to expense vexation to vexation instructional ratiocinative art   by fixation of prices—that is to say by appointment of a fixed sum for each article of service—by this expedient if it stood alone in no other than a very inadequate manner could this desirable effect be produced written pleadings paid at so much for so many words being altogether incompatible with the only system of procedure     compatible with this code—and of written instruments of procedure all such as are in their nature susceptible of general application being provided for by printed papers with blanks for the individual parts of the matter—little would remain for the subject matter of charge besides the time employed on each occasion in the business and how difficult it must be not to say impossible to preascertain for the purpose of fixing the remuneration what shall be the quantity of time necessary to be expended in the performance of each particular business for which there shall be a demand in each individual suit is sufficiently manifest instructional art   under the here proposed system several circumstances however contribute their aid towards the reduction of this part of the expense independently of everything that can be done by regulation applied in a direct manner by fixation of prices as above examples are—   exclusion of all written pleadings as above   maximizing the generalization of all written instruments as above   exclusion of the distinction between managing lawyers and speaking lawyers as per section   litiscontestational class one only   exclusion for the most part of argumentation on the question of law by the substitution of real law throughout to imaginary law and thence of all extra payment for pretending to delineate the features of a nonentity   rendering the substitution of the helpmate to the principal—of the lawyer to the client—a case of exception only the generally exemplified case being the attendance of all parties on both sides in the judicatory in the presence of each other as well as of the judge by which means except in so far as highly penal cases form an exception the demands on each side and the evidence on which they are respectively grounded will all commonly be brought to view at once instructional ratiocinative art   the causes by which the excess in the price paid to lawyers for their services and thence the excessive amount of the burthen imposed on their litigant clients is produced will thus in a great part be removed while by a variety of arrangements directed to this end of such part of the burthen as cannot be taken off from the parties on both sides the quantity imposed on those who are in the wrong will be maximized and by that means operate with proportionable effect towards the reduction of the quantity of the like wrongs in future expositive instructional art   on reviewing the demand made by the lawyer for his service the judge will take into consideration—not merely the quantity of time actually employed and of business actually done but also what there was need for employing and doing and this whether length of time be regarded or number of operations journeys included performed or number and length of written instruments penned instructional art   in an estimate formed of the quantum of remuneration adequate on the occasion in question to the service performed by a professional lawyer the quantity of time thereon expended cannot pass unheeded but so far as regards time employed elsewhere than in the judicatory unless checked by the vigilance of the judge not only may time not employed in the service of the client be charged as so employed but for the sake of the remuneration needless addition may be made to the quantity actually so employed section vii securities for appropriate aptitude enactive art   compensationally and punitionally as a litigant or extraneous witness is responsible for statements mendaciously or temerariously false—so is a professional lawyer for statements insincerely or temerariously false to wit as to anything which he professes to believe of statements made by any such witness or by any person whose statements made or supposed to be made on any other occasion are on the occasion in question employed in evidence enactive art   by a decree of a judge immediate pronounced after due examination and subject to appeal a professional lawyer may be eliminated out of the list of professional lawyers acting in that judicatory enactive art   on appeal if the eliminating decree be confirmed the judge appellate may extend the disqualification to any or all other judicatories in the state expositive art   one instrument of security which applies peculiarly to the professional lawyer is his direct and constant subjection to the power of the judge a subjection less reserved than in the case of the government and eleemosynary advocates they being raised above him by their official character enactive instructional art   the same publicity which enforces     the lawyers duty as towards his clients enforces it also as towards his clients adversaries a wrong to which a litigant on either side stands exposed at the hands of the lawyer on the other side is the giving undue increase to costs of suit by want of appropriate intellectual aptitude a client may stand debarred from having cognizance of the excess or by want of firmness from resisting the demand without waiting for any application on the part of the client the judge will therefore—if it be needful and without preponderant evil in the shape of delay vexation and expense practicable—of his own motion accerse the client and by examining him endeavour to ascertain whether the time charged as expended in the service of the client in relation to the suit was or was not so expended and if expended whether the expenditure was or was not needful as per section   art   as in relation to time so in relation to epistolary communications other written instruments and journeys instructional art   on this occasion the legislature and the judge will be aware of the manner in which the sinister interest of a client may be acting not in opposition to but in league with the sinister interest of the lawyer for if in his own view of the matter the client is confident of gaining the suit and that in such sort as to be assured of receiving back from his adversary the amount of his own expenditure in the shape of costs—a confederacy with the lawyer may in this case render it the endeavour of the client—not to minimize but to maximize the amount of his own costs instructional art   for the more effectual and timely prevention of all such excess an object of the judges care will be at the earliest stage of the suit in concert with the parties and their lawyers to ascertain what may be the cheapest as well as most expeditious course for bringing it to a just conclusion for various arrangements made for minimizing expenses see procedure code ch

occasional the justice minister will perform in the immediate judicatories inspection visits enactive instructional art   objects and businesses of such visits these—   seeing that by those several judicatories in so far as in them lies execution and effect is given to the several ordinances of the legislature   preservation of mutual conformity and symmetry as between each judicatory and every other in respect of the mode of giving execution and effect to the substantive branch of the law through the adjective branch that is to say the system of judicial procedure   taking cognizance of appropriate aptitude on the part of the several functionaries with a view to continuance dislocation suspension or translation as per ch ix ministers collectively section   functions in all art      so with a view to the promotion of them in their several situations to the like in appellate judicatories   settling any such differences as may have place between a functionary in one line and a functionary in another line as per ch xii judiciary collectively section   judiciary functionaries for example judge government advocate eleemosynary advocate and registrar and so as to the several ministerial functionaries instructional ratiocinative art   as to the time of visitation diversifications it admits of are these it may be periodical or occasional if occasional the occasions may be determined either by choice or by chance   of its being periodical the use is this—to persons at large to all to whom it may happen to have complaints to make information     to communicate or meliorative arrangements to suggest time will thus be given and that in so far as may be adequate for arranging their respective affairs in such sort as to minimize the inconvenience produced by attendance at the justice chamber   in the case where the time though not periodical and accordingly fixed is determined by choice the like convenience has place not however in so great a degree for on the part of the several individuals in question the degree of convenience will be diversified depending on the quantity of time between the moment at which the notification of the intended visit takes place and the moment at which the termination of that same visit actually takes place instructional ratiocinative art   such is naturally the good effect of choice now for the bad effects—   in so far as the time is placed under the command of choice a danger which has place is—lest through the influence of some particular and sinister interest whether in the shape of selfregard sympathy or antipathy in the mind of the thus visiting functionary wrong should be done wrong either to the public service or to this or that individual interest   whether any such sinister interest having had place the correspondent bad effect has or has not been produced—a suspicion to that effect to an extent more or less considerable may have place in the public mind instructional ratiocinative art   remains the case where the time not being fixed but occasional is determined by chance of this mode of determination the good effect and use is as follows—the time not being foreseeable the consequence is—that at every moment of time as much as at any one such moment it concerns all those whose conduct is to be inspected to maintain that conduct in a state in which it will abide this trial instructional art   the practical conclusion seems to be as follows—   periodical visitation at fixed times—that is to say once ayear or in the course of the year at two three or any greater number of times—equally or not very unequally distant from one another according to circumstances   for particular reasons on each occasion assigned—the day of the justice ministers occasional visitation determined in each instance by choice preceded by notice having for its object the attendance of all persons desirous of attending   in addition to these announced and foreknown days days of visitation determined by chance that is to say by lot—the lots so drawn as to minimize the interval between the moment at which the lot is drawn and the moment at which the visit of the justice minister is made known to the functionary of whose conduct he comes to take cognizance to this purpose—in so far as it can be effected without losing time by travelling backwards and forwards the lots may be drawn not only at the moment next before that of his setting out for the justice chamber first visited by him but then and there also for the determination of the justice chamber next to be visited and so on instructional art   to the intent that in the breasts of the several functionaries the expectation of being eventually subjected to such inspection may be kept effectually alive—the legislature will perhaps see sufficient reason for appointing a certain number of judicatories to be in the course of each year subjected to these same inspection visits leaving the individual judicatories to be determined by lot instructional art   so likewise as to the offices of the several local headmen and their respective registrars as per ch xxv and xxvi to these offices apply the several preceding articles of this present section instructional art   for the mode of taking by lot the decision of chance—see ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who supplement instructional art  0 as to the appellate judicatories—whether they shall be subject to these visitations of the justice minister will depend upon their local situation if it be in the metropolis yes if elsewhere than in the metropolis no section iv judicative function enactive art   in the exercise of this function the justice minister takes cognizance of petitions complaining of oppression or denial of justice in an appellate judicatory of the like complaints in relation to an immediate judicatory cognizance in the first instance belongs to appellate judicatories enactive art   in consequence of any such complaint or spontaneously he may deliver to any judge or other officer belonging to his department in public a sentence or order of dislocation or a recommendation or permission to resign in case of such recommendation or permission he grants a public hearing if for  00 clearance of character required if in due time resignation fails to have place order of dislocation follows enactive instructional art   for any such sentence or order the most apt cause will generally be—deficiency in respect of appropriate moral aptitude for any such recommendation or permission deficiency in respect of appropriate intellectual or active aptitude instructional art   for ulterior exercise of this same judicative function by the justice minister see section   dispunitive function and section   jurisdictionadjustive function section v dispunitive function expositive instructional art   by the justice ministers dispunitive function understand—the function to which exercise is given by the remission of punishment in a case in which it stands annexed by the law to the commission of an offence in this or that one of the several shapes marked out in the penal code as to which see the table of offences as attached to the penal code instructional expositive art   principal and allcomprehensive subjects of consideration on this occasion are these— i quantity of the effect producible in each instance by the remission modifications of which on this ground it is susceptible are these namely   remission of the whole of the punishment appointed by law say total remission   remission of a part thereof more or less considerable say partial remission   substitution of a less afflictive to the more afflictive punishment appointed by the law   suspension made of the application of the punishment whether total partial or substitutive for and during a time more or less considerable by less afflictive understand that which—in the conception of the party about to suffer is according to his declaration less afflictive instructional expositive art   ii relative time at which the remission whether total partial substitutive or suspensive is made to take place or say to take effect distinctions which on this ground may require or be thought to require to be established are these   time of the remission anterior to that of the commission of the offence say time antepeccational   time of the remission posterior to that of the commission of the offence but anterior to that of the commencement of judicial pursuit on the ground of it say time anteprosecutional   time of the remission posterior to that of the commencement of pursuit but anterior to that of conviction say time anteconvictional   time of the remission posterior to that of the conviction but anterior to that of the sentence whereby the quality and quantity of the punishment has been pronounced say time antesentential   time of the remission posterior to that of the pronunciation of the sentence but anterior to the commencement of the execution thereof say time anteexecutional   time of the remission posterior to the time at which in consequence of the sentence the actual application of the punishment has taken its commencement say time postinitial or terminative instructional expositive art   iii grounds on which it may be thought that at one or more or all of the several relative times abovementioned remission total partial substitutive or suspensive may with propriety be made are these which follow—   of exculpative evidence discovery made at a time subsequent to conviction   service expected to be rendered by the convicted delinquent or say convict by information having for its effect the prevention of otherwise future acts of delinquency   service expected to be rendered by the convict by the prevention frustration or timely repression of acts of hostility or diminution of their maleficent effects of hostility namely at the hands of a foreign power   service expected to be rendered by the convict by the prevention of physical calamity or the diminution of its maleficent effects   service expected to be rendered by the convict by the communication of some useful invention or discovery   service actually rendered by the convict in any one of the abovementioned four shapes   regard for the amity of foreign powers one or more   regard for the amity of the people of the state to which the individual in question belongs   multitude of the individuals who having been cooperating with the delinquent in question are liable to be punished for the same cause say multitude of codelinquents  0 service rendered or about to be rendered by the delinquent in question by information contributory to the conviction of some codelinquent or codelinquents enactive instructional art   as to remission at the hands of the justice minister it will be subject to the  0  restrictions cautions and instructions in relation to the various grounds respectively hereinafter particularized— i ground the first—of exculpative evidence discovery made at a time subsequent to the conviction of the delinquent in question care may in this case require to be taken lest the convict being in time apprized of the existence of the evidence in question should purposely postpone till after conviction the elicitation of it for example for the purpose of averting the elicitation of some counterevidence the elicitation of which may by the expected death or expatriation of the evidenceholder be accordingly averted enactive instructional art   ii ground the second—service expected to be rendered by the convict by information having for its effect the prevention of otherwise future acts of delinquency adequate assurance will on this occasion require to be obtained not only that by means of the information thus afforded by the convict the offences in question will have been prevented but also that without it they would not have been prevented and accordingly that the delinquent not having himself been able to communicate the information was not by some other person who had become possessed of it made the channel of communication for the purpose of his obtaining the remission of the punishment enactive instructional art   iii ground the third—service expected to be rendered by the convict by the prevention frustration or repression of acts of hostility or the diminution of the maleficent effects of hostility at the hands of a foreign power in this case also in like manner will care require to be taken to prevent the impunityconferring transference of merit as per no ii enactive instructional art   iv ground the fourth—service expected to be rendered by the convict by the prevention or the diminution of the effects of some physical calamity of the several calamities to which human nature stands exposed see a list in ch xi ministers severally section   preventive service minister and section  0 health minister care will in this case also require to be taken in like manner to prevent the impunityconferring transference of merit as per no ii enactive instructional art   v ground the fifth—service expected to be rendered by the convict by the communication of some useful invention or discovery care will in this case also require to be taken in like manner to prevent the impunityconferring transference of merit as per no ii so likewise that the good reasonably to be expected from the invention or discovery be of sufficient magnitude to overbalance whatsoever evil may reasonably be apprehended from the impunity thus conferred and in this view the publicopinion tribunal will have its eye on the line of conduct on this occasion pursued by the justice minister enactive instructional ratiocinative art  0 vi ground the sixth—service actually rendered by the convict in any one of the four shapes above specified care will in this case also require to be taken in like manner that there be a reasonable ground for the persuasion that the good produced by the service in question was or was about to be of sufficient magnitude to overbalance whatsoever evil may reasonably be apprehended from the impunity thus conferred on the other hand it will be borne in mind that a reward bestowed for a past service operates as a reward offered for all similar future services and that thereby service may in countless shapes be purchased on the other hand again if a man has in contemplation a favourite crime from the commission of which he looks for inordinate gratification the contemplation of reward in this shape may lead him to add to the service in question the maleficent act so contemplated enactive instructional ratiocinative art    grounds on which to whatsoever other functionary it may it will not belong to the justice minister to exercise at any one of the abovementioned points of relative time as per art   the dispunitive function in every one of the above modes as per art   they are these which follow— i ground the first—regard for the amity of a foreign power or foreign powers it may be that under the particular circumstances of the case from illwill with or without acts of hostility on the part of a foreign power evil would result of such magnitude as to overbalance whatsoever evil may reasonably be apprehended from the impunity thus conferred but in the situation of the justice minister for the forming a correct estimate of a service in this shape means will not in general be possessed so adequate as those which are accessible to a functionary occupying the situation of prime minister to him therefore in this case the function is committed enactive instructional ratiocinative art    ii ground the second—regard for the amity of the people of the state to which the individual in question belongs in no place at no time under no form of government—not even under the form congenial to this code—can the people at large be reasonably regarded as likely to be so nearly  0  upon a level with the members of their legislature in the scale of appropriate intellectual aptitude but that in consequence of some delusion a portion more or less considerable of the community may not be to such a degree averse to the execution of this or that penal law or attached to the particular delinquent that whatsoever evil may reasonably be apprehended from the remission of the punishment on the individual occasion in question may be overbalanced by the joy in the event of the remission and the chagrin in the event of the execution but in this case for the same reason as in the case no i the exercise of the dispunitive function belongs—not to the justice minister but to the prime minister enactive instructional ratiocinative art    iii ground the third—multitude of codelinquents in this case for the same reason as in the case no i the exercise of the dispunitive power belongs—not to the justice minister but to the prime minister various offences there are in which with or without mutual consent it may happen to individuals in numbers altogether unlimited to embark in particular such as are distinguished by the appellation of political consisting as they do in acts of hostility to the ruling powers in the course of a civil war it may happen to the minority in any proportion to have the upper hand and by that means to be in possession of all the powers of government in such a state of things the whole number of the members of the community with the exception of those members of the minority may be in the condition of codelinquents and to avoid giving exercise to the dispunitive power—and that at a time antecedent to judicial pursuit or say prosecution—would be not merely inexpedient but physically impossible enactive instructional ratiocinative art    iv ground the fourth—service rendered or about to be rendered by the delinquent in question by information contributory to the conviction of some codelinquent or codelinquents in this case to give exercise to this power of remission will belong—not to the justice minister but to a government advocate that is to say to the government advocate of the judicatory by which cognizance was originally taken of the offence by the justice minister it will not be to be exercised for the same reason for which the power of a judge immediate will not except in cases of rare necessity be exercised by the supposition by the judge immediate it will not be to be exercised because the exercise of it has for its effect the preserving the delinquent from being in the character of a delinquent brought before any judge immediate on the three points following adequate assurance will on this occasion require to be entertained   that with the information for which so great a price will have been paid the whole of the evidence necessary to warrant the conviction of the whole number of the defendants in question whatsoever it be will be obtained   that without it no sufficient evidence against any one   that with it will be obtained the evidence applying to as many as may be of the whole number of codelinquents of which it is desirable to obtain the conviction proportioned to the magnitude of the evil of the offence is the magnitude of the price thus offered for the hope of contributing to the prevention of it in future to confer impunity on one delinquent with no other effect and for no other purpose than the faculty of applying punishment to another is if by supposition that same faculty can be obtained gratis a bargain palpably absurd instructional exemplificational art    mind now the practical consequence where such is the practice the existence of it constitutes a sort of apparent and virtual law which makes itself known to the fraternity of criminals of all sorts it thus operates as a premium as an encouragement to all crimes to which it applies itself a man says to himself—i will get men to join with me in the commission of this crime i will reap myself all the benefit of it and by information given to the judicial authority i will impose upon them the whole burthen of the punishment what if to the encouragement in this shape be added under the express name of a reward a pecuniary donation the payment of it having for a condition the conviction of the codelinquent in question here then is encouragement offered by authority—offered according to law—for two atrocious and distinct though so intimately connected crimes in the first place the principal crime in question in the next place the utterance of mendacious evidence whatsoever it may be that may have presented itself as necessary or conducive to the obtainment of the reward under english law thanks to the sinister industry of the judges the wretched succedaneum to law by which so large a portion of the field of legislation is covered being of their formation this practice is still in vigour to the defendant himself an interrogatory the effect of which might by means of his confessorial evidence his evasions or his silence be to afford demonstration of his guilt is not suffered to be put why because forsooth the talking of any one of those crimes would not be pleasant a reason which if admitted to give determination to the conduct of the legislator would have the effect of giving impunity to every malefactor and complete license to every crime pleasing to him  0  no assuredly it will not be if he is guilty but not less assuredly it would be if he is innocent instructional art    three several modes there are in which in an indirect and unobserved way impunity may in practice be given to acts marked out for punishment by the direct declaration of the law in two of these instances the authority by which the effect is produced is the legislative in the third it is the judiciary in the first two the relative time at which the remission applies itself is anterior to prosecution the remission is in a word anteprosecutional in the third case it is postprosecutional and commonly postconvictional the effect in some cases is completely remissive in others no other than suspensive instructional art    the impunity in one of these three cases has commonly for its cause want of perspicacity and thence presence of inadvertency in the mind of the legislator he sees not that to an extent more or less considerable the effect produced by his enactment will be—not the effect declared by him to be intended to be produced but the reverse of it such for example and to a prodigious extent is the result in the case in which to the act which is taken for the subject matter of prohibition stands attached punishment in no other shape than that of a pecuniary penalty where to an extent more or less considerable a profit from the offence rises to an amount exceeding the loss by the payment of the penalty—to the amount of the difference between the loss and the profit the effect of the law is in this case not merely that of a license but that of a premium or say a bounty on the commission of the offence as to this see the work intituled nomography ch ix in vol iii p   0 of this collection instructional art    in the second of these cases the result has commonly for its cause the perspicacity foresight and prudence on the part of the legislator this state of things is exemplified in the case where having by the substantive branch of his code interdicted the act in question and attached a punishment to the commission of it by the adjective branch or say the procedure code he excludes from the right or prosecuting for it every person other than a government functionary acting under the direction of the prime minister under a democracy such as the present one a functionary—namely the government advocate of the immediate judgeshire or the government advocategeneral under a monarchy the functionary acts under the direction of the monarch in which state of things a virtual dispunitive function is reposed in the hands of the monarch in one case of the prime minister in the other case instructional art    in this case on the subject of acts of any particular description supposing the legislator to act under the guidance of the greatesthappiness principle suppose it should be his opinion that in regard to the sort of acts in question from the attaching punishment to them the happiness of the community would experience diminution at the same time that towards persons by whom those acts are practised or supposed to be practised illwill or say antipathy in the breasts of a portion more or less considerable of the community has place in such sort as that it is their desire to see punishment of the sort and to the amount in question inflicted on persons by whom those acts are or are supposed to be practised and that such is the intensity of this desire and such the extent to which it has place that were it contravened the evil consisting of their disaffection towards the government would be greater than the evil produced by the attaching to the acts in question punishment in a sort and quantity by which the mass of illwill in question would be saturated instructional art  0 on this or some other no matter what consideration by a legislature of former times to acts of the description in question punishment has been attached by the actual application of punishment to those same acts at the institution of the present pannomion in the opinion of the legislature suppose the happiness of the community would experience not increase but diminution at the same time it apprehends that after the habit which the community has been in of seeing punishment attached to the acts in question were no punishment to be attached to them by the new law the consequence would be that from the observation of the change a portion more or less considerable of the people would not only experience dissatisfaction but dissatisfaction to such an amount that the evil composed of it would be greater than the evil composed of the application made of the punishment in question to the delinquents in question in this case what course shall be taken a course which in a case of this sort has been taken is such as that indicated in art    in this way the dissatisfaction in question is left unproduced—the tranquillity of the public mind is undisturbed instructional art    bad opinions—acts consisting in the giving expression and publicity to bad opinions by legislators of most if not of all nations to acts of this description punishment has been attached to inquire what the relation is which has place between legislation to this effect and the happiness of the community belongs not to the present purpose what does belong to the present purpose is—the  0  observation that supposing this policy advisable here is a case in which the purpose requires that with reference to acts of the description in question the power of remission with regard to whatsoever punishment stands attached to them should in this indirect and silent way be committed to the government advocate and through him to the prime minister instructional exemplificational art    in the third of these cases the remission of the punishment and the virtual though indirect exercise of legislative authority is exercised by the judiciary in this way the evil capable of being produced and which in certain countries in england more particularly actually continues to be produced by it is such as cannot but excite the astonishment of succeeding generations the simple word void or its synonym the compound word nullandvoid is the instrument by which the effect is produced—the impunity conferred for the pronunciation of this word some pretext is always made but no pretext is too frivolous to be employed and serve in the original writing or copying of a written instrument for example in one of the words a letter which ought to have been inserted is not inserted or a letter which ought not to have been inserted is inserted on this ground without any other—without any the least regard to innocence and guilt be the crime ever so atrocious the criminal after the most undoubted proof of his guilt receives in this way impunity from the hands of the judge and is turned by him loose into society to go on and add crime to crime instructional art    as often as in this way remission of punishment takes place legislative power is usurped and the usurpers are—the draughtsman on whom the instrument depends for its aptitude and the judge who on so frivolous a pretext sets himself above the legislature overrules its declared will and frustrates its design instructional art    such is the efficiency of habit and custom in expunging all sense of shame that the practice of conferring impunity on known criminals and thus violating the authority of the legislature is on the part of all judges of the rank in question an avowed practice this being one of the modes in which decisions are pronounced on grounds foreign to the merits a mode of proceeding which no such judge ever scruples or hesitates to speak of himself as practising instructional art    a few years hence when corruption has put on incorruption and the eyes of the great body of the people have opened themselves what will men think and say of the probity or the intelligence of the judges by whom the practice could be persevered in—of the legislators who could leave such judges unpunished—and of the people who could continue their submission to such legislators enactive expositive instructional art    of all the several cases in which as above the dispunitive function is intrusted to the justice minister in no one will the remission be justified otherwise than on the ground of an individual matter of fact the existence of which has been made known by appropriate and adequate evidence elicited in the same manner as the evidence on the ground of which convictions are pronounced instructional expositive ratiocinative art    on no other supposition than that thereby the aggregate of the happiness of all persons interested will in that case be greater than in the opposite case can the application of evil in the shape of punishment be justified on no other ground than this can the remission of punishment be justified and if in the one case the existence of the matter of fact of which the justification for the exercise made of the power of punishment ought to be established by appropriate and adequate evidence suited to the nature of the case so ought it in the other in the one case not more than the other should the happiness of the person interested be dependent upon the arbitrary will and pleasure of any person whose interest it may be or may appear to him to be to make sacrifice of it enactive art    when in consequence of such ex parte evidence as hath been delivered in to him the justice minister determines to make complete inquiry into the truth of an alleged ground for the exercise of this his dispunitive function he will either himself complete the elicitation of the evidence or for the completion issue his mandates to the judge or judges immediate of one or more judgeshires the judgeshire in which the conviction took place included according to the place or places in which the evidenceholder or evidenceholders have his or their residence expositive art    when it is not to the justice minister but to the prime minister that the exercise of this power is committed the need of evidence is not less incontrovertible than where it is to the justice minister that this same trust is committed but the evidence assorted to the nature of the case is different in the one case from what it is in the other in the cases in which it is to the justice minister that the ascertainment of the fact is committed the appropriate evidence is not already in his possession but is capable of being elicited by interrogatories  0  addressed to individuals on that particular occasion for that particular purpose in the cases in which it is to the prime minister that the ascertainment of the fact is committed all the facts which bear upon the case have already in so far as they are capable of being made known been made known to him accordingly by evidence such as it belongs to his situation to receive instructional ratiocinative art  0 as to the relative time generally speaking in no other case than where conviction has already taken place will application be made for the exercise of the dispunitive function by the justice minister the alleged delinquent does he expect to be declared not guilty application for remission of the punishment would be a virtual confession of guiltiness and correspondent loss of reputation would be the natural consequence does he expect to be pronounced guilty still he may as well take his chance for acquittal for example by the death or expatriation of a necessary witness and when the worst that can happen has happened namely the pronunciation of the decree of conviction it will then be time enough for application to be made for the remission instructional art    the only case in which to a man who expects to be otherwise convicted it may happen to appear eligible to obtain remission antecedently to conviction is where to preserve his reputation from the wound it would receive from the individual facts which would be divulgated by the inculpative evidence if elicitated he subjects himself in preference to the evil resulting from the general prevalence of the opinion of his having been guilty of an act of the sort in question unaccompanied with any distinct conception of its particular circumstances instructional art    between the penal code considered as occupied in the appointment of the several punishments for the several offences and the part of the constitutional code thus occupied in declaring in what cases the application of such punishment shall be superseded nothing of contradiction or inconsistency has place for the cases in which exercise may be given to the dispunitive function constitute so many exceptions to the more general rules by which those same punishments will respectively have been appointed enactive art    at any time if any circumstance over and above those herein above enumerated presents itself as fit to be constituted an efficient cause of remission the justice minister will forthwith make report thereof to the legislature suspending execution until the will of the legislature shall have been made known instructional art    pardon to pardon mercy to show mercy—to no such words does any place belong in the vocabulary of this code instructional ratiocinative art    power of pardon supposes tyranny in the same hand exercise of the power of pardon is occasional relaxation of the habitual tyranny habitually exercised by the same hand where without obligation to exercise it power of punishment is exercised tyranny is exercised true it is—that as on every occasion it is better that tyranny be not exercised than exercised so on every occasion where no obligation to inflict punishment is imposed it is better that it be not inflicted than that it be inflicted but on every occasion on which on adequate grounds the obligation of inflicting punishment is by law imposed it is better that it be inflicted than that it be not inflicted and the noninfliction of it by him by whom it should have been inflicted so far from being a meritorious act is or should be made a punishable offence instructional art    such being the real effect and true character of this power behold now the character ascribed to it by the unreflecting and deluded multitude behold hence the support and encouragement given by this delusion to absolutism and tyranny proportioned to the quantity of the praise bestowed upon this power is the evil produced by it instructional art    the more oppressive the tyranny of which the law is thus made the instrument the greater is the quantity of the good capable of being done by the nonexercise of it and the greater the quantity of good capable of being thus done the greater is the quantity of praise capable of being thus purchased thus it is that in a monarchy not only is praise elicited by the exercise of tyranny but the more enormous the tyranny the greater is the quantity of praise thus undeservedly and insidiously obtained instructional exemplificational art    look at the roman emperors of old times look at the oriental despots of all times never were a titus or a trajan so much lauded as a nero or a domitian life and death being at his option the monarch receives laud for every subject he abstains from putting to death to the almighty in heaven man is indebted for his creation to the almighty here on earth for his preservation instructional art    thus combined with cruelty with  0  insincerity with artifice and with fraud no wonder if to longrobed sycophants the power of pardon should be the subject of such ecstatic eulogy by one class held up to admiration by some such appellative as the most valuable jewel of the crown by another even to adoration as being an attribute communicated by the one god to his express image and representative here on earth for true it is that by whomsoever exercised—in him it supposes the existence of tyranny and of that same tyranny he is in this respect the most valuable as being not merely the least odious but even the beloved instrument instructional art  0 by pretences thus false is praise thus filched from the deluded people by the sceptred hypocrite instructional art    popularity gained by tyranny what a paradox yet where is the monarchy in which that paradox has not been endeavoured to be verified and the endeavour crowned with a deplorably extensive success instructional art    to pardon is to be an habitual tyrant to show mercy is to have exercised tyranny scarcely if at all less odious should the words pardon and mercy be than the word tyranny itself tyranny is itself without a mask pardon and mercy are tyranny under a mask instructional ratiocinative exemplificational art    conceive a state of things in which the punishment being death punishment the numbers of the persons convicted and sentenced are hundreds and the numbers executed are units of this state of things what can have been the cause or causes answer—causes these which follow—   the greater the number of those to whom this part of the punishment is remitted the greater the number of those over whom an arbitrary power of life and death is exercised exercised by the unknown functionaries by whom with or without just cause this vast power is exercised exercised in secret and without any the slightest responsibility or apprehension of it   the gratification reaped by the pride of these same individuals—the pride of repealing pro tanto the enactments of the legislature and thus exercising a power over the sostyled supreme power   to absolute rulers and their adherents the advantage of impressing on the imaginations of the people the idea of a sort of godhead upon earth as residing in the person of the man woman child or madman whichsoever it might happen to him or her to be   it operates—this idea—in confirmation of the notion that it is to the bounty of a human creature thus situated that every other member of the community stands indebted for everything valuable that he or she is in possession of and that as to him or her when so pleased it belongs to give so to him or her when so pleased it belongs to take away   in every charter received from a monarch and referred to as a source of right a proposition to this effect is implicitly contained royal bounty in this shape is assumed to be the only security for good government which the people ought to have were it not for this concession he or she would have had and would continue to have the right of doing with them whatsoever he or she pleased and would have been in the right had he or she done so   in regard to monarchy in general and limited monarchy in particular a vague conception which has place in the minds of all its adherents is that being thus rotten the props which by deception and delusion in all imaginable shapes are supplied to it cannot be too strong or too abundant   the judges on whom in so considerable a degree the lot of the delinquent in question in respect of the difference between life and death depends are in their minds divided as to this matter to some the supposed additional security by putting out of the way so many men by whose existence their property and by possibility their persons and even their lives appear to them to be kept in jeopardy presents itself as the most valuable benefit to some the exercise of arbitrary power in saving the lives of delinquents as above presents itself as most desirable in this exercise of a power above that of the legislature the last behold the very thing they wish for the others put up with the state of things in question as well as they can not being able to obtain anything more congenial to their taste   the judges having reduced the value of punishment in the shape or say dimension of certainty or say probability—those among them who are partisans of death punishment feel what appears to them the need of increase to it in the shape or dimension of intensity   death being regarded as the natural and original punishment due to all such offences as are regarded as criminal punishments other than death punishment have when considered as applied to offences of this description come to receive the name of secondary punishments  0 to prevent the institution and application of those secondary punishments has from the first been the endeavour of the english judges of the highest grade—styled the westminster hall judges judge blackstone being the only one who joined in the promotion of it blackstone with whom together with howard and eden the penitentiary system according to the first conception of it originated    when they failed in this their next endeavour was to keep or make these secondary  0  punishments as expensive as possible and in this all who joined in it were but too effectually seconded by a secret intrigue set on foot by george the third    a plan had been presented to and eagerly not to say rapturously taken up by the ministers of that king—by pitt the second and by lord mansfield the first—a plan by which not to speak of collateral advantages moral and economical such as conception had never till then reached to the expense of the maintenance and employment of prisoners would have been reduced from the first to next to nothing    george the third having conceived a secret pique against the proposer by whom the plan was to have been carried into execution kept the business in a state of delay by secret management from the year      to the year      this delay having been preceded by two years and more of delay between march      the time of acceptance and july      the time of passing the act of parliament his assent to which had by means unknown been obtained by those same ministers for that purpose    at length arrived the year      when the time was thought to be arrived for putting an end to this economical scheme altogether benevolent and influential men in considerable numbers still prossing for the penitentiary plan a sort of composition was entered into with them by the secretary of state for the home department lord viscount sidmouth a committee of the house of commons was got up for forms sake the act of      was formally and virtually repealed and the still existing plan substituted    of this plan the expense of the mere construction of the building has been computed at £ 000 per prisoner to what a degree the expense of secondary punishment in this form upon an allcomprehensive scale was unpopularized and represented as impracticable may be imagined section vi jurisdictionadjustive function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function in case of dispute or doubt as to which of two or more judicial functionaries belongs the exercise of this or that power or function the justice minister in subordination to the legislature issues a decree opinative and imperative declaring by whom if at all and in what manner the power or say function in question ought to have been exercised enactive art   this power he exercises whether the functionaries in question as above belong to the same judicatory or to different judicatories enactive instructional art   of such his decision the subject matter may be not only that which under the existing law in his opinion had place but also what in such his opinion ought in future to have place in a word the function on this occasion exercised by him may be—and in case of need is expected to be—not only the interpretative as to which see ch xii section    judges preinterpretative function but also the eventuallyemendative as to which see ch xii section  0 proceeding mutatis mutandis in manner as therein directed instructional art   in so far as if the order of the one judge is executed the execution of an order of the other judge is thereby impossibilized the prevalence generally belongs to the order to which execution has begun to be given before it has begun to be given to the other instructional exemplificational art   of the incompatibility thus brought to view examples are as follows—   by an accersitive mandate of one judge the attendance of a certain person at a certain point of time at his judicatory is required by another judge he being ignorant of such order the attendance of that same person at that same point of time at his judicatory is by an appropriate mandate required   by a prehension mandate of one judge for the purpose of securing the means of eventual execution to a demand on the ground of debt property situated within the territory of another judge is required to be prehended and kept in custody by a like order of some other judge for the like purpose on occasion of a similar demand by another demandant that same property is required to be so dealt with at the same point of time for the benefit of such other demandant section vii term of service enactive art   in the case of a justice minister after the expiration of the preparation period as per section  0 locable who the term of service is the term of his life subject only to causes of dislocatedness as per section    dislocable how enactive art   during the preparation period exceptions excepted of no justice minister  0  will the term of service be more than one solar year for the reason see section  0 locable who enactive art   exception will be if before the ordinary election a vacancy have place in that case the person elected for the remainder of the year will continue in office during the then next year section viii remuneration enactive instructional ratiocinative art   the justice ministers pay is  per day the same as that of every subminister it is paid to him and him only it is paid to him at his official residence of power patronage and dignity is the most valuable part of his remuneration composed dignity natural inseparable from and proportionable to appropriate aptitude enactive art   attached to his justice chamber is his official residence kept furnished by the care of the finance minister at the public expense enactive art   to his regular pay is added indemnificationmoney for the expense of inspection visits as per section   visitative function at the rate of  per mile actually travelled with  per day and night for diet and lodging while out at his official residence immediately on his return from each visitation the amount will be paid to him by or from the finance minister section ix attendance enactive art   either at his official residence or as per section   on some inspection visit he stands bound to attendance on the same times as a judge immediate as per ch xii section    attendance night duty excepted enactive art   by an appropriate registrar whose office is attached to his as of his several official acts so of his attendances is an account kept it is kept by an appropriate service calendar upon the plan of those kept in the several judicatories appellate as well as immediate as per ch xii section    section x locable who enactive art   after the expiration of the relative preparation period—in other words from and after the commencement of the relative consummation period as to which two periods see ch xii judiciary collectively section    locable who and ch ix ministers collectively section    locable who no person will be locable in the situation of justice minister who has not after serving two service years in that of immediate judge principal served two service years in that of appellate judge principal enactive art   during the preparation period no person who has not after serving one service year as judge immediate principal served one service year as judge appellate principal will be locable so soon as any apt person exists who has so served enactive art   until such presumption of appropriate aptitude as is afforded by service as per art   has come into existence—the legislature will make its election out of all such persons to whom in such a state of things it has happened to have afforded such presumptive evidence of appropriate aptitude as the nature of the case admits of enactive art   during the preparation period of no justice minister will the term of service be for solar years more than one nor will any person who has served during one year be eligible on any other year of that period ratiocinative art   why during the preparation period dislocate the justice minister without proof or so much as imputation of blameworthy conduct after he has served no more than a single year answer reasons   to the end that when the choice comes to be made of a justice minister whose term of service is for life those to whom it belongs to choose may have two persons out of whom to choose two persons of each of whom experience in equal quantity has been had   a consideration by which this experience is rendered the more needful is that at the commencement and throughout the whole course of the preparation period out of no persons will the choice have to be made other than such as in the profession of advocate had been inured to the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood section xi located how enactive ratiocinative art   by the legislature as is the prime  0  minister so is the justice minister located by the legislature to whose will it belongs to the justice minister to provide in chief for giving execution and effect in contested as to the prime minister in uncontested cases enactive art   until judicatories immediate have for one year been in activity no restrictions in the choice of the legislature have place in this case other than those which have place in the case of the prime minister instructional ratiocinative art   question why place the power of locating the justice minister not in the hands of the executive chief by whom the other ministers are located but in the hands of the legislature i why in the hands of the legislature answer reasons   the use of the office of justice minister is to give execution and effect in the surest manner to the ordinances which are the expressions of the will of the legislature to give execution and effect to it namely in the case in which from whatever cause instead of obsequiousness it experiences contestation   supposing the purport of that will ascertained obsequiousness could not be too prompt too unreserved or too universal   were the time of the legislature sufficient for the despatch of this business in addition to their own by them this function ought for the above reason to be exercised but by want of time they are debarred from the exercise of this additional function as by want of time the members of the constitutive are debarred from the exercise of the legislative and the members of the legislature from exercising that of the executive chief instructional ratiocinative art   ii why not in the hands of the constitutive answer reasons   on the part of the constitutive want of time namely want of time for the exercise of this function in addition to that paramount function from which their authority takes its denomination namely in its application to the authority of the supreme legislative as also as will be seen in its proper place in its application to the local legislatures—the sublegislatures   note here a distinction not in the want of time for the bare exercise of this function does the efficient cause of inaptitude consist in this instance only in the want of time for the acquiring the appropriate knowledge—the appropriate materials for apt judgment in a word for acquiring adequate intellectual aptitude   on the part of the people at large by the here proposed function of the justice minister notwithstanding its importance no attention will be attracted equal in intensity and extent to that which will of course be attracted by the functions of members of the supreme legislature no such ample means of judging will therefore in this case be put into the hands of the people by the discussion carried on in the publicopinion tribunal by the leading members   the object or end immediately in view being the giving execution and effect on each occasion to the will whatever be the object of the legislature itself the degree of interest with which the legislature will see to the execution of its own will will naturally be greater than any interest with which the members of the constitutive would see to the execution of a will in the formation of which they had not any of them any immediate share   as in the instance of every other head functionary so in this it is essential that the power of dislocation should be in the hands of the constitutive but it is moreover essential that in this case the power of location should not be in the same hands as is the power of dislocation why it should not be so in the case of the situation of justice minister by whom it is proposed that the several judges be located will appear from the reasons which apply to the situation of the judges themselves instructional ratiocinative art   iii why not in the hands of the executive chief answer reasons   for a reason similar to the second of the reasons applying as above to the situation of the constitutive not with any such intensity can the attention of the executive chief—a person whose will is not the will to which it appertains to the functionary in question to give execution and effect—be expected to apply to the choice of the person by whom such execution and effect is to be given to the will of the legislature as that with which the legislature itself may naturally be expected to apply itself to that same subject   so great is the aggregate quantity of power proposed to be placed in the hands of the executive chief by that which is proposed to be given to him in relation to the several other departments of the executive that unless some special and preponderant reasons were afforded for the attaching to the office this power—considered in itself the mere consideration of the danger from excess of power in the same hands would suffice to indicate in preference hands any other than those of the executive chief   in pursuit of a conjunct sinister interest possessed by them in common the two functionaries—the executive chief and his supposed nominee the justice minister—might concur in the commission of depredation or oppression in other shapes to the prejudice of the people in an immediate way or in an unimmediate   0 way by opposition and obstruction instead of obsequiousness to the declared will of the immediate creatures of the constitutive body—the legislature instructional ratiocinative art   question why not render the justice minister dislocable by the executive chief as the several other ministers are answer reasons   because to the effectual performance of the functions belonging to the justice minister no such promptitude and exactness of obedience and complete mutuality of adjustment is necessary as in the case of the greater part of the whole number of the departments belonging to these other ministers namely the army minister the navy minister the preventive service minister the interior communication minister and the finance minister   the functions of the justice minister consisting in the watching over the several judicial functionaries to see that they do what depends upon them towards securing execution and effect to the ordinances issued and arrangements made by the legislature it will be more effectual to that purpose if in case of inaptitude the remedy by dislocation be immediately in the hands of the persons whose will is thwarted by it than in the hands of another although subordinate to and dislocable by themselves   the functions of the justice minister consisting chiefly of location and eventual dislocation no decided judgment can so easily be passed by a superordinate without particular and minute judicial inquiry as in the case of the functions belonging to the other ministers section xii dislocable how enactive expositive art   in like manner as the prime minister the justice minister is dislocable by that authority namely the legislative for the giving execution and effect to whose will he has been located enactive art   other efficient causes of dislocatedness are the same as in the case of the members of the legislature as per ch vi section  0 dislocable how and in the case of the prime minister as per ch viii section   dislocable how section xiii securities for appropriate aptitude enactive instructional art   in the case of the justice minister securities for appropriate aptitude antecedential down to the time of his location as such are the several securities—antecedential concomitant and ultimate—that have been applying to him in his anterior situation of judge immediate and judge appellate enactive instructional art   securities concomitant relative to connexions in this particular case the securities which have place in the case of judges immediate and appellate have no application instructional ratiocinative art   but in respect of the justice ministers locative function the securities against corruption which apply to the several situations with reference to which he possesses the locative power are it is hoped abundantly sufficient the only function which presents itself as being in any degree open to abuse by corruption in any shape is the judicative for the exercise of this function the occasion will naturally be extremely rare still more rare accordingly the abuse of it having corruption for its cause enactive instructional art   securities ultimately applying are—   dislocability by the constitutive authority as in the case of a member of the legislature the prime minister and every minister as per ch v constitutive section   powers   so by the legislature spontaneously   so by the legislature on denunciation by the prime minister   so by the legislature on denunciation by any sublegislature   punibility at the hands of the legislature procedure the same as in the case of a member of the legislature as per ch vi section    legislation penal judicatory instructional art   of all persons in whose instance the power can be conjoined with the interest and consequent desire to offer to the justice minister the matter of corruption in any attractive shape the only one is the prime minister—the head of the administrative department and in it of the financial subdepartment and locator general in respect of the high situations thereto belonging in comparison of this source corruption from all other sources seems highly improbable instructional ratiocinative art   between these two highest functionaries to impossibilize all intercourse were it desirable would not be possible no nor yet to impossibilize all such corruptive intercourse not so the throwing in the way of it such difficulties as to render it if not altogether unexampled extremely rare for this purpose the most promising remedy is composed of two arrangements one is the maximizing the distance between the two high functionaries     in question the other is as often as between them any personal intercourse has place the maximizing the notoriety of it it may be asked how by mere notification or though it were the complete prevention of personal and immediate intercourse can corruptive intercourse be prevented when intercourse by writing remains open and through intermediate agents personal intercourse the answer is—completely prevented certainly not but in case of delinquency in both of those ways evidence having place danger of detection and punishment is thus applied to it instructional art   as to the distance—in the case of the administrative department between the highest superordinates on the one hand and highest subordinates on the other it cannot be too small on the other hand in the case of the administrative department and the judiciary department taken together between the residences of the two chiefs of these two departments for the purpose of diminishing the frequency of intercourse the distance cannot be too great so as both residences are included within the limits of the metropolis—the place of common resort of all sorts of persons for all sorts of purposes these two remedies in so far as they go are both of them unexpensive and simple—simple and free not only from preponderant evil but from all evil in any shape in the case of distance an obstacle opposed to the apprehended intercourse is of the physical class and as far as they go physical obstacles are capable of being rendered altogether insurmountable not so moral obstacles in any case as to expense two residences will not cost any more if built at the greatest than if at the smallest distance instructional art   so much as to the unfrequency of the supposed dangerous intercourse now as to notoriety namely for the purpose of drawing upon it the watchful and tutelary eye—the antiseptic influence—of the publicopinion tribunal an institution which presents itself for the purpose is this—attach to each of these great functionaries a small one—a trumpeter with his trumpet and let the trumpet with its sound accompany the great functionary to every place without the limit of his own residence to the individual the distinction conferred will operate in compensation for the suspicion manifested and as to the suspicion the imputation it being cast—not by any one on another but by the law on all on no one can it sit heavy unless in his instance there be more or less ground for it instructional ratiocinative art   in the case of the administrative department the necessity of constant and thence at the pleasure of the several functionaries of familiar and confidential intercourse has been seen the necessity and at the same time the innoxiousness widely different is the case as between the chief of the administrative department and the chief of the judiciary the danger here is lest with or without intending it each or either should exercise on the other a corruptive influence by the consideration of those good things by the disposal of which each has it in his power to benefit the connexions of the other under the influence of such a system of securities as that which has been already seen whatsoever may be on both parts the disposition the particular facts necessary to the giving further effect to a sinister interest on the part of each could not it is believed be easily made known without frequent and secret intercourse under a monarchy yes for there in the hands of the monarch at whose completely arbitrary and uncontrolled disposal is the aggregate of all objects of general desire what the head of the judiciary sees is—that in the case of obsequiousness to the will of the monarch almost anything which it happens to him to wish for may drop into his lap and in case of resistance nothing and thus in that case of no explanation is there any need but wide is the difference in the present case instructional ratiocinative art  0 the opinion and endeavour of the framers and adapters of the institution being thus declared will afford a sufficient if not a complete protection against odium to all such persons as may feel disposed on the several occasions to contribute to the giving execution and effect to it acting thus as spies says the constitution to them you act as the greatesthappiness principle calls upon you to act by calling you spies a functionary whose endeavour it is to betray his trust will neither make his own conduct the better nor yours the worse true it is that the trumpet which accompanies the one head functionary in his visits to the other cannot accompany his intimates of all sorts in any visits of theirs to any intimates of the other those of the formal sort more particularly but by this means though between principal and principal sinister intercourse cannot be absolutely prevented it may in no inconsiderable degree be obstructed and rarified for between no two individuals for any sinister purpose can any intercourse through the medium of any third person have place without their putting each of them himself as well as the other to a correspondent degree in the power of that same object of mutual and sinister confidence and under a constitution such as this present one scarcely can any one sinister benefit or any number of sinister benefits be found for the hope or receipt of which a functionary in either of those highsituations     would be likely to place himself in a situation thus perilous instructional ratiocinative art    as on the one hand to the functionary the factitious dignity may operate as compensation for the thus publicly manifested suspicion so to the people and their constitution the security thus afforded may operate in compensation for the evil which has for its instrument this same factitious dignity where as under a monarchy or an aristocracy the factitious dignity is so much pure evil—evil without a particle of benefit—every one is used to it and therefore no one objects to it where as here it is at any rate not altogether unattended with compensation more or less efficient no one is used to it and therefore many a one may condemn it upon the whole not only the probability of its being accepted but in case of its being accepted the balance on the side of utility will be in no small degree dependent upon the circumstances of place and time instructional exemplificational art    in england when on circuit the pair of judges make their entry into a county town they are attended by the sheriff of the county and one or two trumpeters blowing their trumpets if right there when of no use can it be wrong when as here it promises to be of special and important use section xiv inaugural declaration enactive art   the justice minister will pronounce an appropriate inaugural declaration in the legislative chamber on his entrance into office this declaration will be kept in view whenever he sits in the exercise of his judicative function as per section   expositive art   for the form of an appropriate inaugural declaration see ch xii judiciary collectively section    judges c inaugural declaration chapter xxv local headmen preliminary observations for giving effect to the will of government in all its several main branches—legislative administrative judicial sublegislative not forgetting the constitutive authority which as per ch iv is superordinate to the government itself—one set of functionaries remains still wanting functionaries who with reference to every distinguishable species of political action shall at all times be as near as possible to the spot functionaries of this description are those who under the name of local headmen are here instituted to these functionaries the name of headmen is given because with the exception of such functionaries superordinate to them in the scale of office as may happen to have their residence permanent or transient within their territories they are in such their territories superior in authority to all other persons and as such have for certain purposes specified the command over them local is the limitative adjunct added because though in the logical field their authority is individually more extensive than that of any other single functionary except the prime minister in the geographical field it is narrower than that of any of their superordinates in this part of its extent it is indeed a minimum this considered unless the number of these situations is so great that the complication produced by it were productive of an inconvenience worth taking into the account the only limit which can apply to the number of these seats of authority will be that which is set by the expense suppose the expense out of the question it would be difficult to say at what mark the number of them could be too great there will be persons and things needing the occasional exercise of the powers of government in all places in considerable numbers functionaries belonging to the several departments and subdepartments at any rate comparatively few and not to speak of complication so the business be but equally well done the fewer the better but the fewer the more distant will be their stations from those spots whichever they be from which they are at the greatest distance thereupon comes this inconvenience the greater the distance     between the functionary and the spot which in each instance is within the local field of his operations the heavier the burthen of delay and expense by which they will be impeded at the same time supposing every diminution effected of the local field of each which the good of the service can require and thence every augmentation of the number—one consideration there is which may suffice to prevent the number requisite from being so inordinate as at first sight might be apprehended this is that the greater the number of the situations the less will be the quantity of the business requisite to be assigned to each the less the quantity belonging to each department and subdepartment and thence the greater the number of the departments and subdepartments of the business of which a share may without overloading be allotted to this office of the several sorts of business which on this occasion presented themselves as capable of being without preponderant inconvenience allotted to the sort of functionary thus denominated the legislator will now see before him the list the points which seemed to call for the exercise of his judgment were in the first place whether there were any which it was not matter of necessity to consign to somebody in the next place whether in any one of the situations hereinafter brought to view there was a functionary to whom with greater prospect of aptitude and convenience the several functions in question could in the spots in question have respectively been intrusted in the french system the sort of functionary whose logical field of authority is most diversified and at the same time his local field narrowest is styled maire maire from the latin major whence also the english mayor but if to a functionary to whom are confided the functions that will presently be seen a name were given to which a set of ideas comparatively so narrow stands associated a continually recurring train of misconceptions would be the result as to the english system no functionary under this name does it present in any spot within the territory except here and there one among those which several centuries ago were covered with buildings but if for purposes such as those in question for a comparatively small aggregate of spots which are covered with buildings a constantly resident functionary is necessary still greater will be the need of him in the other inhabited portions of the territory say in a word everywhere else for where the population is dense much less difficulty and delay will the ordinances of the superordinate functionaries in the several departments and subdepartments be exposed to in respect of execution than when it is thin in a word the facility will be as the density the difficulty as the thinness moreover to the office of the functionary called mayor there are in the english chaos about as many different sets of functions attached as there are towns in which a functionary of this denomination is to be found there are—that is to say if marked out and fixed by really existing law there would be but almost universally this part of the field of legislation has no other covering than what is composed of a groundwork of imaginary with here and there perhaps a patch of real that is to say statute law this portion of the field along with others to so vast an extent being left in the state of debateable land for the benefit of corruptionists in the shape of boroughmongers and lawyers under the english dream of a constitution—under the english actual form of government—in this as in every other part of the field of legislation the duration of the reign of chaos is destined to be maximized the duration of chaos and to that end the darkness of the den of cacus as to the several ends of government—that which in the situation here delineated they have been thought to require may be seen in the list of the functions which here follows section i fields of service enactive expositive art   by a local headman understand a functionary who—in each one of the smallest portions of territory called bissubdistricts or trissubdistricts into which by any allembracing process of division and subdivision the territory of the state is divided—is of all public functionaries whose authority is confined within the limit of that same portion of territory the head enactive art   of the authority of each local headman the local field is accordingly the bissubdistrict or trissubdistrict for and in which he serves enactive art   of the authority of each local headman the logical field will have been marked out by the several functions allotted to him by competent authority that is to say by the legislature or subject to its authority by the sublegislature within the territory—or say local field of which his local field of service is situated instructional ratiocinative art   of the authority of this office the eventual logical field is coextensive with the whole field of legislation in the aggregate body of these offices the legislature possesses a set of subordinate functionaries to any of whom as occasion calls may be committed to be performed within their several bissubdistricts any function the exercise     of which could not by reason of local distance from the seat of authority be so aptly performed by their respective superordinates—namely the functionaries presiding over the several departments and subdepartments of the administration instructional ratiocinative art   of this ultimate link in the chain of territorial division the object is to minimize the inconvenience resulting from the length and difficulty of the course which the individual may have to take ere he can reach the functionary and the functionary ere he can reach the persons or the things on which he has to operate the degree of facility as to means of communication being given this inconvenience will be inversely as the multitude of these portions of territory—their inequality as compared with one another—the nearness of their approach to the figure of a square—and the nearness of the abode of the functionary to the centre of the square section ii selfsuppletive function enactive art   to a local headman as to a minister belongs the selfsuppletive function together with the obligation of keeping it in exercise enactive art   accordingly for the carrying on the business without interruption immediately on being located the principal provides a written instrument whereby some person at his choice is constituted his depute permanent the instrument marked with the year month and day of the month is signed by the principal

the functionary is punitionally as well as satisfactionally and dislocationally responsible by acceptance of the situation he contracts for the apt and sufficient performance of the duties attached to it enactive art   locable in the situation of local headmans depute permanent are all those and those only who are so in that of local headman principal as per section    locable who enactive art   dislocable at any time is the local headman depute by the principal as likewise by any of the authorities by which the principal is dislocable section iii generalassistance function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function at the call of the prime minister or of any one of the ministers or of the judge of any immediate judicatory the local headman does within his territory what depends on him towards giving execution and effect to all ordinances mandates or orders in relation to which in conformity to the will of the legislature it may happen to them to regard the business of their respective departments and subdepartments as standing in need of such his assistance and this whether for the purpose of securing execution and effect or for the purpose of minimizing the amount of delay vexation and expense i legislatureaiding functions section iv presidential function expositive enactive art   in the exercise of this function at all meetings of the inhabitants of his territory held for the exercise of any public function—the local headman takes the chair of course and subject to the authority of the majority present conducts the proceedings enactive instructional art   but to no such meeting is his presence     either in person or by deputy in such sort essential as to render invalid any proceedings at which a majority of the persons entitled to vote are present they are free if they think fit to elect any other person president section v convocative function expositive enactive art   in the exercise of this function the local headman convokes the inhabitants of his territory as occasion calls to meet together for public purposes enactive instructional art   what number of persons joining in a requisition for this purpose shall on each occasion be sufficient to authorize the exercise of this function—and what number sufficient to render it obligatory—are points of local and temporary consideration which under the direction of the legislature will be settled by the sublegislature of the district in which the local headmans territory is comprised ii administrationaiding functions section vi stipendiary armycontrolling function expositive enactive art   in the exercise of this function he takes cognizance of the exercise given to all such powers to which under ch x defensive force section    powers of military as to nonmilitary it happens to be exercised by any stipendiary army functionary on the ground of military necessity enactive art   for this purpose subject to the control of the immediate judicatory he has on every occasion under his command the whole of the radical military force stationed within his territory land service and water service if any included enactive instructional art   in ch x defensive force section    the principle has been advanced stating the inaptitude of all inflexible prohibitive bars to the abuse of military power and the consequent necessity of making the most of such bars as it is of the nature of the publicopinion tribunal to oppose to wit by maximizing and perpetuating the notoriety of whatsoever exercise is given to the stipendiary force on the ground of necessity in the political situation here established may be seen the particular means of execution employable for giving application and effect to this principle in every bissubdistrict the military functionary will find a nonmilitary functionary capable of taking and under the obligation of taking cognizance of the exercise given to the extraordinary military power and this nonmilitary functionary established in the command of such a force—the radical force of the bissubdistrict—as will be sufficient to overpower any force that can be under the command of a stipendiary officer whose rank is not elevated by some grades above the lowest on an occasion of this sort whatsoever is done by the stipendiary functionary the local headman inspects and keeps within bounds and the local registrar records it the smaller the territory the nearer at hand on every such occasion will the headman of it be in no part of the territory can a military commander set a foot without being in

obvious be so frequently presented by the sea as by the land branch of the service but how remote soever it may be from the nearest part of the sea scarcely can there be a bissubdistrict in which a demand for the exercise of it may not have place suppose for example a navy officer with a portion of his crew traversing the country in pursuit of a deserter or a body of deserters from that branch of the service and knowing or suspecting that the object of their search has taken refuge in a certain house entry being refused shall they by law have power to employ force for the obtainment of it

taken place in his territory call it in this case his riotquelling function expositive art   by a riot understand any course of operation in which persons two or more with or without concert act in the continuous exercise of physical violence on persons or things one or more or in producing annoyance to the neighbourhood by noise or threatening language or deportment enactive instructional art   for the purposes in this section mentioned he has under his command the whole of the radical military force belonging to his territory and on each occasion employs such part as in his judgment is in quality best adapted to the purpose and in quantity sufficient without being superfluous enactive art   when once begun in his territory the exercise of the sedative function may be continued by him in any of the contiguous and so in any ulterior local headmans territory until the riot has ceased enactive art   on whatsoever occasion the sedative function ordinarily or extraordinarily is has been or continues to be exercised the headman will by the earliest opportunity transmit to the immediate judicatory notice thereof also then or thereafter an exemplar of the record of whatever passed likewise all such persons and things if any as he has caused to be prehended section xii justiceaiding function expositive enactive art   in the exercise of this function the local headman gives aid to justice in the cases following—   where from the judge of his territory he receives order so to do   where on information from any other person it appears to him that such aid is needed or may be of preponderant use   where upon observation made by himself of the matter of fact in question it appears to him that such aid is needed or as above may be of use expositive art   by giving aid to justice understand the contributing to give execution and effect to some decree or mandate which has been or as appears to him would have been issued by the judge had the circumstances of the case been known to him section xiii uncommissioned prehensionapproving function expositive enactive art   in case of an act of prehension exercised on a person or a thing by command or allowance of law on the ground of necessity by an individual not specially commissioned for the stoppage or prevention of a criminal offence or for the placing the offender or supposed offender under the physical power of the judge—the prehender if no functionary belonging to the judicial or preventive service be nearer at hand will if the service admits repair to the local headman of the territory and give him information respecting the facts and circumstances the headman will thereupon either leave the individual or other subject matter prehended in charge of the prehender or take charge thereof in conjunction with him or without him as the law in that behalf shall have directed enactive instructional art   at the request of the prehender the headman may moreover if he thinks fit deliver to him an instrument containing his approval of the prehenders proceedings in so far as by such evidence as hath come before him he is enabled to judge name of the instrument     local headmans provisional prehensionapproving certificate effects and use of this certificate—in case of suit brought against the prehender on the ground of such his proceedings this certificate may be adduced by him in the character of justificative evidence subject to overbalancement by counter interrogation or counter evidence expositive instructional ratiocinative art   this function and the two preceding ones are obviously very near of kin to one another in the nature of the occasion on which it may happen to them to be called into exercise lies almost the only difference to the sedative function it will be a chance or casual commotion produced by an occurrence capable of happening every day in every year but which from hundred years to hundred years may never happen in the case of the justiceaiding function an order from the judge will naturally in the case of the individual obligation be an efficient cause but unless the duty together with the power were extended to those cases in which an individual order from the judge was by the nature of the case impossibilized the provision made for the support of justice would manifestly be lame and insufficient in the case of the uncommissioned prehensionapproving function the efficient cause is an application made by an individual who time not admitting of its being made to the judge for an individual authorization takes upon him provisionally under the assurance of obtaining it as soon as time admits to act in aid of justice in pursuance of the general authority supposed to have been given by the law instructional exemplificational art   in english practice a man who sees another committing a felony may apprehend him and carry him before a justice of the peace but a felony what is it all it signifies and that but ambiguously is the punishment not the offence true it is that under this denomination some of the most mischievous of crimes such as murder housebreaking by night and highway robbery would by most men probably be regarded as included but between depredations felonious and depredations unfelonious endless and generally uncognoscible are the distinctions instructional exemplificational art   suppose however a person by whom the necessary knowledge is possessed and the occasion having place suppose the act of prehension to have place in consequence what is to be done with the supposed felon within reachable distance perhaps there is no justice of the peace or he is out of the way or he chooses not to act if there should be anything else which it would be more amusing or more agreeable to him to do for performance of functions is not really obligatory in the case of these functionaries with them it is all power and no obligation instructional exemplificational art   under this code the headman if applied to would not dare to make sport of law and justice that day or the next the complainant would repair to the immediate judicatory the delinquent would be called before it and obliged to make compensation for loss of time or any other injury that had resulted from his neglect in england for any such complaint a complainant would have to pay near a £ 00 in costs for the attempt before trial and would assuredly obtain no redress neither would any punishment be inflicted on the delinquent but on proof of corruption as if without it no mischievous misconduct could have place but then gentlemen who serve their king and country in this capacity for nothing are not to be harassed by frivolous accusations section xiv judiciary powercontrolling function enactive instructional art   in the exercise of this function—if by any interessee on his responsibility in case of groundless or wanton application information has been given to the local headman of the territory of any physical act of judicial power exercised on any person or thing for the purpose real or pretended of giving execution and effect to any decree of the judge—in such case if for stoppage or prevention of any abuse made of the power so exercised or about to be exercised his attendance on the spot is applied for he will if he sees need or preponderant use attend accordingly to wit in person or if unable in person by depute enactive expositive art   of such attendance the object will be—not the frustrating in any way any intention of the judge but merely the furnishing upon occasion the most trustworthy evidence of it if however it appears to him that by any subordinate of the judge on pretence or under the belief of giving effect obstruction is really opposed to the will of the superordinate he will on his responsibility take such course as the circumstances of the case appear to him to require for giving effect to it giving always by the earliest opportunity information thereof to the judge expositive art   of the physical acts of judiciary power thus liable to need control examples are as follows—   prehension and consequent detention or transmission exercised on a person   prehension and consequent detention or transmission exercised on a thing moveable       prehension and detention of a thing immoveable   search made whether on land or in a

execution and effect to a judicial decree a mass of property is to be sold—the local headman of the territory is the functionary to whom exceptions excepted the function of effecting the sale and

deemed needful will be among the cares of the legislature and the sublegislature in the adjustment of the details of the nonpenal penal and procedure codes instructional art   whether it be by selection or by auction the moral aptitude of the functionary will on these occasions stand frequently exposed to formidable temptation to preserve it inviolate will be among the special cares of the superordinate authorities instructional art   the source of temptation is—by sale at undervalue profit to the directing functionary or what comes to the same thing a person connected with him by some special tie of interest selfregarding or sympathetic profit to wit by the difference between the actual price received and the price which but for the sinister design in question would or might have been received enactive instructional art   preventives and preservatives as in other cases of temptation so in this—responsibility satisfactional punitional and dislocational and for execution and effect publicity throughout the whole of the process maximized to this publicity the sole limit should be that which may be found set by the conjunct consideration of delay vexation and expense section xvii communicationaiding function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function according to such means as shall by law have been placed at his disposal—the local headman   0 affords the requisite supply to any such deficiency as the service of any administration subdepartment may at any time chance to labour under in respect of the means of communication between place and place as to these see ch xi ministers severally section   interior communication minister section xviii beneficentmediation function enactive art   in the exercise of this function—for prevention of litigation on application made to him the local headman in so far as he sees good will apply his good offices to the reconciliation of family differences within his territory enactive art   for the nonexercise of this function he is not compensationally punitionally or dislocationally responsible only for any abuse committed of the trust thus reposed in him—for his reward he will have the love respect and selfsatisfaction which will be the natural fruits of the kind and meritorious exercise of it expositive art   of family differences or say disagreements examples are as follows—   differences between husband and wife   differences between parent and child   differences between brother and brother sister and sister or brother and sister inhabiting the same house and without a common parent   differences between any two other near relatives inhabiting the same household especially if without the near vicinity of any common superordinate in the order of genealogy   differences between employer and helper in any business especially if inhabiting the same household enactive instructional art   the application made to him may be made by either party separately or as the case may be by both conjunctly if conjunctly so much the better instructional art   in the case of husband and wife and in other cases where the parties are of different sexes he will do well to call in as his assistant a person of the female sex wife or widow and past the age of childbearing instructional art   where both or all parties are of the female sex at the desire of any one he may do well to call in or refer them from himself to some person of the female sex circumstanced as per art   instructional art   at the desire of any party if he sees reason he will call in the registrar but the registrar is not obligationally responsible in case of noncompliance instructional art   at the desire of any party unless he sees special reason to the contrary he will render the hearing secret for causes of secrecy see ch xii judiciary collectively section    publicity c and procedure code ch viii judicial application section    proceedings when secret instructional art   if he sees reason he will inform the parties what in the case before him will in his opinion be likely to be eventually done by the judge instructional enactive art  0 for any of the above purposes on application made by any inhabitant of his territory he may call in any other inhabitant thereof to a mutual attendance a person so called in is not obligationally responsible for noncompliance but at the instance of the headman the registrar will make entry of such noncompliance and at any time after commencement of a suit between the parties at the desire of the applicant send certificate thereof to the judicatory instructional ratiocinative art    of the sort of incompletelyempowered judicatory called a conciliation court invented in denmark and in principle applied in some measure in buonapartes and other codes the principle has thus received a proportionably extensive approbation not that under the here proposed system suppose it in any considerable degree to answer its intended purposes there can be near so great a demand for a judicatory of this sort as under the system in which it originated or even under any in which it has been employed on the other hand the extent given to the principle being maximized cannot but be much greater than in any of those other systems for in the enormous amount of the mass of factitious delay expense and vexation created or left and confirmed by those codes is to be found the sole warrant for the institution of a judicatory unprovided with the power of giving execution to its own decrees as to this matter see ch xv section   referees deputable instructional ratiocinative art    as to danger of abuse—notwithstanding any supposeable deficiency of trustworthiness in the situation of the functionary here in question as compared with that of the judge immediate—little ground of apprehension will it is believed be found no coercive     power is in this case given nor yet as in the case of the danish conciliation courts are parties compelled to betake themselves to this uncoercive judicatory in their way to the coercive one power of compelling compensation not being in this case given to the functionary the influence of any such opinion as he may see reason to declare will in each individual instance be correspondent to the conception entertained by the parties as to his appropriate aptitude and as the aggregate mass of useful information in the territory in question increases this aptitude will naturally receive correspondent increase instructional ratiocinative art    note that in this case as to every assertion by whomsoever on this occasion made the same securities against falsehood must be given as in any other case else as in english practice the omission of those securities will operate as a license to and a bounty upon mendacity but no imperative power either for compelling the appearance of persons or things in the character of sources of evidence—or for compelling responsion for the purpose of evidence at the hands either of strangers or of parties—must be conferred for if yes the power would be—not this comparatively slight and limited power but in so far as regards evidence the ordinary and complete power of judicature section xix beneficentinformation function enactive instructional art   in the exercise of this function on application made to him the local headman affords useful information and advice on various occasions to the otherwise helpless in so far as the means in his power extend and his employable time admits instructional expositive art   of these occasions examples are as follows—   for subsistence the applicant has need of employment and though able to perform work knows not where or how to obtain it if unable his case belongs to the indigence relief ministers subdepartment as per ch xi section     from the estate of a person lately deceased or become insolvent in a distant bissubdistrict or in a foreign country money is believed by the applicant to be due to him for example on the ground of natural relationship or debt his wish is to know by what means if any he may take the best adapted course for the obtaining of it   on an account to which he was not privy by the decease of a relative money is become due to him from government and his wish is to know in what manner to make application and proof section xx travellingdisputessettling function enactive art   in the exercise of this function in subordination to the immediate judicatory with the advice and assistance of his registrar the local headman employs his endeavours in settling travelling disputes thereby in so far as on him depends giving execution and effect to the travellers subcode expositive art   of travelling disputes examples are the following—   disputes between a traveller and a conductor of a public vehicle respecting the quantum to be paid   so respecting loss of or damage to travellers effects   so respecting damage alleged by the conductor to have been done to the vehicle or the effects therein or the beasts of draught by a passenger   the like as between a traveller and an innkeeper   disputes respecting the accommodation afforded in the vehicle or the inn as between traveller and traveller ratiocinative art   question of the here assumed demand for a particular subcode bearing relation to and denominated from persons thus occupied what is the efficient cause answer   the extreme need of the maximum of promptitude in respect of whatsoever remedy is desired to be applied to the evils to which this occupation is liable to give birth of this remedy the principal if not sole peculiarity will be—the nature of the judicatory to which the power of making application of it shall be allotted for—the persons who are they who in this instance require to be taken for subjects of the regulation they are persons of all classes without exception and so in regard to the wrongs which on this occasion may require to be repressed and the correspondent rights which may thus require to be carried into effect not that as to wrongs and rights the classes that may require provision are in fact so absolutely boundless as in regard to persons still however to the purpose of provision by regulation they may without practical error be regarded as such ratiocinative art     this circumstance it is that brings the case within the field of the constitutional code confine the application of the remedy in the first instance to the ordinary judicatories the distance between the scene of dispute and the seat of judicature considered     the remedy would in most cases remain unapplied or if applied be more afflictive than the disorder unless on an occasion of this sort the power of stopping the traveller be allowed to persons exposed to suffer wrongs at his hands the power of doing wrong in all manner of shapes is given to every individual who on the spot in question is personally unknown and over the whole of the globe a comparatively small portion excepted in this case are all individuals whatsoever ratiocinative art   yet if you do grant this power to the several classes of persons by whom the protection in question is needed say in particular innkeepers and conductors of vehicles you put into their hands the faculty of practising extortion and oppression at the charge of an unbounded multitude who in no small proportion will be in a helpless state ratiocinative art   such is the dilemma what then is the option which it leaves answer either to leave the wrongs in question without remedy or to give the application of the remedy to a judicatory much nearer at hand than in general will be the ordinary judicatory to give it in a word to a judicatory of which the local headman with or without the assistance of his registrar is constituted judge for no other course so unexceptionable can the nature of the case admit of no other judicatory does the present code afford no judicatory which can so effectually meet the evil can any code afford yet even thus against the traveller no remedy can be endeavoured to be applied but evil to the magnitude of which scarcely can any limits be assigned is liable to be produced a man whose preservation from ruin depends upon his meeting with a certain person or having under his eye a certain aggregate of things or on his arrival at a certain place within a certain time is consigned to ruin if by the means in question or any others he is prevented from arriving at the place in question within that time to exclude this species of evil is therefore impossible all that can be done is to minimize the amount of it exemplificational ratiocinative art   under existing systems not only inadequate in the extreme but teeming with inconsistency is the provision made against evil in this shape by a person travelling suppose in a carriage in which he is passenger damage to a certain amount is done to the carriage to the cattle or to the inn at which he stops from the damage done suppose him to obtain or seek profit as where the thing in question is stolen by him or endeavoured to be stolen what in this case is the consequence he is liable to be taken before the ordinary judicatory whatever be the distance there to receive a punishment the amount of which is screwed up without scruple to a degree little short of the highest suppose the thing on the other hand not merely as above transferred from one person to another but destroyed and thus lost to everybody in this case be the wrong ever so great whatsoever be his responsibility as declared by the law if his person is unknown or he chooses rather to go out of than stay within reach of the power of the judge such declared is not accompanied by any actual responsibility only to what is called a civil suit does he stand exposed and by that he is left at full liberty to make his escape yet to the loser of the thing how is the loss of it rendered the lighter by its being destroyed better it would be for him that it were stolen for then would he have a chance more or less considerable of getting it back again whereas no such chance has he if it be destroyed true it is that in respect of the demand for punishment there may be a difference between the two cases but in respect of the demand for compensation there can be none instructional ratiocinative art   of any remedy of which the legislature may feel disposed to make the local headman the instrument the efficiency will naturally depend upon the degree of confidence which it may regard itself as warranted in reposing in this functionary to every or any person regarding himself as injured in any of these ways shall the power of prehending the supposed wrongdoer and adducing him before the local headman be given if yes what shall be the function exercised on the occasion by this functionary the opinative only or in addition to it the sole surely effectual function the imperative then as to the registrar having in this case as in others cognizance of whatsoever the headman does or endeavours to do—may it not be advisable in consideration of his longer experience and probable superiority in respect of appropriate intellectual aptitude to confer on him in this case with relation to the imperative decree of the headman an effectual negative or in case of the headmans refusing or purposely declining to act the imperative function itself instructional ratiocinative art   note that on this occasion the less the confidence reposed by the legislature in these chosen and effectually responsible functionaries watched as they will be by the section of the publicopinion tribunal by which they will be environed—the greater is the confidence it will thereby repose in persons of all descriptions of whom collectively nothing is known except that as individuals they are unknown nor let it be forgotten that to the here supposed as to any other judicatory no proposed pursuer can adduce a proposed defendant without at the same time adducing     himself and thus subjecting himself to whatsoever penal and other burthensome consequences the law has attached to any such offence as on the occasion it may have happened to him to commit section xxi hospitable postobituary function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function in the case where within the local headmans territory a foreigner or other person dies or is found dead and no other person being within reach in whom the disposal of the body and the temporary disposal of the effects

section  0 to the local registrar the deceased being supposed a native or other resident inhabitant of the territory of the state there will in general be some individual in whom this trust may be and ought to be reposed but in the case here in question no such person has place the consequence is—that either the trust must devolve upon some public functionary or the disposal of the body and such effects as the deceased had in his possession will be abandoned to chance and depredation section xxii term of service enactive ratiocinative art   of each local headman the term of service is the

case of the headman as in the case of the member of the legislature and the member of a sublegislature it is desirable that he should not be stationary and though his power is entire and theirs but fractionary the reasons that applied to those two cases may be found applying in some measure to this instructional exemplificational art    for his natural mentor this comparatively inexperienced

purpose is capable of being served by registration in this shape is almost exclusively that of death the way in which this purpose is served is—by bringing to light the instances in which that result has had criminal or culpable conduct among its concurrent causes thus whether it had for its cause design or negligence giving publicity to the fact with its several material circumstances with a view to legal pursuit and by maximizing the probability of detection minimizing the frequency of the offence instructional art   vii indeterminate purposes in a period of the same length and among the same

therein mentioned he will forthwith transmit to the immediate judicatory an exemplar of the record of the inquiry as above of which such statement or suspicion is the result enactive instructional art   follow certain other functions subjudiciary exercisable by the registrar on the occasion of deaths reason impossibility of their being exercised by the judge in time for the eventually requisite ulterior judicial operations he will if in his judgment it be necessary issue and cause execute a prehension and transduction mandate for taking into custody every such suspected person and conveying him forthwith to the immediate judicatory together with every such thing as it may appear necessary or preponderantly useful in the character of sources of written or real evidence name of the function the prehensive enactive art   so where the deceased was found dead or in a dying state in a street road or any other open and public place—he will in like manner transmit information to the immediate judicatory although no such cause of suspicion at the charge of any person in particular shall have as yet appeared enactive art   the body he will in this case keep in his custody until there has been time for his receiving the directions of the judge in relation to it enactive instructional art  0 the fact of the death being established and recorded and the time for receiving directions from the judge as per art   having expired he will deliver the body to the known postobit trustee testamentary or vicetestamentary of the deceased or any person properly authorized by such trustee by a warrant authorizing him to dispose of the body by interment or in any such other mode as he may choose enactive instructional art    if the body be that of a person unknown or of a person for whom no such trustee has appeared nor to the belief of the registrar or the headman is likely to be found antecedently to the time at which by putrescence it will have been rendered a source of annoyance—he may place it at the disposal of a medical practitioner for the advancement of medical art and science in such case he will give the preference to any practitioner who     shall have attended the deceased at his last moments or who after the decease shall have been called in for the purpose of the inquiry into the cause and manner thereof as above enactive art    if no such practitioner be to be found the headman will dispose of the body in any such other manner as he shall think best and will make entry of such disposal upon the record enactive instructional art    if for the purpose of examination in the course of the inquiry as to the cause of death the registrar has deemed it necessary to prehend any person although not at the time suspected of having been contributory to the death and has accordingly caused him to be prehended he will take his examination accordingly enactive instructional art    in case of obstinate silence or evasive responsion or responsion believed or suspected to be wilfully false—he will cause convey him to the judicatory in like manner as a suspected person together with an exemplar of the record of the examination enactive instructional art    if in any case in this section mentioned the delay necessary to the transmission of an exemplar of the record would be attended with preponderant inconvenience—the registrar may for the present transmit a brief abstract or notice together with an intimation of the time at which the exemplar may be expected appropriate formularies will be found provided in the procedure code enactive instructional art    in the prehension mandate as per art   or    may be contained an authority in case of necessity to prehend the person in question in any adjacent local headmans territory or even in any other in the state but in this case it must be accompanied by a transcript of the record up to that time and contain a clause requiring the persons and things prehended to be forthwith delivered into the custody of the nearest immediate judge enactive instructional art    when in case of casualty as per art   the person though not actually dead appears to be in imminent danger of death the same powers may be exercised as are herein appointed to be exercised in case of actual death instructional art    by these two local functionaries—the headman and the registrar—are performed in conjunction the several kinds of service performed under english bredlaw by the keeper of the parish register and the coroner with his jury of the english system the extreme inadequacy is among the results of the inexperienced and barbarous ages in which it took its origin the coroners inquest though better than nothing would be palpably inadequate were it only for the distance to which this functionary has to go especially in the largest counties and the expense necessitated by two journeys the direction of this important function being left to the nonentity called common law the conduct of the coroner is altogether arbitrary and is determined on every occasion by whatever sinister interest happens to have place the notification too in this case is confined to deaths known or suspected to be violent section vi marriagerecordation function enactive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar causes recordation to be made as they occur of all marriages celebrated within his territory enactive art   so likewise of all divorces enactive art   with relation to the register book in which these occurrences are recorded he exercises the custoditive function instructional art   the business of marriage is subjected to difficulties and causes of complication which have not place in regard to deaths or births   parties two   families two   anterior residences frequently in different bissubdistricts   places of celebration different from the places of anterior abode of both or either care and regulation will also be requisite to obviate error by the registration of the same contract in different places and thus giving it the appearance of so many different contracts instructional art   as to the conditions the fulfilment of which shall be rendered necessary to the validity of this species of contract—or say causes of invalidation—they belong to the civil code exemplificational art   in england the entering into this   0 contract has been mixed up with religion and the performance of a religious ceremony by a priest is necessary to the validity of the contract for the performance of the ceremony too fees are exacted from all alike section vii birthrecordation function enactive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar causes recordation to be made of all births as they take place within his territory enactive instructional art   heads under which in the birthrecording register entries will be made are the following—   sex   fathers names as reported exceptions excepted   fathers age as reported   fathers occupation as reported   mothers names as reported exceptions excepted   house where born—description as per election code section  0 vol iii p       year month and day of the month and as near as can be guessed the hour as reported   persons if any present at the birth   person or persons by whom the report was brought to the office their names under the handwriting or signature of each respectively  0 year month day and hour at which the report is received    names given or if any proposed to be given to the child as reported instructional art   as to exceptions whether any and what shall have place will depend upon the state of the laws respecting sexual intercourse and its consequences instructional art   in regard to the statements here required the case of children born out of marriage or from an adulterous intercourse requires to be kept in view on this occasion two opposite evils present themselves on the one hand disgrace entailed upon the irreproachable offspring in addition to that suffered on the same account by both parents but in the vastly higher degree by the mother on the other hand for the hope of exemption judicial falsehood in intended effect tantamount to what under the existing swearing system is styled perjury instructional exemplificational art   in the exercise of this function also has religion been mixed up in england under the name of christening and fees of course exacted for the performance of it without the payment of these fees and declaration made of belief in certain religious opinions no individual is admitted to the benefit of this substitute for registration† thus with respect to the registration of deaths marriages and births of the seven distinguishable purposes mentioned in section   of none but the first is any care pretended to be taken by government much more apt is the footing on which this business stands in france neither into the registration of deaths marriages or births is what is called religion admitted to interfere the apt registration of these facts taken in the aggregate is there regarded as a work of prime necessity with reference to the purposes public as well as private mentioned in section   and the exaction of any fees for such registration is prohibited by law see the code civil de napoleon liv i tit ii ch ii iii iv section viii maturityrecordation function enactive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar records the day on which each person has arrived at the age of complete selfgovernment for which purpose he will elicit sufficiently probative evidence of the fact enactive art   so arrival at the several other ages if any at and not before which he or she is by law competent to the exercise of this or that particular right or power instructional art   examples are the following—   right of choosing a guardian   right of making a will or say a postobituary disposition   right of contracting marriage section ix insanityrecordation function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar records as soon as adequate evidence thereof has been elicited by him the existence of insanity in the instance of any person resident at the time within his territory expositive ratiocinative art   by insanity understand such infirmity     of mind as either for the sake of persons in general or for the sake of the person himself alone otherwise than on the account of nonage or criminality an effectual demand is produced for the subjecting of his body or his mind or both to restraint under the care of some person or persons by authority of law expositive ratiocinative art   in some cases only as a channel for conveying the information to the judge is the ministry of the registrar needed name of the function in this case the insanityinformative use and reason saving in respect of delay vexation and expense in the journeys of information in other cases the nature of them may require that by this functionary himself means of security should immediately be employed use and reason prevention of immediately impending mischief name of the function in this case the insanityobviative instructional art   for the marking the requisite distinction in practice between these two classes of cases as per art   the several modifications which in these respects the infirmity admits of require to be distinguished and brought to view expositive instructional art   insanity is either   primæval or   adventitious name when primæval in english idiotcy adventitious it is either   incidental or   superannuational incidental considered as to its effects may be distinguished into universallydangerous and purely selfdangerous selfdangerous insanity may as delinquency be so in respect of person property reputation or condition in life in respect of person by selfdestruction for example or irreparable selfdisfigurement selfdisablement or selfmutilation in respect of property by prodigality or improvident management in respect of reputation by indecorous selfexposure or selfdisgracing discourse in respect of condition in life by illassorted marriage by superannuational adventitious insanity understand that which is sometimes produced by old age expositive ratiocinative art   considered as to its effects insanity may be distinguished into   capricious   malicious   rabid and   melancholy where capricious malicious or rabid a necessary supplement to the recordation function may be that which is exercised by the operations having for their object the prevention of the impending mischief name of the function as above the insanityobviative reason for the institution of it length of the distance of the judiciary registrars office from the sources of the information thence danger of mischief before any preventive arrangements can be taken by the judge in the case of melancholy insanity the mischief is continual but special danger has no place enactive instructional art   in respect of time immediate and more or less urgent but short will be the demand for the exercise of the insanity obviating function by the local registrar in the cases of primæval superannuational and melancholy insanity after appropriate recordation made by him of the malady the charge of permanent guardianship will devolve upon some other persons nonfunctionary or functionary the indigencerelief minister for example according to directions given by the judge enactive instructional art   if from the information received it appears to the local registrar that the supposed insane person cannot without danger either to others or to him or herself be left in a state of personal liberty he will pronounce an appropriate provisional opinative decree and imperative order declaring under the charge of what persons he or she shall be placed in a state of temporary confinement and under what mode of confinement name of such person so appointed temporary insanity guardian name of the instrument insanity temporary guardianship order enactive instructional art   if in this case it appears to the registrar that the insane person has in possession or effectually at command pecuniary means adequate for the present to his maintenance the registrar will by appropriate decree and order authorize the guardian to receive and apply to that purpose such pecuniary means name of the instrument insanity temporary alimentative authorizing order enactive instructional art  0 if it appear to him that the supposed insane person has not in adequate quantity in possession or effectually at command such pecuniary means he will by appropriate decree and order give direction to some person or persons to advance from time to time to the temporary insanity guardian such requisite pecuniary means name of the person so charged the temporary insanity alimentator instructional art    permanent insanity guardian who permanent insanity alimentator who for answer to these questions see in the particular codes the insanity subcode instructional art    a question for the consideration of the legislature will be whether in any and in what cases and in what mode to put prodigality     upon a footing analogous to that of insanity for preservation of property from waste for individuals and families exemplificational art    under the english system where to a person possessed of adequate property insanity is imputed around him flock the lawyers like vultures round a carcase many are the years many the thousands of pounds frequently thus consumed thus is prodigality compulsory prodigality organized at the expense frequently to the ruin of the afflicted family organized by the power and for the profit of these pretended and selfconstituted guardians enactive art    disposed of by the local registrar are exemplars of the record as follows—   kept in the office one   transmitted to the immediate judicatory one   delivered to the temporary guardian one   delivered to the temporary alimentator one   transmitted to the prime minister one enactive art    of every case of restoration to sanity evidence thereof as expressed in an appropriate instrument being elicited and delivered to the local registrar of the territory in the register of which recordation had been made of the insanity recordation will be made name of the instrument restoredsanity certificate for the persons by whom such certificate will be granted and the conditions requisite to the grant of it see in the rightconferring or say nonpenal particular codes the insanity subcode as above section x postobitadministrationgranting function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function on the decease of a person leaving effects in his territory the local registrar receives application from any person stating himself or herself to be entitled to the administration of those same effects in the quality of postobit successionist or postobit trustee and if trustee whether as testamentary or as vicetestamentary trustee or say administrator to wit for the purpose of making disposal of them for the common benefit of all interessees whether as creditors legatees or kinsfolk the term postobit trustee includes the idea of trust and is therefore more expressive than the term executor the term postobit is already in use in english practice as in the instance of a postobit bond enactive instructional art   he thereupon according to the direction given in the rightconferring and procedure codes proceeds to inquire whether there be any person entitled and disposed to contest with such applicant the right to the possession and exercise of this trust if it be clear to him that there is not he accordingly by an appropriate instrument grants to the applicant the appropriate powers if it be clear to him that some such proposed contestator exists or if it be matter of doubt whether there does or not he refers all parties to the judge on the register he in every case makes entry of everything that has passed enactive art   exemplars of the record will on this occasion be disposed of as follows—   kept in the office one   of parties between whom the right is contested delivered to each one   to the registrar of the immediate judicatory one enactive instructional ratiocinative art   in case of need for preservation of the effects from depredation destruction and deterioration the registrar has power to take them under his care and so to keep them until time sufficient having elapsed the judge or under his direction the eleemosynary advocate in the exercise of his supertutelary function as per ch xx section   has taken them into his disposal use and reason the same as in the case of the local registrars insanityrecordation function as per section   and in the case of the local headman in virtue of his hospitable postobituary function as per ch xxv section    ratiocinative instructional art   possible indeed it is that in the instance of this as in the instance of any other functionary or any other individual trustee it may happen to the trust to be abused but in this possibility no adequate reason for withholding it from him can be deduced in regard to appropriate aptitude in the case of this functionary security the highest that the nature of the case admits of will have been provided moreover in his hands the duration of the trust and thence of the faculty of abuse is minimized if from a functionary for whose trustworthiness this security is given the exercise of it being also under the constant inspection of the headman the power is withholden it will remain in the hands of persons of all descriptions the most untrustworthy not excepted the security thus afforded by the care of a functionary who by reason of the smallness of his territory is nearer to the spot in question than any other can be is added not substituted to the greatest security afforded by the current practice     instructional exemplificational art   in the whole of england wales included there are but two offices at and from which the judiciary power in question can be obtained that belonging to the archiepiscopal province of canterbury and that belonging to the archiepiscopal province of york for the obtainment of the power in question £  is the minimum of the expense such is the expense if the place of the effects were next door to the office judge from hence what it may be at three hundred miles distance instructional exemplificational art   this being the case all persons interested in a mass of effects which after defraying the expense will not afford a surplus are without the benefit whatever it may be of the law which has or is supposed to have place in relation to the subject but in this case are the vast majority of the people to what extent injustice on this ground may have place no one can on any sufficient ground take upon him to say and in so far as justice has place the law of course gets the credit of it but the real cause is in the probity and good conduct of the people in spite of what by the license and encouragement thus held out the law does to render them dishonest instructional exemplificational art   the person to whom the disposal of the property is intrusted a person of whom casual exceptions excepted too few to be taken into account the functionary by whom it is granted has not any the smallest knowledge on the granting of the power makes a promise on oath to deliver in within a limited time say a year an inventory of these same effects when the time comes it has been delivered in—this same inventory—or not as it may happen but suppose it delivered in what claim has it to confidence to confidence on the part of persons interested what check is there upon it what security against falsehood and insufficiency preventive check not any reparative check yes to wit by litigation and at an expense such as in the case of the vast majority is sufficient to absorb not only the whole subject matter of the litigation but the whole property of all litigants on all sides instructional ratiocinative art   contrast this established with the here proposed state of things   the abode of the headman and his registrar not being so far distant from the most distant abode in his territory but that a person of adult age may with ease walk thither and back again in the course of a day every habitation with every inhabitant is known to him the arrangements made for the purpose of elections in the election code as per section  0 suffice to render it so   the time at which the inventory is given in may be fixed with joint regard to the quantity of the mass the quality of the ingredients and the facilities natural and acquired of the persons interested   the power of disposal being given to some one or some two in conjunction the power of inspection subject to such conditions as shall prevent obstruction to the disposal may be given to all persons interested   the comparison of the effects themselves with the account of them as given in the inventory will be as easy as possible   of the sale of such as to prevent deterioration or deperition it may be necessary should be forthwith sold the fairness will have as many guardians and guarantees as there are persons interested with the addition of their respective friends and neighbours   every arrangement whether of substantive or adjective law by which the disposal would be directed being determined by the ordinances of real law not as in england by imaginary and sham law every one would know what he has to expect every one would have in his hand an efficient check upon any act of such sinister design or carelessness in which without such check the functionary on whom it depended might otherwise be apt to indulge himself instructional art  0 true it is that supposing with the management of this functionary the headman of his territory or any party interested were dissatisfied recourse to the immediate judicatory of the subdistrict would be the only remedy here then would be litigation but in respect of vexation and expense what a contrast such litigation would make with that litigation which has place in the established english practice may be seen in the procedure code section xi propertytransferrecordation function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar in manner ordained by the legislature exercises the recordative function in relation to all instruments of conveyance or say propertyaffecting instruments to which by the legislature or subject to the authority of the legislature by the sublegislature of the territory exercise shall

purposes in this case over and     above the advantage attached to the giving to the transaction a determinate form by means of perpetually existing signs are—   securing the instrument against deperition   securing it against injurious alteration   securing individuals against loss by fabrication of a false instrument   to persons contemplating the giving credit to another on the supposition of his having at his disposal the mass of property in question affording security against its having been by antecedent obligations placed at the disposal of anterior creditors say security against prior encumbrance   to persons who might otherwise be disposed to contest the title of the proprietor to the interest in question in the mass of property in question rendering manifest the hopelessness of any such endeavour say security against disturbance   to persons disposed to purchase the mass of property in question or an interest therein affording security and the persuasion of security against all claims on the part of others on the ground of antecedent title on their part or on that of the proprietors want of legal power to make the disposition whatever it be

territory exercise shall have been ordained to be given to it in the bissubdistrict registry expositive instructional art   in addition to the first three securities mentioned in section    art   the grand use of committing this function in particular although it applies to a great extent to all the functions in general to so numerous a class of functionaries is the consequent diminution of the delay vexation and expense resulting from the shortness of the distance between the seat of the evidence and the abodes of the individuals having need to deposit it and thenceforward of those having need to inspect it instructional art   of contracts as of conveyances the exposition and relation belong to the nonpenal code for clearness correctness and comprehensiveness of conception not inconsiderable would be the use of a common appellative by which the import of both might be comprehended—say obligatory transactions a contract is a species of conveyance for by it are conveyed rights to the services whatever they are which by the contract a person stands bound to render what distinguishes a contract from a conveyance which is not a contract is that by the conveyance the sole services the right to which is necessarily conveyed are the negative services of persons at large as well as the conveyors to wit the service consisting in abstaining from all occupation of the article conveyed of these services which on the occasion of the conveyance the conveyor undertakes for the performance of the word covenant is the denomination so of those for which the conveyee binds himself for the performance these covenants are so many subsidiary contracts section xiii extrajudicialevidencerecordation function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function the local

shall have ordained or authorized him to receive to wit on the responsibility satisfactional and punitional in case of falsehood of him by whom it is delivered with or without power of receipt and extraction from persons other than him by whom the evidence is offered and the recordation thereof requested according as the legislature shall have ordained instructional ratiocinative art   in ch xii judiciary collectively section    noncontestationalevidenceelicitation function this is among the purposes for which power to elicit that is to say to receive and upon occasion extract such evidence is given to the judge by giving the same power to the registrar of every bissubdistrict the delay vexation and expense to individuals will be minimized and the time of the judiciary registrar so far disburthened instructional art   this seems moreover to belong in a more particular manner to the number of those cases in which—to prevent unprofitable consumption of functionarys time by frivolous wanton or illdesigning applications—it may be advisable that a small pecuniary compensation remissible in case of declared and credited indigence should be required to be exacted as a condition preliminary to the exercise of the function     section xiv subjudiciarytopographicevidencerecordation function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function the local registrar

messengers or say accersitors who expositive art   by a messenger understand a judiciary mandatebearer—a functionary to whose function exercise is given by causing knowledge to be had of a written mandate emaging from a judge and of the contents of such     instrument in so far as acquaintance thereof is obtained by actual contact with and physical possession of the instrument when delivered to the party addressed or in his stead to some other person for the purpose of its being delivered to him arrangements for that purpose will have been made in the procedure code expositive art   accersitor is an appellation coincident with but not altogether coextensive with messenger or mandatebearer accersition from the latin is in english hithercalling calling to the judgmentseat the individual addressed—calling him to it that is to say requiring him to repair to it will accordingly be the most frequently exemplified purpose of the judicial mandate but neither are other purposes wanting for which the issuing of a judicial mandate may be necessary correspondent to the modifications of or say the elementary functions included in the prehensive function as per ch xxviii judiciary prehensors section   will be those of the messenger enactive instructional art   in concert with the finance minister and the interior communication minister arrangements will be taken by the justice minister for causing all judicial mandates exceptions excepted to be delivered at the places to which and to the persons to whom addressed by the several and respective functionaries acting as lettercarriers under the direction of the interior communication minister for this purpose as by any person at large so by a letterpost functionary in particular a letter thus sent by or from a judge can with as much facility as if by or from any person at large be conveyed to the place and person addressed enactive art   in concert with the finance minister and the interior communication minister as above the justice minister will moreover take the necessary arrangements for causing all judicial mandates appearing on the face of them to be such and the responses thereto respectively to be delivered free of postage instructional art   on the part of an individual wishing to escape from the fulfilment of any obligation imposed on him by the law and endeavoured accordingly to be notified to him by the mandate of a judge a natural endeavour will of course be to escape from the receiving information as above of the existence of the corresponding judicial mandate towards which by the supposition he is not disposed to pay obedience so likewise when such information has been received by him to escape from the being known to have received it to check and obviate all such subterfuges is among the objects of endeavour of the procedure code as per ch x judicial communication enactive expositive art   judiciary messengers are either official or unofficial or say special or occasional official messengers are the letterpost carriers as per art   special or occasional are all persons employed as such by or under the authority of a judge chapter xxviii judiciary prehensors section i prehensors who expositive art   by prehensors understand a set of judiciary functionaries to whose functions exercise is given by prehension for whatsoever judicial purpose made of persons or things under and by virtue of corresponding mandates emaning from a judge expositive art   by prehension understand taking physical possession of and taking into their custody persons and things of which under and by virtue of correspondent mandates issued by the judge to whom they are respectively subordinate such possession is required to be taken instructional art   for more particular functions included in the prehensive function thus applied see the procedure code ch xxii prehension section ii fields of service enactive art   the local and logical fields of service of a prehensor are the same as those of a judge as per ch xii judiciary collectively section   enactive expositive art   ordinary and extraordinary or say occasional such are the prehensors local fields of service ordinary that which coincides with that of the judge to whose judicatory the prehensor in question belongs extraordinary the respective local fields of service of any or all the several other immediate judicatories enactive expositive art   only when the person or persons thing or things which requiring to be prehended     are or by the judge are believed to be whether in a stationary or migratory state within the judgeshire of some other judge or judges—to the authority to act within his own judgeshire will be added by the prehension mandate issued by the judge authority to act within the territory of any other judge instructional ratiocinative art   whether they be persons or things or both frequently it cannot be seen whether at the moment of issuing the prehension mandate the proposed subject matters of prehension be in a stationary or a migratory state nor if in a stationary state how soon from that state they may not pass into a migratory one nor in case of migration into or through what other judicatories the migration may not extend accordingly in the tenor of the prehensionmandate at the moment of issuing it the judge if he sees reason will insert a clause authorizing the prehensor to extend to any other judgeshire or judgeshires without exception the exercise given by him to this his function at the same time if in the individual case in question there be any reason to suppose that in preference to or to the exclusion of others the subject matter in question is in a more especial degree likely to be found in this or that judgeshire in this case in and by another appropriate clause designation of such particular judgeshire or judgeshires will be inserted enactive instructional art   as for other judicial mandates in general so for these printed forms in general terms with appropriate blanks for the insertion of matter peculiar to the several individual cases will be provided under the direction of the justice minister enactive art   in case of any such judicial invasion as above the invading prehensor will make a report specifying the judgeshires so invaded with the time of each such invasion and the operations thereupon performed section iii selfsuppletive function enactive art   to a prehensor as to a judge belongs the selfsuppletive function with this difference that in the case of the prehensor the instrument of deputation must be signed not only by the prehensor principal but also by the judge enactive instructional art   under and by virtue of his aidcompelling function as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    at any time provisionally—and lest on any individual occasion by any accident means of giving execution and effect to a judicial decree should be wanting—to the judge it will belong of his own authority by appropriate instruments to appoint prehensor deputes occasional in such number as the state of things may have been found to require section iv locable who enactive art   the pecuniary competition having had place—a salary having by the legislature been attached to the situation as in the case of a judge as per ch xii judiciary collectively section    remuneration any man who can read and write is locable enactive art   qualifications   ordinary the aptitude of the candidate in respect of the arts of reading and writing will be exhibited in public in the justice chamber immediately before the signature of the location instrument enactive art   of the day and hour at which the signature of the location instrument is proposed to be performed notice effectually public will have been given for any persons so inclined to come in and by their evidence respectively delivered and examination taken show cause why such location shall not have place instructional art   of persons who in respect of their antecedently habitual occupation present themselves as affording a presumption of especial appropriate aptitude examples are the following—   functionaries having served as serjeants or in any superior or inferior grade in the army subdepartment being at the same time in respect of bodily vigour apt for a service in which as in this case bodily resistance on the part of others is by the supposition liable to have place   functionaries having served in the navy subdepartment in grades analogous to the above   functionaries having served in the preventive service subdepartment instructional art   qualifications   extraordinary consideration had that individuals of all sorts—foreigners as well as natives—persons not speaking any language spoken by any permanent inhabitant of the state—are liable to be subjected to the exercise of the power thus conferred and regard being had to the need which has place for interchange of expression     of will and correspondent expression of compliance and refusal the locating judge on the occasion of the choice made by him as between candidate and candidate will have regard to the number of foreign languages if any in which the candidate is able to converse cœteris paribus the aptitude of the candidate being as the number of the languages in which he is able to converse instructional art   in making choice of a prehensor for the individual occasion if the proposed prehendee be a foreigner the judge will cœteris paribus employ in preference for the occasion as prehensor if any such there be an individual who is able to converse either in the native language of the proposed prehendee or if that cannot be in some other language in which the proposed prehendee is able to converse instructional art   where the proposed prehendee is of the female sex the judge will if he thinks fit make appointment of a person of that same sex to act as attendant on the person of the proposed prehendee whether she be a foreigner or a native this for the purpose of minimizing the annoyance to which a person of the female sex may unavoidably be subjected by being in the mode in question placed under the power of a person of the male sex of which annoyance the intensity will naturally be in proportion to the degree of affluence to which she has been habituated on such an occasion the judge will be upon his guard against the danger lest by means of such appointment the intended prehension should in any way be frustrated section v located how enactive art   located by the judge of

prehensors by the judge that is to say either of his own motion or at the instance of and appropriate demand accordingly made by any other person whatsoever enactive instructional art   when and as often as it happens to a judge to dislocate a prehensor he will cause him to appear on a day appointed before him in the justice chamber and there after taking his examination in so far as shall appear necessary if by the result thereof he is confirmed in his opinion of the inaptitude of this functionary will declare to him the cause or causes of his dislocation and pronounce a dislocative decree accordingly enactive instructional art   to the care of the government advocate it will belong of his own motion or at the instance of the judge to secure in this as in other cases the exhibition of any such evidence as for the forming of a ground for the proposed dislocative decree may have presented itself as necessary enactive instructional art   to the care of the eleemosynary advocate it will belong in like manner to secure the exhibition of any such evidence as for averting the dislocative decree may have presented itself as necessary enactive instructional art   in this case to afford a valid ground for the dislocative decree it is not necessary that the demand for that purpose should have for its ground any offence of the number of those the denunciation of which is exhibited in and by the penal code the decree will have for its sufficient ground and warrant the whole matter of the record of which such examination as above constitutes the essential part enactive art   of this dislocative record exemplars will be distributed in manner following   kept in the judicatory one   delivered to the dislocatee one   delivered to the dislocating judge one   transmitted to the appropriate appellate judicatory one   transmitted to the justice minister one enactive instructional art   should the dislocative decree appear not sufficiently grounded either to the judge appellate or the justice minister they will not however relocate the dislocatee in any judicatory in which he will have to serve under a judge by whom or at whose instance he has been dislocated by his dislocation in one judicatory no peremptory bar will be opposed to his location in any other   0 chapter xxix sublegislatures section i fields of service enactive expositive art   in every district is a sublegislature by sublegislature understand a political body exercising under the authority of the legislature either as to the whole or as to a part of its logical field of service functions of the same nature as those of the legislature enactive art   of the service of a sublegislature the local field is also the local field of a judicial district so many judicial districts so many sublegislatures section ii functions in general enactive instructional art   by each sublegislature under the authority of the legislature are exercised within its local field of service the several functions following—that is to say—   its ministerial function   its institutionrearing function   its moneysupplying function   its expenditurewatching function   its transfercompelling function   its informationelicitative function   its publicitysecuring function of these several functions the nature stands expressed in the seven sections following section iii i ministerial function enactive art   in the exercise of this function a sublegislature assists in giving execution and effect to all government arrangements when and in so far as called upon so to do by the legislature enactive art   so if called upon by the prime minister but with power in this case to appeal to the legislature enactive art   so if called upon by any subminister acting within the logical field of service belonging to his subdepartment expositive enactive art   power in the above two cases to appeal to the legislature those members of the sublegislature who concur in the appeal being personally responsible for any damage which in consequence thereof shall in respect of delay or otherwise have been suffered by the public service section iv ii institutionrearing function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function each sublegislature within its local field of service subject to the authority of the legislature institutes and keeps on foot public works and establishments such as it thinks fit belonging to any of the local fields of service following that is to say—   the preventive service minister   the indigence relief minister   the education minister   the domain minister as to which see the several chapters sections and articles in which the several functions belonging to these several subdepartments are brought to view expositive art   comprehended in this function are the several elementary functions comprehended under the general head of the administrative functions in ch ix ministers collectively and ch xi ministers severally enactive expositive art   all these several functions the sublegislature exercises either immediately by its own hands or unimmediately by such other hands as it thinks fit locating them accordingly as also dislocating them as it deems convenient section v iii moneysupplying function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function each sublegislature provides funds by taxes and otherwise for the several branches of expenditure of which as per section   it has the direction     instructional art   among the cares of the legislature will be the keeping watch over the operations of the several sublegislatures in this field lest obstruction be thereby opposed to the efficiency of those which have for their object the service of the whole state section vi iv expenditurewatching function enactive expositive art   in the exercise of this function the sublegislature exercises in relation to the persons things and other objects comprised within its fields of service local and logical the several functions which in ch xi section    are attributed to the finance minister to be by him exercised in relation to the objects of the same denomination belonging to the general service of the state section vii v transfercompelling function enactive expositive art   when for the use and greater benefit of the whole district or of any territorial division contained within it or of any person or aggregate of persons belonging to it the transfer of an article of property in any shape is deemed necessary the proprietor or proprietors at the same time declining to sell at any price or declining to sell at the price offered—to the sublegislature it belongs in the exercise of this function to cause a value to be set upon the article by apt valuers sufficient liberty of litiscontestation being at the same time allowed to the proprietor and upon delivery of the equivalent in a pecuniary or other shape to cause possession to be delivered into such hands as the nature of the service indicates enactive instructional art   in every such case the constitution expects—not only that the benefit from the transfer be in due proportion shared between the parties on both sides but also that the compensation so allowed be rather over than under that which shall appear to be the exact equivalent for the loss sustained by reason of the expropriation and that in such valuation the value of affection in a case susceptible of it be not neglected enactive instructional art   for the determining such compensation the requisite examinations may be made either by the sublegislature itself by a committee of itself or by a person or persons at large appointed for the purpose by itself or by reference to the judicatory of any subdistrict contained within its own district provided that if it be by any authority other than that of a judicatory the proceedings shall be carried on with the same sort and degree of publicity as that with which the proceedings of a judicatory are accompanied section viii vi informationelicitative function enactive art   exceptions excepted the powers which the legislature will exercise for the collection of evidence and thus on occasion forming for its proceedings an appropriate ground each sublegislature within its own territory will exercise enactive expositive art   exception is—that which regards the invitation to an agent of any foreign power by the legislature alone can this power be exercised enactive art   in relation to the form of the aggregate mass of law belonging to its field of service it exercises by its own hand or those of any person or persons employed by it the functions of the legislation minister as delineated in ch xi section   enactive instructional art   in relation to its proceedings and the grounds of them it also exercises the several functions statistic recordative custoditive and meliorationsuggestive section ix vii publicitysecuring function expositive art   in the exercise of this function it gives to its several ordinances and to the minutes and grounds of its several proceedings whatsoever degree of publicity they are respectively susceptible of yet so as that the evil resulting in the shape of delay vexation and expense from the mode of communication employed be not such as to outweigh the benefit section x sublegislationinquiry judicatory enactive instructional art   when in one and the same arrangement existing or contemplated the interests of two or more districts are concerned the sublegislature of any one of them may send invitation to that of any other to join in the formation of a composite inquiry judicatory bicomposite tricomposite or quadricomposite     and so on will such a judicatory be according to the number of the sublegislatures enactive art   by authority from any sublegislature an inquiry judicatory may exercise its functions within the territory of any other sublegislature instructional art   on any such occasion it will be among the cares of such judicatory to minimize the interruption or obstruction if any given to the proceedings of the judiciary and other constituted authorities in the district into which it migrates enactive instructional art   any conflict which on such occasion may have place between authority and authority the legislature will terminate to wit in such manner as shall be deemed most conducive to the aggregate good of the service conjunct regard being had to the elicitation of appropriate truth and the minimization of delay vexation and expense section xi term of service enactive art   for a member of a sublegislature the term of service is in every particular the same as for a member of the legislature section xii attendance enactive art   in respect of attendance to the several sublegislatures apply the several provisions applied in ch vi section    to the legislature except in so far as in consideration of the difference between the quantity of business in the two situations the legislature may in the instance of this or that sublegislature think fit to diminish in any way the aggregate quantity of obligatory attendance section xiii remuneration enactive instructional art   of a member of a sublegislature the pay is  per day vacation days included ulterior emolument if from unwilling hands is extortion if from willing ones corruption section xiv attendance and remuneration—how connected enactive instructional art   in respect of the connexion between attendance and remuneration to the several sublegislatures apply the several provisions applied in ch vi section  0 to the legislature section xv locable who enactive art   whosoever is competent to serve as member of the legislative body is competent to serve as member of any sublegislative body section xvi located how enactive art   in each subdistrict immediately after voting for the election of a person to serve as deputy from the district in the legislature the voters vote for the election of another person to serve as deputy from the subdistrict in the sublegislature of that same district so many subdistricts so many members of the sublegislative body section xvii dislocable how enactive art   to the several members of each sublegislature apply the several causes of dislocation applied in ch vi section  0 to those of the legislature enactive art   they are moreover dislocable by the legislature section xviii securities for appropriate aptitude enactive instructional art   to the several sublegislatures apply in general the several securities applying as per ch vi section    to the legislature any which cannot apply will be indicated by the difference of the two situations section xix inaugural declaration enactive instructional art   immediately after the ratification made by the election clerk of the person who     has been elected a member of a sublegislature—the person so elected will read aloud an inaugural declaration similar to that pronounced by a member of the legislature with such alterations as the difference between the two situations requires expositive art   for the tenor of this inaugural declaration and the details relating to the reading of it see ch vii legislators inaugural declaration chapter xxx sublegislation ministers section i sublegislation ministers who enactive expositive art   in each district will be a set of administrative functionaries bearing the same names and within that local field having exceptions excepted the same logical fields of service as the several ministers of the whole state enactive expositive art   in this case each sublegislature within its fields of service local and logical standing in the place of the legislature these several functionaries its subordinates will be in every respect on the same footing as those of the legislature namely in respect of the several topics treated of in the different sections of ch ix ministers collectively enactive instructional art   taking the national administrative establishment for the standard of reference each sublegislature under the direction of the legislature will settle with itself and by appropriate ordinances express in what particulars and in what shapes the difference in respect of extent of local and logical field of service considered the nature of the case in such instances appears to require alteration instructional art   in regard to union and separation of administrative departments for example by the comparative narrowness of the local field of service considered in conjunction with that of the logical field of service if union in either case has place more subdepartments will naturally admit of being united in one hand in the administration of a district than in that of the whole state and as between district and district more in this or that one than in this or that other instructional art   the only instance in which it can be clear beforehand that in and for a district no minister correspondent to a national minister can have place is that of the foreign relation minister since it is for all districts collectively and not for any one in particular that what is done in the foreign relation department is done instructional ratiocinative art   in the land defensive force it may seem that there can be no room for interference on the part of a sublegislature since it is to the defence of the whole and not of any district more than another that this branch of the national power is designed but cases may happen in which the sublegislature of a district may have a use for this or that part of its own radical land force and so as the service in question is not obstructive of the service due to the whole state the legislature will not inhibit the exaction of it instructional art   so in regard to the sea defensive force yet what may happen is—that for the defence of this or that roadstead within the district the sublegislature of the district may be desirous of organizing and keeping on foot this or that portion of sea defensive force which to the legislature having in view in respect of defence and finance together the interest of the whole may not seem necessary instructional art   so more particularly in the case of this or that district which may be regarded as entirely inland but scarcely will there be any district which has not within it waters communicating in some way or other with the sea nor thus any from and through which persons and things may not have to pass for national sea defensive service enactive instructional art   in the judiciary department this or that district or not improbably every district may see reason to have its district advocate correspondent to the advocate general of the state in that case with the assistance of a competent number of deputes one and the same advocate principal may officiate in the several immediate judicatories within or even without the district as well as in the several appellate judicatories chapter xxxi government simple or federative section i topics for consideration instructional art   throughout this code the supposition     has been that the form of government being republican is simple in contradistinction to federative but in fact among republics the federative form is most in use from this consideration arise several unavoidable questions   considered in general which form is preferable   supposing the simple form preferable to wit by reason of its simplicity are there any and what cases of exception in which the federative form of government is matter of necessity or a fit object of preference   in either case what are the alterations by which the simple form here exhibited may in the most advantageous manner be altered into the federative even supposing that in the political state in question the federative government is the only one which circumstances admit of the formation of the present code though penned on the supposition that the government is proposed to be of the simple kind is not the less adapted to the purpose in view if the only form employable is the federative to convert it into a federative government all that is wanting is the giving appropriate power to the several sublegislatures section ii government federative—its disadvantages expositive instructional art   of a federal constitution a description may be given in either of two methods—the analytic and the synthetic i in the analytic method a federal constitution may be thus described conceive a number of sublegislatures as according to the present code conceive them one or more or all of them as to this or that point or any number of points supreme not subordinate with relation to the legislature ii in the synthetic method conceive a number of republics each independent in each of them the authority of the legislature supreme but agreeing to stand as to certain specified points one or more subordinate to a central legislature the members of which shall be deputed from the several thus confederated states of these two correspondent and opposite forms the analytic presents itself as being in itself the most simple and accordingly the most easily conceived instructional art   in an abundance which cannot but call forth proportionable regret the federative system presents to view a host of difficulties these difficulties divide themselves into two classes those which regard the substance of the arrangements and those which regard the form meaning in this case those which regard the operation of giving apt and adequate expression to whatsoever arrangements may have come to be on all sides really intended instructional art   i in regard to substance how to secure in the quantities absolute and relative apt and agreed upon the affording of the requisite supplies in the two shapes necessary to wit the personal and the real—men and money or moneys worth—these are the problems for which solution is required instructional art   as to what regards men the case presents not comparison had with that which belongs to money and moneys worth much difficulty only from stipendiaries can the quotas of contributed men or say contributees from the several states be furnished to the central army for if not stipendiaries at the time of the contribution they are by it rendered such whether the men contributed by each state shall be kept distinct or mixed indiscriminately in the central army will be a question for consideration instructional art   as to money or moneys worth two difficulties present themselves first how to settle as between state and state the quota and secondly how to secure the actual furnishing of it   how to settle the quotas for this purpose a preliminary operation necessary is a statistic account of the mass of the matter of wealth absolute and relative in each constituent state relative—meaning with reference to the quantity of the population among which it stands distributed instructional ratiocinative art     how to secure the actual and perpetual furnishing of the supply settled and agreed upon this operation divides itself into two suboperations   taxation that is to say legislation applied to the purpose in question   collection and transference of the supply so obtained that is to say the administration of it comparatively speaking the legislational involves little difficulty legislation is a sort of operation performed exceptions excepted once for all and performed for the whole territory of the union by a single assembly without change of place not so the administrational and judicial branch the causing the ordinary supplies to find their way from each source surely and periodically into the common treasury instructional ratiocinative art   on this occasion two antagonizing arrangements present themselves       each state to its own taxes imposed for its own peculiar purposes adds others imposed on the same sources or say contributionyielding subject matters of taxation or on other and additional ones in both cases it collects the money by its own collectors and from the aggregate fund thus composed periodically conveys the quota agreed on or such lesser share as it chooses to part with for the use of the whole confederacy to the central spot call this the singletaxation system   each state under such restrictions and conditions as are agreed on gives permission and authority to the central government to impose at its own choice taxes to the stipulated amount on the citizens of the several confederated states in this case follow as a necessary consequence in each state two separate department official establishments to wit a branch of the administrative and a branch or the whole of a judiciary establishment the one for the collection of the correspondent part of the revenue in uncontested cases the other for the collection of it in contested cases call this the doubletaxation system instructional ratiocinative art   evils attached to the double system are as follows—   addition to the expense of the two branches of the additional establishment namely the administrative and the judiciary the maximum of the addition will be reduplication in both cases but in the case of the administrative this maximum is susceptible of alleviation in a greater degree than in the case of the judiciary for the subject matters of taxation being given and the number of intended contributors or say taxees given likewise as well as the other circumstances local circumstances included upon which facility of collection depends such as density of population being also equal—the expense of collection may be not considerably greater in the case of double or a still greater multiple of the sum in question than in the case of the original sum instructional ratiocinative art     danger of disagreement ill will and consequent rupture of the association of states accompanied or not—followed or not by hostility as between states and states the state of things in question is that of an imperium in imperio the central government commanding that which the local government inhibits or vice versâ the local commanding what the central inhibits at any time on any occasion such repugnancy is liable to have place no man says the proverb can serve two masters yet here does the servant subject stand engaged to serve two masters instructional ratiocinative art  0 manifest on the bare statement is the comparative simplicity of the singletaxation system and the comparative complicatedness of the doubletaxation system manifest accordingly the superiority of the singletaxation system on the supposition that execution and effect can be and is given to it but here lies the great difficulty and in such a degree is the difficulty capable of varying as between confederacy and confederacy that in the instance of this or that confederacy it may be capable of being carried into effect in this or that other not in this latter case supposing it realized nothing will remain but to submit and give to the yoke such alleviation as it is susceptible of instructional art    another difficulty connected with the federative system is how to settle the seat of the aggregate government—the seat of the heart into which the matter in question shall be received from and out of which it shall be distributed and into which it shall reflow instructional art    ii in regard to form—namely uncertainty by reason of diversity of interpretation accompanied with sincerity and free from evil consciousness on both sides this arises from the difficulty of finding in every part of the field locutions sufficiently well adapted to the purpose of marking out the boundaries between the authority of the central government and the authority of each particular confederating state to the complete accomplishment of this object an altogether consummate acquaintance with the art and science of logic is an indispensable requisite even in the angloamerican confederacy no such consummation nor any near approach to it has as yet been effected instructional ratiocinative art    under the federative system the magnitude of the aggregate territory will be productive of various other evils the distance and consequent length of time would cause tardiness and unfrequency of communication between the seat of the central government with its head offices administrative and judiciary on the one part and the seats of the several particular governments on the other part of this distance and consequent tardiness the ill effects will perhaps be in a more particular degree obvious and striking in the judiciary than in the administrative department true it is that by the universal registration and publication system as applied to judiciary proceedings evil in this shape would under the present proposed pannomion be minimized and the tardiest pace of communication     under that system would be promptitude in comparison of the least tardy which in suits regarded as important has place at present in english practice still however the quantity of it would constitute a serious objection of sufficient weight perhaps in some cases to turn the scale instructional ratiocinative art    in addition to the adjustment of territorial limits as between state and state it will be necessary to make adjustment of the use to be made of waters in the several states whether running or stagnant salt or fresh the land covered with them respectively being so situated as to be capable of being turned to use by one more or all of the several states of such uses examples are as follows—   fishing   irrigation   navigation for the purpose of access to water useful in either of the above two ways   navigation for the purpose of warlike operations offensive or defensive against a nation at whose hands hostility has place or is apprehended and regarded as impending adjustment must also be made of the limits within which by encouragement intended or unintended given to this or that branch of its own trade discouragement shall be applied to the trade of this or that other of the mutually contracting states these matters being adjusted and a judicatory composed of agents from each state for the peaceable termination of future contingent pursuits established the probability of continuing in a state of amity seems not to be in any determinate degree increased by coalescence into a confederated state but under the federative system in so far as on the part of any one or more of the thus associating states any plan of conquest or less extensive scheme of depredation or oppression at the charge of other states one or more has place—to the purpose of defeating such a scheme the sort of judicatory in question would not with anything like certainty be adequate though by the publicity of such discussions and the appeal thus made to the publicopinion tribunal every such mischievous scheme would receive the most effectual check which by anything but superior warlike force the nature of things admits of instructional exemplificational ratiocinative art    an idea which will be apt to present itself and which unless corrected will be but too apt to produce pernicious error in practice is this—namely that to establish an effective and permanent union of this kind nothing more is necessary than to take for the model and for a subject matter of exact imitation the system exemplified in the case of the angloamerican states in one essential circumstance the case of that confederacy is but too widely different from all those which in the same continent are either already formed or are in a way so to be this is the eminent altitude in which the public mind was seated in respect of political and legislative intelligence at the time of the establishment of the confederacy while in the other instances the public mind has been reduced to a correspondently low degree by spanish tyranny and portuguese misrule intellectual aptitude in a maturer state may be obtained from without but moral aptitude and in correspondent degree and proportion must have place within or all intellectual aptitude will be useless instructional exemplificational art    since the disruption of the spanish monarchy several federations have been either effected or endeavoured in no instance does it appear probable that these unions have had for their efficient cause on the part of the ruling few by whom they have been effected an opinion that of the change a preponderant good to the many would be the result the phenomenon has had for its more natural cause perceived or unperceived the love of power for the more extensive the union the greater the power in the hands of the central government and thence of the several individual functionaries sharing in it in this case ambition wears a mask less transparent than in most other cases under the name of allies history shows how the athenians proceeded to render tributary so many republics whom they found weaker than themselves section iii government simple—its advantages enactive ratiocinative art   exceptions excepted in no instance will a federal constitution or say a confederated form of government be employed in preference to the simple or say unconfederated reasons   complicatedness of the federal form   thence difficulty of the several operations of creation and preservation in relation to it   difficulty of effecting an agreement as to the purport of the arrangements to be established   difficulty of framing apt expressions for the designation of those same arrangements   danger of jealousies from supposed partiality as to this or that particular state   danger of disagreement and eventual hostility on the part of the states a confederacy of which is formed or in contemplation to be formed instructional ratiocinative art   the advantages which the simple form possesses in comparison with the federative howsoever constructed are altogether obvious and not less undeniable       it is more easily understood corruption is therefore more easily and surely kept out of it for the less perfectly is the form and conduct of the government understood by the many the more easily will they be imposed upon by the few and the sinister sacrifice in proportion as opportunity offers be thus made   if in general terms the choice be in favour of the federative thereupon comes the choice as between every proposable modification of the federative form and every other and here comes matter for debate without end   a federative form supposed established danger of conflict between the general government and each particular government is a danger that cannot but be perpetually impending   take each dispute by itself and suppose it settled still the basis on which it is settled will be to be settled and by the expression given to the settlement whatsoever it be so much additional complication is introduced   in comparison of a simple form of government constructed upon the same republican basis and framed or adopted and carried into execution and effect by a people under the same degree of civilisation—a federative government even if constructed upon the best possible plan will so long as it exists be a weak one the weaker the stronger the powers of the several local governments of this weakness the angloamerican federative government exhibited in its original form a striking exemplification and proof the ties were too loose necessity compelled the strengthening them instructional ratiocinative art   the advantages of having in the given space a number more or less considerable of political debating assemblies instead of no more than one—the additional and allpervading strength thus given to the public mind in every part of the country each particular government operating as a check upon the central government as well as upon every other—are advantages the importance of which is altogether above dispute among the causes that contributed to the fall of the french republic the want of this advantage was perhaps the most influential while to the capital was confined almost the whole of the political light the provinces remained if not in absolute in different degrees of comparative darkness instructional ratiocinative art   but from the very first for the securing this advantage provision the efficiency of which will hardly be deemed exposed to dispute has been here made with the utmost anxiety in and by the existence of and the powers and duties given to the sublegislatures in this code each sublegislature is a seminary for the legislature in each sublegislature public men are continually formed and sent out upon the stage of public life furnished with inducements as well as means for acting with guardian vigilance as instruments of control to the proceedings of the universal legislature in the form here proposed may be seen a body and a vast body it may be with but one soul in the federative form there cannot but be as many souls as distinct governments and amongst them there may any day be jarring ones instructional ratiocinative art   an exception might be where for defence against hostility actual or probable at the hands of another political state in such sort and degree powerful that by no other means does resistance against conquest at the hands of such overpowerful state afford an adequate promise of being effectual but it seems questionable whether for defence against a common enemy any preponderant demand for federation has place in any instance neither does it appear that in respect of security against mutual hostility between member and member of a proposed federal state any clearly preponderant demand has place comparison had with such other means as the nature of the case affords     appendix no i collectanea relating to book ii ch vi legislature section  0 attendance

was assumed and exercised by the commanderinchief may no emergency hereafter occur in which a military officer shall consider himself authorized to cite as a precedent this violation of the constitution to all appearance it was by this proclamation of martial law that new orleans was saved saved from capture perhaps from destruction but for this substitute to regular legislation one or other catastrophe would have taken place this is but one of divers accidents to which every government stands exposed and by which on pain of suffering boundless in amount a demand for immediate action on the part of the allembracing legislature may be produced foreign war civil insurrection pestilence famine here are already four every one of them but too frequently brought to view by experience the following information relating to this subject the author received from john neal esq an advocate in the supreme judicatory of the union january      the members of congress of the united states are elected for two years they meet in the first monday in december and rise at the end of about four months upon the average they sit therefore only onethird of the time they may be called together on forty days notice however at any intermediate period but although it requires time to make a good law and the president has power to provide for such events whatever they may be as are likely to require extraordinary power—as if the country be invaded or if a rebellion should break out—still cases have occurred where much distress might have been saved to the people if the chief legislature had been in session with power to pass a law quickly by the constitution of the united states it is provided that no state of the confederacy shall pass a law to impair the obligation of contracts by the same constitution power is given to the united states to pass a general bankrupt law the several states or the majority of them have been in the habit of passing insolvent laws which had the effect sometimes of discharging both the person and property of a debtor this habit continued for thirty years at last however a question was made for the supreme court of the united states that court decided that all discharges granted under state authority under such and such circumstances were void the law under the authority of which they were granted being void as impairing the obligation of contracts the effect was terrible the country was agitated in every direction houses were entered and stripped—the houses of wealthy men who had been discharged years and years before nothing was heard but complaint hundreds and hundreds of old judgments were revived a multitude of executions issued and thousands of new suits brought a national bankrupt law was required but the legislature were not in session or if in session they had not time enough left before they were to break up for passing a uniform system of bankrupt law the distress continued therefore till it found a remedy or died away as the outcry did so that when the congress did meet they were not much pressed about the matter a law was half prepared but they broke up and went home before it was finished—and so was it the next year—and the year after and so is it now up to this hour they have no bankrupt law in the united states of america though thousands and thousands of people are praying for it as their only hope no ii collectanea relating to ch xi ministers severally section  0 health minister supra p     from the examiner of  th july      sanatory regulations—a circular of which the following is a copy has been delivered to the inhabitants of st jamess westminister viz—it is strongly recommended     to the inhabitants of this parish to have their dust bins emptied at least once in every week the fermentation and putrefaction of vegetable and other matters therein being a great cause of infection at this season of the year unless the board of health is superintended and stimulated by the press it will proceed in the moleeyed and bitbybit manner in which the functions of government are usually performed by government itself as well as those to whom it delegates authority after the arrangements of quarantine and the sanatory regulations against the cholera have been made the medical commission will probably if left to itself become a sinecure the government acting ignorantly and without plan having assigned to the commission only one object when with the same expenditure of money the services of the commissioners might be directed to a number of other objects of permanent importance for the improvement and preservation of the public health such a body would render great service if for example they obtained reports of the districts in which fever patients are the most numerous or in which epidemics are the most frequent and extensive and if they investigated the local causes of these diseases and took measures for their removal why should not such a commission be instructed to frame sanatory regulations for the maintenance of cleanliness in the streets and for the guidance of proper officers in the execution of the existing laws it does not appear to have occurred to the home department that the police officers most of whom are occupied in patrolling their rounds from morning to night for the protection of persons and property might be employed to enforce such regulations without any detriment to their other duties a correspondent suggests in anticipation of an epidemic or contagious disease making its appearance in this metropolis the necessity of organizing in each parish a sanatory committee composed of active intelligent and humane individuals who should be empowered by the magistrates to visit all dwellings occupied by the poorer classes and where there is a want of cleanliness and ventilation to cause the necessary measures to be carried into effect such as whitewashing and proper openings for the free circulation of air to be done at the expense of the landlord if he can afford it or by means of parish subscription the above committee should also inspect uncovered drains or stagnant pools that may exist in any part of the parish and cause the former to be covered and the latter to be filled up to the first the sewer company will no doubt give its sanction and assistance as tending to contribute to the public health no iii collectanea relating to book ii—ch xii judiciary collectively i section    justice for the helpless from the examiner of sunday   th june      queen square expense of justice for depredations committed on the poor—a girl named sophia chapman was yesterday committed for trial on a charge of robbing a foreigner named ben hyam of a halfsovereign on the prisoner being committed the turk said that he could not attend at the sessions as he got his living by travelling round the country and he would therefore much rather put up with the loss of the halfsovereign—mr marriott on this said that he must find two sureties to answer for his appearance at the old bailey—the prosecutor said he could do no such thing and he was therefore committed to jail in default it is almost impossible to describe how astonished the poor fellow was at this specimen of english law had basil hall been so served in a foreign country we should have liked to have seen his comments on its institutions montesquieu says that in turkey justice is thus administered—the cadi hears both the plaintiff and defendant orders both a drubbing on the spot and there is an end of the matter ben hyam will have time during a protracted imprisonment to meditate on the superior wisdom of the mode in which it is administered in his own country and regret that he was not in a country in which he could have a drubbing at once and the matter be thus ended the morning chronicle remarks upon the case—the committal of a poor turk by a queen square magistrate for inability to find security to prosecute the person who robbed him would almost lead one to believe that the essex squire was not so far wrong when he said that the magistrates were they who knew least of the law there can be no doubt that the   0 committal is according to law but there can be as little doubt that such a law is unjust towards the sufferer and injurious towards the community but like many absurd laws it subsists because the poor alone suffer from it to detain a poor man who derives his subsistence by travelling about the country in order to prosecute for a trifle may be to him of a most serious consequence in the case of a rich man the case would be trifling he could easily obtain securities whom he could indemnify if more than his personal recognizance should be demanded the moral is obvious to all who may read the account of the proceedings it is too bad to be robbed but still worse to be sent to prison to secure the punishment of the robber the thief of course calculates on this unwillingness to prosecute and he is not far out in his calculation such is the dread of being obliged to prosecute entertained by people engaged in business in london except the loss be serious or the thief has particularly provoked them that they are exceedingly anxious to keep the matter quiet we remember another case illustrative of the hardship of our lengthy and expensive penal procedure to labouring people and persons in the middle rank of life who are compelled to attend as prosecutors and witnesses a labouring man who was the occupier of a cottage in middlesex detected a fellow in the act of carrying away one of his geese from the common the thief was seized carried before a magistrate who will be known to many by the fees demanded and committed for trial the unpaid magistrate or the magistrates clerk rather in his name exacted from the labourer six shillings for fees the value of the goose attempted to be stolen was only four shillings so that at the outset the administrator of the law deprived the poor man of two shillings more than the thief would have taken from him but the sufferer was also bound over to prosecute and what with attendance before the clerk of the peace to get the bill of indictment framed before a grand jury to get the bill found and waiting until the thief was tried and to obtain his costs—sixteen days of his time were expended this was before the establishment of a second court each day to him was worth  s but he was only allowed  s  d which barely paid his expenses in coming to town his lowest loss was  s  d aday so that the total loss including the  s fees which were not allowed back and which in truth were illegally exacted amounted to £   s or the value of fifteen geese the thief only attempted to take one goose—the law swept away more than the whole flock injuries of this kind are daily perpetrated and the expense of justice is impunity to the depredators it is only the rich who have nothing to do who can prosecute without inconvenience a thief is usually a martyr for the sake of the others of his fraternity to protect them in the commission of crime a prosecutor is a victim to deter other honest people who are plundered from prosecuting the instances are not unfrequent where persons who have once prosecuted abscond from redress when they have been robbed a second time the mischievous operation of our penal procedure and the serviceable elisions that might be made in it have already been demonstrated at full length there are few who have had better opportunities for observing these evils than sir thomas denman there are few who are more free from the vulgar prejudices against innovation entertained by mere technical lawyers for he admits the inutility and mischief of grand juries we trust that after the reform bill is carried he will propose reforms in penal procedure more comprehensive and efficient than the bitbybit reforms brought forward by sir robert peel common law reform—remanet fees to the editor of the times sir—observing the judges have at length put their shoulder to the wheel and promulgated some rules tending to reduce the expense of legal proceedings in the first stage of a cause allow me through your medium to call their attention as well as the common law commissioners to the urgent necessity of devising some scheme during the vacation by which the remanet fees on the untried causes in london and middlesex may be avoided to you sir and the unprofessional part of the public it may be some information to learn that these fees and which in the course of twelve months amount to an enormous sum are not paid either for expediting the trial or for the trial but actually and for no other reason than the total inability of parties to get their causes tried allow me to go a little into detail and to show the absurdity as well as the necessity of an immediate alteration in middlesex at the end of the late term there were  0  untried causes in the kings bench alone these are technically called remanets     additional causes were placed in the list for the sittings after term making a total of     causes in london there were near  00 remanets to the sittings after term and with the new causes for those sittings there will no doubt be a total of  00 causes the term ended the   th instant and with the exception of one day lord tenterden has sat in middlesex ever since devoting four days for the trial of common jury causes five days for special juries and this day for undefended causes the last common jury cause appointed for trial was no    so that with the exception of the undefended causes to be tried today and the special juries that have been disposed of this week there will remain     causes untried in middlesex alone and which will stand over till michaelmas term     in london seven days are appointed for the trial of common jury causes and six days for special juries now sir my complaint is this that in all human probability there will be in the kings bench alone about  000 causes standing over until michaelmas term and as very few are tried in the term there will be paid by every plaintiff at the office of the marshal and associate and i presume for his benefit though that is immaterial for the object of this letter   s on every cause for no other reason than as before stated because the parties are delayed and cannot get their causes tried but sir this is not all the fortunate officer entitled to the   s on each cause is not the only one benefitted—other fees are paid to other officers and all for the same cogent reason in fact to give your unprofessional readers and those who have the power of remedying this grievance some idea of its extent it will be sufficient for me to say that  000 causes standing over in the way described will at the expiration of the next term be a charge to the unsuccessful litigants alone of upwards of £ 000 this is certain for even if parties settle their differences without a trial the remanet fees down to the settlement must be paid before the record is withdrawn and the cause struck out of the paper i am afraid at this particular period i have already trespassed too much on your indulgence if however you think these remarks are worth noticing i may in a few days trouble you again—i am sir your obedient servant a b june    ii section    contestedinterpretationreporting function from the morning chronicle august        western circuit assizes    one objection to the indictment namely that it did not state the accident to have occurred on the kings highway or in a public road and all the precedents showed that such an averment was necessary was overruled by the chiefjustice best who observed that he had little doubt the precedents would furnish instances of nonsense of all sorts but it was then objected—it was alleged that the coach was drawn by two mares and two geldings which allegation had not been supported by proof this was a thumping objection—two mares and two geldings stated in the indictment and no one to prove the averment the lord chiefjustice then said—he feared that the objections were fatal at first he imagined that there was a clause in one of mr peels acts which cured the error but he found such was not the case however he might observe that when that right honourable gentleman was preparing the bills for the amendment of the criminal law he consulted all the judges upon the clauses he proposed and among them was one which would have been amply sufficient to meet these objections he the lord chiefjustice had at the time expressed his opinion in favour of that clause but mr peel who with great propriety determined to be governed by the advice of the majority struck it out as the majority of the judges certainly had thought it would be introducing too great a laxity in pleading  iii section  0 judges eventuallyemendative function from the examiner of sunday june        court of exchequer may    bitbybit legal reform cranage gent attorney against price—in this case the declaration which was for slander and libel had been referred to the master for such counts to be struck out as he might think unnecessary it appeared there were twenty counts for the slander or oral matter of complaint and eight for the libel or written many of which differed from one another only by a slight inversion of style and were identical in effect and meaning thus in one count the charge was that the defendant had published a libel of the counts for slander the master struck out twelve and of those for the libel he struck out four and he curtailed the remaining but as it appeared that the declaration had not been drawn by the plaintiff himself but by a pleader whether at or below the bar was not stated and as the instructions given by the plaintiff were proper the master had refused the defendant the costs of the disgusting and rejected superfluity though he would have done otherwise and granted the costs could he have enforced them on the pleader hinc illæ lachrymæ the costs formed the substance the words spoken the pretext only of the quarrel and the court and the bar who evinced a vivid perception of the ludicrous at the disappointment of the complainant in obtaining nothing more than the reduction of the declaration to orthodox dimensions were convulsed with laughter whilst mr addison with virtuous indignation denounced the scandalous corruption of the science of pleading however the conclusion was tragic mr baron garrow said that such practices were the more scandalous as the commissioners supported by the legislature and by the courts of justice were devising every means which were within their power for the abbreviation and simplifying of law proceedings and he hoped that the present application would show that the suitors for justice     were not with impunity to be made the objects of oppression through the means of any occupation however little exposed to view however mysterious that occupation might be undoubtedly the courts have the power to punish them without the intervention of parliament but it is believed that the courts or those judges whose influence is predominant instead of supporting as mr baron garrow says have opposed alterations in special pleading it is evident that the courts would be glad that the mere expression of abhorrence at individual instances of abuse should satisfy the public but the policy imitated from the boroughmongers of victimizing one unlucky attorney or pleader in order to preserve a bad system is now too well appreciated to be successful the day is come for the thorough reform of legal procedure and special pleading if retained can be so—not in the place of a universal instrument but as subordinate to the preliminary examination of the parties the result of the masters inquiry into the above case must indeed convince the public of the general inaptitude of special pleading as an instrument of judicature urged by mr addison to the extreme the master could reduce this twentyeightfold declaration to only a twelvefold one that is each count being considered in law as a declaration the master thought twelve special declarations necessary to bring fairly before the court one cause of action were special pleading employed only as a supplementary process in special cases and as subordinate to the preliminary examination the proceeding would vary but little from the ancient system in which the litigation was conducted ore tenus that is in the presence of the judges and was continued by successive imparlances that is successive adjournments until this preliminary investigation had completely disclosed to the judges the true issue when not until then the pleadings and issue were drawn and recorded iv section    judges attendance and section    judges c remuneration the following letter giving an account of the days of sitting in the french

important de fixer leur obligation de siéger au moins deux fois par semaine c apparemment parceque cest une magistrature nouvellement établie—ce nest que par des réglements émanés tantôt du gouvernement et tantôt des cours ou tribunaux quon a fixé ce qui concerne les jours et heures de séance les vacances c la régle générale est que les réglements du gouvernement ont déterminé à cet égard quelques regles communes à tousles corps judiciaires du royaume   et que chacun de ces corps a le pouvoir de régler les points secondaires et surtout ceux qui dependent des circonstances particulières à chacun deux   or le nombre de jours que les cours et tribunaux autres que les juges de paix doivent siéger chaque semaine est laissé au réglement de chacun de ces corps   dans ceux où il y a beaucoup daffaires comme à paris et quelques autres siéges il y a séance tous les jours excepté le dimanche   je parle ici des affaires civiles ou celles de petit criminel que nous subdivisons

   judges c inaugural declaration art  0 nonelectioneering from the caledonian mercury   th may      political judges why was the lord justiceclerk absent from his duty yesterday at the court of session because it is said he preferred going to the ayrshire election so here is a judge receiving £ 000 ayear from government his court is prevented from sitting and to which he is bound to give regular attendance yet in defiance of that government and indifferent to the interests of the suitors he has gone to give his vote and support to the candidate who is opposed to the measures of his majestys government and the general voice of the people we have more than once had occasion in this journal to express a very decided opinion against the practice which has been but too prevalent in this country and in this city of judges mixing themselves up in elections of all sorts in the course of last year on the introduction of the new scotch judicature act we expressed our hope that it would be finally put an end to but nothing was done at that time to remedy the abuse the present government however has had the firmness to introduce a clause into the reform bill depriving their lordships as well as the sheriffs of counties of the privilege of voting and we suppose that with so stanch a partyman as the lord justiceclerk this alone was a reason for making him even more than usually eager in his hostility of the great indecency of this practice we never heard two opinions from influential persons for this plain reason that the judges of the court of session are the only judges who by act of parliament     have the power of determining all questions that relate to the validity of votes in counties and the due or undue election of magistrates for burghs nothing can illustrate the great impropriety of such a judge as the lord justiceclerk interfering in elections more strongly than the following case—not long ago a vote in lanarkshire was challenged when the claim for enrolment was made for the freeholders who as most of our readers know have the power of deciding judicially on such matters but the unfortunate gentleman happening to be a whig the tories determined to keep him off the roll and among others a tory judge was present and voted against the enrolment a suit in the court of session was the result and it happened curiously enough that the case according to the routine of business came before the very tory judge in the court of session who had voted against the enrolment in the court of freeholders the whig gentleman whose vote was challenged deemed it right to decline the jurisdiction of this judge and the case was verbally reported to the court when the lord justiceclerk held that although in his opinion the declinature was not well founded still as the judge himself had that morning consented to the removal of the case to another judge it was unnecessary to say more about the matter still in the lord justiceclerks opinion a judge may go electioneering and although he votes against a freeholders claim in the court of freeholders that nevertheless that circumstance does not incapacitate him from determining on the validity of the appeal of the claimant against the decision of the court of freeholders when it happens to come before him a few weeks afterwards sitting as a judge of the court of session vi section    justice chambers from the morning chronicle june        yesterday the old bailey new court was opened for the first time the recorder presided the form of the court is square and without ornament the light falls down from the ceiling behind is a spacious gallery admission to which is to be obtained only by tickets from the members of the corporation who are entitled to pass in their friends in this order—each sheriff passes four each alderman four and each commoncouncilman two per diem the box for the law students and reporters is placed opposite to that of the jury at the table there is a double row of seats the front for the counsel and the back for the attorneys an arrangement frequently wished for in the old court but perhaps the new court is the worst contrived court in the metropolis or anywhere else for sound and the spot on which the prisoner is to stand is perhaps the worst part of the court for hearing we regret to say that the two new courts at guildhall which are nearly finished have been built on the same plan and of course must be subject to the same condemnation memorandum by the author—in the morning chronicle  th june      is an account of a controversy between the aldermen and the commoncouncil about the right claimed by the commoncouncil to give admission tickets no care about admission room for the public at large on either side from the morning chronicle nov         court of common pleas construction of the new court it might have been expected in this age of improvement when everything was performed upon scientific principles and when even the very stones in our roads were laid down with almost mathematical precision that the architects of our courts of law would have deemed the convenience of the public worthy of some consideration we do not intend to say that it has been wholly neglected on the contrary we give the architect every credit for the improvements with respect to the size of the court and the freedom of admission and egress the new court is considerably larger than the old one and instead of there being but one door through which judges counsel students jurors attorneys and witnesses were obliged to pass there are now six each of which communicates only with a particular portion of the court so that much of the confusion and bustle incident upon the determination of one cause and the commencement of another is avoided the bench is placed at the eastern end of the court and the seat is elevated about six feet above the floor the back is formed by cloth of a deep crimson and on each side are hung curtains of the same material over the bench is a sounding board supported by four ionic scrolls which together with the board are painted of an oak colour the associate and marshal have seats directly under the bench and between them and the sergeants table there is a space of about five feet through which the witnesses pass when called into the box immediately behind the sergeants are the seats appropriated to the junior counsel and in the rear of them to the attorneys in waiting while those who are engaged in the cause under discussion have seats just below the sergeants the remainder of the court is allotted to the witnesses in attendance and to the public—the whole rising from the sergeants table to the western end in the form of an amphitheatre the general appearance of the court is pleasing and the result in the mind of a causal visiter who came only to see would undoubtedly be favourable but appearance in a public court is not all that is required     in alluding some time since to the principle on which these courts were to be constructed we declared our opinion that unless some alteration was made in the arrangement then proposed the echo would be so powerful as to render everything that was said indistinct if not nearly inaudible the suggestion was not attended to and the result is just as might have been foreseen the counsel endeavour to speak loudly in order that they may be heard but the only effect of their greater exertion is an increase of the noise while the distinctness of sound is wholly lost the fact is that the roof is so high and that space which if smaller might be called the lantern so contrived that the sound is completely dissipated now we by no means intend to complain of the increased size and loftiness of the court which indeed we consider an advantage grossly neglected by the architects of the courts of westminster but what we object to is the want of attention to that proportion necessary to the proper conveyance of sound and especially to the neglect of the architect in not having erected side galleries which while they increased the commodiousness of the court would have contributed greatly to the facility of hearing we cannot but regret that architects of the present day will not condescend to study more accurately the proportions of the rooms built by sir christopher wren who has furnished the most perfect models of the kind so intimately was he acquainted with the effect of sound and so minutely did he study the proportions of his buildings necessary to render its conveyance perfect that not one of the edifices which he has constructed for that purpose can be altered with advantage we have heard that some changes were recently made in one of his churches and it being thought expedient to remove the situation of the pulpit the attempt was made but was afterwards abandoned as it was found impossible to obtain the sound so well as in the precise spot on which he had fixed the situation of the witness box which in the new court is placed in a corner exactly between the bench and the jury is also liable to the strongest objections but on this subject we need make no remark contenting ourselves with simply relating what fell from the chiefjustice in the course of the day one of the witnesses was desired by a learned counsel to speak louder as it was impossible to hear him when the lord chiefjustice immediately observed—from the situation in which the witness stands he necessarily speaks to me in a whisper that however is not his fault last but not least among the grounds of serious complaint is the position of the students box the architect as if with the design of limiting the number of the future vaughans and pells of this bar and of discouraging the study of the law in general has allotted only three seats to the students although it is believed that there are about three thousand who in that character have a prescriptive right to accommodation the part of the court in which that seat is placed is at the right hand corner of the bench and at such a distance from the witness and the jury as to render every chance of hearing what passes completely impossible this however is not the only objection behind the seat is a door leading to an anteroom appropriated we believe to the sergeants and the passage to which was this day occupied by the officers and servants in attendance upon his lordship the seat is therefore in a position which seems to indicate the propriety of devoting it to their use the students box might with much greater advantage have been placed by the side of the jury box and instead of being thus satirically contracted in its size should have been constructed so as to afford the students every advantage for hearing and taking notes this arrangement is rendered so much the more necessary as the gentlemen connected with the press who are also students are under the present system subjected to innumerable inconveniences the alteration of the witness box is also a point of paramount importance the new courts in london are constructed upon the same plan as the county courts at norwich and during the last assizes there the lord chief baron found it necessary on every trial to have the witnesses placed on the bench as from their proximity to the counsel they always pitched the voice in such a tone as to render them inaudible to his lordship and the jury we trust that the committee for improvements will for the credit of the city attend to these matters and as speedily as possible make the requisite alterations no iv collectanea relating to ch xvi quasijury from the morning chronicle  st december      jurors—their irresponsibility—grievous injustice flowing from it we call the attention of our readers to an extract from the brighton guardian in another column on the subject of a trial in which the proprietor of that journal was concerned it appeared to us at the time astonishing after the defendant cohen had in all essential respects established his defence and after the fair and candid charge on that evidence to the jury that such ruinous damages should have been given but the proprietor of the brighton guardian had the misfortune to have enemies for jurors and it appears that they were determined to make the most of the opportunity     for gratifying their vengeance which the trial presented to them the sort of justice dealt out to him may be inferred from the declaration of a juror when remonstrated with—ay but this is not the only case this editor has been attacking all our institutions nobody and nothing is secure against him and so we determined to put a stop to it or to him  no v collectanea relating to ch xxii appellate judicatories section   seats where reasons by c cameron esq commissioner for inquiring into the state of the law in ceylon why the appeal judge in ceylon should go circuits to hear appeals    0 in a good system of judicature much must be left to the discretion of the judge   in order that the judge may not abuse his discretion he must feel that he is observed by somebody whose good opinion is of importance to him   in england the observation of the public answers this purpose better than any other   in ceylon the opinion of that public which constitutes the audience of a provincial judge has little more effect upon the judge than the opinion of a flock of sheep has upon the shepherd   it must be observed also that there is for the purpose now in view no printingpress in ceylon and no probability that one will exist for a long period   these things being so i can devise no better scheme for laying the provincial judges under a real responsibility and for giving something like the requisite weight to the opinion of the public which constitute his audience than sending the appeal judge periodically into his district not only to rectify any mistakes that may have been committed in point of law but also to rehear any cases in which through mistakes or misconduct a rehearing may be desirable   in the provincial courts of ceylon there are no advocates the native proctors are ignorant and knavish and the pleadings and evidence upon which the judge decides are translations made by native interpreters of the statements made by the parties and their witnesses the proctors and interpreters have a strong interest in conciliating the favour of the provincial judge   under these disadvantages and none of them seem to admit of immediate remedy there is little chance that an appeal from a provincial judge or an application for a rehearing should be carried by the post to the appeal judge in colombo in a shape calculated to procure a decision disagreeable to the provincial judge   but if the appeal judge comes to the place where the provincial judge holds his court the parties and their witnesses may have the same access to him that they have to the provincial judge and the latter will always act under the knowledge that his proceedings will be really subject to the revision of a judge of superior learning habitually controlled himself when in the exercise of his original jurisdiction at colombo by as much of public opinion as is to be found in the island and in the exercise of his appellate jurisdiction on circuit by the presence of the officers of his court of the advocate fiscal and of the proctor for prisoners and paupers who being all europeans may be considered as the representatives of the public of colombo i use these designations because officers now exist who bear them and who now accompany the supreme court on its criminal circuits no vi collectanea relating to ch xxiii professional lawyers i section   professional lawyers who from the examiner    0 law—court of kings bench westminster—collier v hicks and others—this was an action by an attorney at cheltenham against sir w hicks and another magistrate of that town and two of their officers for expelling the plaintiff from their justiceroom the case came on upon a demurrer to two special pleas of justification the facts were these—in december      an information was laid before the magistrates at cheltenham by one latham against the proprietors of a stagecoach for not having a plate with a number upon the coach on the hearing of the information the plaintiff mr collier appeared and proposed to act as an advocate in taking notes and conducting the proceedings on the part of the informer but the magistrates refused to let him act in that character and on his persisting in his attempt to do so he was removed from the justiceroom the question now for the decision of the court was whether the plaintiff had a right to be present at the hearing of the information before the magistrates as the attorney of the informer and to take notes of the evidence their lordships delivered their opinions seriatim at considerable length the substance of their judgment was that the magistrates had a discretion in common with other courts of justice in regulating their proceedings of determining who should be heard before them in the character of an advocate the pleadings in this case did not raise the question as to the right of any person merely taking notes     but the plaintiff put it on the ground that he had a right to act as an advocate in arguing or expounding the law and examining or crossexamining witnesses and it had been very properly said that if the magistrates could exclude an attorney they had also the power to prevent a barrister or any one of the public from acting as an advocate the court was of opinion that the magistrates had that power although frequently in the exercise of their discretion they allowed members of either branch of the profession to conduct cases where the accuser or the defendant required legal assistance the superior courts of westminster hall had the power and were bound according to ancient usage not to allow any persons to plead before them but barristers who were members of one of the inns of court and in the court of common pleas none but barristers who had attained the dignity of sergeant were allowed to practise it might be proper that either party should have the advice and assistance of a counsel or attorney in some cases but it did not follow that it was desirable in all cases for it must necessarily lead to expense as the other party must be provided with the same assistance to be on equal terms with his adversary it might also be doubted whether such a practice was favourable to the due administration of justice for members of either branch of the profession in discussions before magistrates might urge technical objections quite beside the justice of the case which must have the effect of embarrassing persons not accustomed to such subtilties in the case of dauheny v cooper and other cases it was decided that all the kings subjects had a right to be present in an open court so that there was room and they conducted themselves with decorum but those cases did not bear upon the present question which was whether magistrates had the power to decide who should appear before them as advocates and the court being of opinion that the magistrates had that power the assault in excluding the plaintiff from the policeoffice was justified—judgment for the defendants this is a most extraordinary and important decision of which we shall say more at convenient opportunity lord tenterden is fearful that magistrates will be embarrassed by legal subtilties he has no such fear for

ct iv section   remuneration main cause of the mischievousness of libel law the factitious expense from the examiner of the   th july      the press the law and the pettifoggers it is much to the credit of the government that for some years past there has scarcely been a single prosecution by the attorneygeneral for libel and it is equally to the credit of the press that the liberal and manly policy of the ministry has been fully appreciated and that in a crisis where the government is exposed to the attacks of a formidable faction nearly every respectable print in the kingdom has come forward zealously to its support but though public prosecutions have been rare there was scarcely ever a time when private prosecutions were so abundant or of such an impudent character the list of these prosecutions for the last twelve months would be startling and the characters of those by whom they were commenced would be yet more so convicted felons have brought actions because their forgeries and bigamies were exposed to that public whom they had opportunities of corrupting oppressive magistrates because their acts of injustice have been recorded kept mistresses because their licentious courses were denounced unnatural relatives because their unheardof cruelties have been mentioned stupid architects because their ridiculous erections were criticised habitual libellers because they were repaid in their own coin falsifiers of petitions because their fraudulent practices were made known men guilty of bribery and corruption at elections because they were truly charged with it shameless adulteresses because legal documents attesting their guilt were published foolish barristers because their ridiculous conduct was correctly reported and the proprietors of newspapers have been prosecuted not merely for the publication of the just charges against these individuals on their own authority but for accurately reporting the proceedings at policeoffices and in courts of justice—for inserting advertisements with the real signatures of persons ready to support or to answer for their allegations—for publishing affidavits filed in a court of equity—for copying—barely copying—from other papers published hundreds of miles off the details of offences concerning which the individuals prosecuted were equally uninformed and uninterested to complete the character of these proceedings the actions have in several cases been brought by attorneys who have urged the parties to prosecute with no other view than making a good job of the transaction people often talk bitterly of the licentiousness of the press and we are far from     saying that there are not mean malignant unprincipled calumniators reckless alike of private character and of the public benefit but we beg that those who condemn the press generally would look at the heavy penalties which hang over the head of every publisher and observe how the most honourable disinterested and prudent men are rendered liable to expensive if not ruinous prosecutions from persons the most profligate the law of libel as laid down by the judges is such that we venture to say there is not any number of any journal in great britain though published with the most exemplary care and with the utter absence of every motive to defame which might not render the publisher liable to prosecution nor does a publisher escape by a verdict in his favour a verdict of one farthing against him though really intended as an acquittal leaves him except in very extraordinary cases where the judge refuses to certify charged with the costs of both parties even a verdict for the defendant in a criminal prosecution for libel leaves him to pay his own costs which will seldom fall below £  0 or £ 00 now the instances have of late been extremely numerous of publishers utterly free from any motive for detraction being thus saddled with enormous expenses by persons deserving only of infamy and contempt in one instance within our knowledge a journal was broken up by such a transaction though the publisher had merely copied from a distant paper the account of an act of horrid cruelty in these cases and standing as the law at present does the jury are responsible for the protection of publishers against unjust attacks it is the duty imposed upon every juryman by his oath to acquit a defendant if there is no reason to believe that he has been actuated by malicious motives for all indictments for libel charge malice as the essence of the crime and it is obvious to common sense that without this there is no guilt juries however have too often been found to give verdicts against the press where this essential feature of guilt was wanting and we believe they havedone it in ignorance of the consequences which their verdicts involve they are too apt to be influenced by the opinions of judges who almost invariably decide against the press the judges are themselves influenced by previous decisions by the absurd legal fiction that malice is necessarily to be inferred in every accusation or reflection in some cases by political subserviency and in others by that jealous and sensitive spirit which leads men in authority to extend as far as possible the range of their power and to dislike whatever operates as a check upon their actions juries however have not unfrequently shown a proper sense of the dignity and duties of their office and have returned verdicts for the defendants where they could discover no evidence of malice or falsehood no less than five actions have been tried during the last week in two of which verdicts were given for the defendants and in the other three damages of one farthing each we hope that these verdicts will check the spirit of persecution and that they will be an example to future juries if the press should again be subjected to the attacks of public delinquents and mercenary attorneys if the utility of a free press is recognised—and no one in this country ventures openly to deny it—printers and publishers must be defended against wanton prosecutions we do not plead for malice or faction but we do claim protection for every editor in the honourable and upright discharge of his duties even though he fall into unintentional error or denounce those whose actions make them a public nuisance—leeds mercury under the present law of libel as laid down by our judges no newspaper proprietor no bookseller or writer of any description is safe libel has been defined by the late lord ellenborough to be anything which hurts the feelings or the reputation of any individual we defy the meekest and the wisest man upon earth to write upon any disputed point without hurting the feelings of some person true indeed the public press of this country assumes a considerable licence in speaking of public men and public measures but be it remembered that this is done in defiance and not with the sanction of the law upon public opinion the press relies for protection from the consequences of its temerity but too often is public opinion found to be a broken reed the public cannot be made too generally aware that when the measures of government are canvassed by political journals those publications are indebted for their impunity to the forbearance of that government whose acts they presume to question—belfast northern whig if when actions for libel are brought against the press by pettifogging attorneys or briefless barristers whose characters juries estimate at the value of a farthing or a shilling it would be well before juries gave such people verdicts for even one farthing to inquire what the cost to a newspaper would be they ought to ask such question in court before they deliver their verdict because it would then become a question for a jury to consider whether the better plan would not be to find a verdict in favour of the newspaper so as to throw the costs upon those whose trade it is to bring actions against newspapers for the sake of the costs when law was comparatively cheap it was well enough when a mans character had suffered damage to the value of a farthing or a shilling to find a verdict in favour of the plaintiff thus saddling the newspapers with the costs on both sides for probably at that time a newspaper could escape with the loss of £ 0 or £ 0 but now when law is shamefully dear in all its branches it is quite another thing for juries to give verdicts   0 against newspapers for a verdict of one farthing carries costs to the amount of nearly £ 00 the law with respect to libel is severe enough juries need not add to its severity by giving costs to the tribe that we have named if juries do not in all fair instances protect newspapers the freedom of the press will be a mere name and the public will find to its cost that itself as jurymen had let in plunderers to plunder with impunity—morning herald the following information respecting the remuneration of professional lawyers in the united states was furnished by mr neal in march      who was then in england— i am strongly inclined to believe that upon the average throughout the united states it does not cost more than five dollars   s  d to make any conveyance—taking one conveyance with another in the middle states the business of conveyancing is carried on by mere scriveners and justices of the peace without any knowledge of the law and their regular charge for conveyance or mortgage is from three to five dollars   s  d to   s  d the average length of a bill of bargain and sale of lease and release a lease or a mortgage i dare say does not exceed what may conveniently be written upon two pages of the conveyancy paper which is about twice the size of this parchment is seldom or never used it is common for leases to be made by a slight memorandum—a few lines only in the whole united states there are not probably five conveyancers by profession i do not know one and generally speaking lawyers are not even employed to look into titles not once perhaps in five hundred cases of sale or transfer in very complicated marriage settlements lawyers are employed who give the heads to a clerk and the papers are drawn up with a brevity which is without example here—i should say that for the same purposes in america not more than a tenth part as many words would be used as are used here nb i speak of legal

council which shall consist of not less than seven and not more than twentyone members the members of the council shall be elected by the commune according to a majority of votes every adult male enjoying civil rights is entitled to vote the vote is given in writing and put into a box which is opened in public and the successful candidates are announced the council represents the interests of the village in its relations with the government its duty is to protect the people from external encroachments and from internal disorder every village or town elects its mayor or chief who is ex

to strangers to prevent all acts of injustice and oppression to superintend and act for the welfare of the village to direct the management of its affairs in concert with the council and to prevent

committee to control the acts of the council the committee consists of the same number of members as the council it is elected for two years         the council is obliged to obtain the consent of the committee of control in the following cases—   in the formation of the budget and the assessment   in the defraying of any expenses   on the occasion of forming all contracts on account of the village which are not put up to public auction especially should the contract be to be made with a member of the council   on remunerating the members of the council for extra services   on remitting balances due to the village   in all charges whatsoever of the public disbursements on the public funds when the council and committee of control cannot agree on any matter no charge shall take place the committee on examining the budget shall be competent to annex any remarks it may have to make on the general state of the community and its concerns         how superior the organization of these communities to anything we have in this country here everything is anarchy or irresponsibility by this scheme the people are deprived of what they never can discharge with advantage—the power of deliberation on the parochial affairs while they have full scope in electing those who have to execute and deliberate care again is taken by the appointment of a committee that the council or parliament of the communes shall not exceed its powers in our parishes there is neither executive nor council one of the churchwardens is always a creation of the parson and hostile to the parishioners and the overseers hurry through their task the best way they can all the functions assigned to the mayor of the commune in wirtemberg are in england assigned to no one if a churchwarden or overseer have a relation an attorney the parish funds are liberally expended in prosecutions and litigation in general but in general individuals are left to protect themselves as they best can no viii collectanea relating to ch xxxi government simple or federative suggestions by mr neal army   it is an idea of mr benthams that the regiments and even the companies which compose the federal army should be made up of men from each of the states   if troops are to be encamped together or if they have not much to do at any time they should be mixed up as much as possible   but if they are in the field with an enemy before them they cannot be too little mixed   that very rivalry which is bad in a time of leisure would be good if a battle was at hand   the u s a have had some proof all the disaffection that occurred in the revolutionary war grew out of the separation of the troops the regiments of this state from the regiments of that state the men of the south from the men of the north still however when they came to fight a common enemy they fought the better for being separated and when they were joined as a body to attack the british on one side while the french as a body attacked the british on another side as at york town where cornwallis surrendered they behaved all the better for being each for itself   it is common to distribute mutinous troops and we know that the esprit de corps is quite as strong as any other spirit after a time   it should be an object with the federal government to get possession of certain posts and to garrison them in each of the state governments   the jealousy of the latter may interfere with such a plan for a time under a dread of consolidation but when they see that the federal head is rendered so much the stronger at so much less expense by having the command of such and such rivers and highways they will be likely to yield   we have found it so in u s a revenue   under the old articles of confederation the anglounited states had no power to raise money as a federal body what they received was by a sort of irregular contribution each state gave what it pleased and no more and almost every one tried to pay as little as possible even after the quota of each was fixed by the general congress   much of this evil might have been avoided if all the states had known what each paid   but for want of publicity certain of     the states were thought to be defaulters when they were not and others were supposed to be defaulters to a larger amount than they were   the consequence was that each state endeavoured to pay as little as it could   there was no reputation to be had by doing more than its duty—no disgrace to be apprehended from doing less   if a tax be levied by the general government—perhaps it may be well to offer to every state its quota at a discount   people in america are much in the habit of considering such discount as a profit or at any rate as an abatement for prompt pay   by the registration system of mr bentham added to the publicity which he provides for the difficulty of obtaining a true knowledge of the wealth and population of a country would be materially lessened   so much so that ten yearly tables might be furnished to the heads of department perhaps at less expense than one table such as they are now furnished with in u s a every ten years  0 the population would be shown every year    and if as all contracts are to be registered the parties could be induced to state the value of the subject matter the wealth of the country might be nearly estimated in the same way    but could they be so induced it is believed they could men pay larger taxes than they ought merely that they may be thought richer than they are most men desire to be thought richer than they are    and they find the political importance of their state to be in proportion to its wealth whatever else they may do they will not be likely to underrate the value of their own property    to counteract the tendency to exaggerate there will be the counterpoise of taxation      essay on the influence of time and place in matters of legislation      part i of this

knowledge that of a judge who by a stroke of the palsy had been reduced to a state of complete helplessness well and what was the provision made for him none at all there was no fund for it what—no fund for such a case no for there is no need of it no need of it no and thereupon came an intimation of the principle that has been seen in the text   —contents—constructed is this table in part from actual observation of the contents of the several chapters and sections partly from the anticipation of them it cannot be considered as completed till expression has been given to the whole of the code in the very words of it or as the phrase is—in terminis note here that the socalled unwritten law has no assignable words belonging to it this is the characteristic—the distinguishing property—the differential character—of it by which this fictitious stands distinguished from the only really existing sort of law namely the so called written law—the statute law by the matter of this table the whole field of penal legislation has been endeavoured and is supposed to be covered to a student an instructive sort of exercise would be—the finding or endeavouring to find a species of maleficent act which is not comprised in it this supposition of all comprehensiveness of course falls more or less short of being correct but in this line as in every other line of action which has for its object or end in view the maximum of happiness the impossibility of attaining the summit affords no reason against making continual approaches to it on each occasion as near as possible condemners of codification think of this and exhibit apposite reasons against it if you can offences affecting condition in life offences affecting the revenue offences affecting trade of the aggregate of the several portions of matter belonging to these several heads will be composed the principal portion of the aggregate of the matter of the assemblage or say collection of particular codes herein may be seen the relation between these same particular codes on the one part and this general code on the other part the several acts which in the several enactments of which the penal code is composed are taken for the subject matter of its prohibition may be considered as so many acts of codelinquency with relation to the so widely comprehensive genera of offence designated by the hereinabovementioned denominations of codelinquency namely by contributing in some way or other to the production of an evil effect of the sort of those which by the denomination in question are designated corresponding enactments suppose—do not anything from which detriment may ensue to the revenue do not anything from which detriment may ensue to the trade of the country to help conception take the observation following in a commonwealth erroneous enactment if performed in relation to either of these topics may be considered as an act of delinquency on the part of the legislature of delinquency for remedy to which the members therein concurring will collectively or severally be liable to suffer dislocation at the hands and by the votes of the members of the constitutive authority   —axioms—correspondent are these to the several acts of maleficence to which in consideration of such their quality it is thought fit to assign the character of acts of delinquency and the denomination of offences with correspondent treatment for the purpose of remedy as per chap xvi these axioms are enunciative of the sufferance or say pain respectively produced by those same offences and of the preponderancy of this pain over any pleasure producible by those same acts to the agent   —exemptions—so many distinguishable sorts of burthens as are imposed—whatsoever be the purpose—whether satisfaction or punishment—so many are the correspondent exemptions possible   —part ii—in this part is contained the remainder of the work it is composed of what relates to the several offences in so many chapters in each chapter so much being given of the general matter as is applicable to the offence which is the subject matter of that same chapter under the heads constituted by the denominations of the several genera of supposed maleficent acts which on account of their being so are spoken of as acts of delinquency and constituted offences—the several arrangements and enactments thereto belonging are grounded all of them on considerations derived from the contemplation of the more general propositions contained in the several chapters of part i reference to which will all along be given as also per contra in part i will reference be made to the several occasions on which in part ii application is made of them respectively   —offences severally—in the work will be seen a definition of each genus of offence as designated by the name by which it is designated here and where the genus is divided into species a definition of each species   —private—in the method here pursued commencement is made with those offences the conception of which is more simple and clear and from these it proceeds on with those of which the conception is more and more complex and obscure on this occasion why it may be asked does no such class appear as that of selfregarding offences especially as in the authors former works this class makes its appearance along with the others answer—   needless with relation to the present purpose would have been any such additional matter from the names of the several acts which correspond to them in the list here given of extraregarding offences the names of the several selfregarding offences may without difficulty be inferred   burthensome would the addition have been in proportion to the space occupied by it   discussion occupying additional space would have been necessitated by it   to the practical purpose of taking the acts in question for subjectmatter of prohibition backed by appropriate punishment—no more than a part of the whole list of extraregarding offences would have furnished corresponding articles to the list of selfregarding offences   of these articles scarcely would there have been any others than those affecting property and those affecting condition in life in the first case prodigality in the other case illassorted marriage and improvidently contracted engagement of servitude and in neither case would any demand for punishment have place   so much for the offences themselves by which disorders in the body politic are produced now as to the corresponding remedies in relation to maleficent acts of this class needless is—absurdly employed would be—the punitive plainly inapplicable the satisfactive which see part i chap xvi   in the case of prodigality the sole remedy applicable with advantage is the suppressive even in this case whether with advantage or not depends upon the system of procedure   under the existing system the remedy would he but an exacerbation of the disease expenditure going on but employed in the purchase of pain at the hands of lawyers instead of pleasure at the hands of all other sorts of dealers   under the proposed system with little or no expense the diarrhœa might be stopt at any time the case of nonage excepted if on the part of the judicial authority interference in any shape is in this case justifiable it is more on account of the interest of the family connexion of the prodigal than on the account of the prodigal himself and in this case no otherwise than in so far as by ties legal or moral in the event of his falling into indigence they would find themselves bound for his maintenance  0 common to all selfregarding offences is this highly material circumstance and quality—by no offence of this description is evil of the second order—danger or alarm in any shape to other persons at large—ever produced nor yet in the opinion of him who generally speaking is the best qualified judge any preponderant and nett quantity of evil even of the first order at the same time from evil done to the offender himself though by himself results commonly it must be acknowledged a derivative evil to other individuals to wit to those connected with him by the tie of interest—of the one sort or the other—selfregarding or sympathetic or both on this ground therefore—principally if not exclusively—will be found to stand any reason by which the legislature can be called upon to make or be justified in making any arrangements the effect of which would be—to produce in a table of this sort a demand for the insertion of any such class as that composed of selfregarding private offences   —wrongful—exceptions excepted in the case of every one of the several sorts of acts ranked in this table under the denomination of offences—to the name of the act this word wrongful it will be observed stands prefixed the case is—that on the present occasion an addition to this effect to the denomination and thereby a correspondent limitation applied to the idea could not it will be seen be refused the reason is—that of all these several instances no one is there in which to the act in question as designated by its name in the table it may not happen to be made lawful made lawful—that is to say on the consideration that in the instance in question whatever be the evil produced by the maleficent act it is balanced or outweighed by some equivalent or more than equivalent good made lawful—namely by the establishment of some power or right—private semipublic or public as the case may be as to the exceptions—these are constituted by the several denominations in the signification of which an assertion of the unlawfulness of the act in question is involved examples are   usurpation   seduction   rape   theft   embezzlement   peculation   robbery   rioting   rebellion  0 treason    contrabandism    mistrading    international maleficence   —simple—in the cases in which from the magnitude of the extent over which the suffering spreads the offence receives the quality and denomination of semipublic—it receives thereby a complexion quite different from the more ordinary and natural one and of the appropriate remedy the nature becomes correspondingly different in the case of an offence levelled at the person of an assignable individual the motive is most commonly antipathy or say illwill in the case in which the persons affected are so numerous that the offence takes a semipublic character seldom has illwill anything to do with it the motive is a selfregarding one—namely the love of wealth or say pecuniary desire as to the means by the conjunction of which with the motive the temptation is produced—where antipathy is the motive persons of all classes stand alike exposed to it in the case where pecuniary desire is the motive it is by the matter of wealth in considerable quantities that the means—the instrument by which the evil effect is produced—is most commonly afforded of the thus widespreading annoyance the most commonly exemplified efficient cause is—either some manufacturing course of operations carried on in a certain edifice or spot of ground or some particular quality in the situation of the edifice or spot of ground itself   —morbification c—these might be considered as constituting nothing more than so many aggravations of the one offence first mentioned—namely simple corporal vexation in which case they would fall under the head of that offence constituting so many aggravations of it instead of constituting as here so many genera of offences and as such occupying so many places in the list of those same genera  0 —inventorship—in the case of offences affecting property in general the subject matters of the actsprohibited are individual things in the case of offences affecting reputation of and exclusive title to inventorship they are species of things    —conditions in life—these are—

being opposites what is predicated of each may by an appropriate change in the context be with equal truth and propriety predicated of the other and so with regard to reward and punishment  another

purposed reduction in the quantity of it in the female sex beauty by the influence it exercises serves as a compensation for inferiority in the scale of physical strength and as a counterforce to the sinister power which it enables and prompts the male to exercise—and thus to diminish the inequality produced by it when on this occasion and in this view superiority in beauty is attributed to the female sex in comparison with the male all that to this purpose is true in what is said is that the enjoyment in which both are partakers is in the case of the male upon the average more intense the desire accordingly stronger the need more urgent and the inducement greater to employ service in all shapes for the obtainment of it in particular the negative service consisting in the forbearing to apply the superiority in the scale of physical force to the purpose of intimidation depredation and oppression in other shapes for as to beauty itself it has no absolute it has only a relative

nations the language of the numeration table being alike needed by all and accordingly alike employed by all and thus far the language of each may be understood by the natives of every other and to incomparably greater perfection than at present the language of any one is understood by the natives of that one † if in the present instance this same principle of denomination is in its nature applicable with more or less advantage so it will it is believed be found to be in a great variety of other instances if to any natural and material whole so to any ideal or other factitious aggregate—say for example to any of those aggregates which form the subjectmatter of natural history and in particular if classed by divisional operations performed in the dichotomous mode as exhibited tablewise in dr dumerils admirable french work on zoology but ere it had proceeded far this mode of designation would probably be found too unwieldy for use at any rate unless figures could be substitutes for words  responsibility partly with partly without design the ideas attached to the word responsibility and its conjugate responsible have come to us enveloped in a thick cloud and from this cloud has flowed it will soon be seen practical evil—evil in the shape of waste depredation and corruption covering the whole field of government in a word by it has been promoted and in no small degree the success of those designs by which instead of being as it ought to be minimized official expense has under so many governments though under no other in so high a degree as under the english been maximized the time for the employment of this important word having here arrived the operation of clearing it from the delusion of which it has been made the instrument could not any longer be delayed the laws being by the supposition apt—for on no other supposition can they be either made or continued—the object of the legislator must on every occasion be—to maximize compliance with them to maximize it on the part of all persons and in particular as on the present occasion on the part of all functionaries to maximize complianes with the laws is in other words to maximize the execution and effect given to them but at the hands of no person can any such execution and effect be depended upon except in so far as to this purpose the quality called responsibility has on his part place responsibility and that responsibility effective for the creation and preservation of this effective responsibility punishment it will be seen—punishment by means of the fear of it is the only instrument which as in other so in official situations can be employed for engaging a man to take upon himself the obligations attached to the situation reward in some shape or other is indeed an instrument and generally speaking the only apt instrument that can be employed but to the purpose of ensuring the regular and apt fulfilment of those same obligations punishment is the only instrument which the nature of man being such as it is can be made applicable with effect say then for shortness   for constituting effective responsibility punitional responsibility is indispensable   by reward—by remuneration—no effective responsibility can be constituted remuneratory responsibility may be spoken of but can neither be realized nor so much as conceived give a man the matter of reward and afterwards in case of misconduct on his part take it away again thus it is true may responsibility and in a proportionable degree be effected but it is by the taking it away not by the giving it that the effect is produced and the taking it away is not reward but punishment suppose money taken from him the same quantity of money would have had the same effect on him had he had it from any other quarter under any other name instead of having it from the legislator under the name of reward to functionaries however as to other persons reward is more acceptable than punishment accordingly while for the establishment of this same effective responsibility they have in the instance of other persons employed punishment and that in no small abundance—with correspondent abundance for the production of the same desirable effect in their own instance they have everywhere employed reward with this instrument thus employed not only have they represented themselves as having in their own instance established responsibility—responsibility under that very name and that responsibility effective—but the degree of its efficiency they have represented as rising in exact proportion to the quantity of the acceptable matter thus employed in no imaginable shape have they omitted thus to employ it but the matter of opulence being the only sort of acceptable matter capable of being applied on every occasion and to every person let pecuniary or the degree considered let opulential be the name of the sort of responsibility thus professed to be established seldom has profession been more hollow the pretended species of responsibility thus described—it is not in the nature of it to be effective not that for the speaking of it as such a pretence is wanting a pretence—nor that an unplausible one a pretence not only for the employing of this acceptable matter but for maximizing it for maximizing it in quantity and value—maximizing it in all imaginable shapes—pretence is always ready at hand that where punishment is employed its degree of certainty being given the efficiency of it—to wit to the purpose of effective responsibility—will be as its magnitude cannot but be admitted well then says the distributer of good things if this is true of punishment is it not so of reward answer not it indeed when towards the production of effective responsibility anything is done by means of the matter of reward it is not by rewarding that the effect is produced but by punishing—not by anything that has been given to a man but by that whatever it be which is taken from him and as to his having on a former occasion received it under the name of reward that as above shown makes not to this purpose any the smallest difference true it is—the more you give to a man the more there is that upon occasion you can take from him again provided always that at the time in question you find him in possession of it and that you can manage so as to get at it but whether to effective responsibility any very advantageous addition can be made by giving a man money for no more than a chance more or less considerable of being able to get that same money or a part of it back again from him—may be left to be imagined by no quantity of the matter of reward be it ever so great can any the smallest addition be ever made to the degree of effective responsibility producible without it—producible by punishment alone by punishment without reward you can make a man suffer as much pain as mans nature is capable of suffering and by all the matter of reward you can give him or take from him you cannot make him suffer any more what is more—by the pretended responsibility produced by the gift of money—effective responsibility so far from being increased is as has been seen diminished diminished and that in a degree proportionate to the opulence produced by the money the short reason is—that as the opulence increases the value and efficiency of any quantity of punishment professed or even endeavoured to be employed in the production of punitional responsibility is diminished diminished because as opulence increases so does the facilities of obtaining accessaries before and after the fact—of obtaining accomplices and supporters as in the shape of opulence thus is it with the matter of reward in all its several other shapes power factitious dignity reputation ease in so far as compatible with the enjoyment of power—in an official situation ease at the expense of duty and vengeance at the expense of justice the more in all these shapes taken together a man has of it the more is his effective responsibility—his responsibility to the effect of his being made to suffer in proportion to his misconduct diminished  see above p     see p    et seq  ratiocinative or say rationale deputy question why deputy rather than representative answer reason   because by the word deputy a plain matter of fact is indicated and that the appropriate one   because the word representative is less apposite and not exclusively characteristic in the concerns of individuals for example in the field of private right many are the cases in which it is necessary that one person should act on behalf of another without having been appointed by him for that purpose witness guardians of orphans administrators of the property of intestates and the like   under favour of this ambiguous and indeterminate use of the word representative in preference to deputy it is—that in the case of the english form of government the fictitious and fallacious security for the people against the monarch and the aristocracy has been imposed upon the people in the character of a real one to the members who in effect are located—some by the located and at pleasure dislocable instruments of the monarch others by individuals possessing an interest opposite to theirs the appellation of representative is habitually applied—applied and by many whom shame might deter from styling them deputies—deputies of the people belonging to the districts for which they respectively sit styled deputies they would be immediately recognised as impostors obtainers of a share in supreme power on false pretences styled as they are representatives the colours of imposture are not altogether so glaring upon the face of this their common name and as to their being members members of the body in question it is a truth but too incontrovertible as such they are admitted to act nor would any others be admitted in their places anything of course they would rather style themselves than what to the knowledge of everybody they are not to wit deputies question   why rather than depute answer by the word depute the matter of fact would indeed be expressed and in a manner equally apposite not however in a manner equally because not exclusively appropriate of the word depute continual need as will be seen has place for the designation of functionaries in little less than all the several subordinate grades of functionaries—located each of them by no more than a single principal and with functions wanting little of being altogether identical with his the deputy of the prime minister will thus be seen to be styled the prime minister depute the depute of a minister the minister depute the election minister for example the election minister depute and so on in the case of the justice minister and the several judges and other judiciary functionaries in all these instances the word depute is in the adjective form as in the case of the functionary who in scottish law is styled sheriffdepute to no functionary other than those deputed by the electors of the election districts to the legislature and of the election subdistricts to the several sublegislatures—is the term

of the law—that is to say of all the judges—and in conjunction with a set of professional lawyers whom as is shown they have even forced into the confederacy—have been proved to be in the constant and longcontinued practice of a crime—obtainment of money by false pretences—for which by an act of the legislaturea expressed in these very words men at large have for near a century past been consigned

prosecution of the accused no prosecution of the accuser no for by such prosecution the accused with their guilt upon their heads would be dragged into the broadest daylight and though there is but

indication given of the bearing of the law upon those same facts meantime by all parliament men by all judges by all professional lawyers of all classes—it is either read or heard of it is known to be

ruling few are plunged in the habit of those transgressions a single act of which suffices to consign any one of the subject many to punishment and infamy—the louder are they in that chorus of protestations and selfeulogies and mutual certificates of impeccability in which if there were any approach to the truth all security against deficiency in appropriate moral aptitude not to speak of

sanction as exercised by the publicopinion tribunal the points here enumerated are in general such that in relation to them—more especially in the case of persons in the situation in question—the force of the legal sanction cannot in the nature of the case be brought to bear in such sort as to subject men to punishment under the name of punishment for aberration in any direction from the assumed line of rectitude but in the exercise given to its power the publicopinion tribunal neither is nor ought to be nor can be fettered by those formalities by which the exercise of the power of the legal sanction ought everywhere to be and to a certain degree is everywhere restricted under the sort of law established and enforced by the power of the moral sanction—the penalty for transgression in whatsoever shape is forfeiture of a correspondent degree of popularity and no formality of trial is necessary to the giving execution and effect to this forfeiture take here an example for the purpose of an indisputably necessary branch of service—the legislature allots suppose a somewhat larger sum than could have been necessary—for no such impropriety of conduct without preponderant evil in the shape of dissension and danger of civil war could those who joined in the allotment be subjected to legal punishment as per section    legislation penal judicatory at the

whole the instrument may be considered as a sort of moral code adapted to the situation of legislators and as containing a sort of map of the field of legislation a moral disease with the seeds of which most if not all opinionprofessing instruments in use have hitherto been tainted and contributed to inoculate is—insincerity and besides the bad effect thereby produced on the whole moral frame—this vice in so far as on the occasion here in question it has place fails of producing the particular effect for the production of which it was designed for this reason it is that in the code

declared reservation declarations of this sort are apt to be regarded as no better than empty forms and the matter instead of being mended is but made worse by giving to the declaration the

by the use of those signs—more especially that most formidable sort composed of letters of the alphabet—it seems clear enough that not more than a comparatively small part could have been obtained

act section    the following are the words in which the mode of selection there appointed is described—such pieces of parchment or card being all as nearly as may be of equal size shall be delivered unto the associate or prothonotary of such court viz kings bench common pleas or exchequer by the under sheriff of the county or the secondary of the city of london and shall by direction and care of such associate or prothonotary be put together in a box to be provided for that purpose and when any such issue shall be brought on to be tried such associate or prothonotary shall in open court draw out twelve of the said parchments or cards one after another on this occasion what on the part of the prime author of this act and the draughtsmen respectively was the design—whether to continue the present practice of selection by choice called packing or to substitute chance to it—is more than the author of the present work by whom a volume on the subject had been published see the art of packing juries in vol v can take upon him to say what he does say is—that if having the act to draw it had been his design to continue the reality of choice with the appearances of chance to serve as a veil to it—unless the fear of being detected by the choice made of means so palpably adverse to the professed end had not stayed his hand—similar to the above wording probably identical with it is that which he should have employed in the new house of commons should any such chance happen to it as the containing so much as a single member to whom the difference between packing and nonpacking were anything different from a matter of entire indifference—a motion will be made for an amendment having for its object the substituting chance to choice in this case mutatis mutandis unless aptitude for the professed purpose be religiously avoided the wording in the text or something not dissimilar to it may by another chance be found to answer the purpose thus much as to theory now as to practice in the natural course of administration and judicature supposing on this or that occasion choice regarded as more conducive to expediency than chance—gratification will not probably be given to the desire but on some few and those adequate occasions for in some nine cases out of ten either the course taken by the verdict will be a matter of indifference or the verdict suggested by expediency will be deemed sufficiently secured by other causes by the multitude of the occasions on which no point would be to be gained by unfairness the habit of fairness being thus rendered a matter of notoriety—a high ground will thus have been formed from which to thunder down the charge of insincerity on whosoever shall have had the audacity to speak of any such intention as that of ever putting to their obvious use the instruments provided as above thereupon should peradventure any packingworthy occasion happen to take place there are they at hand—the effectual means of choice and the obvious manner of giving effect to them much too simple to present any demand for instruction in the nimblefingered art nothing is there to hinder a mark from being put on one side of a ticket

to the distance to which for the purpose of conversation sound is capable of being conveyed by means of these same conversationtubes between thirtyfour and thirtyfive years ago—on the occasion of an experiment made by the procurement and under the eye of the author of these pages—conversation of course with a velocity which was that of sound in the tone of ordinary discourse was carried through a tube of about   0 feet in length composed of course of a number of tubes fitted one into another airtight diameter according to recollection between one and two inches the dimensions of the building were not such as to admit of the drawing out that length into a right line but between interlocutor and interlocutor such was the distance as to render otherwise impossible any such communication without the greatest exertion if it could be held at all at any such distance as that at which it actually had place much about that time—information was received from several quarters of an interchange of sounds as having been produced at more than a miles distance between the two ends of an antique watercourse somewhere in the north of england about twenty years before that time—observation had by the persons in question been made of conversation habitually carried on in a low tone between the top and the bottom of a high house in cornhill london the year in which in a work intituled panopticon or the inspection house the universal inspection principle with this feature belonging to it was published and circulated in government circles was      since that time this instrument has in london found its way into several public offices among which is the custom house † in the london offices particular instances of this mishap have reached the ears of the author of these pages ‡ so in the case of prisons if in any shape abuse has existence in any place at any time—it is because to the extent which with the utmost facility in any place at any and every moment of

this place in the abovementioned individual instance the extinction of the plan had for its cause an accidental and individual state of things but the degree of neglect experienced by it thenceforward—not in england alone but throughout the civilized world and more particularly in france—and this not a particle of objection to it being uttered anywhere can scarcely be accounted for otherwise than by that mixture of cold jealousy and apathy the influence of which on human conduct is but too frequently visible before its receiving the above sanction in england in france lewis the xvi saw it and expressed his personal approbation of it before the reign of that gentlest and least noxious of monarchs had along with his life come to a close—the inventor of the political part of this plan the architectural being the invention of his brother was invited by authority to establish it in that country in ireland at the hands of the local authority adoption had been given to it and endeavour used towards its being carried into execution and effect—even before it had received adoption in england as above in spain in the year      it was recommended for adoption upon a national scale by a committee of the then existing legislature in england and perhaps the angloamerican united states—the practical adoption of it awaits the death of the two inventors no expense in the shape of misery and money being one should think in the minds of those on whom it depends too great to pay for exemption from the mortification of seeing the inventors reap so much as the satisfaction of witnessing the adoption of it unaccompanied by remuneration in any other shape—the correspondence illustrative of the authors attempt to put in practice his panopticon and its failure with a narrative

considered in itself this arrangement presents itself as eminently useful as being powerfully contributory to the superseding all need and demand for compulsion for the purpose of engaging men to the performance of this service so far as regards the defensive force establishment the usefulness of it seems therefore eminent and unquestionable but qualification on the part of one description of

men with horses if motion from place to place is required can conduct and manage a hundred and fifty rounds of rockets with this further peculiarity that the hundred and fifty rounds may upon occasion be all discharged at once or in any intermediate quantity hence though the accuracy of the rocket be inferior the utility of the other quality may frequently predominate  as to the length of the term what follows is from an english officer possessing in a peculiar degree the means of observation accompanied with appropriate aptitude for a first engagement in the infantry in a country not employing its troops chiefly in distant dependencies seven years a proper medium in the cavalry eight years or at most nine in the artillery the same where there are distant dependencies the terms may require

the head of the land branch of the defensive force service engagement for limited terms for example seven years was substituted and to a considerable extent to engagement for life by this arrangement the condition and character of this class of functionaries were in a high and conspicuous degree meliorated since that time the principle has been broken in upon by admixture of life engagements with limited term engagements for the unlimited terms bounties were made greater than for the limited and to the shortterm system obstruction has been opposed in other shapes by the observant functionary abovementioned no more probable cause for this departure has been found than the natural fondness for arbitrary power in the breasts of the high professional functionaries and sympathy for it in those of their civil exordinates and superordinates in respect of subsistence engaged for in the articles of food clothing and lodging the hardships imposed upon the functionaries of some classes were at one time enormous in the year      singularly extensive and alarming was the mutiny that took place in the sea service it had for its cause the frauds committed on the sailors by various functionaries in whose instance as in every instance under matchless constitution delinquency was either kept out of sight or if known left unpunished the mixture of depredation and oppression in this shape was however in consequence of the alarm put an end to but of the mutineers some were hanged others flogged to death punishment if any misapplied appositelyapplied none such is the allruling axiom  see to this purpose the comparison made of the state of the two defensive forces french and english by the french minister hyde de neuville refer to the newspapers of thelast week in july      † an

existence of the angloamerican united states general puttenham high in grade and popularity but weak in appropriate aptitude was in this way put by washington under the guardianship of colonel aaron burr such at least was the statement made by that once highseated and extraordinary aspirant after monarchy in the year   0  or thereabouts in the course of a sojournment of some months under the same roof under which this is written burr had for a year or two been about the person of washington in quality of aidedecamp or secretary of the disastrous state of the army in the netherlands under the command of the late duke of york in the war against the french revolution mention is of course to be found in the histories of the time if the account given of the matter in the year   0  to the author of these pages by a person high in rank and character who at that time was about the person of his royal highness be correct—the mind of the duke was during that time kept in a state of habitual confusion by the force of wine if in that case any such secret orders had place how far from effectual the policy was in that instance at least is now seen but in what proportion was it to the wine—in what to the birth—and in what to the education of the high functionary—that what was disastrous in this case should be attributed this is among the problems not so easily solved as stated  in relation to this matter the following statement was a few years ago at the request of the author delivered to him by a high functionary whose situation afforded ample security for correctness—in the united states the president has the entire patronage of the army at all times he may place every member of it from the private to the commanderinchief in any grade he pleases and keep him or send him upon his service as he pleases he may accordingly put any man officer or soldier over the heads of any officers he pleases notwithstanding this latitude given to power by law no instances are known of any extensive complaint made of any alleged abuse of it this being the case the evil obviated by this state of things is obvious a man unfit for the particular service in question—or for occupying the grade in question on the occasion of any service—is not as elsewhere appointed to the service through fear lest the nonappointment of him should give offence to some person having influence then as to grade a man unfit to occupy this or that rank is not lifted into it on no other ground than that of his having for a certain length of time been occupying this or that inferior rank for which he has been fit or unfit for the sake of coming at this or that individual whom the opinion of his extraordinary aptitude or the more easilyformed opinion of the strength of his connexions has marked out for an advance in rank—twenty others who have neither the one recommendation nor the other are not pushed upwards to make way for that one the president says section ii of article   of the constitution of      shall be commanderinchief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states on the foundation of this text and no other bearing upon the point has a careful scrutiny been able to discover stands the above comment power of location is one thing power of dislocation is another power of command over the persons located is a third perfectly distinct from both that they should all three be united in one and the same hand may in the present instance in the grade in question be altogether fitting be it so but that they are not necessarily so in the nature of the case is sufficiently evident and that in fact they are not so anywhere in inferior grades is matter of universal notoriety of dissension on a point of such importance would not prevention to wit be preferable to continued hazard—prevention that is to say by appropriate enactment note that on this occasion in the situation of president the constant existence of adequate appropriate aptitude intellectual as well as moral is—not the less necessarily though but tacitly—assumed assumed and assuredly not without adequate reason the appropriate moral aptitude the number of the stipendiaries being comparatively so minute the number of the fencible citizens in the character of radicals comparatively so vast the eyes of the people everywhere and at all times so widely open to the conduct of all functionaries and more particularly of this highest but the intellectual branch—whence is it to come the president ever since the first who could not but be a military man has not till the present year—   0 been so in any instance in any of these instances what can have been his opportunities for being acquainted with comparative degrees of appropriate aptitude on the part of military men the result is this as to aptitude superior to the ordinary in any of those situations it is not likely that generally speaking he should be able to form a wellgrounded judgment on any other ground than that of the opinion of those military functionaries whose conversation is within his reach but that for the security of his reputation on the occasion of so extraordinary and conspicuous an exercise of extraordinary power as that in question he would be anxious to take for his leaningstock the authority of the men of best general reputation among them is no more than may reasonably be expected so much as to the formation of a judgment on the question as to extraordinary plenitude of aptitude on the part of the objects of choice remains the case of extraordinary deficiency but of this a nonmilitary man will in cases to no small extent be a not inadequately qualified judge not less so even than a military man witness any generally conspicuous deficiency either in moral aptitude or in intellectual aptitude as applied to the ordinary intercourse and concerns of life for evil in this shape the discretionary judgment thus allowed to the chief executive functionary affords a remedy while the seniority system if no such power be admitted opposes an insuperable bar to all remedy behold here under a really existing constitution which has for its end in view the greatest happiness of the community and under which to power in every situation checks so efficient and adequate are applied—the vastness of the power which for the purpose of maximizing security ab extra may without any the least danger to security ab intra be established and conferred—while under a fictitious constitution which has for its end in view the greatest happiness of the ruling one and the subruling few the deficiency of useful power is joined with useless and mischievous power in quantity so profuse  the point dhonneur runs so high in the french army that a soldier once degraded can never reenter the service in any capacity any attempt to force him into it would produce mutiny among the men for the same reason a soldier never receives a blow even from his officer without resenting it sur le champ if he did in the first place his comrades would no longer keep company with him and in the next the officer that committed the outrage would inevitably be put to death  in english practice matter of remuneration thus employed is styled bounty  at any rate such it was

in hindostan in the name and under the immediate authority of the east india company—the crown it is stated in speaking of the war antecedent to the abovementioned year      had made a grant to the east india company of the whole of the booty—one half for their own use to defray the expense of carrying on the war the other half for distribution among the troops—had a similar grant been made on the present occasion we venture to assert continues the article that the prizes taken in      would long since have been distributed what the article has for its object is plainly enough the exculpation of the directors and from their authority it wears the appearance of having emanated the court of directors says an anterior paragraph lost no time in submitting the question to the lords of the treasury but in consequence of the legal impediments thrown in the way by the advisers of the respective parties to the appeal their lordships did not arrive at a decision on the point although submitted to them in march      until march      it is known that the decision was in favour of the actual captors thus far the newspaper article as to the reasonableness of the decision see the consideration alleged in behalf of it in the text as to the delay—for anything that appears the fault lay—not in the judges as above but in the system under which they had to act thus it is that under

evil in all shapes spring up in vast crops under it think of these men sitting in comfort and security and in their manufactory of factitious delay grinding away the value of those rewards on the efficiency of which the service such as it is cannot but in so high a degree be on all occasions dependent for its success  in a case known to the author of these pages—a leading member of

person of opposite political principles who was not known to him even by sight and this violation of law—what was it for only to save the trouble of producing by law an effect unquestionably innoxious

good in any shape would be done by the disclosure—and punishment more or less would be sure to fall on the informer—none whatever on the criminal—no disclosure will be made as for punishment a man

occupied the same length of time may prove delusive † as in jurisprudence and other branches of art and science so in military tactics a sort of science void of information is heaped up—composed of appellatives employed in posterior times to designate objects different from those which they were originally employed to designate examples are the following   grenadiers this was the name originally employed for designation of a select class of infantry whose employment consisted in throwing in the manner of so many cricket balls a species of hollow balls styled grenades so constructed as to burst in the manner of the bombs projected from mortars the idea appears to have originated in the war of sieges carried on for the amusement of louis the fourteenth for this favoured service the tallest men were selected and to make them look the taller and thence the more formidable the caps distinguished by the name of grenadier caps were employed these portable mortars or handgrenades being no longer employed the consequence is—that to nonmilitary men the term grenadier so far as its meaning can be collected from its derivation is delusive the actual meaning of grenadiers at the present period is a body of picked infantry of the line   dragoons as applied to mounted troops in general originally one body of men were exclusively employed on foot another body on horseback the distinction had its origin in feudal times during which between the man who was and the man who was not rich enough to keep a horse a great gulph was fixed in france in the reign of louis the fourteenth a discovery was at length made that by using one sort of weapon on horseback a man would not be altogether disqualified from using the same or another sort of weapon on foot hence came an amphibious class to which from their composite nature a dragon being a serpent with the wings of a bird—added to the terror which their experienced efficiency inspired—was given the name of dragons—in english pronunciation and consequent orthography dragoons  another proposable mode is—giving to each man two cards each with his name on the one side but on one of the two the words discharge me on

purpose of showing him the card that had not as above been employed  in relation to disbandment the following paragraph followed immediately on the conclusion of the extract on the subject of the united states which forms the note to art    in section   promotion anno        the termination of the war with england presented a case of no ordinary difficulty and delicacy the only purpose for which a regular standing military force is meant to be kept up in the united states is that of garrisoning a cordon of posts extending between  000 and  000 miles for a protection against aggression from the indians by the last war with england the regular force exclusive of the militia had been swelled to about   000 men at the conclusion of this war a determination was taken to give up every idea of keeping on foot any regular force whatever in the character of an eventual protection against the force of england of spain in short of any other foreign nation england in comparison with which no other nation could present any the least apprehension would in the event of a rupture be quite sure of making more or less way into the interior of the united states and equally sure of being ultimately drowned as it were destroyed or captured in case of perseverance of no such perseverance would the english nation henceforward be able at this distance to endure the expense from england therefore all apprehension is at an end remains as the only existing source of incursion from the indians against evil from this source the above number of  000 was and is regarded as sufficient the difficulty now was—how to reduce no   000 to no  000 i e to less than half not that there were not ways enough in any of which the thing might be done with the ultimate acquiescence of all parties concerned but the duty fell upon the president and the task was a most unpleasant and invidious one no skeleton regiments were to be preserved the reason has been already given no war at any rate any certain war from any civilized nation was apprehended therefore in proportion as the privates were dismissed the officers it was necessary should be dismissed with them the expedient employed was this—the president convened a general board composed of seven officers selecting of course for such was his obvious interest those whose reputation he regarded as standing highest in the country no such operation as dismissal took place but the existing army was regarded as being completely and all at once disbanded as being for the purpose for which it was raised no longer necessary but for a purpose of a different nature another army as above was to be raised here then a choice was to be made—made at the same instant—of all the several officers of whom the official establishment of this new army was to be composed the board accordingly had their meetings and it was by the concurrent suffrages of all the members or at least of the majority that the selection was made thus the number in question were appointed and none were dismissed admissions so many dismissions none what could not be expected was—that by those who found themselves left out of the list it should be regarded with a degree of satisfaction equal to that with which it was regarded by those whose names were comprised in it but whatever dissatisfaction was felt none of it it was evident could reach the president

the tutelary force of the popular or moral sanction a screen is in general a highly pernicious instrument but in the present instance the force against which it was employed as a screen was—not that of the popular or moral sanction—the tribunal of public opinion composed of members whose interest is the universal interest—but the force of individual selfpreference acting in opposition to the universal interest those who were not comprehended were they neglected no they were not neglected note was taken of them and as opportunity offered provision has been made for them in the civil line

and balls of the same size as the french musket the above statement is curiously at variance with the objections presented in preceding editions of the aidememoire and allowed to continue in the last the whole of which are founded on the supposition of mismanagement there is no necessity for the ball being driven with violence all that is required being that by means of its greased cloth it should go down smoothly like the sucker of a pump hence the loading is easy either on foot or horseback the powder to be in blank cartridges like those used in exercise the balls covered with their greased cloth twisted together at the ends the ramrod of hard wood cylindrical of nearly the diameter of the bore any bruise from an iron ramrod making the barrel useless ever afterwards it is easy to add a bayonet of    or  0 inches long making the whole length the same as in the musket and without removing the power of taking aim many other suggestions might be added tending to increase the ratio of the comparative efficiency of the instrument  amendment in english practice every change or say alteration produced or designed and endeavoured to be produced in the body of law which it finds established being supposed and affirmed to be for the better—every discourse having for its declared purpose the effecting any such alteration is termed an amendment and for the effecting of any such alteration this term amendment—this and no other already being in use in english practice and thence in french may after this notice without danger of misconception continue to be employed and accordingly after this notice to say of any printed portion of discourse under the denomination of an amendment that it is an unapt or a bad amendment and that it is no amendment is what may be said without selfcontradiction in effect  in english practice about      a design was formed of consolidating parts of the statutelaw by putting into one statute matter which had entered into the composition of divers statutes and thereupon in and by the consolidating statutes declaring those other statutes or parts of statutes repealed but when that which was thus dealt with was not an entire statute but only a part of a statute not by express designation but only by general designation of the contents has it been undertaken to be repealed so much of the statute in question as relates to such or such a matter or to that effect—consequences   it is left open always to argument and sometimes to real doubt what the exact portion of matter is that was meant to be so dealt with   the body of the law is left encumbered with all these carcases—some dead—some as above in a state between life and death for this mode of proceeding one cause may be found in the condition in which in respect of method that part of the rule of action which is not a mere fiction is still left—a mass in which be it ever so enormous no parts distinguished one from another by the figures of the numeration table are to be found in the statute book of every other civilized nation the aggregate body of the laws is partitioned into divisions and subdivisions one within another the results of the last division being commonly termed articles—these articles all along distinguished by numbers and in respect to length each article differing little if anything from the sentences in a literary work at large in the statute book of england the whole mass of matter to which authentication is given by one and the same touch of the sceptre is termed a statute and the statutes which in the course of the session follow one another are distinguished from one another by the title of chapter with a number annexed but of these statutes though there are many of them each of which is of a bulk equal to that of a reasonable volume not one has any authentically recognised parts in practice somehow or other in the printed copies a division has been made of them into numbered sections but neither this nor any other division has place in the original manuscript and thus it is that the practice of repealing no otherwise than by description is kept up but this practice—though it has this for its cause has no excuse for if the thing described were—not the purport but the terms—not the meaning but certain words—for example from such or such words in such a line in such a page in the governmentprinted copy to such and such other words in such another line of the same or such other page—awkward as would be the expedient uncertainty as to the matter intended would at any rate stand excluded the authors views on this subject will be found at greater length in the tract on nomography vol iii p     et seq the special defect above noticed was singularly illustrated in the consolidation of the customs acts in     —part of the project above alluded to after enormous exertions had been made to collect and describe all acts and portions of acts bearing on the customs it was found after the consolidating acts were passed that some had been omitted and that a supplementary repealing act was necessary—ed  of the practicability of colonization for relief against excess of population the

judge might not be sufficiently comprehensive † theatre theatres be it remembered there are moveable as well as immoveable  the word informer though in its original signification exactly equivalent to informant has by the dyslogistic import which has become attached to it been rendered with reference to the purpose here in hand unfit for use  an appellative customarily employed in the english language in particular as synonymous to a suit is a cause but such is the ambiguity resulting from the other import—the logical or as some would say the metaphysical import—given to this same word that throughout this present work it has seemed advisable to abstain from giving any employment to it suit has for its conjugates as logicians say to sue to pursue suitor pursuer pursuit cause employed in this sense has no such conjugates  vol vi p     a commentary on mr humphreys real property code  executionalists executioner would have been the more simple and thence the more convenient

employed in the infliction of dolorific corporal punishments  in this case in and by existing codes the judge has been spoken of as acting ex officio or ex mero motu and in penal cases the course or

november      such is the state of things that must be believed to have had place in the judiciary establishment of scotland if credit be given to certain letters on the subject in the globe and traveller and the morning chronicle of that time there may still      be four successive grades of appeal in scotland beginning with the sheriffsubstitute a case may be carried before the sheriff thence to the outerhouse of the court of session thence to the innerhouse and lastly to the house of lords—ed  note that under the system of procedure which the herebyinstituted judiciary establishment all along bears reference to and supposes to be in existence in no case has the judge above for the basis of his decision any mass of evidence other than that which has been present to the cognizance of the judge below this supposed for no expense can there in the judicatory above be any demand other than the expense of obtaining professional argumentation on the ground of that same evidence for the eventual defraying of that expense the finding adequate security should such be the mandate of the judge below may under that same system of procedure be a condition to the allowance given to the act of making appeal in that case the judge above will not take cognizance of any appeal in the case of which the appropriate written instrument does not contain a word or words of permission signed by the judge below throughout the whole tenor of this code and thence throughout this section in particular a power the existence of which is supposed to have place on the part of the judge is on every occasion in so far as in his eyes the information in question is necessary to justice—the power of making inquiry into the pecuniary circumstances of every individual who in any character whatsoever comes before him for suppose no such power to have place denial of justice coupled with and aggravated by exercise of oppression may instead of administration of justice be the result in point of fact should the case be such that in no judicatory as yet having existence under any government any such power has place—on this supposition so it is that in no judicatory as yet in existence is fulfilment given to the ends of justice true it is that to an amount more or less considerable evil will be among the number of the results of such inquiry but by this undeniable fact no reasonable objection to the institution of such inquiry will be opposed for not less true is it that from beginning to end the whole business of judicature is but a choice of evils but injustice depredation and oppression to any amount under colour of justice may under any government be accounted for and shown to be natural by one notorious fact namely that under every government as yet in existence the system of procedure has been the product of the labour of a set of men whose interest it has been—that for their benefit injustice depredation and oppression in so far as beneficial to that same sinister interest should be maximized but a question that may be asked is—the judge below in a case in which it is his intention to do injustice and this is a case which must throughout be provided for will he thus lend his hand to the frustration of that which by supposition is his own purpose should not the act of making appeal have without more ado the effect of stopping the execution of the decree of the judge below—leaving it to the judge above to impose on the party appealing the conditional obligation abovementioned questions these—for the consideration of the legislature but to which no determinate answer can be given till the very tenor of the code of procedure and of the corresponding part of the substantive code has been determined against this evil in section    incidental complaint book will be seen a provision which even of itself holds out a promise of being—not merely an efficient but even a sufficient remedy it consists in the conveying on every occasion to the judge above information of everything which on that same occasion has been either done or said by the judge below thence it is that by the subordinate judge no criminal act positive or negative can be committed but information thereof will find its way to the cognizance of such his superordinate in the procedure code in certain suits of a penal nature the question may come to be started discussed and settled—whether for the avoidance of preponderant evil in the shape of expense vexation and delay it may not upon the whole be advisable to inhibit the exercise of the right of appeal the question belongs not to this place only to obviate the imputation of want of due consideration is mention here made of it  this was written during the reign of charles the tenth—ed

indication the alleged intolerableness of it would be stated as a peremptory bar to the proposed institution would if this note with the alleviation indicated by it had formed part of the text have employed his ingenuity in representing it as ridiculous and as forming in this way an adequate ground for rejection and contempt the whole remainder of the proposed code being disposed of by silence an article such as this would in that case have been held up to view in the character of an adequate specimen of it the argument here supposed is no other than one to which some five and six and thirty years ago it actually happened to be exemplified on the occasion of an arrangement of a slightly different nature to which the one here in question is now substituted the fallacy being thus characterized and exposed in utero fear of shame may perhaps in some instances suffice to render it abortive as often as in relation to any subject a plan or any component arrangement belonging to it
