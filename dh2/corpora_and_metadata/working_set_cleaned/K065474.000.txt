the history of the life of thomas ellwood or an account of his birth education etc with diverse observations on his life and manners when a youth and how he came to be convinced of the truth with his many sufferings and services for the same also several other remarkable passages and occurrences  written by his own hand  to which is added a supplement by j w  heb      by faith the elders obtained a good report the second edition  london printed and sold by the assigns of j soul in white hartcourt in graciousstreet       the preface gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost john      was the direction of our savior to his disciples after he had fed the multitude which may well and usefully be applied to the collecting and preserving the accounts of the lives of good men men who in their day have been eminently useful in those stations of life wherein god by his good providence has placed them and this preserving by publication is the rather to be done when themselves do leave behind them in writing an account of their lives and of the signal mercies of god to them therein for from such accounts may best be gathered by the reader the mans particular state exercise and growth in the work of restoration out of the fall and degeneracy and in the reading thereof be not only excited to bless the name of the lord on his behalf but also gain some direction from the path so fairly tract out and ground of hope that by being faithful they may likewise attain to the same good experience  there is not with me any doubt but something of this kind may be the lot of many into whose hands this treatise may happen to come for that they will herein meet with variety of exercises and the providence of god therein all related with great strength and plainness of speech our deceased friend thomas ellwood having been a man whom god had endued with singular abilities both as a man and as a christian which is evident not only from this short account of his life which was written by himself and by the supplement added hereunto but more largely from his many useful labors and services in the many books which he writ in the defense of truth and the friends thereof for which service he was in a particular manner qualified by spiritual wisdom and christian obedience to which in him was added great strength and depth of judgment wherein he could discern the spirits of others and was very much the master of his own as did appear to such who knew him not only by the soundness of his reasoning and the seasonableness of his words but also by his great and exemplary modesty in that he was not hasty to propose nor rudely tenacious to insist on what he had proposed if any thing though not well expressed yet well intended was offered by any one much weaker nay though but by a babe in christ  his countenance was manly and cheerful his deportment grave yet affable and courteous even to the meanest person his conversation innocent pleasant and instructive yet severe against any thing that was beyond the liberty of truth these with his other qualifications of body and mind did render him both very acceptable and very useful as a friend as a neighbor and as a member and elder in the church of christ and the more for that his time was chiefly employed in being serviceable in one or other of these capacities  i might here particularly mention the several labors of our deceased friend according to their respective times and the nature of their several subjects but much of this being already done in the ensuing pages i choose to remit the reader thither by which possibly he may be excited to the perusal of them and shall only say concerning them that the judicious reader will easily observe that his method and style do denote him to have been a scholar and yet not farther so than the simplicity and purity of the truth whereof he made profession would permit him  i was with our friend thomas ellwood the greater part of his sickness in which he was also very frequently visited by our friend george bowls who was his neighbor to whom therefore i refer for the account which he may give of his sickness and dying words  as it was my good lot to be well acquainted with him though only in the latter years of his life and know that he did neither use nor encourage the bestowing elaborate encomiums upon persons deceased so neither shall i add further concerning him than to say with the apostle concerning the faithful heb      that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaks  j w london the   th of the  d month      george bowls his testimony concerning thomas ellwood dear friends it is in my heart briefly on this occasion to commemorate the tender dealings of the lord with his people in this latter age of the world when it has pleased him in love to poor lost man graciously to appear by the breaking forth of his glorious gospel day and by the secret divine reaches of the hand of god which has been felt and seen in the light of it many have been drawn in their spirits to seek after the lord and to enquire after the knowledge of the way of life and salvation and blessed be his holy name who was graciously pleased by the inshinings of this divine light in the hearts of many to expel the darkness and rend the vail and then was the arm of his mighty power made bare for the gathering many thousands to the saving knowledge of himself and in that day was the lord pleased according to his promise to pour forth of his spirit upon sons and upon daughters yea upon servants and upon handmaids and many were made to prophecy and being qualified by the holy spirit which they received and were baptized by it into his name became willing and were freely given up in obedience to the lord and in bowels of tender love to the souls of mankind in his power to preach the gospel of life and salvation to those to whom they were sent and many were turned from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god by their ministry amongst whom our dear deceased friend and brother thomas ellwood was one whose conscience was reached and awakened by the powerful ministry of dear edward borough as i have heard him relate and as by the following sheets will more plainly appear and of that day and time and the worthy instrument by whose ministry he was convinced and turned unto god and made sensible of the divine principle of life and light in his own heart have i heard him speak with great regard and also of the sufferings which did attend him after he received the truth in his fathers family for the truths sake and how the lord preserved him in that time under the various exercises which he passed through for truths testimony which for christs sake he was conscientiously concerned to stand in according to that plainness and simplicity which truth then led and still continues to lead the sincere disciples of christ into by which they were distinguished from the world and for the sake thereof they were despised of men and hated of the world such was the plain language of thou to one and refusing the hathonour for which dear t e suffered not a little in that day as by the following account of his life more fully appears and it were well if all who come up in a profession of the blessed truth in this time were faithful in these and in the other branches of its testimony and let all consider that the neglecting thereof is in a degree a making void the sufferings of the faithful and strengthening the hands of evil doers who for the sake of their testimony loved not their lives to the death but underwent cruel mockings buffetings stonings whippings stockings revilings imprisonments and spoiling of goods rejoicing in the lord that they were counted worthy to suffer either less or more for his name sake in respect of which this my dear friend was a good example he being a man of a steady mind and very patient in suffering as well as faithful in his testimony for truth and took joyfully the spoiling of his goods wherein he was tried but a few years before his death he was often concerned in defense of truths testimony both against our professed adversaries and also against the libertine spirit which appeared in some professing the same truth with us who opposed themselves against that good order and discipline which the truth led friends into all which will abundantly appear from the books themselves which are in print which he writ upon various occasions and upon diverse subjects and let not his great labor and industry be forgotten in his writing those two historical volumes relating to the old and new testament a work truly great and is and may be of great use and service by all which his many labors it may be perceived by the wary and enlightened reader that the lord had endowed him with an excellent gift and qualified him for the service of truth his church and people in which he employed the talent which the bountiful lord had given him to the honor of the great giver and to the comfort and edification of the church of christ but more especially were his services known to the brethren in this county of bucks most of which are fallen asleep and but few remaining here who knew him in his beginning or his first services for the lord his church and people amongst whom he was a zealous asserter of that excellent discipline the lord had opened in and led his people to for the preserving his church as a garden enclosed for which cause how did many of those libertines set themselves fiercely against him and shot their arrows at him but the lord defended him and covered his head in the day of battle and his bow abode in strength and his bough spread over the wall and continued fresh and green but a blast from the lord came upon their evil work and how have they melted away and how is their strength failed and their work brought to naught but the blessing of the lord is with his people even with the faithful to this day whom he has preserved as a peculiar treasure to himself blessed be his holy name for evermore and furthermore it may be truly said of this our dear friend that as the lord fitted him for his service so was he eminently serviceable in his hand in the church of christ particularly in these parts of which there are many living witnesses in this and the adjacent counties of his great labor of love having served the church freely with great diligence and faithfulness the true sense of which ucheth me and others with the deeper sense of the reat loss the church has by his removal but eing also sensible through the lords goodness that ur loss is his eternal gain i feel in my heart n humble submission to the will of him who does hatsoever pleases him both in heaven and in earth and who shall say unto him what do thou and it is the tender breathing of my spirit to the god and father of our lord jesus christ that he would be graciously pleased in pity and compassion to his poor people to raise up fit and furnish more faithful servants for his work and service and make them zealous for his name and truth upon the earth that the place of this my dear friend and other faithful servants of the lord and his people of late removed from amongst us in these parts may be supplied and that the spouse of christ may amidst all her tribulations afflictions and sore exercises be made to praise the lord and bless his holy name who takes away one and raises up another and blesses his children with his goodness according to his promise made of old by the holy prophet isa    ver   saying i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring and thus has the lord preserved zion from age to age and i doubt not but am fully persuaded that he will still bless his people and preserve zion and deliver her from all her enemies  and my dear friends brethren and sisters although it be matter of sorrow to us to part with our dear friends especially such as have been made serviceable in their day and have faithfully served the lord and his people in their generation as it may i hope without just occasion of offense to any be said of dear t e that he was a man who served the lord in faithfulness and his people with cheerfulness and his neighbors with uprightness and integrity and therefore both they and we have the greater loss yet may we not sorrow unseasonably as those which sorrow without hope but believing that the lord has taken him to himself in mercy though it may be in judgment to some who were unworthy let us all learn resignation to his blessed will and say with holy job the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord and dear friends i may farther signify unto you that it being my lot to be with this our dear friend of whom i am speaking almost every day of his last ilness i did observe in him to my great comfort and satisfaction a quiet composed frame of mind and spirit and resignation to the will of god when i came first to him which was soon after i heard of his being taken ill which was the   th day of the  d month i found him very much disabled by the distemper which was thought to be a palsy that had seized him especially on his right side so that he could not stand alone nor help himself but a little with his left hand and his speech was also very much interrupted insomuch that it was with great difficulty for the most part that he expressed himself so as to be understood some time after i came to him there being also other iends with him we sat down together under a ighty exercise of spirit waiting upon the lord  deep silence with our eye to him it pleased the lord eminently to appear amongst us and to fill our earts with the refreshing streams of his divine love and to open the mouth of one of us in prayer and supplication and the lord was graciously pleasd abundantly to replenish our spirits to our mutu comfort in a living sense of divine goodness and this our dear friend expressed himself in great enderness and brokenness of spirit on this wise  am sensibly comforted and refreshed in this visit and that afternoon he fixing his eyes upon me with great earnestness of spirit expressed as well as he could at that time a great concern that was upon his mind for truth and the friends of it in diverse particulars especially in relation to our own monthly and quarterlymeetings the writings of both which had been under his care for more than forty years after which he was much eased in his spirit and so continued to the last so far as i perceived often saying when asked how he did i am easy i am quiet and he was often very tender in his spirit expressing his resignation to the will of god whether in life or death saying if the lord has no more work for me to do i am content and resigned to his will and my hearty farewell to all my brethren and at another time nearer his end he said to us present in much brokenness of heart i am full of joy and peace my spirit is filled with joy or to this effect for by reason that his speech was so weakened sever things could not be so well collected which he at time spoke in a tender sense of the lords goodness the sense of which deeply affected some of as who were with him and my heart is sorrowfully affected at this time in a sense of the great loss which the church of christ in these parts especially has by his removal but in this i am comforted in a living sense of the lords mercy and goodness toward him in carrying him through his affliction in great patience and quietness under which he was sweetly refreshed by the streams of divine love and his cup was often made to overflow and we who were present being touched with a sense thereof were comforted therein being in a travail of spirit for him and did in our measures truly sympathize with him under his affliction and i am fully satisfied he laid down his head in peace with the lord and is gathered to his everlasting rest he departed this life the   st of the   d month      about the  d hour in the morning in the   th year of his age he received the truth in the year      and lived in fellowship with the friends of it about    years and i think it may be truly said of him that as he lived so he died the servant of the lord and his people and has left a sweet savor behind him and his memory is blessed with the righteous for ever amen  george bowls the   th month      a testimony from the monthly meeting at hungerhill the seventh day of the fourth month      concerning our dear and wellbeloved friend and brother in the truth thomas ellwood deceased that the dead which die in the lord are blessed of him we have great assurance of from john the divine his writing to the seven churches rev    ver    where he tells them that he heard a voice from heaven saying write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea says the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them of which number we have no cause to doubt but this our dear friend is one who was eminently serviceable in the church of christ a man to whom the lord had given a large capacity beyond many and furnished him with an excellent gift whereby he was qualified for those services in the church in the performance of which he did shine as a star which received its luster and brightness from the glorious sun of righteousness he was wise but humble condescending to the weak and ready to help where he saw and felt sincerity but sharp to that which he apprehended to be insincere and deceitful for which cause he was not acceptable to hypocrites and disorderly walkers yet he was a man of a very acceptable and agreeable conversation as well as sober and religious both in the church and in the world being of a free and affable temper and disposition far from affectation but of a courteous behavior and graceful carriage to all and very serviceable to and amongst  neighbors he was very near and dear to many  us who were most intimately acquainted with him and his memorial is sweet to us his services in o meetings and in the quarterly meeting for the county of bucks were very great and of many years ctinuance in which he showed great diligence be of a ready mind willing to serve the church according to that ability which the lord had given him and his heart and house was open to his friends and the monthly meeting was kept there more than forty years and remains there to this day our loss is great by his removal but in this we are satisfied that it is his everlasting gain being gathered as we have good cause to believe to his eternal rest the knowledge we had of him and the good account which we have received of him in the time of his last ilness by those who were most constantly with him and of his quiet and peaceable departure does sensibly engage our hearts to acquiesce in the will of the lord and therein we have peace and comfort he departed this life the first of the third month      and was honorably buried in friends burying place at new jourdens in the parish of giles chalfont in the county of bucks the fourth day of the same month  signed by the appointment of the monthly meeting by us george bowls william grimsdall james smith daniel wharley daniel roberts abraham barber thomas olliffe   a testimony from the womensmeeting concerning thomas ellwood a concern is upon our spirits to write somewhat concerning our dear deceased friend and elr thomas ellwood who was highly valued by  for that wisdom and counsel were with him and ing of a free and affable temper ready to assist ose which stood in need thereof encouraged many to ply to him for advice under the diverse circumnces and various exercises which this uncertain orld affords which we have found to be for our od as we followed it he was an early comer to eetings seldom hindered by weather though he liv three miles distant when bodily weakness did  hinder of late years being often indisposed as to his ealth the monthly meeting was held at his ouse about forty years and he always looked very kind d courteous on friends when they came there and ok care and notice of the meanest who came in ncerity he was zealous for good order and ainst such who being in an apostatized spirit opsed it and may well be numbered amongst the wories whose names are upon record for their valor is this our friend worthy to be who never turned his ck on such who opposed the truth but stood his round as his printed sheets on such occasions do w as also his other works of several kinds do nifest how great endowments god had bestowed on  yet we who knew him in his conversation are engaged to set forth how kind and condescending he was to the weakest capacity and would help out when they wanted a word that generations to come may learn how good it is to forsake all and follow christ jesus as this our friend did and the account of his life following shows who not only gives wisdom but teaches humility also  he was greatly respected by his neighbors for his services amongst them his heart and doors were open to the poor both sick and lame who wanted help and had it freely taking care to provide things useful for such occasions blessed also with good success often saying he mattered not what cost he was at to do good such lament their loss what then may we do who miss him in an higher station in his great service in the church of christ but even desire to be resigned to the will of the lord who preserved him through all his hardships to a dominion over false brethren and is now out of their reach and of temptation too on whose head the blessing asked for joseph rests who as a fruitful bough his branch spreads over the wall of opposition and his bow abode in strength the hands of whose arms were made strong by the help of the mighty god of jacob to whom be the glory for what he has wrought in our day whose own works praise him for evermore and the tears of sorrow that we shed for the loss of this our deceased friend let them be remembered to bow our spirits each of us into a godly care that we may com up according to our several capacities to follow the lord faithfully in a godly zeal for his honour and so come to lay down our heads in joy and peac as this our friend expressed he did  this eminent servant of christ was early convined of the way of truth wherein he continued to the finishing of his days for the sake of which he soo became a sufferer not only by imprisonment for worshipping god in the assemblies of his people but also from his father by whom he was made as an outcast for no other cause but for his faithful testimony in taking up the cross to the worlds behavior and language whereupon he was invited by his much valued friend isaac penington to his house where he abode several years until he married he was a blessing in as well as a great comfort and help to that family and by his wise conduct therein gained much esteem not only from the elders but the youth whom he instructed in learning and though most of them are by death removed yet one still remains who from certain and experimental knowledge can commemorate his worth being engaged thereto from a sense of the benefit of his good and wholesome advice given at sundry times and on diverse occasions which friendship continued firm to the last  his natural capacity was large and his understanding in the things of god very deep which excellent qualifications meeting in one rendered him useful beyond many to his country as well as very serviceable in the church by both which he is and will be greatly missed but he is gone to his grave in a full age and gathered as a shock of corn in its season having done his days work faithfully so that saying may be verified in him the end crowns all  his sickness was sudden which soon deprived him of the use of his limbs yet he retained the faculties of his inward and outward senses clear all along and notwithstanding at times his pains were great his exemplary patience and composed resignation was remarkably apparent to those that visited and attended him so that their sorrow in parting with so dear a friend was intermixed with comfort in beholding the heavenly frame of mind wherewith he was adorned  thus after all his labors he entered into everlasting rest and left many behind weeping though not without hope that they shall again meet at the general assembly of saints where the redeemed shall sing praises to their blessed redeemer whose right it is to reign for ever  we have this farther to add namely that our esteem of him was great because of that real worth that was in him through the operation of the mighty power of the lord that separated him from the love of the world so that he chose with moses rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and it pleased the lord to fit him with wisdom and counsel so that he was made able to give judgment in difficult cases wherein many of us have particularly received benefit and therefore have cause to lament the loss we have by his removal and oh say our souls that the lord would raise up many more in his room to the praise and honor of the good husbandman and it is our desire that we who are yet behind may be made able so to steer our course through this troublesome world that when our end comes we may lay down our heads in peace with the lord and leave a good savor behind us as this our friend has done  this is written in true love and respect to the memory of our deceased friend as it pleased the lord to move upon our hearts and being read and approved in our womensmeeting at hungerhill the   th of the   th month      was subscribed in behalf of the said meeting by us  mary baker mary wharley mary larcum   concerning our dear friend thomas ellwood of hungerhill he was much esteemed amongst good men good men in their day and station upon the earth represent him who made all things good in the beginning who said genesis     let there be light and there was light and also said ver    let us make man in our image after our likeness oh high favor so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them v    and blessed them and gave them dominion under himself for he was chief commander then and so he is witnessed to be now where his heavenly image is come into again and men live in it as did this our dear friend who did good in his day and generation counsel was with him to give to such as needed and did apply to him he was of a tender spirit and had dominion over passion over pride and over covetousness so he was comfortable to and in his family he was amiable in the church of christ and a doer of good amongst his neighbors and being an elder amongst and with the elders he has not only obtained a good report but also the blessing in the promised seed which bruises the serpents head he was valiant in suffering for his testimony which he held in the truth and may not i say unwearied in his labors for the setting forth the fame and excellency of it whereby we see what the truth makes men to be who do come under the conduct and power of it even as fixed stars in the firmament of his divine power who has caused the morning of his heavenly and glorious gospelday to break forth and as with the day that springs from on high in tender mercy has he visited many souls and early did this our worthy deceased friend embrace it as it appears by his testimony concerning that eminent and blessed messenger and mnister of the gospel g f  and now he having endured the times of proving and the days of tribulation and suffering togethe with the perils and slights and undervaluings of fal brethren against whose ungodly work he was engaged to stand as a noble warrior in the defense of and for the glorious gospel of christ not admiring mens persons but the work of the gospelpower and although he was endowed with parts and accomplishment above many he was humble and grave not selfseeking but esteeming the power of truth though it did appear through mean instruments he was honorable and honored for that he sought not his own honour but the honor of truth not only by his sufferings for it and labors in it but also in standing firmly against the loose libertine ones who would have thrust in amongst the lambs and flock of christ i an unclean adulterating spirit from the life of the true shepherd and heavenly husband christ jesus but to the tender hearted and sincere minded he was strengthening and comfortable i knew him when  was but young and i can truly say my heart has often been affected on his behalf with thankfulness to the lord who made him as a strong pillar in his spiritual house with many more of his dear servants and children who shall no more go out his memory is in my heart esteemed beyond what i can write oh surely the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance psalm       and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever dan       eliz richardson hunger hill the   th of the   th month      richard vivers his testimony concerning thomas ellwood he was a man of great wisdom and understanding and the lord the giver of it being pleased to visit him in his early days made choice of him and by the sanctification of his holy spirit fitted and prepared him for his work and service whereunto he was called and although he did not often appear as a minister yet in those meetings set apart for the affairs of truth he often appeared in great wisdom having an extraordinary talent given of the lord for that work more than many other brethren and faithful he was in waiting for instruction from god to improve the same to his glory and the churches advantage for nothing was more desirable to him than to be employed in the lords service so it pleased the almighty to furnish him with understanding and strength faithfully to do his days work and now he has taken him to himself where his soul is at rest and although our loss be his gain therein i with many more are greatly comforted for i can truly say i loved him in the truth from the first of my acquaintance with him and so it remained to the end of his course being near forty years since we knew each other and when ever we conversed together our discourse was chiefly concerning heavenly things and the affairs of the church and i always thought my time well spent with him although opportunity would not serve for so much of it as i desired had it been the will of god  and this i can say according to my observation he was a man true to his friend and deliberate in the choice of his acquaintance to whom he showed real love and sincerity of heart and he was one of a steady and sound judgment as to the things of god often desiring that those who came amongst us especially children of believing parents might not settle down only in a form of godliness without the power at which door the apostasy entered but that they might be raised up to walk in that wherein the saints fellowship does stand which is the light of our lord jesus christ enlightening every man that comes into the world and then the ancient testimony of truth will be more and more raised up in their hearts and they being preserved of the lord in it it will more be maintained in its several branches as in former days blessed be the name of the lord who has a people in these latter ages of the world to whom he has given power to stand for his truth whilst on earth and to be tender of the honor of his name of the number of whom this our deceased friend and brother was who although dead yet his memory lives and will be preserved amongst the righteous in generations yet to come  richard vivers banbury the  0 th of the    th month      an index

account of tithes    the history of the life of thomas ellwood although my station not being so eminent either in the church of christ or in the world as others who have moved in higher orbs may not afford such considerable remarks as theirs yet inasmuch as in the course of my travels through this vale of tears i have passed through various and some uncommon exercises which the lord has been graciously pleased to support me under and conduct me through i hold it a matter excusable at least f not commendable to give the world some ittle account of my life that in recounting he many deliverances and preservations which the lord has vouchsafed to work for me both i by a grateful acknowledgmen thereof and return of thanksgivings unt him therefore may in some measure set forth hi abundant goodness to me and others whos lot it may be to tread the same path and fal into the same or like exercises may be encouraged to persevere in the way of holines and with full assurance of mind to trust in the lord whatsoever trials may befall them  eighth mont so far as i have been able to inform my self for the parish register which relates to the time not of birth but of baptism as the call it is not to be relied on  the place of my birth was a little countr town called crowell situate in the upper sid of oxfordshire three miles eastward from them the nearest market town  my fathers name was walter ellwood an my mothers maidenname was elizabeth pman both well descended but of declinin families so that what my father possesse which was a pretty estate in lands and mo as i have heard in moneys he received as h had done his name walter from his grandfther walter gray whose daughter and onl child was his mother  london f the civil war between king and parliamen breaking then forth my father who favoued the parliamentside though he took not arms not holding himself safe at his country habitation which lay too near some garrisons of the kings betook himself to london that city then holding for the parliament  there was i bred up though not without much difficulty the city air not agreeing with my tender constitution and there continued until oxford was surrendered and the war in appearance ended  in this time my parents contracted an acquaintance and intimate friendship with the lady springett who being then the widow of sir william springett who died in the parliament service was afterward the wife of isaac penington eldest son of alderman penington of london and this friendship devolving from the parents to the children i became an early and particular playfellow to her daughter gulielma being admitted as such to ride with her in her little coach drawn by her footman about lincolnsinnfields  i mention this in this place because the continuation of that acquaintance and friendship having been an occasional means of my being afterward brought to the knowledge of the blessed truth i shall have frequent cause in the course of the following discourse to make honorable mention of that family to which i am under so many and great obligations  oxford my father returned to his estate at crowell which by that time he might have need enough to look after having spent i suppose the greatest part of the moneys which had been left him by his grandfather in maintaining himself and his family at an high rate in london  my elder brother for i had one brothe and two sisters all elder than my self was while we lived in london boarded at a privat school in the house of one francis atkinson a a place called hadley near barnet in hertfordshire where he had made some good proficiency in the latin and french tongues but after we had left the city and were resettled i the country he was taken from that privat school and sent to the free school at tham in oxfordshire  thither also was i sent as soon as my tender age would permit for i was indeed bu young when i went and yet seemed younge than i was by reason of my low and little stature for it was held for some years a doubtful point whether i should not have proved a dwarf but after i was arrived to the fifteenth year of my age or thereabouts i began to shoot up and gave not over growing till i had attained the middle size and statu of men  at this school which at that time was i good reputation i profited apace havin then a natural propensity to learning so tha at the first reading over of my lesson i commonly made my self master of it and y which is strange to think of few boys in the chool wore out more birch than i for though  was never that i remember whipt upon he score of not having my lesson ready or of not saying it well yet being a little busy boy full os spirit of a working head and ctive hand i could not easily conform my self to the grave and sober rules and as i hen thought severe orders of the school but was often playing one waggish prank or other among my fellowscholars which subjected me to correction so that i have come under the discipline of the rod twice in a forenoon which yet brake no bones  had i been continued at this school and in due time preferred to an higher i might in likelihood have been a scholar for i was observed to have a genius apt to learn but my father having so soon as the republicangovernment began to settle accepted the office of a justice of the peace which was no way beneficial but merely honorary and every way expensive and put himself into a port and course of living agreeable thereunto and having also removed my brother from thameschool to mertoncolledge in oxford and entered him there in the highest and most chargeable condition of a fellowcommoner he found it needful to retrench his expenses elsewhere the hurt of which fell upon me for he thereupon took me from school to save the charge of maintaining me there which was somewhat like plucking green fruit from the tree and laying it by before it was come to its due ripeness which will thenceforth shrink and wither and lose that little juice and relish which it began to have  even so it fared with me for being taken home when i was but young and before i was well settled in my studies though i had made a good progress in the latin tongue and was entered in the greek being left too much to my self to ply or play with my books or without them as i pleased i soon shook hands with my books by shaking my books out of my hands and laying them by degrees quite aside and addicted my self to such youthfu sports and pleasures as the place afforded and my condition could reach unto  by this means in a little time i began to lose that little learning i had acquired at school and by a continued disuse of my books became at length so utterly a stranger to learning that i could not have read far less have understood a sentence in latin which i was so sensible of that i warily avoided reading to others even in an english book lest if i should meet with a latin word i should shame my self by mispronouncing it  thus i went on taking my swing in such vain courses as were accounted harmless recreations entertaining my companions and familiar acquaintance with pleasant discourses in our conversations by the mere force of motherwit and natural parts without the help of schoolcultivation and was accounted good company too  but i always sorted my self with persons of ngenuity temperance and sobriety for i athed scurrilities in conversation and had a atural aversion to immoderate drinking so at in the time of my greatest vanity i was reserved from prophanness and the grosser eils of the world which rendered me acceptble to persons of the best note in that counry then i often waited on the lord wenman t his house thamepark about two miles from crowell where i lived to whose favor held my self entitled in a twofold respect oth as my mother was nearly related to his lady and as he had been pleased to bestow his name upon me when he made large promises or me at the font he was a person of great honor and virtue and always gave me a kind reception at his table how often soever i came and i have cause to think i should have received from this lord some advantageous preferment in this world as soon as he had found me capable of it though betwixt him and my father there was not then so good an understanding as might have been wished had i not been in a little time after called into the service of the best and highest lord and thereby lost the favor of all my friends relations and acquaintance of this world to the account of which most happy exchange i hasten and therefore willingly pass over many particularities of my youthful life yet one passage i am willing to mention for the effect it had upon me afterward which was thus  pettysessions at walington i waited on him thither and when we came near the town the coachman seeing a nearer and easier way than the common road through a corn field and that it wa wide enough for the wheels to run without endammaging the corn turned down there which being observed by an husbandma who was at plow not far off he ran to us an stopping the coach poured forth a mouthfu of complaints in none of the best language for driving over the corn my father mildly answered him that if there was an offenc committed he must rather impute it to hi servant than himself since he neither directed him to drive that way nor knew which way he drove yet added that he was going to such an inn at the town whither if h came he would make him full satisfaction for whatsoever damage he had sustained thereby and so on we went the man venting his discontent as he went back in angry accents at the town upon enquiry we understood that it was a way often used and without damage being broad enough but that it was not the common road which yet lay not far from it and was also good enough wherefore my father bid his man drive home that way  it was late in the evening when we returned and very dark and this quarrelsome man who had troubled himself and us in the morning that there were two men at the horses eads who held them back and would not suffer em to go forward whereupon my father oening the boot stept out and i followed close  his heels going up to the place where e men stood he demanded of them the eason of this assault they said we were upon the corn we knew by the routs we ere not on the corn but in the common way nd told them so but they told us they were esolved they would not let us go on any farther but ould make us go back again my father endeaoured by gentle reasoning to persuade them  forbear and not run themselves farther into he danger of the law which they were run oo far into already but they rather derided im for it seeing therefore fair means would ot work upon them he spoke more roughly o them charging them to deliver their clubs for each of them had a great club in his hand omewhat like those which are called quartertaves they thereupon laughing told him they did not bring them thither for that en thereupon my father turning his head to m said tom disarm them  i stood ready at his elbow waiting only for the word of command for being naturall of a bold spirit full then of youthful hea and that too heightened by the sense i had no only of the abuse but insolent behavior o those rude fellows my blood began to boy and my fingers itchd as the saying is to b dealing with them wherefore stepping boldly forward to lay hold on the staff of him tha was nearest to me i said sirrah deliver you weapon he thereupon raised his club which was big enough to have knocked down an ox intending no doubt to have knocked me dow with it as probably he would have done ha i not in the twinkling of an eye whipt o my rapier and made a pass upon him  could not have failed running of him through up to the hilt had he stood his ground b the sudden and unexpected sight of my brigh blade glistering in the dark night did so amaze and terrify the man that slipping asid he avoided my thrust and letting his sta sink betook himself to his heels for safety which his companion seeing fled also i folowed the former as fast as i could but tim addidit alas fear gave him wings and mad him swiftly fly so that although i was accouned very nimble yet the farther we ran the more ground he gained on me so that i could not overtake him which made me think h  ireland with a person poerful there in those times by whose means  was quickly preferred to a place of trust a profit but lived not long to enjoy it  i mentioned before that during my father abode in london in the time of the civil wa he contracted a friendship with the lady sprigett then a widow and afterward marri to isaac penington esquire to continue which  sometimes visited them at their countrylodgings as at datchet and at causham lodge nea reading and having heard that they we come to live upon their own estate at chalfo buckinghamshire about fifteen miles from well he went one day to visit them there d to return at night taking me with him  but very much surpized we were when ing come thither we first heard then found ey were become quakers a people we had  knowledge of and a name we had till en scarce heard of  so great a change from a free debonair d courtly sort of behavior which we forerly had found them in to so strict a graty as they now received us with did not a tle amuse us and disappoint our expectation f such a pleasant visit as we used to have and ad now promised our selves nor could my ather have any opportunity by a private onference with them to understand the ground or occasion of this change there beg some other strangers with them related to saac penington who came that morning from ondon to visit them also  for my part i sought and at length found means to cast my self into the company of the daughter whom i found gathering some flowers in the garden attended by her maid who was also a quaker but when i addressed my self to her after my accustomed manner with intention to engage her in some discourse which might introduce conversation on the foot of our former acquaintance though she treated me with a courteous mein yet as young as she was the gravity of her look and behavior struck such an awe upon me that  we stayed dinner which was very ha some and lacked nothing to recommend it  me but the want of mirth and pleasant d course which we could neither have w them nor by reason of them with one ather amongst our selves the weightiness t was upon their spirits and countenances keeing down the lightness that would have be up in us we stayed notwithstanding till t rest of the company took leave of them a then we also doing the same returned n greatly satisfied with our journey nor knoing what in particular to find fault with  yet this good effect that visit had upon m father who was then in the commission f the peace that it disposed him to a more fvourable opinion of and carriage toward tho people when they came in his way as not lo after one of them did for a young man wh lived in buckinghamshire came on a first day  to the church so called at a town calle chinner a mile from crowell having it seem a pressure on his mind to say something to the minister of that parish he being an acquaintance of mine drew me sometimes to hea him as it did then the young man stood i the isle before the pulpit all the time of the the prayer of the wicked  abomination to the lord and that god hears t sinners  somewhat more i think he did say which  could not distinctly hear for the noise the people made and more probably he would ave said had he not been interrupted by the fficers who took him into custody and led im out in order to carry him before my faer  when i understood that i hastened home at i might give my father a fair account of e matter before they came i told him the oung man behaved himself quietly and peacebly spoke not a word till the minister had uite done his service and that what he then ake was but short and was delivered without passion or ill language this i knew would furnish my father with a fair ground whereon to discharge the man if he would  and accordingly when they came and made  high complaint against the man who said ittle for himself my father having examined the officers who brought him what the words that he spoke were which they did not well agree in and at what time he spoke them which they all agreed to be after the minister had done and then whether he gave the minister any reviling language or endeavored to raise a tumult among the people  some time after this my father having goten some further account of the people calle quakers and being desirous to be informed concerning their principles made another visit  isaac penington and his wife at their hou called the grange in peters chalfont and to both my sisters and me with him  it was in the tenth month in the year     that we went thither where we found a ve kind reception and tarried some days o day at least the longer for that while w were there a meeting was appointed at  place about a mile from thence to which w were invited to go and willingly went  it was held in a farmhouse called t grove which having formerly been a getlemans seat had a very large hall and the well filled  to this meeting came edward borough besides other preachers as thomas curtis an james nailor but none spoke there at tha time but edward borough next to who as it were under him it was my lot to sit o a stool by the side of a long table on which he sat and i drank in his words with desire for they not only answered my understanding but warmed my heart with a certain  when the meeting was ended our friends ook us home with them again and after super the evenings being long the servants of he family who were quakers were called in and we all sat down in silence but long we ad not so sat before edward borough began o speak among us and although he spoke ot long yet what he said did touch as i supose my fathers religious copyhold as the hrase is and he having been from his outh a professor though not joined in that which is called close communion with any one sort and valuing himself upon the knowledge e esteemed himself to have in the various notions of each profession thought he had now a fair opportunity to display his knowledge and thereupon began to make objections against what had been delivered  the subject of the discourse was the universal free grace of god to all mankind to which he opposed the calvinistical tenet of particular and personal predestination in defense of which indefensible notion he found imself more at a loss than he expected edward borough said not much to him upon it though what he said was close and cogent but james nailor interposing handled the subject with so much perspicuity and clear demonstration that his reasoning seemed to be irresistible and so i supposemy father found it which made him willing to drop the discourse  edward borough he was a bri young man of a ready tongue and might have been for ought i then knew a schola which made me the less to admire his way o reasoning but what dropped from james nalor had the greater force upon me because h looked but like a plain simple countryma having the appearance of an husbandman o a shepherd  as my father was not able to maintain the argument on his side so neither did the seem willing to drive it on to an extremity o their side but treating him in a soft an gentle manner did after a while let fall the discourse and then we withdrew to our respective chambers  the next morning we prepared to retur home that is my father my younger siste and my self for my elder sister was gone before by the stage coach to london an when having taken our leaves of our friend we went forth they with edward burroug accompanying us to the gate he there directed his speech in a few words to each of u severally according to the sense he had o our several conditions and when we were gone off and they gone in again they asking him what he thought of us he answered them as they afterward told me to this effect as for the old man he is settled on his lees and the young woman is light and airy but the young man is reached and may do well if he dont lose it and surely that which he said to me or  i found it was not so with my father and sister for as i rode after the coach i could hear them talk pleasantly one to the other but they could not discern how it was with me because i riding on horsback kept much out of sight  by that time we got home it was night and the next day being the first day of the week i went in the afternoon to hear the minister of chinner and this was the last time i ever went to hear any of that function after the sermon i went with him to his house and in a freedom of discourse which from a certain intimacy that was between us i commonly used with him told him where i had been what company i had met with there and what observations i had made to my self thereupon he seemed to understand as little of them as i had done before and civilly abstained from casting any unhandsome reflections on them  i had a desire to go to another meeting of the quakers and bid my fathers man enquire if there was any in the country thereabouts he thereupon told me he had heard at isaac peningtons that there was to be a meeting at highwiccomb on thursday next  thither therefore i went though it was seven miles from me and that i might be rather thought to go out a coursing than to a meeting i let my grayhound run by my horseside  when i came there and had set up my horse at an inn i was at a loss how to find the house where the meeting was to be i knew it not and was ashamed to ask after it wherefore having ordered the horstler to take care of my dog i went into the street and stood at the inngate musing with my self what course to take but i had not stood long ere i saw an horseman riding along the street whom i remembered i had seen before at isaac peningtons and he put up his horse at the same inn him therefore i resolved to follow supposing he was going to the meeting as indeed he was  being come to the house which proved to be john raunces i saw the people sitting together in an outer room wherefore i stepped in and sat down on the first void seat the end of a bench just within the door having my sword by my side and black clothes on which drew some eyes upon me it was not long ere one stood up and spoke whom i was afterward well acquainted with his name was samuel thornton and what he spoke was very suitable and of good service to me for  as soon as ever the meeting was ended and the people began to rise i being next the door stept out quickly and hastening to my inn took horse immediately homewards and so far as i remember my having been gone was not taken notice of by my father  this latter meeting was like the clinching of a nail confirming and fastening in my mind those good principles which had sunk into me at the former my understanding began to open and i felt some stirrings in my breast tending to the work of a new creation in me the general trouble and confusion of mind which had for some days lain heavy upon me and pressed me down without a distinct discovery of the particular cause for which it came began now to wear off and some glimmerings of light began to break forth in me which let me see my inward state and condition toward god the light which before had shone in my darkness and the darkness could not comprehend it began now to shine out of darkness and in some measure discovered to me what it was that had before clouded me and brought that sadness and trouble upon me and now i saw that although i had been in a great degree preserved from the common immoralities and gross pollutions of the world yet the spirit of the world had hitherto ruled in me and led me into pride flattery vanity and superfluity heavenly fathers planting and that all these of whatever sort or kind they were or how specious soever they might appear must be plucked up  now was all my former life ripped up and my sins by degrees were set in order before me and though they looked not with so black a hue and so deep a dye as those of the lewdest sort of people did yet i found that all sin even that which had the fairest or finest show as well as that which was more course and foul brought guilt and with and for guilt condemnation on the soul that sinned this i felt and was greatly bowed down under the sense thereof  now also did i receive a new law an inward law superadded to the outward the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus which wrought in me against all evil not only in deed and in word but even in thought also so that every thing was brought to judgment and judgment passed upon all so that i could not any longer go on in my former ways and course of life for when i did judgment took hold upon me for it  thus the lord was graciously pleased to deal with me in somewhat like manner as he had dealt with his people israel of old when they had transgressed his righteous law whom by his prophet he called back required to put away the evil of their doings cease to do evil then learn to do well before he would admit them to reason with him and before he would impart to them the effects of his free mercy isa          i was now required by this inward and spiritual law the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus to put away the evil of my doings and to cease to do evil and what in particulars the evil was which i was required to to put away and to cease from that measure of the divine light which was now manifested in me discovered to me and what the light made manifest to be evil judgment passed upon  so that here began to be a way cast up before me for me to walk in a direct and plain way so plain that a wayfaringman how weak and simple soever  though a fool to the wisdom and in the judgment of the world could not err while he continued to walk in it the error coming in by his going out of it and this way with respect to me i saw was that measure of divine light which was manifested in me by which the evil of my doings which i was to put away and to cease from was discovered to me  by this divine light then i saw that though i had not the evil of the common uncleanness bauchery prophanness and pollutions of the rld to put away because i had through the at goodness of god and a civil educa been preserved out of those grosser evils put away and  cease from some of which were not by t world  which lies in wickedness   john     accounted evils but by the light of chr were made manifest to me to be evils and  such condemned in me  as particularly those fruits and effects  pride that discover themselves in the nity and superfluity of apparel which i  far as my ability would extend to took ala too much delight in this evil of my doi i was required to put away and cease from a judgment lay upon me till i did so whefore in obedience to the inward law whi agreed with the outward   timothy       p       timothy     jam      i took  from my apparel those unnecessary trimmin of lace ribbands and useless buttons whi had no real service but were set on only  that which was by mistake called orname and i ceased to wear rings  again the giving of flattering titles to me between whom and me there was not any rlation to which such titles could be pretened to belong this was an evil i had be much addicted to and was accounted a read artist in therefore this evil also was i quired to put away and cease from so the thenceforward i durst not say sir master m lord madam or my dame or say your sevant to any one to whom i did not stand i the real relation of a servant which i ha never done to any  respect of persons in uncovering the ead and bowing the knee or body in salutans was a practice i had been much in the se of and this being one of the vain customs  the world introduced by the spirit of the world instead of the true honor which this a false representation of and used in deceit  a token of respect by persons one to another ho bear no real respect one to another and esides this being a type and proper emblem f that divine honor which all ought to pay o almighty god and which all of all sorts who take upon them the christian name apear in when they offer their prayers to him and therefore should not be given to men i ound this to be one of those evils which i had een too long doing therefore i was now reuired to put it away and cease from it  again the corrupt and unsound form of speakg in the plural number to a single person you o one instead of thou contrary to the pure plain and single language of truth thou to one and you to more than one which had always been used by god to men and men to god as well as one to anoer from the oldest record of time till corpt men for corrupt ends in later and corrupt times to flatter fawn and work upon the corrupt nature in men brought in that false and senseless way of speaking you to one which has since corrupted the modern languages and has greatly debased the spirits and depraved the manners of men this evil custom i had been as forward in as others and this i was now called out of and require to cease from  these and many more evil customs which had sprang up in the night of darkness an general apostasy from the truth and tru religion were now by the inshining o this pure ray of divine light in my conscience gradually discovered to me to be what i ough to cease from shun and stand a witness against  but so subtly and withal so powerfully did the enemy work upon the weak part in me as to persuade me that in these things i ought to make a difference between my father and all other men and that therefore though i did disuse these tokens of respect to others yet i ought still to use them toward him as he was my father and so far did this wile of his prevail upon me through a fear lest i should do amiss in withdrawing any sort of respect or honor from my father which was due unto him that being thereby beguiled i continued for a while to demean my self in the same manner toward him with respect both to language and gesture as i had always done before and so long as i did so standing bare before him and giving him the accustomed language he did not express whatever he thought any dislike of me  but as to my self and the work begun in me i found it was not enough for me to cease to do evil though that was a good and a great step i had another lesson before me which to learn to do well which i could by no ns do till i had given up with full purpose  mind to cease from doing evil and when d done that the enemy took advantage of  weakness to mislead me again  or whereas i ought to have waited in the t for direction and guidance into and e way of welldoing and not to have mo till the divine spirit a manifestation of ich the lord has been pleased to give unto e for me to profit with or by the enemy nsforming himself into the appearance of an gel of light offered himself in that aparance to be my guide and leader into the erformance of religious exercises and i t then knowing the wiles of satan and be eager to be doing some acceptable service to  too readily yielded my self to the con of my enemy instead of my friend  he thereupon humouring the warmth and  of my spirit put me upon religious permances in my own will in my own time and  my own strength which in themselves were od and would have been profitable unto me d acceptable unto the lord if they had been ormed in his will in his time and in the ity which he gives but being wrought in  will of man and at the prompting of the il one no wonder that it did me hurt ind of good  read abundantly in the bible and ld set my self tasks in reading enjoying  self to read so many chapters sometimes holy spirit which alone could op the understanding and give the true sense  what was read  i prayed often and drew out my prayers  a great length and appointed unto my self cetain set times to pray at and a certain number of prayers to say in a day yet knew no mean while what true prayer was whi stands not in words though the words whi are uttered in the movings of the holy spirit a very available but in the breathing of the soul to the heavenly father through the opeation of the holy spirit who makes intercessi sometimes in words and sometimes with sig and groans only which the lord vouchsafes  hear and answer  this will worship which all is that is peformed in the will of man and not in the movings of the holy spirit was a great hu to me and hinderance of my spiritual growt in the way of truth but my heavenly father who knew the sincerity of my soul t him and the hearty desire i had to serve him had compassion on me and in due time wa graciously pleased to illuminate my understanding farther and to open in me an eye to discer the false spirit and its way of working from the true and to reject the former and cleav to the latter  general quarter sessions for the peace comg on my father willing to excuse himself m a dirty journey commanded me to get  betimes and go to oxford and deliver in e recognizances he had taken and bring him  account what justices were on the bench d what principal pleas were before em which he knew i knew how to do having often tended him on those services  i who knew how it stood with me better an he did felt a weight come over me as n as he had spoke the word for i presently y it would bring a very great exercise upon  but having never resisted his will in any ng that was lawful as this was i attempt not to make any excuse but ordering an rse to be ready for me early in the morning ent to bed having great struglings in my east  for the enemy came in upon me like a od and set many difficulties before me elling them up to the highest pitch by repreting them as mountains which i should ne be able to get over and alas that faith ich could remove such mountains and cast  he cast into my mind not only how i should behave my self in court and dispatch the bsiness i was sent about but how i should dmean my self toward my acquaintance  which i had many in that city with whom  was wont to be jolly whereas now i could not put off my hat nor bow to any of the nor give them their honorary titles as they a called nor use the corrupt language of you any one of them but must keep to the pla and true language of thou and thee  much of this nature revolved in my min thrown in by the enemy to discourage a cast me down and i had none to have rcourse to for counsel or help but the lord alone to whom therefore i poured forth m supplications with earnest cries and breatings of soul that h e in whom all pow was would enable me to go through this gre exercise and keep me faithful to himself the in and after some time he was pleased  compose my mind to stilness and i went  rest  early next morning i got up and fou my spirit pretty calm and quiet yet not witout a fear upon me lest i should slip and fall the testimony which i had to bear and  i rode a frequent cry ran through me to the lord on this wise o my god preserve  faithful whatever befalls me suffer me not to  drawn into evil how much scorn and contempt soever may be cast upon me  thus was my spirit exercised on the way almost continually and when i was come within a mile or two of the city whom should i meet upon the way coming from thence but edward borough i rode in a mountiercap a dress more used then than now and so did he and because the weather was exceeding sharp we both had drawn our caps down to helter our faces from the cold and by that means neither of us knew the other but passed y without taking notice one of the other till  few days after meeting again and observing ach others dress we recollected where we ad so lately met then thought i with my elf o how glad should i have been of a word  encouragement and counsel from him when i as under that weighty exercise of mind but the lord saw it was not good for me that my reance might be wholly upon him and not on man  when i had set up my horse i went directly  the hall where the sessions were held here i had been but a very little while before  knot of my old acquaintances espying me me to me one of these was a scholar in his own another a surgeon of that city both y schoolfellows and fellowboarders at ameschool and the third a country gentlean with whom i had long been very familiar  when they were come up to me they all sated me after the usual manner putting off your humble servant sir expecting no doubt the like from me but when they saw me stand still not moving my cap nor bowing my knee in way of congee to them they were amazed and looked first one upon another then upon me and then one upon another again for a while without a word speaking  at length the surgeon a brisk young man who stood nearest to me clapping his hand in a familiar way upon my shoulder and smiling on me said what tom a quaker t which i readily and cheerfully answered ye a quaker and as the words passed out of m mouth i felt joy spring in my heart for  rejoiced that i had not been drawn out b them into a compliance with them and tha i had strength and boldness given me to cofess my self to be one of that despised people  they staid not long with me nor said an more that i remember to me but lookin somewhat confusedly one upon another after  while took their leave of me going off in the same ceremonious manner as they came on  after they were gone i walked a while about the hall and went up nearer to the court to observe both what justices were on the bench and what business they had before them and i went in fear not of what they could or would have done to me if they should ha taken notice of me but lest i should be suprized and drawn unwarily into that whi i was to keep out of  clerk of the peace at his house whom i was well acquainted with so soon as i came into the room where he was he came and met me and saluted me after his manner for he had a great respect for my father and a kind regard for me and though he was at first somewhat startled at my carriage and language yet he treated me very civilly without any reflection or show of lightness i delivered him the recognizances which my father had sent and having done the business i came upon withdrew and went to my inn to refresh my self and then to return home  but when i was ready to take horse looking out into the street i saw two or three justices standing just in the way where i was to ride this brought a fresh concern upon me i knew if they saw me they would know me and i concluded if they knew me they would stop me to enquire after my father and i doubted how i should come off with them  this doubting brought weakness on me and that weakness led to contrivance how i might avoid this trial i knew the city pretty well and remembered there was a back way which though somewhat about would bring me out of town without passing by ose justices yet loath i was to go that way wherefore i staid a pretty time in hopes they would have parted company or removed to ome other place out of my way but when  but the lord looked on me with a tender eye and seeing my heart was right to him and that what i had done was merely through weakness and fear of falling and that i was sensible of my failing therein and sorry for it he was graciously pleased to pass it by and speak peace to me again so that before i got home as when i went in the morning my heart was full of breathing prayer to the lord that he would vouchsafe to be with me and uphold and carry me through that days exercise so now at my return in the evening my heart was full of thankful acknowledgments and praises unto him for his great goodness and favor to me in having thus far preserved and kept me from falling into any thing that might have brought dishonor to his holy name which i had now taken on me  but notwithstanding that it was thus with me and that i found peace and acceptance with the lord in some good degree according to my obedience to the convictions i had received by his holy spirit in me yet was not the vail so done away or fully rent but that there still remained a cloud upon my understanding with respect to my carriage toward my father and that notion which the enemy i ought to put such a difference between him all others as that on the account of paternal relation i should still deport my self toward him both in gesture and language as i had always heretofore done did yet prevail with me so that when i came home i went to my father bare headed as i used to do and gave him a particular account of the business he had given me in command in such manner that he observing no alteration in my carriage toward him found no cause to take offense at me  i had felt for sometime before an earnest desire of mind to go again to isaac peningtons and i began to question whether when my father should come as i concluded ere long he would to understand i inclined to settle among the people called quakers he would permit me the command of his horses as before wherefore in the morning when i went to oxford i gave direction to a servant of his to go that day to a gentleman of my acquaintance who i knew had a riding nag to put off either by sale or to be kept for his work and desire him in my name to send him to me which he did and i found him in the stable when i came home  on this nag i designed to ride next day to isaac peningtons and in order thereunto arose betimes and got my self ready for the journey but because i would pay all due respects to my father and not go without his consent or knowledge at the least i sent one up to him isaac peuingtons and desired to know if he pleased to command me any service to them he sent me word he would speak with me before i went and would have me come up to him which i did and stood by his bedside  then in a mild and gentle tone he said i understand you have a mind to go to mr penington s i answered i have so why said he i wonder why you should you were there you know but a few days ago and unless you had business with them dont you think it will look odly i said i i thought not i doubt said he you will tire them with your company and make them think they shall be troubled with you if replied i i find any thing of that i will make the shorter stay but said he can you propose any sort of business with them more than a mere visit yes said i i propose to my self not only to see them but to have some discourse with them why said he in a tone a little harsher i hope you dont incline to be of their way truly answered i i like them and their way very well so far as i yet understand it and i am willing to go to them that i may understand it better  thereupon he began to reckon up a beadroll of faults against the quakers telling me they were a rude unmannerly people that would not give civil respect or honor to their superiors no not to magistrates that they held many dangerous principles that they were an immodest shameless people and that one of them stripped himself starknaked and went in that unseemly manner about the streets at fairs and on marketdays in great towns  to all the other charges i answered only that perhaps they might be either misreported or misunderstood as the best of people had sometimes been but to the last charge of going naked a particular answer by way of instance was just then brought into my mind and put into my mouth which i had not thought of before and that was the example of isaiah who went naked among the people for a long time  isai  0   aye said my father but you must consider that he was a prophet of the lord and had an express command from god to go so yes sir replied i i do consider that but i consider also that the jews among whom he lived did not own him for a prophet nor believe that he had such a command from god and added i how know we but that this quaker may be a prophet too and might be commanded to do as he did for some reason which we understand not  this put my father to a stand so that letting fall his charges against the quakers he only said i would wish you not to go so soon but take a little time to consider of it you may visit mr penington hereafter nay sir replied i pray dont hinder my going now for i have so strong a desire to go that i do not well know how to forbear and as i spoke those words i withdrew gently to the chamber door and then hastening down stairs went immediately  this discourse with my father had cast me somewhat back in my journey and it being fifteen long miles thither the ways bad and my nag but small it was in the afternoon that i got thither and understanding by the servant that took my horse that there was then a meeting in the house as there was weekly on that day which was the fourth day of the week though i till then understood it not i hastened in and knowing the rooms went directly to the little parlour where i found a few friends sitting together in silence and i sat down among them well satisfied though without words  when the meeting was ended and those of the company who were strangers withdrawn i addressed my self to isaac penington and his wife who received me courteously but not knowing what exercise i had been in and yet was under nor having heard any thing of me since i had been there before in another garb were not forward at first to lay sudden hands on me which i observed and did not dislike but as they came to see a change in me not in habit only but in gesture speech and carriage and which was more in countenance also for the exercise i had passed through and yet was under had imprinted a visible character of gravity upon my face they were exceeding kind and tender toward me  anne curtis the wife of thomas curtis of reading who was come upon a visit to them and particularly to see mary peningtons daughter guli who had been ill of the small pox since i had been there before betwixt mary penington and this friend i observed some private discourse and whisperings and i had an apprehension that it was upon something that concerned me wherefore i took the freedom to ask mary penington if my coming thither had occasioned any inconvenience in the family she asked me if i had had the small pox i told her no she then told me her daughter had newly had them and though she was well recovered of them she had not as yet been down amongst them but intended  have come down and sat with them in the parour that evening yet would rather forbear till another time than endanger me and that that as the matter they had been discoursing of i assued her that i had always been and then ore especially was free from any apprehenon of danger in that respect and therefore treated that her daughter might come own and although they were somewhat nwilling to yield to it in regard of me yet y importunity prevailed and after supper e did come down and sit with us and though e marks of the distemper were fresh upon er yet they made no impression upon me aith keeping out fear    before i went to bed they let me know that there was to be a meeting at wiccomb nex day and that some of the family would g to it i was very glad of it for i greatly dsired to go to meetings and this fell very aply it being in my way home next mornin isaac penington himself went having anne cutis with him and i accompanied them  at wiccomb we met with edward burroug who came from oxford thither that day that  going thither met him on the way and hving both our mountiercaps on we recollecte that we had met and passed by each other  the road unknown  this was a monthly meeting consisting  friends chiefly who gathered to it from sever parts of the country thereabouts so that  was pretty large and was held in a fair roo in jeremiah steevenss house the roo where i had been at a meeting before in jo raunces house being too little to receive us  a very good meeting was this in its se and to me edward burroughs ministry ca forth among us in life and power and t assembly was covered therewith i also acording to my small capacity had a sha  when the meeting was ended the friends of the town taking notice that i was the man that had been at their meeting the week before whom they then did not know some of them came and spoke lovingly to me and would have had me staid with them but edward borough going home with isaac penington he invited me to go back with him which i willingly consented to for the love i had more particularly to edward borough through whose ministry i had received the first awakning stroke drew me to desire his company and so away we rode together  but i was somewhat disappointed of my expectation for i hoped he would have given me both opportunity and encouragement to have opened my self to him and to have poured forth my complaints fears doubts and questionings into his bosom but he being sensible that i was truly reached and that the witness of god was raised and the work of god guidance of the good spirit in my self the counselor that could resolve all doubts that i might not have any dependence on man wherefore although he was naturally of an open and free temper and carriage and was afterward always very familiar and affectionately kind to me yet at this time he kept himself somewhat reserved and showed only common kindness to me  next day we parted he for london i home under a very great weight and exercise upon my spirit for i now saw in and by the farther openings of the divine light in me that the enemy by his false reasonings had beguiled and misled me with respect to my carriage toward my father for i now clearly saw that the honor due to parents did not consist in uncovering the head and bowing the body to them but in a ready obedience to their lawful commands and in performing all needful services unto them wherefore as i was greatly troubled for what i already had done in that case though it was through ignorance so i plainly felt i could no longer continue therein without drawing on my self the guilt of wilful disobedience which i well knew would draw after it divine displeasure and judgment  hereupon the enemy assaulted me afresh setting before me the danger i should run my self into of provoking my father to use severity toward me and perhaps to the casting equirings whatever might come on it  thus laboring under various exercises on e way i at length got home expecting i ould have but a rough reception from my ather but when i came home i understood y father was from home wherefore i sat own by the fire in the kitchen keeping y mind retired to the lord with breathings  spirit to him that i might be preserved om falling  after some time i heard the coach drive in which put me into a little fear and a sort of ivering came over me but by that time he as alighted and come in i had pretty well covered my self and as soon as i saw him i ose up and advanced a step or two toward im with my head covered said isaac pengton and his wife remember their loves to ee  he made a stop to hear what i said and oberving that i did not stand bare and that i sed the word  thee to him he with a ern countenance and tone that spoke high displeasure only said i shall talk with you sir another time and so hastening from me went to the parlour and i saw him no more that night    my spirit longed to be among friends a to be at some meeting with them on the fi day which now drew on this being the six day night wherefore i purposed to go  oxford on the morrow which was the seven day of the week having heard there was  meeting there accordingly having order my horse to be made ready betimes i got u in the morning and made my self ready al yet before i would go that i might be as o servant to my father as possibly i could i dsired my sister to go up to him in his chambe and acquaint him that i had a mind to g to oxford and desired to know if he pleased  command me any service there he bid h tell me he would not have me go till he ha spoken with me and getting up immediately he hastened down to me before he was quit dressed  as soon as he saw me standing with my ha on his passion transporting him he fell upon me with both his fists and having by tha means somewhat vented his anger he plucked off my hat and threw it away then stepping whence that horse came who ling him he fetched it from mr  such an es then ride him presently back said my far and tell mr  i desire he will never d my son an horse again unless he brings a te from me  the poor fellow who loved me well would  have made excuses and delays but my ther was positive in his command and so gent that he would not let him stay so much  to take his breakfast though he had five iles to ride nor would he himself stir from e stable till he had seen the man mounted d gone  then coming in he went up into his chamr to make himself more fully ready thinkg he had me safe enough now my horse was e for i took so much delight in riding t i seldom went on foot  but while he was dressing himself in his amber i who understood what had been e changing my boots for shoos took aner hat and acquainting my sister who ed me very well and whom i could confide  whither i meant to go went out privately d walked away to wiccomb having seven g miles thither which yet seemed little and e to me from the desire i had to be among ends  as thus i traveled all alone under a load  grief from the sense i had of the opposition wther i had done well in thus coming away from  father without his leave or knowledge  i was quiet and peaceable in my spirit before this question was darted into me but after that disturbance and trouble seized up me so that i was at a stand what to do whither to go forward or backward fear of offend inclined me to go back but desire of the meet and to be with friends pressed me to go forwa  i stood still a while to consider and weig as well as i could the matter i was sensib satisfied that i had not left my father with a intention of undutifulness or disrespect to hi but merely in obedience to that drawing  spirit which i was persuaded was of t lord to join with his people in worshipp him and this made me easy  but then the enemy to make me uneasy gain objected but how could that drawing be the lord which drew me to disobey my fath  i considered thereupon the extent of patnal power which i found was not wholly a bitrary and unlimited but had bounds set u it so that as in civil matters it was restraed to things lawful so in spiritual and relious cases it had not a compulsory power over cscience which ought to be subject to the hvenly father and therefore though obedie to parents be enjoined to children yet it  with this limitation in the lord hildren obey your parents in the lord for this  right   pet      this turned the scale for going forward d so on i went and yet i was not wholly ee from some fluctuations of mind from the esettings of the enemy wherefore although  knew that outward signs did not properly beg to the gospel dispensation yet for my betr assurance i did in fear and great humiy beseech the lord that he would be pleas so far to condescend to the weakness of his rvant as to give me a sign by which i ight certainly know whether my way was ght before him or not  the sign which i asked was that if i had e wrong in coming as i did i might be reject or but coldly received at the place i was going  but if this mine undertaking was right in his ht he would give me favor with them i went  so that they should receive me with hearty kinds and demonstrations of love accordingly en i came to john rances house which beg so much a stranger to all i chose to go to ause i understood the meeting was comnly held there they received me with re than ordinary kindness especially frances nce  john rances then wife who was both  grave and motherly woman and had a rty love to truth and tenderness toward  that in sincerity sought after it and this  kind reception confirming me in the be that my undertaking was approved of by  lord gave great satisfaction and ease  thus it fared with me there but at hom it fared otherwise with my father he supposing i had betaken my self to my chamber when he took my hat from me made no enquiry after me till evening came and the sitting by the fire and considering that the weather was very cold he said to my sister who sat by him go up to your brothers chamber and call him down it may be he will sit the else in a sullen fit till he has caught cold alas sir said she he is not in his chamber nor i the house neither at that my father startling said why where is he then i know not s said she where he is but i know that when  saw you had sent away his horse he put on shoo and went out on foot and i have not seen hi since and indeed sir added she i dont wonder at his going away considering how you use him this put my father into a great frigh doubting i was gone quite away and so great a passion of grief seized on him that he fobore not to weep and to cry out aloud so tha the family heard him oh my son i shall never see him more for he is of so bold and refolut a spirit that he will run himself into danger an so may be thrown into some goal or other where he may lie and die before i can hear of hi then bidding her light him up to his chamber he went immediately to bed where h lay restless and groaning and often bemoaning himself and me for the greatest part o the night    this account was very uneasy to me i was uch grieved that i had occasioned so much rief to my father and i would have rerned that evening after the meeting but e friends would not permit it for the meetg would in likelihood end late the days beg short and the way was long and dirty and besides john rance told me that he had mething on his mind to speak to my father d that if i would stay till the next day he ould go down with me hoping perhaps that ile my father was under this sorrow for  he might work some good upon him ereupon concluding to stay till the morrow ismisst the man with the things he brought ding him tell my sister i intended god ling to return home to morrow and rging him not to let any body else know t he had seen me or where he had been  next morning john rance and i set out and en we were come to the end of the town  agreed that he should go before and knock  the great gate and i would come a little er and go in by the back way he did so  when a servant came to open the gate he ing if the justice were at home she told yes and desiring him to come in an sit down in the hall went and acquainted h master that there was one who desired to spea with him he supposing it was one that ca for justice went readily into the hall to hi but he was not a little surpized when he fou it was a quaker yet not knowing on wh account he came he staid to hear his busine but when he found it was about me he  somewhat sharply on him  in this time i was come by the back w into the kitchen and hearing my father voice so loud i began to doubt things wroug not well but i was soon assured of that b my father having quickly enough of a quak company left john rance in the hall a came into the kitchen where he was m surprised to find me  the sight of my hat upon my head m him presently forget that i was that son  his whom he had so lately lamented as  and his passion of grief turning into an he could not contain himself but running  on me with both his hands first viole snatched off my hat and threw it away t giving me some buffets on my head he  sirrah get you up to your chamber  i forthwith went he following me at  heels and now and then giving me a whi on the ear which the way to my cham lying through the hall where john rance  he poor man might see and be sorry for  i doubt not but he was but could not help   disrespect to him but upon a religious prinle but as this hathonour as it was acunted was grown to be a great idol in those es more especially so the lord was pleased  engage his servants in a steady testimony ainst it what suffering soever was brought on them for it and though some who have en called in the lords vineyard at latter urs and since the heat of that day has been uch over may be apt to account this testimo a small thing to suffer so much upon as some ve done not only to beating but to fines d long and hard imprisonments yet they who  those times were faithfully exercised in and der it durst not despise the day of small things  knowing that he who should do so would t be thought worthy to be concerned in her testimonies  i had now lost one of my hats and i had t one more that therefore i put on but  not keep it long for the next time my faer saw it on my head he tore it violently m me and laid it up with the other i ew not where wherefore i put on my untiercap which was all i had left to wear  my head and it was but a very little while  this was in the eleventh month called janary and the weather sharp so that i wh had been bred up more tenderly took so great a cold in my head that my face and hea were much swelled and my gums had o them boyls so sore that i could neither che meat nor without difficulty swallow liquid it held long and i underwent much pain wit out much pity except from my poor siste who did what she could to give me ease a at length by frequent applications of figs a stoned raisins toasted and laid to the boy as hot as i could bear them they ripened  for lancing and soon after sunk then i h ease  now was i laid up as a kind of prison for the rest of this winter having no mea to go forth among friends nor they liber to come to me wherefore i spent the ti much in my chamber in waiting on t lord and in reading mostly in the bib  but whenever i had occasion to speak to  father though i had no hat now to offe him yet my language did as much for durst not say you to him but thou  thee as the occasion required and the would he be sure to fall on me with his fi  sirrah if ever i ar you say thou or thee to me again i will strike ur teeth down your throat i was greatly ieved to hear him say so and feeling a word e in my heart unto him i turned again d calmly said unto him would it not be t if god should serve thee so when thou est thou or thee to him though his hand as up i saw it sink and his countenance  and he turned away and left me standing ere but i notwithstanding went up into y chamber and cried unto the lord earstly beseeching him that he would be pleas to open my fathers eyes that he might see whom he fought against and for what and at he would turn his heart  after this i had a pretty time of rest and iet from these disturbances my father not ing any thing to me nor giving me occan to say any thing to him but i was still der a kind of confinement unless i would ve run about the country bareheaded like  madman which i did not see it was my ace to do for i found that although to be road and at liberty among my friends ould have been more pleasant to me yet ome was at present my proper place a patience to bear the cross and i willingly submitted to it  but after some time a fresh storm more fierce and sharp than any before arose and fell upon me the occasion whereof was this my father having been in his younger years more especially while he lived in london  constant hearer of those who are called puritanpreachers had stored up a pretty stock o scriptureknowledge did sometimes not constantly nor very often cause his family t come together on a first day in the evening and expound a chapter to them and pray his family now as well as his estate wa lessened for my mother was dead my brother gone and my elder sister at london an having put off his husbandry he had put  with it most of his servants so that he ha now but one man and one maidservant  so fell out that on a first day night he bi my sister who sat with him in the parlou call in the servants to prayer  whether this was done as a trial upon m or no i know not but a trial it proved  me for they loving me very well and diliking my fathers carriage to me made  haste to go in but staid a second summon this so offended him that when at length the did go in he instead of going to prayer eamined them why they came not in when the were first called and the answer they gave hi being such as rather heightened than abate ll in that fellow meaning me who was left one in the kitchen for he is the cause of all is they as they were backward to go in emselves so were not forward to call me in aring the effect of my fathers displeasure ould fall upon me as it soon did for i earing what was said and not staying for the all went in of my self and as soon as i as come in my father discharged his diseasure on me in very sharp and bitter exessions which drew from me in the grief f my heart to see him so transported with assion these few words they that can pray ith such a spirit let em for my part i cannot with that my father flew upon me with both is fists and not thinking that sufficient stept astily to the place where his cane stood and atching that up laid me on i thought with ll his strength and i being bareheaded i hought his blows must needs have broken my cull had i not laid mine arm over my head o defend it  his man seeing this and not able to conain himself stept in between us and laying old on the cane by strength of hand held t so fast that though he attempted not to take t away yet he withheld my father from striking with it which did but enrage him the more i disliked this in the man and bid him et go the cane and be gone which he immediately did and turning to be gone had a  but now my sister fearing lest my father should fall upon me again besought him  forbear adding indeed sir if you strike hi any more i will throw open the casement and c murder for i am afraid you will kill my brothe this stopped his hand and after some threaning speeches he commanded me to get to m chamber which i did as i always did wheever he bid me  thither soon after my sister followed m to see my arm and dress it for it was indee very much bruised and swelled between the wrist and the elbow and in some places the skin was broken and beaten off but thoug it was very sore and i felt for some time mu pain in it yet i had peace and quietness i my mind being more grieved for my father than for my self who i knew had hurt himself more than me  this was so far as i remember the la time that ever my father called his family t prayer and this was also the last time tha he ever fell so severely at least upon me  soon after this my elder sister who in al the time of these exercises of mine had bee at london returned home much troubled t find me a quaker a name of reproach an great contempt then and she being at london hd received i suppose the worst character of them yet though she disliked the  the rest of this winter i spent in a lonesome solitary life having none to converse with none to unbosom my self unto none to ask counsel of none to seek relief from but the lord alone who yet was more than all and yet the company and society of faithful and judicious friends would i thought have been very welcome as well as helpful to me in my spiritual travel in which i thought i made but a slow progress my soul breathing after further seize the sense of which drew from me the following lines  the winter tree resembles me whose sap lies in its root the spring draws nigh as it so i shall bud i hope and shoot isaac penington and his wife to make a visit to my father and see how it fared with me and very welcome they were to me whatever they were to him to whom i doubt not but they would have been more welcome had it not been for me  they tarried with us all night and much discourse they had with my father both about  when my father and we were at their house some months before mary penington in some discourse between them had told hi how hardly her husbands father alderma penington had dealt with him about his hat which my father little then thinking that i would and so soon too be his own case di very much censure the alderman for wondering that so wise a man as he was should take notice of such a trivial thing as the putting off or keeping on a hat and he spare not to blame him liberally for it  this gave her a handle to take hold of him by and having had an ancient acquaintance with him and he having always had an high opinion of and respect for her she who was a woman of great wisdom of ready speech and of a wellresolved spirit did pres so close upon him with this homeargument that he was utterly to seek and at a loss how to defend himself  after dinner next day when they were ready to take coach to return home she desired my father that since my company was so little acceptable to him he would give me leave to go and spend some time with them where i should be sure to be welcome  he was very unwilling i should go and made many objections against it all which  we were come to the coachside before this was concluded on and i was ready to step in when one of my sisters privately put my father in mind that i had never a hat on that somewhat startled him for he did not think it fit i should go from home and that so far and to stay abroad without a hat wherefore he whipred to her to fetch me a hat and he entertained them with some discourse in the mean time but as soon as he saw the hat coming he would not stay till it came lest i should put it on before him but breaking off his discourse abruptly took his leave of them and hastened in before the hat was brought to me  i had not one penny of money about me nor any indeed elsewhere for my father so soon as he saw that i would be a quaker took from me both what money i had and every thing else of value or that would have made money as some plate buttons rings etc pretending that he would keep them for me till i came to my self again lest i in the mean time should destroy them  but as i had no money so being among my friends i had no need of any nor ever honed after it though once upon a particular occasion i had like to have wanted it the case was thus  reading and set out from thence on the first day of the week in the morning intending to reach as in point of time i well might to isaac peningtons where the meeting was to be that day but when i came to maidenhead a thoroughfair town on the way i was stopped by the watch for riding on that day  the watchman laying hold on the bridle told me i must go with him to the constable and accordingly i making no resistance suffered him to lead my horse to the constables door when we were come there the constable told me i must go before the warden who was the chief officer of that town and bid the watchman bring me on himself walking before  being come to the wardens door the constable knocked and desired to speak with mr warden he thereupon quickly coming to the door the constable said sir i have brought a man here to you whom the watch took riding through the town the warden was a budge old man and i looked somewhat big too having a good gelding under me and a good riding coat on my back both which my friend isaac penington had kindly accommodated me with for that journey  the warden therefore taking me to be as the saying is somebody put off his hat and made a low congee to me but when he saw that i sat still and neither bowed to him nor moved my hat he gave a start and said you said you had brought a man ut he dont behave himself like a man  i sat still upon my horse and said not a word but kept my mind retired to the lord waiting to see what this would come to  the warden then began to examine me asking me whence i came and whither i was oing i told him i came from reading and was going to chalfont he asked me why i did travel on that day i told him i did not know that it would give any offense barely to ride r walk on that day so long as i did not cary or drive any carriage or horses laden with burdens why said he if your business was urent did you not take a pass from the mayor of reading because replied i i did not know or think i should have needed one well said e i will not talk with you now because it is time o go to church but i will examine you further non and turning to the constable have him said he to an inn and bring him before me after dinner  the naming of an inn put me in mind that uch public houses were places of expense and i knew i had no money to defray it wherefore i said to the warden before thou endest me to an inn which may occasion some expense i think it needful to acquaint thee that i have no money  at that the warden startled again and turning quick upon me said how no money how can that be you dont look like a man that has no money however i look said i i tell i wonder said he what art you have got that you can travel without money you can do more i assure you than i can  i making no answer he went on and said well well but if you have no money you have  good horse under you and we can distrain hi for the charge but said i the horse is no mine no said he ut you have a good coa on your back and that i hope is your own no said i but it is not for i borrowed both the horse and the coat  with that the warden holding up hi hands and smiling said bless me i never met with such a man as you are before what were you set out by the parish then turning to the constable he said have him to the grayhound and bid the people be civil to him accordingly to the grayhound i was led my horse set up and i put into a large room and some account i suppose given of me to the people of the house  this was new work to me and what the issue of it would be i could not foresee but being left there alone i sat down and retired in spirit to the lord in whom alone my strength and safety was and begged support of him even that he would be pleased to give me wisdom and words to answer the warden when i should come to be examined again before him  i should be welcome to dine with him though i had no money i desired him to tell his master that i was very sensible of his civility and kindness in so courteously inviting me to his table but i had not freedom to eat of his meat unless i could have paid for it so he went on with his dinner and i with my writing  but before i had finished what was on my mind to write the constable came again bringing with him his fellowconstable this was a brisk genteel young man a shopkeeper in the town whose name was cherry they saluted me civilly and told me they were come to have me before the warden this put an end to my writing which i put into my pocket and went along with them  being come to the wardens he asked me again the same questions he had asked me before to which i gave him the like answers then he told me the penalty i had incurred which he said was either to pay so much money or lie so many hours in the stocks and asked me which i would choose i replied i shall not choose either and said i i have told  when he heard that he paused awhile and then told me he considered that i was but a young man and might not perhaps understand the danger i had brought my self into and therefore he would not use the severity of the law upon me but in hopes that i would be wiser hereafter he would pass by this offense and discharge me  then putting on a countenance of the greatest gravity he said to me but young man i would have you know that you have not only broken the law of the land but the law of god also and therefore you ought to ask him forgiveness for you have highly offended him that said i i would most willingly do if i were sensible that in this case i had offended him by breaking any law of his why said he do you question that yes truly said i for i do not know that any law of god does forbid me to ride on this day  no said he that is strange where i wonder were you bred you can read cannot you yes said i that i can dont you read then said he the commandment remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shall thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shall not do any work yes replied i i have both read it often and remember it very jews not to christians and this is not that day for that was the seventh day but this  the first how said he do you know the days of the week no better you had need then e better taught  here the younger constable whose name was cherry interposing said mr warden the gentleman is in the right as to that for this is the first day of the week and not the seventh  this the old warden took in dudgeon and oking severely on the constable said what  you take upon you to teach me i will have you now i will not be taught by you as you please r that sir said the constable but i am sure u are mistaken in this point for saturday i ow is the seventh day and you know yesterday as saturday  this made the warden hot and testy and ut him almost out of all patience so that i ard it would have come to a downright quarel betwixt them for both were confident and neither would yield and so earnestly were ey engaged in the contest that there was no oom for me to put in a word between them  at length the old man having talked himlf out of wind stood still a while as it were    take breath and then bethinking himself of e he turned to me and said you are discharg and may take your liberty to go about your occans but said i i desire my horse may be ischarged too else i know not how to go y ay said he you shall have your horse and go see that his horse b delivered to him  away thereupon went i with that constable leaving the old warden and the young constable to compose their difference as they could being come to the inn the constable called for my horse to be brought out which done i immediately mounted and began to set forward but the hostler not knowing the condition of my pocket said modestly  me sir dont you forget to pay for your horse standing no truly said i i dont forget it but i have no money to pay it with and so  told the warden before well hold you yo tongue said the constable to the hostler i see you paid then opening the gate they l me out the constable wishing me a good jouney and through the town i rode without further molestation though it was as much sabbath i thought when i went out as i was when i came in  a secret joy arose in me as i rode on the way for that i had been preserved from ding or saying any thing which might gi the adversaries of truth advantage again it or the friends of it and praises sprang i my thankful heart to the lord my preserve  it added also not a little to my joy that  felt the lord near unto me by his witness i my heart to check and warn me and m spirit was so far subjected to him as readily   for as i rode between reading and maindenead i saw lying in my way the scabbard of an anger which having lost its hook had slipped off i suppose and dropped from the side of the wearer and it had in it a pair of knives whose hafts being inlaid with silver seemed o be of some value i alighted and took it p and clapping it between my thigh and he saddle rode on a little way but i quickly ound it too heavy for me and the reprover  me soon began to check the word arose  me what have thou to do with that does it elong to thee i felt i had done amiss in taking  wherefore i turned back to the place where  lay and laid it down where i found it and when afterward i was stopped and seized on at maidenhead i saw there was a providence in ot bringing it with me which if it should ave been found as it needs must under my oat when i came to be unhorsed might ave raised some evil suspicion or sinister houghts concerning me  the stop i met with at maidenhead had ent me so much time that when i came to aac peningtons the meeting there was half er which gave them occasion after meetg to enquire of me if any thing had befaln me on the way which had caused me  come so late whereupon i related to them that exercise i had met with and how the lord had helped me through it which when  great was the love and manifold the kindnesses which i received from these my worthy friends isaac and mary penington while i abode in their family they were indeed as affectionate parents and tender nurses to me in this time of my religious childhood for besides their weighty and seasonable counsels and exemplary conversations they furnishe me with means to go to the other meetings o friends in that country when the meeting was not in their own house and indeed the time i staid with them was so well spent tha it not only yielded great satisfaction to m mind but turned in good measure to my spritual advantage in the truth  but that i might not on the one hand bea too hard upon my friends nor on the other hand forget the house of thraldom after  had staid with them some six or seven week from the time called easter to the tim called whitsuntide i took my leave of the to depart home intending to walk to wiccom in one day and from thence home in another  that day that i came home i did not see my father nor until noon the next day when i went into the parlour when he was to take my usual place at dinner  as soon as i came in i observed by my fathers countenance that my hat was still an offense to him but when i was sitten down and before i had eaten any thing he made me if you cannot content your self  come to dinner without your hive on your ead so he called my hat pray rise and go ke your dinner somewhere else  upon those words i arose from the table d leaving the room went into the kitchen here i staid till the servants went to dinner d then sat down very contentedly with em yet i suppose my father might intend at i should have gone into some other room d there have eaten by my self but i chose ther to eat with the servants and did so om thenceforward so long as he and i lived gether and from this time he rather chose  i thought to avoid seeing me than to rew the quarrel about my hat  my sisters mean while observing my waess in words and behavior and being safied i suppose that i acted upon a principle  religion and conscience carried themselves ry kindly to me and did what they could to itigate my fathers displeasure against me  that i now enjoyed much more quiet at ome and took more liberty to go abroad amongst my friends than i had done or could  before and having informed my self here any meetings of friends were holden ithin a reasonable distance from me i resortd to them  at first i went to a town called haddenham  buckinghamshire five miles from my fathers belson  few who were called quakers did meet some times on a first day of the week but i foun little satisfaction there afterward upon futher enquiry i understood there was a settle meeting at a little village called meadle abo four long miles from me in the house of o john white which is continued there still  and to that thenceforward i constantly wen while i abode in that country and was ab many a sore days travel have i had thith and back again being commonly in the witer time how fair soever the weather was ver head wet up to the ancles at least y through the goodness of the lord to me  was preserved in health  a little meeting also there was on t fourth day of the week at a town call bledlow two miles from me in the house  one thomas saunders who professed the trut but his wife whose name was damaris  possess it she being a woman of great sincety and lively sense and to that meeting a i usually went  but though i took this liberty for the svice of god that i might worship him the assemblies of his people yet did i not  it upon other occasions but spent my ti on other days for the most part in my chamber in retiredness of mind waiting on  lord and the lord was graciously pleed to visit me by his quickening spirit a life so that i came to feel the operation of  power in my heart working out that which was contrary to his will and giving me in measure dominion over it  and as my spirit was kept in a due subjectin to this divine power i grew into a nearer acuaintance with the lord and the lord ouchsafed to speak unto me in the inward of y soul and to open my understanding in his ear to receive counsel from him so that i ot only at sometimes heard his voice but ould distinguish his voice from the voice of he enemy  as thus i daily waited on the lord a weighty and unusual exercise came upon me which bowed my spirit very low before the lord i had seen in the light of the lord he horrible guilt of those deceitful priests f diverse sorts and denominations who made  trade of preaching and for filthy lucre ake held the people always learning yet so aught them as that by their teaching and ministry they were never able to come to the knowledge much less to the acknowledgment f the truth for as they themselves hated the light because their own deeds were evil so y reviling reproaching and blaspheming the true light  wherewith every man that ometh into the world is enlightened john     hey begat in the people a disesteem of the light and labored as much as in them lay o keep their hearers in the darkness that they might not be turned to the light in themselves est by the light they should discover the wickedness deceitful teachers and turn from them  against this practice of these false teachers the zeal of the lord had flamed in my breast sor some time and now the burden of the word of the lord against them fell heavy upon me with command to proclaim his controversy against them  fain would i have been excused from this service which i judged too heavy for me wherefore i besought the lord to take this weight from off me who was in every respect but young and lay it upon some other of his servants of whom he had many who were much more able and fit for it but the lord would not be entreated but continued the burden upon me with greater weight requiring obedience from me and promising to assist me therein whereupon i arose from my bed and in the fear and dread of the lord committed to writing what he in the motion of his divine spirit dictated to me to write when i had done it though the sharpness of the message therein delivered was hard to my nature to be the publisher of yet i found acceptance with the lord in my obedience to his will and his peace filled my heart as soon as i could i communicated to my friends what i had written and it was printed in the year    0 in one sheet of paper under the title of an alarm to the priests or a message from heaven to forewarn them etc  london i went to visit george fox the younger who with another riend was then a prisoner in a messengers ands i had never seen him nor he me bere yet this paper lying on the table before im he pointing to it asked me if i was e person that writ it i told him i was it is uch said the other friend that they bear it  is replied he their portion and they must ear it  while i was then in london i went to a tle meeting of friends which was then held  the house of one humphry bache a goldmith at the sign of the snail in towerstreet  was then a very troublesome time not from e government but from the rabble of boys d rude people who upon the turn of the imes at the return of the king took lierty to be very abusive  when the meeting ended a pretty number  these unruly folk were got together at the oor ready to receive the friends as they came th not only with evil words but with ows which i saw they bestowed freely on me of them that were gone out before me d expected i should have my share of when  came amongst them but quite contrary to y expectation when i came out they said e to another let him alone dont meddle th him he is no quaker i will warrant you  this struck me and was worse to me than  they had laid their fists on me as they did quake and upon a close examination of my self wit respect to my habit and deportment i could not find any thing to place it on but that  had then on my head a large mountiercap  black velvet the skirt of which being turne up in folds looked it seems somewhat abo the then common garb of a quaker and the put me out of conceit with my cap  i came at this time to london from isa peningtons and thither i went again in  way home and while i staid there among other friends who came thither thomas lo  oxford was one a faithful and diligent bourer he was in the work of the lord a an excellent ministerial gift he had and in my zeal for truth being very desirous t my neighbors might have the opporunity  hearing the gospel the glad tidings of salvtion livingly and powerfully preached amo them entered into communication with h about it offering to procure some convenie place in the town where i lived for a meing to be held and to invite my neighbo to it if he could give me any ground to pect his company at it he told me he  not at his own command but at the lords  he knew not how he might dispose of him  wished me if i found when i was come home t the thing continued with weight upon my mi and that i could get a fit place for a meeting  would advertize him of it by a few lines directed to him in oxford whither he was then going and he might then let me know how his freedom stood in that matter  when therefore i was come home and had treated with a neighbor for a place to have a meeting in i wrote to my friend thomas lo to acquaint him that i had procured a place for a meeting and would invite company to it if he would fix the time and give e some ground to hope that he would be t it  this letter i sent by a neighbor to them o be given to a dyer of oxford who constanty kept thamemarket with whom i was pretty well acquainted having sometimes formerly used him not only in his way of trade ut to carry letters between my brother and e when he was a student in that university r which he was always paid and had been o careful in the delivery that our letters had lways gone safe until now but this time providence so ordering or at least for my trial permitting it this letter of mine intead of being delivered according to its diretion was seized and carried as i was told o the lord faulkland who was then called lord lieutenant of that county  the occasion of this stopping of letters at that time was that mad prank of those inatuated fifthmonarchymen who from their meeting house in colemanstreet london breakng forth in arms under the command of venner made an insurrection in the city on pretense of setting up the kingdom of jesus who it is said they expected would come down from heaven to be their leader so little understood they the nature of his kingdom though he himself had declared it was not of this world  the king a little before his arrival in england had by his declaration from breda given assurance of liberty to tender conscience and that no man should be disquieted or called in question for differences of opinion in matters of religion who do not disturb the peace o the kingdom upon this assurance dissenters o all sorts relied and held themselves secur but now by this frantic action of a few ho brained men the king was by some holde discharged from this his royal word an promise in his foregoing declaration publicly given and hereupon letters were intercepted and broken open for discovery o suspected plots and designs against the government and not only dissenters meetings o all sorts without distinction were disturbed but very many were imprisoned in most parts throughout the nation and great search the was in all countries for suspected persons who if not found at meetings were fetched in from their own houses  the lord lieutenant so called of oxfordshire had on this occasion taken thomas lo and many other of our friends at a meeting and sen them prisoners to oxfordcastle just before my thomas lo to a meeting and he utting the worst construction upon it as if i a poor simple lad had intended a seditious meeting in order to raise rebellion ordered wo of the deputy lieutenants who lived near to me to send a party of horse to fetch e in  accordingly while i wholly ignorant of that had passed at oxford was in daily exctation of an agreeable answer to my letter me a party of horse one morning to my faers gate and asked for me  it so fell out that my father was at that e from home i think in london whereup he that commanded the party alighted and me in my eldest sister hearing the noise  soldiers came hastily up into my chamber d told me there were soldiers below who quired for me i forthwith went down to em and found the commander was a bar of them and one who had always been  barber till i was a quaker his name was ately a bold brisk fellow  i asked him what his business was with me  told me i must go with him i demand to see his warrant he laid his hand on his lord and said that was his warrant i told  though that was not a legal warrant  i would not dispute it but was ready to r injuries he told me he could not help  he was commanded to bring me forthwith be the deputy lieutenants and therefore desired  he thereupon taking my sister aside told he he found i was resolute and his orders were peemptory wherefore he desired that she would give order for an horse to be made ready for me for otherwise he should be forced to mou me behind a trooper which would be ver unsuitable for me and which he was very uwilling to do she thereupon ordered an hor to be got ready upon which when i had taken leave of my sisters i mounted and went of not knowing whither he intended to carry me  he had orders it seems to take some others also in a neighboring village who names he had but their houses he did n know wherefore as we rode he asked m if i knew such and such men whom he naed and where they lived and when he undestood that i knew them he desired me to she him their houses no said i i scorn to  an informer against my neighbors to bri them into trouble he thereupon riding  and fro found by enquiry most of their hoses but as it happened found none of the at home at which i was glad  clark of weston by them ho being afterward knighted was called r john clark a jolly man too much addict to drinking in soberer times but was now own more licensious that way as the times d now more favor debauchery he and i d known one another for some years though t very intimately having met sometimes at e lord wenmans table  this clark was one of the deputylieutents whom i was to be brought before and  had gotten another thither to join with him  tendering me the oaths whom i knew only  name and character he was called esquire owls of grays by henly and reputed a man  better morals than the other  i was brought into the hall and kept there d as quakers were not so common then as ey now are and indeed even yet the more  the pity they are not common in that part  the country i was made a spectacle and zingstock to the family and by diverse i s diversely set upon some spoke to me courously with appearance of compassion oers ruggedly with evident tokens of wrath d scorn but though i gave them the hearg of what they said which i could not well id yet i said little to them but keeping y mind as well retired as i could i breathed  the lord for help and strength from him  bear me up and carry me through this try that i might not sink under it or be prevailed  at length came forth the justices themselves for so they were as well as lieutenants an after they had saluted me they discoursed wit me pretty familiarly and though clark would sometimes be a little jocular and waggis which was somewhat natural to him ye knowls treated me very civilly not seeming  take any offense at my not standing bare before him and when a young priest who  i understood was chaplain in the famil took upon him pragmatically to reprove me  standing with my hat on before the magstrates and snatched my cap from of  head knowls in a pleasant manner correct him telling him he mistook himself in taki a cap for a hat for mine was a mountierca and bid him give it me again which  though unwillingly doing i forthwith p it on my head again and thenceforward no meddled with me about it  then they began to examine me putti diverse questions to me relating to the pres disturbances in the nation occasioned by t late foolish insurrection of those frantic fif monarchymen to all which i readily aswered according to the simplicity of  heart and innocence of my hands for i h neither done nor thought any evil again the government  innuens that for all my pretense of innocence ere was high matter against me which if would stand out  would be brought forth and at under my own hand i knew not what ey meant by this but i knew my innocence d kept to it  at length when they saw i regarded not eir threats in general they asked me if i ew one thomas lo and had written of late  him i then remembered my letter which  then i had not thought of and thereupon nkly told them that i did both know thos lo and had lately written to him but at as i knew i had written no hurt so i did t fear any danger from that letter they ook their heads and said it was dangerous to rite letters to appoint meetings in such troublee times  they added that by appointing a meeting and eavouring to gather a concourse of people toger in such a juncture especially as this was i had dered my self a dangerous person and theree they could do no less than tender me the oaths  allegience and supremacy which therefore y required me to take  i told them if i could take any oath at all  would take the oath of allegiance for i owed legiance to the king but i durst not ke any oath because my lord and master sus christ had commanded me not  swear at all and if i brake his command  hereupon they undertook to reason with m and used many words to persuade me the that command of christ related only to common a profane swearing not to swearing before a mastrate i heard them and saw the weakn of their arguings but did not return the any answer for i found my present busin was not to dispute but to suffer and that  was not safe for me in this my weak and chdish state especially to enter into reasoni with sharp quick witty and learned me lest i might thereby hurt both the cause  truth which i was to bear witness to a my self therefore i chose rather to be a for and let them triumph over me than by  weakness give them advantage to triumph ver the truth and my spirit being close exercised in a deep travel toward the lord  earnestly begged of him that he would  pleased to keep me faithful to the testimo he had committed to me and not suffer me be taken in any of the snares which the emy laid for me and blessed be his h name he heard my cries and preserved  out of them  when the justices saw they could not bo me to their wills they told me they must se me to prison i told them i was contented  suffer whatsoever the lord should suffer the to inflict upon me whereupon they witdrew into the parlour to consult together wh  after a pretty long stay they came forth to me again with great show of kindness telling me they were very unwilling to send me to goal ut would be as favorable to me as possibly they ould and that if i would take the oaths they would pass by all the other matter which they had against me i told them i knew they could not stly have any thing against me for i had neither done nor intended any thing against he government or against them and as to he oaths i assured them that my refusing them was merely matter of conscience to me and that i durst not take any oath whatsoever  it were to save my life  when they heard this they left me again and went and signed a mittimus to send me to rison at oxford and charged one of the trooers that brought me thither who was one of e newly raised militiatroop to convey me fe to oxford but before we departed they lled the trooper aside and gave him private structions what he should do with me which i knew nothing of till i came thither t expected i should go directly to the castle  it was almost dark when we took horse d we had about nine or ten miles to ride e weather thick and cold for it was about e beginning of the twelfth month and i had  boots being snatched away from home on  sudden which made me not care to ride ry fast and my guard who was a tradesman them having confidence in me that i would not give him the slip jogged on without heeding how i followed him  when i was gone about a mile on the way i overtook my fathers man who without my knowledge had followed me at a distance to weston and waited there abroad in the stables till he understood by some of the servants that i was to go to oxford and then ran before resolving not to leave me till he saw what they would do with me  i would have had him return home but he desired me not to send him back but let him run on till i came to oxford i considered that it was a token of the fellows affectionate kindness to me and that possibly i might send my horse home by him and thereupon stopping my horse i bid him if he would go on get up behind me he modestly refused telling me he could run as fast as i rid but when i had told him if he would not ride he should not go forward he rather than leave me leaped up behind me and on we went  but he was not willing i should have gone at all he had a great cudgel in his hand and a strong arm to use it and being a stout fellow he had a great mind to fight the trooper and rescue me wherefore he desired me to turn my horse and and ride off and if the trooper offered to pursue leave him to deal with him    we came pretty late into oxford on the seventh day of the week which was the market day and contrary to my expectation which was to have been carried to the castle my trooper stopped in the high street and calling at a shop asked for the master of the house who coming to the door he delivered to him the mittimus and with it a letter from the deputy lieutenants or one of them which when he had read he asked where the prisoner was whereupon the soldier pointing to me he desired me to alight and come in which when i did he received me civilly  the trooper being discharged of his prisoner marched back and my fathers man seeing me settled in better quarters than he expected mounted my horse and went off with him  i did not presently understand the quality of my keeper but i found him a genteel linnendraper and as i afterward understood he was the citymarshall had a command in the county troop and was a person of good repute in the place his name was  galloway  whether i was committed to him out of regard to my father that i might not be thrust into a common goal or out of a politic design to keep me from the conversation of my friends in hopes that i might be draw to abandon this profession which i had but lately taken up i do not know but this i know that though i wanted no civil treatment nor kind accommodations where i was yet after once i understood that many frien were prisoners in the castle and amongst the rest thomas lo i had much rather have been among them there with all the inconveniences they underwent than where i was with the best entertainment but this was my present lot and therefore with this i endeavored to be content  it was quickly known in the city that a quaker was brought in prisoner and committed to the marshall whereupon the men friends being generally prisoners already in the castle some of the women friends came to enquire after me and to visit me as silas nortons wife and thomas loes wife who were sisters and another woman friend who lived in the same street where i was whose husband was not a quaker but kindly affected toward them a baker by trade and his name as i remember ryland  thomas lo to salute me with a ery tender and affectionate letter in the folowing terms my beloved friend in the truth and love of the lord jesus by which life and salvation is revealed in the aints is my dear love unto thee and in much enderness do i salute thee and dear heart a ime of trial god has permitted to come upon us  try our faith and love to him and this will ork for the good of them that through patience dure to the end and i believe god will be orified through our sufferings and his name will  exalted in the patience and longsuffering of s chosen when i heard that thou wast called to this trial with the servants of the most high  give thy testimony to the truth of what we have lieved it came into my heart to write unto thee and to greet thee with the embraces of the power f an endless life where our faith stands and nity is felt with the saints for ever well my ear friend let us live in the pure counsel of the lord and dwell in his strength which gives us power and sufficiency to endure all things for his names sake and then our crown and reward will be with the lord for ever and the blessings  his heavenly kingdom will be our portion o dear heart let us give up all freely into the w of god that god may be glorified by us and  comforted together in the lord jesus which  the desire of my soul who am  thy dear and loving friend in the eternal truth thomas lo we are more than forty here which suffer inocently for the testimony of a good consence because we cannot swear and bre christs commands and we are all well  the blessings and presence of god is with  friends here salute thee farewell  the power and the wisdom of the lord god  with thee amen       greatly was my spirit refreshed and  heart gladded at the reading of this conslating letter from my friend and my so blessed the lord for his love and tender gooness to me in moving his servant to wri thus unto me  but i had cause soon after to double a redouble my thankful acknowledgment to t lord my god who put it into the heart  my dear friend isaac penington also to vi me with some encouraging lines from alesbu goal where he was then a prisoner and from whence having heard that i was carried psoner to oxford he thus saluted me great has been the lords goodness to thee in calling thee out of that path of vanity and death wherein thou wast running toward destruction to give thee a living name and an inheritance of life among his people which certainly will be the end of thy faith in him and obedience to him and let it not be a light thing in thine eyes that he now accounts thee worthy to suffer among his choice lambs that he might make thy crown weightier and thy inheritance he fuller o that that eye and heart may be ept open in thee which knows the value of these things and that thou may be kept close to the feeling of the life that thou may be fresh in thy spirit in the midst of thy sufferings and may reap he benefit of them finding that pared off thereby which hinders the bubblings of the everlasting springs and makes unfit for the breaking forth and enjoyment of the pure power this is the rief salutation of my dear love to thee which esireth thy strength and settlement in the power nd the utter weakening of thee as to self my dear love is to thee with dear thomas goodyare and the rest of imprisoned friends i remain  thine in the truth to which the lord my god preserve me single and faithful i p from alesburygoal   th of   th mo    0      for although my marshallkeeper was ve kind to me and allowed me the liberty of h house yet he was not willing i should b seen abroad the rather perhaps because h understood i had been pretty well known i that city yet once the friendly baker g him to let me step over to his house and onc and but once i prevailed with him to let m visit my friends in the castle but it was wit these conditions that i should not go fort till it was dark that i would muffle my se up in my cloak and that i would not sta out late all which i punctually observed  when i came thither though there we many friends prisoners i scarce knew one  them by face except thomas lo whom  had once seen at isaac peningtons nor did a of them know me though they had generall heard that such a young man as i was covinced of the truth and come among friend  our salutation to each other was very grav and solemn nor did we entertain one another with much talk or with common discourse thomas lo ore particularly know that i had directed a etter to him which having fallen into the and of the lord lieutenant was so far as  could learn the immediate cause of my beg taken up  having staid with them as long as my liitted time would permit which i thought as but very short that i might keep touch ith my keeper and come home in due time  took leave of my friends there and with utual embraces parting returned to my in me sense more easy but in others less easy rison where after this i staid not long bere i was brought back to my fathers house  for after my father was come home who  i observed before was from home when i as taken he applied himself to those justices at had committed me and not having disliged them when he was in office easily tained to have me sent home which between m and them was thus contrived  there was about this time a general muster and training of the militiaforces at oxford whither on that occasion came the lordieutenant and the deputy lieutenants of the  when they had been a while together and the marshall with them he stepped suddenly in and in haste told me i must get ready quickly to go out of town and that a soldier would come by and by to go with me this said he hastened to them again not giving me any intimation how i was to go or whither  i needed not much time to get ready in but i was uneasy in thinking what the friend of the town would think of this my suddai and private removal and i feared lest a report should be raised that i had purchase my liberty by an unfaithful complian wherefore i was in care how to speak wi some friend about it and that friendly bake whose wife was a friend living on the oth side of the street at a little distance i we out at a back door intending to step over t way to their house and return immediatel  it so fell out that some of the lieutenan of whom esquire clark who committed me w one were standing in a balcony at a gre inn or tavern just over th place where i w to go by and he spying me called out to t soldiers who stood thick below in the stree to stop me they being generally gentmens servants and many of them knowin me did civilly forbear to lay hold on me b calling modestly after me said stay sir sta pray come back i heard but was not willin to hear therefore rather mended my pa  being thus disappointed i took a pen and k and wrote a few lines which i sealed  and gave to the apprentice in the shop ho had carried himself handsomely to me d desired him to deliver it to that friend ho was their neighbor which he promised  do  by that time i had done this came the soler that was appointed to conduct me out of wn i knew the man for he lived within  mile of me being through poverty reduced  keep an alehouse but he had lived in bet fashion having kept an inn at them d by that means knew how to behave himf civilly and did so to me  he told me he was ordered to wait on me  whately and to tarry there at such an inn  esquire clark came thither who would then ke me home with him in his coach acrdingly to whately we walked which is from ford some four or five miles and long we d not been there before clark and a great mpany of rude men came in  he alighted and stayed a while to eat and ink though he came but from oxford and vited me to eat with him but i though i d need enough refused it for indeed their lot  he seemed at that time to be in a sort  mixt temper between pleasantness and souness he would sometimes joke which wa natural to him and cast out a jesting flurt a me but he would rail maliciously against the quakers if said he to me the king wou authorize me to do it i would not leave a quak alive in england except you i would make  more added he to set my pistol to their ears a shoot them through the head than i would to  a dog i told him i was sorry he had so  an opinion of the quakers but i was glad  had no cause for it and i hoped he would  of a better mind  i had in my hand a little walkingsti with a head on it which he commended a took out of my hand to look on it but i sa his invention was to search it whether it h a tuck in it for he tried to have drawn t head but when he found it was fast he  turned it to me  he told me i should ride with him to his ho in his coach which was nothing pleasant  me for i had rather have gone on foot  bad as the ways were that i might have bee out of his company wherefore i took no ntice of any kindness in the offer but onl answered i was at his disposal not min own  but when we were ready to go the marsha came to me and told me if i pleased i shou ide his horse and he would go in the coach with mr clark i was glad of the offer and only ld him he should take out his pistols then r i would not ride with them he took em out and laid them in the coach by him d away we went  it was a very fine beast that i was set on y much the best in the company but though e was very tall yet the ways being very foul  found it needful as soon as i was out of own to alight and take up the stirrups ean while they driving hard on i was so r behind that being at length missed by the ompany a soldier was sent back to look er me  as soon as i had fitted my stirrups and was emounted i gave the rein to my mare which being courageous and nimble and imtient of delay made great speed to recover e company and in a narrow passage the ldier who was my barber that had fetched e from home and i met upon so brisk a allop that we had enough to do on either de to take up our horses and avoid a brush when we were come to weston where esquire ark lived he took the marshall and some hers with him into the parlour but i was ft in the hall to be exposed a second time r the family to gaze on  at length himself came out to me leading  his hand a beloved daughter of his a oung woman of about eighteen years of ge who wanted nothing to have made her her tom will you kiss her i was grieved and ashamed at this frothy lightness and i suppos he perceived it whereupon he drew neare as if he would have whispered and the said will you lie with her at which i wi a disdainful look turning away he said  think it would be better for you than to be a quker and so little consideration and rega to modesty had she that she added i thi so too  this was all by candle light and wh they had made themselves as much sport wi me as they would the marshall took his lea of them and mounting me on a horse  clarks had me home to my fathers the night  next morning before the marshall we away my father and he consulted togeth how to entangle me i felt there were snar laid but i did not know in what manner or  what end till the marshall was ready to g and then coming where i was to take  leave of me he desired me to take notice the although he had brought me home to my father house again yet i was not discharged from  imprisonment but was his prisoner still and t he had committed me to the care of my father  see me forthcoming whenever i should be cal for and therefore he expected i should in all thi serve my fathers orders and not go at any time m the house without his leave  now i plainly saw the snare and to what d it was laid and i asked him if this dee was not contrived to keep me from going  meetings he said i must not go to meetings ereupon i desired him to take notice that  would not own my self a prisoner to any man ile i coninued here that if he had power etain me prisoner he might take me back in with him if he would and i should not se to go with him but i bid him assure self that while i was at home i would e my liberty both to go to meetings and isit friends he smiled and said if i would esolute he could not help it and so took his e of me  by this i perceived that the plot was of my ers laying to have brought me under such  engagement as should have tied me from g to meetings and thereupon i expected ould have a new exercise from my father   was the constant manner of my father to  all the keys of the outdoors of his house ich were four and those linked upon a in brought up into his chamber every ht and fetched out from thence in the ning so that none could come in or go  in the night without his knowledge   knowing this suspected that if i got not  before my father came down i should be ed from going out at all that day where the passage from my chamber lying by meadle four long miles off  i expected to have been talked with about it when i came home but heard nothing of it my father resolving to watch me better next time  this i was aware of and therefore on the next first day i got up early went down softly and hid my self in a backroom before the maid was stirring  when she was up she went into my fathers chamber for the keys but he bid her leave them till he was up and he would bring them down himself which he did and tarried in the kitchen through which he expected i would go  the manner was that when the common doors were opened the keys were hung upon a pin in the hall while therefore my father staid in the kitchen expecting my coming  stepping gently out of the room where i wa reached the keys and opening another doo not often used slipped out and so got away  i thought i had gone off undiscovered bu whether my father saw me through a window or by what other means he knew of my going i know not but i had gone but a little way before i saw him coming after me  the sight of him put me to a stand in my mind whether i should go on or stop ha  this he observing mended his pace also  at length ran whereupon i ran also  a fair course we had through a large meaw of his which lay behind his house and  of sight of the town he was not i supe then above fifty years of age and be light of body and nimble of foot he held  to it for a while but afterward slacking  pace to take breath and observing that i  gotten ground of him he turned back  went home and as i afterward underd telling my sisters how i had served him  said nay if he will take so much pains to go  him go if he will and from that time forrd he never attempted to stop me but left  to my liberty to go when and whither i uld yet kept me at the usual distance aing the sight of me as much as he could ot able to bear the sight of my hat on nor ing to contend with me again about it  nor was it long after this before i was left  only to my self but in a manner by my  for the time appointed for the coronation april drawing on my ther taking my two sisters with him went  to london sometime before that they might  there in readiness and put themselves in condition to see that so great a solemni leaving no body in the house but my self a a couple of servants and though this was tended only for a visit on that occasion ye proved the breaking of the family for he stowed both his daughters there in marria and took lodgings for himself so that aftwards they never returned to settle at cr  being now at liberty i walked over to bury with some other friends to visit my  friend isaac penington who was still a pris there with him i found dear john whit and between sixty and seventy more be wellnigh all the menfriends that were  in the county of bucks many of them  taken out of their houses by armed men  sent to prison as i had been for refusing  swear most of these were thrust into a room behind the goal which had ancie been a malthouse but was now so deca that it was scarce fit for a doghouse a open it lay that the prisoners might have g out at pleasure but these were purposely  there in confidence that they would not  out that there might be room in the p for others of other professions and na whom the jailer did not trust there    after this imprisonment was over i went etimes to isaac peningtons house at chal to visit that family and the friends thereuts there was then a meeting for the st part twice a week in his house but one st day in four there was a more general eting which was thence called the monthly eting to which resorted most of the friends ther adjacent meetings and to that i usu went and sometimes made some stay re  here i came acquainted with a friend of don whose name was richard greenaway  trade a tailor a very honest man and one o had received a gift for the ministry  he having been formerly in other profess of religion had then been acquainted th one john ovy of watlington in oxfordshire  man of some note among the professors ere and understanding upon enquiry t i knew him he had some discourse with  about him the result whereof was that  having an intention then shortly to visit e meetings of friends in this county and oxfordshire and berksh invited me to meet him upon notice giv and to bear him company in that journ and in the way bring him to john ovys ho with whom i was well acquainted wh i did  we were kindly received the man and  wife being very glad to see both their  friend richard greenaway and me also w they had been very well acquainted with merly but had never seen me since i w quaker  here we tarried that night and in the vening had a little meeting there with  few of john ovys people amongst who g declared the truth which they atively heard and did not oppose which at  time of day we reckoned was pretty w for many were apt to cavil  this visit gave john ovy an opportunity t quire of me after isaac penington whose wri those which he had written before he  among friends he had read and had a  esteem of and he expressed a desire to see  that he might have some discourse with  if he knew how whereupon i told him  if he would take the pains to go to his ho i would bear him company thither intro him and engage he should have a  reception  this pleased him much and he embra the offer i undertook to give him noti a suitable time which after i had gone  richard greenay and was retured i did making choice  the monthly meeting to go to  we met by appointment at stokenchurch ith our staves in our hands like a couple of lgrims intending to walk on foot and hag taken some refreshment and rest at wicmb went on cheerfully in the afternoon enrtaining each other with grave and religis discourse which made the walk the ear and so reached thither in good time on e seventh day of the week  i gave my friends an account who this pern was whom i had brought to visit them d the ground of his visit he had been a ofessor of religion from his childhood to s old age for he was now both gray headed d elderly and was a teacher at this time and had long been so amongst a people wheer independants or baptists i do not well reember and so well thought of he was for s zeal and honesty that in those late prosing times he was thrust into the commission  the peace and thereby lifted up upon the ench which neither became him nor he it r he wanted indeed most of the qualificaons requisite for a justice of the peace an tate to defray the charge of the office and  bear him up in a course of living above ontempt a competent knowledge in the aws and a presence of mind or body or oth to keep offenders in some awe in all which he was deficient for he was but a fellmonger  my friends received me in affectionate kiness and my companion with courteous cility the evening was spent in common  grave conversation for it was not a prop season for private discourse both as we we somewhat weary with our walk and the were other companies of friends come into  family to be at the meeting next day  but in the morning i took john ovy into  private walk in a pleasant grove near t house whither isaac penington came to  and there in discourse both answered all h questions objections and doubts and opeed to him the principles of truth to  both admiration and present satisfaction which done we went in to take some refreshment before the meeting began  of those friends who were come over nigh in order to be at the meeting there was isaac brother william penington a merchant london and  with him a friend whose nam i have forgotten a grocer of colchester in essex and there was also our friend george whitehead  the nation had been in a ferment ever ce that mad action of the frantic fifthonarchymen and was not yet settled but orms like thundershowers flew here and ere by coast so that we could not promise r selves any safety or quiet in our meetgs and though they had escaped disturbce for some little time before yet so it fell t that a party of horse were appointed to me and break up the meeting that day ough we knew nothing of it till we heard d saw them  the meeting was scarce fully gathered when ey came but we that were in the family d many others were settled in it in great ace and stilness when on a sudden the ancing of the horses gave notice that ghtning was at hand  we all sat still in our places except my mpanion john ovy who sat next to me t he being of a profession that approved pes advice to his lord to save himself soon k the alarm and with the nimbleness of  stripling cutting a caper over the form at stood before him ran quickly out at a prite door which he had before observed which led through the parlour into the gardens d from thence into an orchard where he d himself in a place so obscure and withal  convenient for his intelligence by observation  by that time he was got into his burrow came the soldiers in being a party of the county troop commanded by matthew ardale of wiccomb he behaved himself civill and said he was commanded to break up t meeting and carry the men before a justice of t peace but he said he would not take all an thereupon began to pick and choose chiefly a his eye guided him for i suppose he knew very few  he took isaac penington and his brothe george whitehead and the friend of colcheste and me with three or four more of t country who belonged to that meeting  he was not fond of the work and the made him take no more but he must ta some he said and bid us provide to go wi him before sir william boyer of denham w was a justice of the peace isaac penington being but weakly rode but the rest of us waed thither it being about four miles  when we came there the justice carrie himself civilly to us all courteously to isa penington as being a gentleman of his neighborhood and there was nothing charged against us but that we were met together without word or deed yet this being contrary t a late proclamation given forth upon the risin of the fifthmonarchymen whereby all disseters meetings were forbidden the justice could do no less than take notice of us  g whitehead was of westmorland in the north of england the grocer was of essex i was of oxfordshire and w penington was of london  hereupon he told us that our case looked ill and he was sorry for it for how said he can it be imagined that so many could jump altogether at one time and place from such remote quarters and parts of the kingdom if it was not by combination and appointment  he was answered that we were so far from coming thither by agreement or appointment that none of us knew of the others coming and for the most of us we had never seen one another before and that therefore he might impute it to chance or if he pleased to providence  he urged upon us that an insurrection had been lately made by armed men who pretended to be more religious than others that that insurrecton had been plotted and contrived in their meeting house where they assembled under color of worshipping god that in their meeting house they hid their arms and armed themselves and out of their meeting house issued forth in arms and killed many so that the government could not be safe unless such meetings were suppressed  guilty and the innocent and between those who were principled for fighting and those who were principled against it which we were and had been always known to be so that our meetings were public our doors standing open to all comers of all ages sexes and persuasions men women and children and those that were not of our religion as well as those that were and that it was next to madness for people to plot in such meetings  he told us we must find sureties for our good behavior and to answer our contempt of the kings proclamation at the next general quarter sessions or else he must commit us  we told him that knowing our innocence and that we had not misbehaved our selves nor did meet in contempt of the kings authority but purely in obedience to the lords requirings to worship him which we held our selves in duty bound to do we could not consent to be bound for that would imply guilt which we were free from  then said he i must commit you and ordered his clerk to make a mittimus and diverse mittimusses were made but none of them would hold for still when they came to be read we found such flaws in them as made him through them aside and write more  he had his eye often upon me for i was a young man and had at that time a black suit on at length he bid me follow him and  i knew not what he meant by this but i cried in spirit to the lord that he would be pleased to be a mouth and wisdom to me and keep me from being entangled in any snare  he asked me many questions concerning my birth my education my acquaintance in oxfordshire particularly what men of note i knew there to all which i gave him brief but plain and true answers naming several families of the best rank in that part of the country where i dwelt  he asked me how long i had been of this way and how i came to be of it which when i had given him some account of he began to persuade me to leave it and return to the right way the church as he called it i desired him to spare his pains in that respect and forbear any discourse of that kind for that i was fully satisfied the way i was in was the right way and hoped the lord would so preserve me in it that nothing should be able to draw or drive me out of it he seemed not pleased with that and thereupon went out to the rest of the company and i followed him glad in my heart that i had escaped so well and praising god for my deliverance  when he had taken his seat again at the upper end of a fair hall he told us he was not willing to take the utmost rigor of the law against us but would be as favorable penington himself because he was but at home in his own house an he would discharge mr penington of london because he come but as a relation to visit hi brother and he would discharge the groce of colchester because he came to bear mr penington of london company and to be acquainted with mr isaac penington whom he ha never seen before and as for those others o us who were of this country he would discharge them for the present at least because they being his neighbors he could send for them when he would but as for you said he to george whitehead and me i can see no business you had there and therefore i intend to hold you to it either to give bayl or go to jayl  we told him we could not give bayl then said he you must go to jayl and thereupon he began to write our mittimus which puzzled him again for he had discharged so many that he was at a loss what to lay as the ground of our commitment whose case differed nothing in reality from theirs whom he had discharged  at length having made diverse draughts which still g w showed him the defects of he seemed to be weary of us and rising up said unto us i consider that it is grown late in the day so that the officer cannot carry you to alesbury to night and i suppose you will be willing to go back with mr penington therefore if you will promise to be forthcoming at his house to morrow morning i will dismiss you for the present and you shall hear from me again to morrow  we told him we did intend if he did not otherwise dispose of us to spend that night with our friend isaac penington and would if the lord gave us leave be there in the morning ready to answer his requirings whereupon he dismissed us all willing as we thought to be rid of us for he seemed not to be of an ill temper nor desirous to put us to trouble if he could help it  back then we went to isaac peningtons but when we were come thither o the work we had with poor john ovy he was so dejected in mind so covered with shame and confusion of face for his cowardliness that we had enough to do to pacify him toward himself  the place he had found out to shelter himself in was so commodiously contrived that undiscovered he could discern when the soldiers went off with us and understand when the bussle was over and the coast clear whereupon he adventured to peep out of his hole and in a while drew near by degrees to the house again and finding all things quiet and still he adventured to step within the doors and found the friends who were left behind peaceably fettled in the meeting again  the sight of this smote him and made him sit down among them and after the meeting was ended and the friends departed to their several homes addressing himself to mary penington as the mistress of the house he could not enough magnify the bravery and courage of the friends nor sufficiently debase himself he told her how long he had been a professor what pains he had taken what hazards he had run in his youthful days to get to meetings how when the ways were forelaid and passages stopped he swam through rivers to reach a meeting and now sai he that i am grown old in the profession of religion and have long been an instructor and encourager of others that i should thus shamefully fall short my self is matter of shame and sorrow to me  thus he bewailed himself to her and when we came back he renewed his complaints of himself to us with high aggravations of his own cowardice which gave occasion to some of the friends tenderly to represent to him the difference between profession and possession form and power  he was glad he said on our behalfs that we came off so well and escaped imprisonment  but when he understood that g whitehead and i were liable to an afterreckoning next morning he was troubled and wished the morning was come and gone that we might be gone with it  we spent the evening in grave conversation and in religious discourses attributing the deliverance me hitherto had to the lord and the next morning when we were up and had eaten we tarried some time to see what  and when we had staid so long that on all ands it was concluded we might safely go  w and i left a few words in writing to e sent to the justice if he sent after us imorting that we had tarried till such an hour and not hearing from him did now hold our lves free to depart yet so as that if he ould have occasion to send for us again upon otice thereof we would return  this done we took our leave of the family d one of another they who were for lon taking horse and i and my companion ting forth on foot for oxfordshire went to ccomb where we made a short stay to t and refresh our selves and from thence ched our respective homes that night  after i had spent some time at home ere as i had no restraint so my sisters beg gone i had now no society i walked up  chalfont again and spent a few days with  friends there  as soon as i came in i was told that my ther had been there that day to see j p d his wife but they being abroad at a eeting he returned to his inn in the town ere he intended to lodge that night after pper m p told me she had a mind to go d see him at his inn the woman of the use being a friend of ours and i went london to see my sisters the younger  whom was then newly married and direc me where to find em and also gave  money to defray my charges according i went yet staid not long there but retued to my friend j ps where i made a lit stay and from thence went back to crowell  when i was ready to set forth my frie isaac penington was so kind to send a serva with a brace of geldings to carry me as  as i thought fit to ride and to bring the ho back i intending to go no farther t day than to wiccomb rode no farther than beconsfield townsend having then but f miles to walk but here a new exercise fel me the manner of which was thus  before i had walked to the middle of  town i was stopped and taken up by  watch i asked the watchman what athority scrivener whose name was pepys to him he gave the order which he had received from the constables which directed him to take up all rogues vagabonds and sturdy beggars i asked him for which of these he stopped me but he could not answer me  i thereupon informed him what a rogue in law is viz one who for some notorious offense has burnt on the shoulder and i told them they might search me if they pleased and see if i was so branded a vagabond i told them was one that had no dwelling house nor certain place of abode but i had and was going to  and i told them where it was and for a beggar i bid them bring any one that could y i had begged or asked relief  this stopped the fellows mouth yet he would not let me go but being both weakeaded and strongwilled he left me there ith the scrivener and went out to seek the onstable and having found him brought im thither he was a young man by  trade tanner somewhat better mannered than is wardsman but not of much better judgent  he took me with him to his house and aving settled me there went out to take adice as i supposed what to do with me aving no body in the house to guard me  she enquired of me upon what account i was taken up and seeming to have some pity for me endeavored to persuade me not to stay but to go my way offering to show me a back way from their house which would bring me into the road again beyond the town so that none of the town should se me or know what was become of me but  told her i could not do so  then having sat a while in a muze she asked me if there was not a place of scripture wh said peter was at a tanners house i to her there was such a scripture and direct her where to find it  after some time she laid her child to sle in the cradle and stept out on a suddai but came not in again in a pretty while  i was uneasy that i was left alone in t house searing lest if any thing should be msing i might be suspected to have taken  yet i durst not go out to stand in the stree lest it should be thought i intended to slip way  but besides that i soon found work to iploy my self in for the child quickly waki fell to crying and i was fain to rock  cradle in my own defense that i might  be annoyed with a noise to me not more pleasant than unusual at length the wom came in again and finding me nursing   when night came on the constable himlf came in again and told me some of the hief of the town were met together to consider that was fit to do with me and that i must go with m to them i went and he brought me to a ttle nasty hut which they called a townouse adjoining to their markethouse in which dwelt a poor old woman whom they lled mother grime where also the watch used  turns to come in and warm themselves in e night  when i came in among them they looked ome of them somewhat sourly on me and kd me some impertinent questions to which  gave them suitable answers  then they consulted one with another how ey should dispose of me that night till they uld have me before some justice of peace to  examined some proposed that i should be d to some inn or other public house and a ard set on me there he that started this was obably an innkeeper and consulted his own terest others objected against this that it uld bring a charge on the town to avoid ich they were for having the watch take arge of me and keep me walking about e streets with them till morning most ices seemed to go this way till a third shed them to consider whether they could aner the doing of that and the law would bear m out in it and this put them to a stand  while they thus bandied the matter to and fro one of the company asked the rest if any of them knew who this young man was and whither he was going whereupon the constable to whom i had given both my name and the name of the town where i dwelt told them my name was ellwood and that i lived at a town called crowell in oxfordshire  old mother grime sitting by and hearin this clapped her hand on her knee and cry out i know mr ellwood of crowell very we for when i was a maid i lived with his granther there when he was a young man a thereupon she gave them such an account of  father as made them look more regardful on me and so mother grimes testimo turned the scale and took me off fr walking the rounds with the watch t night  the constable hereupon bid them take  further care i should lie at his house t night and accordingly took me home wi him where i had as good accommodation  the house did afford before i went to be he told me that there was to be a visitation  spiritual court as he called it holden next d at amersham about four miles from beconsfie and that i was to be carried thither  this was a new thing to me and it broug a fresh exercise upon my mind but be given up in the will of god to suffer w  in the morning as soon as i was up my spi was exercised toward the lord in strong ies to him that he would stand by me d preserve me and not suffer me to be taken the snare of the wicked while i was thus ying to the lord the other constable e and i was called down  this was a budge fellow and talked high  was a shoomaker by trade and his name s clark he threatned me with the spiril court but when he saw i did not rerd it he stopped and left the matter to his rtner who pretended more kindness for e and therefore went about to persuade rk to let me go out at the back door so  away  the plot i suppose was so laid that clark uld seem averse but at length yield which  did but would have me take it for a far but i was so far from taking it so that  would not take it at all but told them plain that as i came in at the foredoor so i uld go out at the fore door when theree they saw they could not bow me to their ll they brought me out at the fore door o the street and wished me a good journey t before i went calling sor the woman of e house i paid her for my supper and lodgg for i had now getten a little money in my cket again  smallpox of which so soon as friends had notice i had a nurse sent me and in a while isaac penington and his wifes daughter glielma maria springett to whom i had been playfellow in our infancy came to visit me bringing with them our dear friend edward borough by whose ministry i was called  the knowledge of the truth  it pleased the lord to deal favorably wi me in this ilness both inwardly and outwaly for his supporting presence was with m which kept my spirit near unto him a though the distemper was strong upon m yet i was preserved through it and my coutenance was not much altered by it but aft i was got up again and while i kept  chamber wanting some employment  entertainment sake to spend the time wit and there being at hand a pretty good libra of books amongst which were the works  augustine and others of those ancient written who were by many called the fathers i betook my self to reading and these books being printed in the old blackletter with abbreviations of the words difficult to be re i spent too much time therein and thereb much impaired my sight which was n strong before and was now weaker than usu by reason of the ilness i had so newly ha  after i was well enough to go abroad with espect to my own health and the safety of others i went up in the beginning of the welfth month      to my friend isaac pengtons at chalfont and abode there sometime r the airing my self more fully that i might e more fit for conversation  quakers but en i both saw my loss and lamented it d applied my self with utmost diligence at l leisure times to recover it so false i found at charge to be which in those times was st as a reproach upon the quakers that ey despised and decried all humane learning because they denied it to be essentially necessary  a gospel ministry which was one of the conoversies of those times  but though i toiled hard and spared no ains to regain what once i had been master f yet i found it a matter of so great diffiulty that i was ready to say as the noble euuch to philip in another case how can i uness i had some man to guide me  this i had formerly complained of to my special friend isaac penington but now more arnestly which put him upon considering  he had an intimate acquaintance with dr paget a physician of note in london and he with john milton a gentleman of great note for learning throughout the learned world for the accurate pieces he had written on various subjects and occasions  this person having filled a public statio in the former times lived now a private an retired life in london and having wholly l his sight kept always a man to read to hi which usually was the son of some gentlem of his acquaintance whom in kindness  took to improve in his learning  thus by the mediation of my friend isa penington with dr paget and of dr pag with john milton was i admitted to come  him not as a servant to him which at t time he needed not nor to be in the ho with him but only to have the liberty coming to his house at certain hours wh i would and to read to him what books  should appoint me which was all the favo i desired  but this being a matter which would quire some time to bring it about i in  mean while returned to my fathers house  oxfordshire  i had before received direction by lett from my eldest sister written by my father command to put off what cattle he had  about his house and to discharge his serva michaelmas fore so that all that winter when i was  home i lived like an hermit all alone ing a pretty large house and no body in but my self a nights especially but an elrly woman whose father had been an old rvant to the family came every morning d made my bed and did what else i had asion for her to do till i fell ill of the all pox and then i had her with me and  nurse but now understanding by letter m my sister that my father did not intend  return to settle there i made off those proions which were in the house that they ght not be spoiled when i was gone and cause they were what i should have spent if ad tarried there i took the money made of em to my self for my support at london if e project succeeded for my going thither  this done i committed the care of the use to a tenant of my fathers who lived  the town and taking my leave of crowell nt up to my sure friend isaac penington ain where understanding that the median used for my admittance to john milton d succeeded so well that i might come when  would i hastened to london and in the first ace went to wait upon him  he received me courteously as well for the ke of dr paget who introduced me as of aac penington who recommended me to oth whom he bore a good respect and ving enquired diverse things of me with respect  i went therefore and took my self a lodging as near to his house which was then in jewe street as conveniently as i could and from thenceforward went every day in the afternoon except on the first days of the wee and sitting by him in his dining room re to him in such books in the latin tongue as  pleased to hear me read  at my first sitting to read to him observi that i used the english pronounciation he t me if i would have the benefit of the lat tongue not only to read and understand latin athors but to converse with foreigners either broad or at home i must learn the foreign prnounciation to this i consenting he instrued me how to sound the vowels so differe from the common pronounciation used by t english who speak anglice their latin the with some few other variations in soundi some consonants in particular cases as c before e or i like chapter sc before i like sh etc the latin thus spoken seemed as different from that which was delivered as the english generally speak it as if it were another language  i had before during my retired life at my fathers by unwearied diligence and industry so far recovered the rules of grammar in which i had once been very ready that i could both read a latin author and after a sort hammer  labor omnia vincit improbus  incessant pains the end obtains   and so did i which made my reading the re acceptable to my master he on the or hand perceiving with what earnest de i pursued learning gave me not only all  encouragement but all the help he could  having a curious ear he understood by  tone when i understood what i read and en i did not and accordingly would stop  examine me and open the most difficult sages to me  thus went i on for about six weeks time ding to him in the afternoons and exercig my self with my own books in my cham in the forenoons i was sensible of an provement  but alas i had fixed my studies in a wrong ce london and i could never agree for alth my lungs as i suppose were too der to bear the sulphurous air of that city  that i soon began to droop and in less than o months time i was fain to leave both my dies and the city and return into the country  i chose to go down to wiccomb and to jo rances house there both as he was a phycian and his wife an honest hearty discre and grave matron whom i had a very goo esteem of and who i knew had a good rgard for me  there i lay ill a considerable time and  that degree of weakness that scarce any w saw me expected my life but the lord w both gracious to me in my ilness and w pleased to raise me up again that i might ser him in my generation  as soon as i had recovered so much streng as to be fit to travel i obtained of my ther who was then at his house in crowel dispose of some things he had there and w in my ilness had come to see me so much mney as would clear all charges in the hou for both physic food and attendance a having fully discharged all i took leave of m friends in that family and in the town a returned to my studies at london  i was very kindly received by my maste who had conceived so good an opinion of m that my conversation i found was acceptab to him and he seemed heartily glad of my recovery and return and into our old metho of study we fell again i reading to him an he explaining to me as occasion required  but as if learning had been a forbidden fruit to me scarce was i well settled in my  for a sudden storm arising from i know ot what surmise of a plot and thereby daner to the government and the meetings of issenters such i mean as could be found which erhaps were not many besides the quakers were broken up throughout the city and the risons mostly filled with our friends  i was that morning which was the   th ay of the  th month      at the meeting  the bullandmouth by aldersgate when on  sudden a party of soldiers of the trained ands of the city rushed in with noise and lamour being led by one who was called major rosewell an apothecary if i misrememer not and at that time under the ill name f a papist  as soon as he was come within the room aving a file or two of musketteers at his eels he commanded his men to present their muskets at us which they did with intent i suppose to strike a terror into the people then he made a proclamation that all who were not quakers might depart if they would  it so happened that a young man an aprentice in london whose name was  dove the son of dr dove of chinner near crowell in oxfordshire came that day in curiosity to see the meeting and coming early and finding me there whom he knew came and sat down by me  i would not shift for my self and try to get out i told him no i was in my place and was willing to suffer if it was my lot when he heard the notice given that they who were not quakers might depart he solicited me again to be gone i told him i could not do so for that would be to renounce my profession which i would by no means do but as for him who was not one of us he might do as he pleased whereupon wishing me well he turned away and with cap in hand went out and truly i was glad he was gone for his master was a rigid presbyterian who in all likelihood would have led him a wretched life had he been taken and imprisoned among the quakers  the soldiers came so early that the meeting was not fully gathered when they came and when the mixed company were gone out we were so few and sat so thin in that large room that they might take a clear view of us all and single us out as they pleased  he that commanded the party gave us first a general charge to come out of the room but we who came thither at gods requirings to worship him like that good man of old who said we ought to obey god rather than men acts      stirred not but kept out places whereupon he sent some of his soldiers among us with command to drag or drive us out which they did roughly enough    in this work none seemed so eager and ace as their leader major rosewell which bserving stepped boldly to him as he was sing by me and asked him if he intended  massacre for of that in those times there s a great apprehension and talk the sudnness of the question from such a young n especially somewhat startled him but ollecting himself he answered no but i end to have you all hanged by the wholesome laws  the land  when he had gotten as many as he could or ught fit which were in number thirty  whereof two were caught up in the eet who had not been at the meeting he ered the pikes to be opened before us and ing the word to march went himself at the ad of us the soldiers with their pikes mag a lane to keep us from scattering  he led us up martins and so turned down  newgate where i expected he would have ged us but to my disappointment he nt on through newgate and turning through  old bailey brought us into fleet street i s then wholly at a loss to conjecture whir he would lead us unless it were to whitehall oldbridwell but on a sudden he gave a short turn a brought us before the gate of that prison where knocking the wicket was forthwi opened and the master with his porter rdy to receive us  one of those two who were picked up  the street being near me and telling me  case i stepped to the major and told him the this man was not at the meeting but was ken up in the street and showed him  hard and unjust a thing it would be to  him into prison  i had not pleased him before in the questi i had put to him about a massacre and t i suppose made this solicitation less accepta to him from me than it might have been fr some other for looking sternly on me  said who are you that take so much upon  seeing you are so busy you shall be the first  that shall go into bridewell and taking me  the shoulders he thrust me in  as soon as i was in the porter pointing w his finger directed me to a fair pair of sta on the further side of a large court and  me go up those stairs and go on till i could go  farther  accordingly i went up the stairs the  flight whereof brought me to a fair chap on my left hand which i could look i through the irongrates but could not h gone into if i would  courtroom or place of judicature ter i had stood a while there and taken a ew of it observing a door on the further e i went to it and opened it with inten to go in but i quickly drew back being ost affrighted at the dismalness of the place r besides that the walls quite round were laid over from top to bottom in black there d in the middle of it a great whippingpost ich was all the furniture it had  in one of these two rooms judgment was en and in the other it was executed on se ill people who for their lewdness were t to this prison and there sentenced to be hipd which was so contrived that the urt might not only hear but see if they ased their sentence executed  a sight so unexpected and withal so unpleas gave me no encouragement either to rest ndeed to enter at all there till looking eartly i spied on the opposite side a door ich giving me hopes of a further progress i entured to step hastily to it and opened it  this let me into one of the fairest rooms t so far as i remember i was ever in and  wonder for though it was now put to this an use it had for many ages past been  royal seat or palace of the kings of engd until cardinal woolsey built whitehall peace offering to king henry the eighth who until that time had ke his court in this house and had this as t people in the house reported for his dini room by which name it then went  this room in length for i lived long enough in it to have time to measure it  threescore foot and had breadth proportiable to it in it on the frontside were v large baywindows in which stood a la table it had other very large tables  with benches round and at that time the f was covered with rushes against some so festival which i heard it was bespoken  here was my nil ultra and here i fou might set up my pillar for although there  a door out of it to a backpair of stairs w led to it yet that was kept locked so  finding i had now followed my keepers rection to the utmost point beyond whi could not go i sat down and considered  rhetorical saying that the way to heaven by the gate of hell the black room thr which i passed into this bearing some reblance to the latter as this comparatively  by way of allusion might in some sor thought to bear to the former  but i was quickly put out of these thou by the flocking in of the other friends  fellow prisoners amongst whom yet  all were come together there was but  whom i knew so much as by face and  him i had no acquaintance for i having   oon after we were all gotten together came  the master of the house after us and deded our names which we might reason have refused to give till we had been lly convened before some civil magistrate  had power to examine us and demand  names but we who were neither guil nor wilful simply gave him our names ch he took down in writing   was as i hinted before a general storm ch fell that day but it lighted most and t heavy upon our meetings so that most ur menfriends were made prisoners and  prisons generally filled and great work  the women to run about from prison to on to find their husbands their fathers r brothers or their servants for accordy as they had disposed themselves to several etings so were they dispersed to several ons and no less care and pains had they n they had found them to furnish them  provisions and other necessary accomlations  but an excellent order even in those early ys was practiced among the friends of that y by which there were certain friends of er sex appointed to have the oversight of  prisons in every quarter and to take care ll friends the poor especially that should  committed thither  bridewell was under the c of two honest grave discreet and mothe women whose names were anne mer afterward vivers and anne travers b widows  they so soon as they understood that t were friends brought into that prison vided some hot victuals meat and broth  the weather was cold and ordering their vants to bring it them with bread cheese  beer came themselves also with it and ha placed it on a table gave notice to us t was provided for all those that had not other provide for them or were not able to prov themselves and there wanted not among  competent number of such guests  as for my part though i had lived as gally as possibly i could that i might draw the thread of my little stock to the ut length yet had i by this time reduced  ten pence which was all the money i h bout me or any where else at my comman  this was but a small estate to enter  an imprisonment with yet was i not  discouraged at it nor had i a murm thought i had known what it was rately to abound and if i should now  to suffer want i knew i ought to be co and through the grace of god i was s had lived by providence before when  long time i had no money at all and  always found the lord a good provide made no doubt therefore that he who se elijah and who clothes the lil would find some means to sustain me th needful food and raiment and i had rnd by experience the truth of that sayg natura paucis contenta i e nature is cont with few things or a little  although the sight and smell of hot food s sufficiently enticing to my empty stomach r i had eaten little that morning and was gry yet considering the terms of the ination i questioned whether i was included t and after some reasonings at length coned that while i had ten pence in my cket i should be but an injurious intruder to t mess which was provided for such as haps had not two pence in theirs  being come to this resolution i withdrew  far from the table as i could and sat wn in a quiet retirement of mind till the past was over which was not long for re were hands enough at it to make light rk of it  when evening came the porter came up  backstairs and opening the door told us  we desired to have any thing that was to be had  the house he would bring it us for there was  the house a chandler sshop at which beer ead butter cheese eggs and bacon might be d for money upon which many went to  and spoke for what of these things they d a mind to giving him money to pay for em  ten pence as far as i could desired him to bring me a penny loaf only when he returned we all resorted to him  receive our several provisions which he devered and when he came to me he told m he could not get a penny loaf but he had broug me two halfpenny loaves  this suited me better wherefore returni to my place again i sat down and eat  one of my loaves reserving the other for  next day  this was to me both dinner and suppe and so well satisfied i was with it that i  willingly then have gone to bed if i had h one to go to but that was not to be expect there nor had any one any bedding broug in that night  some of the company had been so considerate as to send for a pound of candles the we might not sit all night in the dark and hving lighted diverse of them and placed the in several parts of that large room we kep walking to keep us warm  after i had warmed my self pretty througly and the evening was pretty sar spent  bethought my self of a lodging and castin mine eye on the table which stood in t baywindow the frame whereof looked  thought somewhat like a beadstead when fore willing to make sure of that i gathered  a good armful of the rushes wherewith t floor was covered and spreading them und  my example was followed by the rest who thering up rushes as i had done made emselves beds in other parts of the room d so to rest we went  i having a quiet easy mind was soon a ep and slept till about the middle of the ght and then waking finding my legs d feet very cold i crept out of my cabin d began to walk about apace  this waked and raised all the rest who findg themselves cold as well as i got up and lked about with me till we had pretty well rmed our selves and then we all lay down ain and rested till morning  next day all they who had families or begd to families had bedding brought in of e sort or other which they disposed at the ds and sides of the room leaving the mid void to walk in  but i who had no body to look after me t to my rushypallet under the table for r nights together in which time i did not t off my cloths yet through the merciful odness of god unto me i rested and slept ll and enjoyed health without taking ld  in this time diverse of our company through e solicitations of some of their relations or quaintance to sir richard brown who was misrule in the city and over bridewell more especially were released and among these one william mucklow who lay in an hammack he having observed that i only was unprovided of lodging came very courteously to me and kindly offered me the use of his hammack while i should continue a prisoner  this was a providential accommodation  me which i received thankfully both from the lord and from him and from thenc forth i thought i lay as well as ever i had do in my life  amongst those that remained there were several young men who cast themselves into  club and laying down every one an equ proportion of money put it into the hand  our friend anne travers desiring her to lay  out for them in provisions and send them in very day a mess of hot meat and they kinly invited me to come into their club wi them these saw my person and judged  me by that but they saw not my purse n understood the lightness of my pocket b i who alone understood my own condition knew i must sit down with lower common wherefore not giving them the true reason i as fairly as i could excused my self from etring at present into their mess and we on as before to eat by my self and that ve sparingly as my stock would bear a before my ten pence was quite spent provdence  for william penington a brother of isaac penngtons a friend and merchant in london at whose house before i came to live in the ciy i was wont to lodge having been at his brothers that day upon a visit escaped this storm and so was at liberty and undertanding when he came back what had been one bethought himself of me and upon enuiry hearing where i was came in love to ee me  he in discourse amongst other things asked me how it was with me as to money and how well i was furnished i told him i could not boast of much and yet i could not say i had none though what i then had was indeed next to none whereupon he put twenty shillings into my hand and desired me to accept of that for the present i saw a divine hand in thus opening his heart and hand in this manner to me and though i would willingly have been excused from taking so much and would have returned one half of it yet he pressing it all upon me i received it with a thankful acknowledgment as a token of love from the lord and from him  on the seventh day he went down again as he usually did to his brothers house at chalfont and in discourse gave them an account of my imprisonment whereupon at his return on the second day of the week following my affectionate friend mary penington sent me forty shillings which he soon after brought me out of which i would have repaid him the twenty shillings he had so kindly furnished me with but he would not admit it telling me i might have occasion for that and more before i got my liberty  not many days after this i received twenty shillings from my father who being then at his house in oxfordshire and by letter from my sister understanding that i was a prisoner in bridewell sent this money to me for my support there and withal a letter to my sister for her to deliver to one called mr w who lived near bridewell and was a servant to sir richard brown in some wharf of his requesting him to interceed with his master who was one of the governors of bridewell for my deliverance but that letter coming to my hands i suppressed it and have it y by me  now was my pocket from the lowest ebb risen to a full tide i was at the brink o want next door to nothing yet my confidence did not fail nor my faith stagger an now on a sudden i had plentiful supplies shower upon shower so that i abounded yet wa not lifted up but in humility could say thi is the lords doing and without defrauding any of the instruments of the acknowledgments due unto them mine eye looked over and beyond them to the lord who  saw was the author thereof and prime agen therein and with a thankful heart i returned  now i durst venture my self into the club  which i had been invited and accordingly aving by this time gained an acquaintance with them took an opportunity to cast my self among them and thenceforward so long as we continued prisoners there together i was e of their mess  and now the chief thing i wanted was imloyment which scarce any wanted but my elf for the rest of my company were geneally tradesmen of such trades as could set themselves on work of these diverse were tailors some masters some journeymen and with these i most inclined to settle but because i was too much a novice in their art to e trusted with their work lest i should spoil he garment i got work from an hosier in cheap side which was to make nightwaist coats of red and yellow flannel for women and children and with this i entered my self among he tailors sitting crosslegd as they did and o spent those leisurehours with innocence and pleasure which want of business would have made tedious and indeed that was in a manner the only advantage i had by it for my master though a very wealthy man and because as he smilingly said he would not let me so far into his trade as to acquaint me with the prises of the work but would be sure to give me enough and thereupon he gave me one crown piece and no more though i had wrought long for him and made him many dozens of wastcoats and bought the thread my self which i thought was very poor pay but as providence had ordered it i wanted the work more than the wages and therefore took what he gave me without complaining  about this time while we were prisoners in our fair chamber a friend was brought and put in among us who had been sent thither by richard brown to beat hemp whose case was thus  he was a very poor man who lived by mending shoos and on a seventh day night late a carman or some other such laboring man brought him a pair of shoos to mend desiring him to mend them that night that he might have them in the morning for he had no other to wear the poor man sat up at work upon them till after midnight and then finding he could not finish them he went  accordingly he got up betimes and though e wrought as privately as he could in his chamber that he might avoid giving offense o any yet could he not do it so privately but that an illnatured neighbor perceived it who went and informed against him for working on the sunday whereupon he was had before richard brown who committed him to brideell for a certain time to be kept to hard labor in beating hemp which is labor hard enough  it so fell out that at the same time were committed thither for what cause i do not now remember two lusty young men who were called baptists to be kept also at the same labor  the friend was a poor little man of a low condition and mean appearance whereas hese two baptists were topping blades that ooked high and spoke big they scorned to eat hemp and made a pish at the whippingpost but when they had once felt the smart of it they soon cried peccavi and submitting to the punishment set their tender hands to the beetles  the friend on the other hand acting upon a principle as knowing he had done no evil for which he should undergo that punishment refused to work and for refusing was cruelly whipped which he bore with wonderful constancy and resolution of mind    with these rods they tormented the friend most barbarously and the more for that having mastered the two braving baptists they disdained to be mastered by this poor quaker yet were they fain at last to yield when they saw their utmost severity could not make him yield and then not willing to be troubled longer with him they turned him up among us  when we had enquired of him how it was with him and he had given us a brief account of both his cause and usage it came in my mind that i had in my box which i had sent for from my lodging to keep some few books and other necessaries in a little gallypot with lucatellus balsam in it  wherefore causing a good fire to be made and setting the friend within a blanket before the fire we stripped him to the waste as  he had been too be whipped again and foun his skin so cut and torn with the knott hollyrods both back side arm and breast that it was a dismal sight to look upon the melting some of the balsam i with a feathe anointed all the sores and putting a softe  but we were still continued prisoners by an bitrary power not being committed by the vil authority nor having seen the face of y civil magistrate from the day we were ust in here by soldiers which was the   th ay of the eighth month to the   th of the nth month following  on that day we were had to the sessions at e old baily but not being called there we ere brought back to bridewell and continued ere to the   th of the same month and then e were carried to the sessions again  i expected i should have been called the first cause my name was first taken down but  proved otherwise so that i was one of the t that was called which gave me the adntage of hearing the pleas of the other risoners and discovering the temper of the ourt  the prisoners complained of the illegality of eir imprisonment and desired to know what y had lain so long in prison for the court garded nothing of that and did not stick to recorder to them if you think you have been wrongfully impris you have your remedy at law and may take  if you think it worth your while the court sa he may send for any man out of the street a tender him the oath so we take no notice  you came hither but finding you here we te you the oath of allegiance which if you ref to take we shall commit you and at length pmunire you accordingly as every one refu it he was set aside and another called  by this i saw it was in vain for me to  upon false imprisonment or ask the cause  my commitment though i had before nished my self with some authorities and mims of law on that subject to have plead if room had been given and i had the b out of which i took them in my bosom  the weather being cold i wore a gown g about the middle and had put the book wi in it but i now resolved to wave all the and insist upon another plea which just the came into my mind  as soon therefore as i was called i ste nimbly to the bar and stood up upon the stping that i might the better both hear and  heard and laying my hands upon the b stood ready expecting what they would  to me  i suppose they took me for a confident you man for they looked very earnestly upon  and we faced each other without words  a while at length the recorder who was d john howel asked me if i would take e oath of allegiance  to which i answered i conceive this court ath not power to tender that oath to me in e condition wherein i stand  this so unexpected plea seemed to startle em so that they looked one upon another d said somewhat low one to another what h he demur to the jurisdiction of the court and thereupon the recorder asked me do you  demur to the jurisdiction of the court not bsolutely answered i but conditionally th respect to my present condition and the ircumstances i am now under  why what is your present condition said the corder a prisoner replied i and what is t said he to your taking or not taking the th enough said i as i conceive to exempt e from the tender thereof while i am unr this condition pray what is your reason  that said he this said i that if i htly understand the words of the statute i  required to say that i do take this oath free and without constraint which i cannot say cause i am not a free man but in bonds and der constraint wherefore i conceive that  you would tender that oath to me ye ought t to set me free from my present imprisonent  but said the recorder will you take the oath  you be set free thou shall see that said i en i am set free therefore set me free first d then ask the question  but said he again you know your own msure and can tell now what you would do if you we at liberty yes replied i that i can but  dont hold my self obliged to tell it until i at at liberty therefore set me at liberty a ye shall soon hear it  thus we fenced a good while till i was bo weary of such trifling and doubted also  some of the standers by should suspect i wo take it if i was set at liberty wherei when the recorder put it upon me again  him plainly no though i thought they ou not to tender it me till i had been set at berty yet if i was set at liberty i could  take that nor any other oath because  lord and master christ jesus had presly commanded his disciples not to s at all  as his command was enough to me so confession of mine was enough to them t him away said they and away i was tak and thrust into the baildock to my oth friends who had been called before me a as soon as the rest of our company were call and had refused to swear we were all committed to newgate and thrust into the common side  when we came there we found that side  the prison very full of friends who were psoners there before as indeed were at that ti all the other parts of that prison and most of t other prisons about the town and our addion caused a great throng on that side nowithstanding  we had the liberty of the hall which is on e first story over the gate and which in the y time is common to all the prisoners on that de felons as well as others to walk in and  beg out of and we had also the liberty of e other rooms over that hall to walk or rk in a days but in the night we all dged in one room which was large and and having in the middle of it a great pillar f oaken timber which bore up the chap that is over it  to this pillar we fastened our hammacks at  one end and to the opposite wall on the over end quite round the room and in three grees or three stories high one over the or so that they who lay in the upper and ddle row of hammacks were obliged to  to bed first because they were to climb up  the higher by getting into the lower and er the lower rank of hammacks by the llsides were laid beds upon the floor in ich the sick and such weak persons as could t get into the hammacks lay and indeed ough the room was large and pretty airy t the breath and steam that came from so any bodies of different ages conditions d constitutions packt up so close together s enough to cause sickness amongst us and  this caused some bustle in the house for the body of the deceased being laid out and put into a coffin was carried down and set in the room called the lodge that the coroner might enquire into the cause and manner of his death and the manner of their doing it is thus as soon as the coroner is come the turnkeys run out into the street under the gate and seize upon every man that passes by till they have got enough to make up the coroners inquest and so resolute these rude fellows are that if any man resist or dispute it with them they drag him in by main force not regarding what condition he is of nay i have been told the will not stick to stop a coach and pluck the men out of it  it so happened that at this time they lighted on an ancient man a grave citizen who was trudging through the gate in great haste and him they laid hold on telling him he must come in and serve upon the coroners inquest he pleaded hard begged and besought them to let him go assuring them he was going on very urgent business and that the stopping him would be greatly to his prejudice but they were deaf to all entreaties and hurried him in the poor man chaffing without remedy  when they had got their complement and were shut in together the rest of them said to come father you are the oldest man among us you shall be our foreman and when the coroner had sworn them on the jury the coffin was uncovered that they mightook upon the body but the old man disturbed in his mind at the interruption they had given him was grown somewhat fretful upon it said to them to what purpose do you show us a dead body here you would not have us think sure that this man died in this room how then shall we be able to judge how this man came by his death unless we see the place wherein he died and wherein he has been kept prisoner before he died how know we but that the incommodiousness of the place wherein he was kept may have occasioned his death therefore show us said he the place wherein this man died  this much displeased the keepers and they began to banter the old man thinking to have beaten him off it but he stood up titely to them come come said he though you have made a fool of me in bringing me in hither ye shall not find a child of me now i am here mistake not your selves i understand my place and your duty and i require you to conduct me and my brethren to the place where this man died refuse it at your peril  they now wished they had let the old man go about his business rather than by troubling him have brought this trouble on themselves but when they saw he persisted in his resolution and was peremptory the coroner told them they must go show him the place  turnkeys opening our door said hold hold dont undress your selves here is the coroners inquest coming to see you  as soon as they were come to the door for within the door there was scarce room for them to come the foreman who led them lifting up his hand said lord bless me what a sight is here i did not think there had been so much cruelty in the hearts of englishmen to use englishmen in this manner we need not now question said he to the rest of the jury how this man came by his death we may rather wonder that they are not all dead for this place is enough to breed an infection among them well added he if it please god to lengthen my life till to morrow i will find means to let the king know how his subjects are dealt with  whether he did so or no i cannot tell but i am apt to think that he applied himself to the mayor or the sheriffs of london for the next day one of the sheriffs called sir william turner a wollendraper in paulsyard came to the pressyard and having ordered the porter of bridewell to attend him there sent up a turnkey amongst us to bid all the bridewell prisoners come down to him for they knew us not but we knew our own company  being come before him in the pressyard he looked kindly on us and spoke courteously to us gentlemen said he i understand the prison is very full and i am sorry for it i wish it were in my power to release you and the rest of your friends that are in it but since i cannot do that i am willing to do what i can for you and therefore i am come hither to enquire how it is and i would have all you who came from bridewell return thither again which will be a better accommodation to you and your removal will give the more room to those that are left behind and here is the porter of bridewell your old keeper to attend you thither  we duly acknowledged the favor of the sheriff to us and our friends above in this removal of us which would give them more room and us a better air but before we parted from him i spoke particularly to him on another occasion which was this  when we came into newgate we found a shabby fellow there among the friends who upon inquiry we understood had thrust himself among our friends when they were taken at a meeting on purpose to be sent to prison with them in hopes to be maintained by them they knew nothing of him till they found him shut in with them in the prison and then took no notice of him as not knowing how or why he came thither but he soon gave  thus lived this lazy drone upon the labors of the industrious bees to his high content and their no small trouble to whom his company was as offensive as his ravening was oppressive nor could they get any relief by their complaining of him to the keepers  this fellow hearing the notice which was given for the bridewellmen to go down in order to be removed to bridewell again and hoping no doubt that fresh quarters would produce fresh commons and that he should fare better with us than where he was thrust himself amongst us and went down into the press yard with us which i knew not of till i saw him standing there with his hat on and looking as demurely as he could that the sheriff might take him for a quaker at sight of which my spirit was much stirred  wherefore as soon as the sheriff had done speaking to us and we had made our acknowledgment of his kindness i stepped a little nearer to him and pointing to that fellow said that man is not only none of our company for he is no quaker but is an idle dissolute fellow who has thrust himself in among our friends to be sent to prison with them that he might bridewell  at this the sheriff smiled and calling the fellow forth said to him how came you to be in prison i was taken at a meeting said he but what business had you there said the sheriff i went to hear said he aye you went upon a rse design it seems replied the sheriff but i disappoint you said he for i will change your company and send you to them that are like your self then calling for the turnkey he said take this fellow and put him among the felons and be sure let him not trouble the quakers any more  hitherto this fellow had stood with his hat on as willing to have passed if he could for a quaker but as soon as he heard this doom passed on him off went his hat and to bowing and scraping he fell with good your worship have pity upon me and set me at liberty no no said the sheriff i will not so far disappoint you since you had a mind to be in prison in prison you shall be for me then bidding the turnkey take him away he had him up and put him among the felons and so friends had a good deliverance from him  the sheriff then bidding us farewell the porter of bridewell came to us and told us we know our way to bridewell without him and he could trust us therefore he would not stay nor go with us but left us to take our own time so we were in before bedtime  then went we up again to our friends in newgate and gave them an account of what newgate i think it no amiss to give the reader some little accoun of what i observed while i was there  the common side of newgate is generally accounted as it really is the worst part of that prison not so much from the place as the people it being usually stocked with the veriest rogues and meanest sort of felons and pickpockets who not being able to pay chamberrent on the masters side are thrust in there and if they come in bad to be sure they do not go out better for here they have an opportunity to instruct one another in their art and impart each to other what improvements they have made therein  the common hall which is the first room over the gate is a good place to walk in when the prisoners are out of it saving the danger of catching some cattle which they may have left in it and there i used to walk in a morning before they were let up and sometimes in the day time when they have been there  they all carried themselves respectfully toward me which i imputed chiefly to this that when any of our womenfriends came there to visit the prisoners if they had not relations of their own there to take care of them i as being a young man and more at leisure than most others for i could not play the tailor there was forward to go down with them to  one day as i was thus walking to and fro beside them i heard them recounting one to another what feats they had done at pocketpicking and shoplifting whereupon turning short upon them i asked them which of you all will undertake to pick my pocket they were not very forward to answer but viewed me round i wore a long gown which was lapt over before and tied about the middle and had no pocketholes in it when they had a while considered it and i having taken another turn was come up again to them one of them said why master if you will promise not to prosecute us we will show you a piece of our skill nay hold there said i i won so far encourage you in evil as to promise no to prosecute and away i turned again having mine eye on my book but mine ear to them and in a while i heard them contriving how they would have done it i said one of them would give him the budge and before he can recover himself you said he to another of them having your penknife ready should  his gown and then said he let honeypot alone for the diving part this honeypot was a little boy then in prison with them for picking a pocket who by his stature did not seem to be above ten or a dozen years old but for his dexterity at pocketpicking was held to be one of the top of the trade as for the budg i had had it given me often in the street but understood not the meaning of it till now and now i found it was a jostle enough to throw one almost upon his nose  i have sometimes occasionally been in the hall in an evening and have seen the whores let in unto them which i take to be a common practice nasty sluts indeed they were and in that respect the more suitable and as i have passed by them i have heard the rogues and they making their bargains which and which of them should company together that night which abominable wickedness must be imputed to the dishonesty of the turnkeys who for vile gain to themselves not only suffer but further this leudness  newgate in measure a type of hell upon earth but there was at that time something of another nature more particular and accidental which was very offensive to me  when we came first into newgate there lay in a little byplace like a closet near the room where we were lodged the quartered bodies of three men who had been executed some days before for a real or pretended plot which was the ground or at least pretext for that storm in the city which had caused this imprisonment the names of these three men were philips tongue and gibs and the reason why their quarters lay so long there was the relations were all that while petitioning to have leave to bury them which at length with much ado was obtained for the quarters but not for the heads which were ordered to be set up in some parts of the city  i saw the heads when they were brought p to be boiled the hangman fetched them n a dirty dust basket out of some byplace and setting them down amongst the felons he and they made sport with them they took them by the hair flouting jeering and laughng at them and then giving them some ill names boxd them on the ears and cheeks which done the hangman put them into his kettle and parboyld them with bay salt and cumminseed that to keep them from putrefaction and this to keep off the fowls from bridewell even in that respect the more welcome whither we now go  for having as i hinted before made up our packs and taken our leave of our friends whom we were to leave behind we took our bundles on our shoulders and walked two and two a breast through the old baily into fleet street and so to old bridewell and it being about the middle of the afternoon and the streets pretty full of people both the shopkeepers at their doors and passengers in the way would stop us and ask us what we were and whither we were going and when we had told them we were prisoners going from one prison to another from newgate to bridewell what said they without a keeper no said we for our word which we have given is our keeper some thereupon would advis us not to go to prison but to go home bu we told them we could not do so we could suffer for our testimony but could not fl from it i do not remember we had any abus offered us but were generally pitied by the people  when we were come to bridewell we were not put up into the great room in which we ha paroll upon us so that both conscience d honor stood now engaged for our true prisonment  adjoining to this room wherein we were as such another both newly fitted up for orkhouses and accordingly furnished with ry great blocks for beating hemp upon d a lusty whippingpost there was in each d it was said that richard brown had orred those blocks to be provided for the quas to work on resolving to try his strength ith us in that case but if that was his purse it was overruled for we never had any work offered us nor were we treated after the manner of those that are to be so used yet we set our selves to work on them for being ery large they served the tailors for shopards and others wrought upon them as ey had occasion and they served us very well for tables to eat on  we had also besides this room the use of ur former chamber above to go into when we thought fit and thither sometimes i withdrew lord to me in his gracious and tender dealings with me did deeply affect my heart and caused me to break forth in a song of thanksgiving and praise to him and on the other hand a sense of the prophaneness debaucheries cruelties and other horr impieties of the age fell heavy on me and lay as a pressing weight upon my spirit and this drew from me a close expbration which my mournful muse vented i the following lines to which i gave for a title  speculum seculi or a lookingglass for the times which began with this expostulatory preface  why should my modest muse forbidden be to speak of that which but too many see y should she by conniving seem to uphold s wickedness and thereby make them bold l to persist in it why should she be shy call them beasts who want humanity y should she any longer silence keep d lie secure as one that is fast asleep  how indeed can it expected be t she should hold her tongue and daily see se wicked and enormous crimes committed ich she in modesty has pretermitted which but to name would with their filth defile chaste ears and cast a blemish on her style yet of so many she cannot forbear to mention some which here detected are loud were the cries which long h pierced mine ear foul the reports which i did daily hear unheard of newinvented crimes were brough by fame unto my knowledge which i thoug too foul and loathsome to have found a place in any heart though never so void of grace this made me take a more observant view whether report spoke what of men is true but as the celebrated southern queen when she the court of solomon had seen and had with more than usual diligence observed his splendour and magnificence considered well his pomp his port his state the great retinue that on him did wait as one with admiration filled no doubt not able longer to contain burst out into such words as these thrice happy kin whose fame throughout the universe does ri ough of thine acts i thought report too bold t now i see one half has not been told st so did i though in another kind ter i had intently fixed my mind on mens actions and had duly weighed ot only what they did but what they said while i stood like one that is struck with thunder ld with astonishment and silent wonder t length my heart swelling with indignation ented it self in such an exclamation  o hellish doings o infernal crew f whom who says the worst he can says true  herd of lustful satyrs

what precedes was written i have found an accusation formed but without ground against me that with uncontrouled pen i too severely lash the faults of men and take upon me in satyrick rhimes to pass a rigid censure on the times this drew me on to add another line to show them that the faults their own not mine no crime can justly to my charge be laid unless it be a crime that truth be said nor can without injustice any blame my muse for echoing the common fame if any should object that wise men hold that truth at all times ought not to be told whatever comes into ones head should straight because it is true be published i readily assent because i know pearls before swine we are forbid to through some truths i grant may better be concealed than if they out of season were revealed yet would i not that any through mistake should of my words a misconstruction make than that should happen i had rather be taxt by the reader for prolixity thus then in brief would i be understood if what i know concerns my brothers good for him to know ought i not then unfold it to him rather than from him withold a benefit so on the other side it is i think too plain to be denied that if i see what certainly does tend to the hurt of my neighbor or my friend i am obliged by christian charity to give them warning of the danger nigh to show them that they stand upon the brink of certain ruin and if then they sink  from guilt their blood on their own heads will be it is plain i think yet if ye cannot believe it without a scripture proof lo here levit       ezekiel    i give it this is the very case which if well weighed will fully justify what i have said i saw men running to a precipice at foot of which was such a vast abyss as could have swallowed nations so immense that twas impossible to climb out thence for if a man we see but chance to pitch over head and ears into some miry ditch how quickly is he smothered unless some friendly hand assist in that distress and if with struggling out at length he get yet how besmeared is he with dirt and wet but into this deep pit who falls in vain expects an hand to help him out again no it is of grace that men forewarned are and ever their

choice alone ensnared again to be bridewell london      in this sort did i spend some leisure ho during my confinement in bridewell especi after our return from newgate thither w we had more liberty and more opportu and room for retirement and thought as the poet said carmina scribentes secessum and otia quaer they who would write in mea retire where they may stilness have and    this he observed and asked me when i eant to ask to go out i told him i had not uch occasion nor desire yet at sometime or ther perhaps i might have but when i had  would ask him but once and if he then deed me i would ask him no more  after we were come back from newgate i ad a desire to go thither again to visit my riends who were prisoners there more espeially my dear friend and father in christ dward borough who was then a prisoner ith many friends more in that part of newate which was then called justicehall whereupon the porter coming in my way i sked him to let me go out for an hour or two o see some friends of mine that evening  he to enhanse the kindness made it a matter f some difficulty and would have me stay ll another night i told him i would be at  word with him for as i had told him before that if he denied me i would ask him no ore so he should find i would keep to it  yes said he very willing and thereupon away walked i to newgate where having spent the evening among friends i returned in good time  under this easy restraint we lay till the court sat at the old bailey again and then whether it was that the heat of the storm was somewhat abated or by what other means providence wrought it i know not we were called to the bar and without further question discharged  whereupon we returned to bridewell again and having raised some moneys among us and therewith gratified both the master and his porter for their kindness to us we spent sometime in a solemn meeting to return our thankful acknowledgement to the lord both for his preservation of us in prison and deliverance of us out of it and then taking a solemn farewell of each other we departed with bag and baggage and i took care to return my hammack to the owner with due acknowledgement of his great kindness in lending it me  being now at liberty i visited more generally my friends that were still in prison and more particularly my friend and benefactor william penington at his house and then went to wait upon my master milton with whom buckinghamshire to visit my worthy friends isaac penington and his virtuous wife with other friends in that country  thither therefore i betook my self and the weather being frosty and the ways by that means clean and good i walked it through in a day and was received by my friends there with such demonstration of hearty kindness as made my journey very easy to me  i had spent in my imprisonment that twenty shillings which i had received of william penington and twenty of the forty which had been sent me from mary penington and had the remainder then about me that therefore i now returned to her with due acknowledgement of her husbands and her great care of me and liberality to me in the time of my need she would have had me kept it but i begged her to accept it from me again since it was the redundancy of their kindness and the other part had answered the occasion for which it was sent and my importunity prevailed  i intended only a visit hither not a continuance and therefore purposed after i had staid a few days to return to my lodging and former course in london but providence ordered it otherwise  isaac penington had at that time two sons and one daughter all then very young of whom the eldest son john penington and the mary the wife of daniel wharley are yet living at the writing of this and being himself both skilful and curious in pronounciation he was very desirous to have them well grounded in the rudiments of the english tongue to which end he had sent for a man out of lancashire whom upon enquiry he had heard of who was undoubtedly the most accurate english teacher that ever i met with or have heard of his name was richard bradley but as he pretended no higher than the english tongue and had led them by grammar rules to the highest improvement they were capable of in that he had then taken his leave of them and was gone up to london to teach an english school of friends children there  this put my friend to a fresh straight he had sought for a new teacher to instruct his children in the latin tongue as the old had done in the english but had not yet found one wherefore one evening as we sat together by the fire in his bedchamber which for want of health he kept he asked me his wife being by if i would be so kind to him as to stay a while with him till he could hear of such a man as he aimed at and in the mean time enter his children in the rudiments of the latin tongue  this question was not more unexpected than surprising to me and the more because it seemed directly to thwart my former purpose and undertaking of endeavoring to improve my self by following my studies with my master milton which this would give at  but the sense i had of the manifold obligations i lay under to these worthy friends of mine shut out all reasonings and disposed my mind to an absolute resignation to their desire that i might testify my gratitude by a willingness to do them any friendly service that i could be capable of  and though i questioned my ability to carry on that work to its due height and proportion yet as that was not proposed but an initiation only by accidence into grammar i consented to the proposal as a present expedient till a more qualified person should be found without further treaty or mention of terms between us than that of mutual friendship and to render this digression from my own studies the less uneasy to my mind i recollected and often thought of that rule in lilly qui docet indoctos licet indoctissimus esset ipse brevi reliquis doctior esse queat he that the unlearned does teach may quickly be more learned than they though most unlearned he   with this consideration i undertook this province and left it not until i married which was not till the year      near seven  but alas not many days not to say weeks had i been there ere we were almost overwhelmed with sorrow for the unexpected loss of edward borough who was justly very dear to us all  this not only good but greatgood man by a long and close confinement in newgate through the cruel malice and malicious cruelty of richard brown was taken away by hasty death to the unutterable grief of very many and unspeakable loss to the church of christ in general  the particular obligation i had to him as the immediate instrument of my convincement and high affection for him resulting therefrom did so deeply affect my mind that it was some pretty time before my passion could prevail to express it self in words so true i found that of the tragoedian curae leves loqunntur ingentes stupent  great ones are through amazement closely pent   at length my muse not bearing to be any longer mute brake forth in the following acrostick which she called  a pathetick elegy on the death of that dear and faithful servant of god edward borough who died the    th of the    th month      and thus she introduces it  how long shall grief lie smothered ah how long shall sorrows signet seal my silent tongue how long shall sighs me suffocate and make my lips to quiver and my heart to ache how long shall i with pain suppress my cries and seek for holes to wipe my watery eyes why may not i by sorrow thus oppressed pour forth my grief into anothers breast  that ille dolet vere qui sine test dolet he mourns truly who does mourn alone then may i truly say my grief is true since it has yet been known to very few nor is it now mine aim to make it known to those to whom these verses may be shown but to assuage my sorrowswollen heart which silence caused to taste so deep of smart this is

to gods pure will latin tongue to the mutual tisfaction of both their parents and my self as n as i had gotten a little money in my poct which as a premium without compact i eived from them i took the first opportuy to return to my friend william penington  money which he had so kindly furnished  with in my need at the time of my imprisonment bridewell with a due acknowledgement of my obligation to him for it he was not at all forward to receive it so that i was fain to press it upon him  while thus i remained in this family various suspicions arose in the minds of some concerning me with respect to mary peningtons fair daughter guli for she having now arrived to a marriageable age and being in all respects a very desirable woman whether regard was had to her outward person which wanted nothing to render her completely comely or to the endowments of her mind which were every way extraordinary and highly obliging or to her outward fortune which was fair and which with some has not the last nor the least place in consideration she was openly and secretly sought and solicite by many and some of them almost of ever rank and condition good and bad ric and poor friend and foe to whom in the respective turns till he at length came  whom she was reserved she carried her se with so much evenness of temper such couteous freedom guarded with the strictest modesty that as it gave encouragement  ground of hopes to none so neither did it aminister any matter of offense or just cau of complaint to any  but such as were thus either engaged  themselves or desirous to make themselves advocates for others could not i observed  look upon me with an eye of jealousy a  according therefore to the several kinds and degrees of their fears of me they suggested  her parents their ill surmises against me  some stuck not to question the sincerity of y intentions in coming at first among the uakers urging with a why may it not be so that the desire and hopes of obtaining by that eans so fair a fortune might be the prime and ief inducement to me to thrust my self amongst at people but this surmise could find no ace with those worthy friends of mine her ther in law and her mother who besides e clear sense and sound judgment they had  themselves knew very well upon what erms i came among them how straight and rd the passage was to me how contrary to  worldly interest which lay fair another ay how much i had suffered from my faer for it and how regardless i had been of tempting or seeking any thing of that nare in these three or four years that i had en amongst them  some others measuring me by the propeny of their own inclinations concluded i uld steal her run away with her and marher which they thought i might be the re easily induced to do from the advantaus opportunities i frequently had of riding  i was not ignorant of the various fears which filled the jealous heads of some concerning me neither was i so stupid nor so divested of all humanity as not to be sensible of the real and innate worth and virtue which adorned that excellent dame and attracted the eye and hearts of so many with the greatest importunity to seek and solicit her nor was i  devoid of natural heat as not to feel some sparklings of desire as well as others but the force of truth and sense of honor suprest whatever would have risen beyond the bounds of fair and virtuous friendship for easily foresaw that if i should have attempte any thing in a dishonorable way by for or fraud upon her i should have thereb bought a wound upon mine own soul a for scandal upon my religious profession and  infamous stain upon mine honor either  which was far more dear unto me than my li wherefore having observed how some other foelix quem faciunt aliena pericular cautum  happys he whom others dangers wary make to be   i governed my self in a free yet respectul carriage toward her that i thereby both reserved a fair reputation with my friends and enjoyed as much of her favor and kindess in a virtuous and firm friendship as was fit for her to show or for me to seek  thus leading a quiet and contented life i ad leisure sometimes to write a copy of vers on one occasion or another as the poetic vein naturally opened without taking pains to olish them such was this which follows ccasioned by the sudden death of some lusty people in their full strength  est vita caduca as is the fragrant flower in the field which in the spring a pleasant smell does yield and lovely sight but soon is withered sos man to day alive to morrow dead and as the silverdewbespangled grass which in the morn bedecks its mothers face but ere the scorching summers past looks brown or by the sith is suddenly cut down just such is man who vaunts himself to day decking himself in all his best array but in the midst of all his bravery death rounds him in the ear friend thou must dye or like a shadow in a sunny day which in a moment vanishes away or like a smile or spark such is the span of life allowed this microcosm man  thy brightest glorys as the morning dew which disappears when first the rising sun displays his beams above the horizon as the consideration of the uncertainty of humane life drew the foregoing lines from me so the sense i had of the folly of mankind in misspending the little time allowed them in evil ways and vain sports led me more particularly to trace the several courses wherein the generallity of men run unprofitably at best if not to their hurt and ruin which i introduced with that axiom of the preacher eccles      all is vanity see here the state of man as in a glass and how the fashion of this world does pass  some in a tavern spend the longest day while others hawk and hunt the time away here one his mistress courts another dances a third incites to lust by wanton glances dressing the other seeks to set fresh colors on her withered cheeks that when the sun delines some dapper spark may take her to springgarden or the park plays some frequent and balls others their prime consume at dice some bowl away their time with cards some wholly captivated are from tables others scarce an hour can spare one to soft music mancipates his ear

if their day should never have a night till natures palefaced sergeant them surprise and as the tree then falls just so it lies now look at home thou who these lines do read see which of all these paths thy self do tread and ere it be too late that path forsake which followed will thee miserable make after i had thus enumerated some of the many vanities in which the generality of men misspent their time i sang the following ode in praise of virtue  wealth beauty pleasures honors all adieu i value virtue far far more than you you are all but toys for girls and boys to play withal at best deceitful joys she lives for ever ye are transitory her honor is unstained but your glory  a painted bait hung out for such as sit at follys gate true peace content and joy on her attend you on the contrary your forces bend to blear mens eyes with fopperies which fools embrace but wiser men despise estate and having reserved for his own us such parts of his housholdgoods as he though fit not willing to take upon himself the troble of selling the rest gave them unto me whereupon i went down to crowel and haing before given notice there and thereabou that i intended a public sale of them i so them and thereby put some money into my pocket yet i sold such things only as i judged useful leaving the pictures and armor of which there was some store there unsold  not long after this my father sent for me to come to him at london about some business which when i came there i understood was to join with him in the sale of his estate which the purchaser required for his own satisfaction and safety i being then the next heir to it in law and although i might probably have made some advantageous terms for my self by standing off yet when i was satisfied by  quakers by name and more particularly prohibiting our meetings under the sharpest penalties of five ounds for the first offense so called ten pounds r the second and banishment for the third under pain of felony for escaping or returning without license which law was looked upon to have been procured by the bishops in orer to bring us to a conformity to their way of worship i wrote a few lines in way of dialogue etween a bishop and a quaker which i called  conformity pressed and represt b what you are one of them that do deny to yield obedience by conformity q nay we desire conformable to be b but unto what q the image of the son romans       b what is that to us well have conformity unto our form q then we shall never have done  should be to seek a new conformity thus who to day conform to prelacy to morrow may conform to popery but take this for an answer bishop we cannot conform either to them or thee for while to truth your forms are opposite whoever conforms thereto does not aright b well make such knaves as you conform or lie confined in prisons till ye rot and die q well gentle bishop i may live to see for all thy threats a check to cruelty and thee rewarded with thy envious crew according as unto your works is due but in the mean time i for my defense betake me to my fortress patience no sooner was this cruel law made but it was put in execution with great severity the sense whereof working strongly on my spirit made me cry earnestly to the lord that he would arise and set up his righteous judgment in the earth for the deliverance of his people from all their enemies both inward and outward and in these terms i uttered it   thy sword up take cast what would thine forgetful of thee make into the lake awake i pray o mighty jah awake make all the world before thy presence quake not only earth but heaven also shake arise arise o jacobs god arise and hear the cries of every soul which in distress now lies and to thee flies arise i pray o israels hope arise set free thy seed oppressed by enemies why should they over it still tyrannize make speed make speed o israels help make speed in time of need for evil men have wickedly decreed against thy seed make speed i pray o mighty god make speed let all thy lambs from savage wolves be freed that fearless on thy mountain they may feed ride on ride on thou valiant man of might and put to flight belial who do despite to the upright ride on i say thou champion and smitc thine and thy peoples enemies with such might that none may dare against thee or thine to fight although the storm raised by the act for banishment fell with the greatest weight an force upon some other parts as at london hertford etc yet we were not in buckinghamshire wholly exempted therefrom for a part of that shower reached us also  for a friend of amersham whose name was edward perot or parret departing this life and notice being given that his body would be buried there on such a day which was the first day of the fifth month      the friends of the adjacent parts of the country resorted pretty generally to the burial so that there was a fair appearance of friends and neighbors the deceased having been well beloved by both  after we had spent some time together in the house  morgan watkins who at that time happened to be at isaac peningtons being with us the body was taken up and born on friends shoulders along the street in order to be carried to the buryingground which was at the orchard belongng to the deceased which he in his life time ad appointed for that service  it so happened that one ambrose benett a arister at law and a justice of the peace for that county riding through the town that morning in his way to alesbury was by some disposed person or other informed that here was a quaker to be buried there that day and that most of the quakers in the country were come thither to the burial  upon this he set up his horses and staid and when we not knowing any thing of his design against us went innocently forward to erform our christian duty for the interrment f our friend he rushed out of his inn upon s with the constables and a rabble of rude ellows whom he had gathered together and aving his drawn sword in his hand struck ne of the foremost of the bearers with it commanding them to set down the coffin but the friend who was so stricken whose name was thomas dell being more concerned or the safety of the dead body than his own est it should fall from his shoulder and any inecency thereupon follow held the coffin fast which the justice observing and being enraged at his word how unjust soever was not rthwith obeyed set his hand to the coffin d with a forcible thrust threw it off from the earers shoulders so that it fell to the ground  the midst of the street and there we were rced to leave it  justice giving command for the apprehending us the constables with the rabble fell on us and drew some and drove others into the inn giving thereby an opportunity to the rest to walk away  of those that were thus taken i was one and being with many more put into a room under a guard we were kept there till another justice called sir thomas clayton whom justice benett had sent for to join with him in committing us was come and then being called forth severally before them they picked out ten of us and committed us to alesbury goal for what neither we nor they knew for we were not convicted of having either done or said any thing which the law could take hold of for they took us up in the open street the kings highway not doing any unlawful act but peaceably carrying and accompanying the corpse of our deceased friend to bury it which they would not suffer us to do but caused the body to lie in the open street and in the cartway so that all the travelers that passed by whether horsemen coaches carts or wagons were fain to break out of the way to go by it that they might not drive over it until it was almost night and then having caused a grave to be made in the unconsecrated part as it is accounted of that which is called the churchyard they forcibly took the body from the widow whose right and property it was and buried it there  justices had delivered us prisoners to the constable it being then late in the day which was the seventh day of the week he not willing to go so far as alesbury nine long miles with us that night nor to put the town to the charge of keeping us there that night and the first day and night following dismissed us upon our parole to come to him again t a set hour on the second day morning whereupon we all went home to our respective habitations and coming to him punctually according to promise were by him without guard conducted to the prison  the jailer whose name was nathaniel irch had not long before behaved himself very wickedly with great rudeness and cruely to some of our friends of the lower side of he county whom he combining with the clerk of the peace whose name was henry wells had contrived to get into his goal and after they were legally discharged in court etained them in prison using great violence and shutting them up close in the common goal among the felons because they would not give im his unrighteous demand of fees which hey were the more straightned in from his treacherous dealing with them and they aving through suffering maintained their reedom and obtained their liberty we were the more concerned to keep what they ad so hardly gained and therefore resolved ot to make any contract or terms for either chamberrent or fees but to demand a fre prison which we did  when we came in the jailer was ridde out to wait on the judges who came in tha day to begin the assize and his wife wa somewhat at a loss how to deal with us bu being a cunning woman she treated us wit great appearance of courtesy offering us the choice of all her rooms and when we asked upon what terms she still referred us to he husband telling us she did not doubt but tha he would be very reasonable and civil to u thus she endeavored to have drawn us to tak possession of some of lier chambers at a venture and trust to her husbands kind usag but we who at the cost of our friends had  proof of his kindness were too wary to b drawn in by the fair words of a woman an therefore told her we would not settle an where till her husband came home and the would have a free prison wheresoever he put u  accordingly walking all together into the court of the prison in which was a well o very good water and having before hand sen to a friend in the town a widow woman whose name was sarah lambarn to bring u some bread and cheese we sat down upon the ground round about the well and when w had eaten we drank of the water out of the well  our great concern was for our friend isa penington because of the tenderness of h  in this posture the jailer when he came me found us and having before he came to  consulted his wife and by her understood  what terms we stood when he came to  he hid his teeth and putting on a show of indness seemed much troubled that we should  there abroad especially his old friend mr enington and thereupon invited us to come in d take what rooms in his house we pleased e asked upon what terms letting him know ithal that we determined to have a free prison he like the sun and wind in the fable that ove which of them should take from the traler his cloak having like the wind tried gh boisterous violent means to our friends fore but in vain resolved now to imitate e sun and shine as pleasantly as he could up us wherefore he told us we should make  terms our selves and be as free as we desired  we thought fit when we were released to give  any thing he would thank us for it and if  he would demand nothing  upon these terms we went in and disposed r selves some in the dwelling house others  the malthouse where they chose to be  during the assize we were brought before dge morton a sour angry man who very ely reviled us but would not hear either us  they when the assize was ended sent for  to be brought before them at their inn and fied us as i remember six shillings eight pen a piece which we not consenting to pay the committed us to prison again for one mon from that time on the act for banishment  when we had lain there that month i wi another went to the jailer to demand o liberty which he readily granted telling  the door should be opened when we pleased to go  this answer of his i reported to the rest  my friends there and thereupon we raised among us a small sum of money which the put into my hand for the jailer whereup i taking another with me went to the goa with the money in my hand and remindi him of the terms upon which we accepted t use of his rooms i told him that althou we could not pay chamberrent or fees yet asmuch as he had now been civil to us  were willing to acknowledge it by a small taken and thereupon gave him the money  putting it into his pocket said i thank you  your friends for it and to let you see i take it  gift not a debt i will not look on it to see  much it is  the prison door being then set open for  we went out and departed to our respecti homes  but before i left the prison considering  day with my self the different kinds of lib aenig or riddle  lo here a riddle to the wise in which a mystery there lies read it therefore with that eye which can discern a mystery the riddle ome men are free while they in prison lie others who never saw prison captives die caution he that can receive it may he that cannot let him stay and not be hasty but suspend his judgment till he sees the end solution he onlys free indeed that is free from sin and he is fastest bound that is bound therein conclusion this is the liberty i chiefly prize the other without this i can despise alesbur prison i was desired by my quondam maste milton to take an house for him in the neigbourhood where i dwelt that he might go ou of the city for the safety of himself and hi family the pestilence then growing hot in london i took a pretty box for him in gileschafont a mile from me of which i gave hi notice and intended to have waited on hi and seen him well settled in it but was prvented by that imprisonment  but now being released and returned hom i soon made a visit to him to welcome him ito the country  after some common discourses had passed between us he called for a manuscript of his which being brought he delivered to me biding me take it home with me and read it a my leisure and when i had so done return i to him with my judgment thereupon  when i came home and had set my self t read it i found it was that excellent poem which he entitled paradise lost after i had with the best attention read i through i made him another visit and returned him his book with due acknowledgement of the favor he had done me in communicating it to me he asked me how i liked it and what i thought of it which i modestly but freely told him and after some further discourse about it i pleasantly said to him thou have said much here of paradise lost but what have thou to say of paradise found he made  after the sickness was over and the city well cleansed and become safely habitable again e returned thither and when afterward i went to wait on him there which i seldom faild of doing whenever my occasions drew me o london he showed me his second poem alled paradise regained and in a pleasant tone said to me this is owing o you for you put it into my head by the question ou put to me at chalfont which before i had not hought of but from this digression i return o the family i then lived in  we had not been long at home about a month perhaps before isaac penington was taken out of his house in an arbitrary manner by military force and carried prisoner to alesury goal again where he lay three quarters of a year with great hazard of his life it being the sickness year and the plague being not only in the town but in the goal  mean while his wife and family were turned out of his house called the grange at peterschalfont by them who had seized upon his estate and the family being by that means broken up some went one way others another mary penington her self with her younger children went down to her husband at alesbury guli with her maid went to bristol to see her former maid anne hersent who was married to a merchant of that city thomas biss i went to alesbury with the children but not finding the place agreeable to my health i soon left it and returning to chalfont took a lodging and was dieted in the house of a friendly man and after some time went to bristol to conduct guli home  mean while mary penington took lodgings in a farmhouse called bottrels in the parish of gileschalfont where when we returned from bristol we found her  we had been there but a very little time before i was sent to prison again upon this occasion there was in those times a meeting once a month at the house of george salter a friend of hedgerly to which we sometimes went and morgan watkins being with us he and i with guli and her maid and one judith parker wife of dr parker one of the college of physicians at london with a maiden daughter of theirs neither of whom were quakers but as acquaintance of mary penington were with her on a visit walked over to that meeting it being about the middle of the first month and the weather good  this place was about a mile from the house of ambrose benett the justice who the summer before had sent me and some other friends to alesbury prison from the burial of edward parret of amersham and he by what means i know not getting notice not only of the meeting but as was supposed of our being there came himself to it and as he came  being come to the house he stood for a while without the door and out of sight listening o hear what was said for morgan was then speaking in the meeting but certainly he heard very imperfectly if it was true which we heard he said afterward among his companions as an argument that morgan was a jesuit viz that in his preaching he trolled over his latin as fluently as ever he heard any one whereas morgan good man was better versed in welsh than in latin which i suppose he had never learned i am sure he did not understand it  when this martial justice who at amersham had with his drawn sword struck an unarmed man who he knew would not strike again had now stood some time abroad on a sudden he rushed in among us with the stackwoodstick held up in his hand ready to strike crying out make way there and an ancient woman not getting soon enough out of his way he struck her with the stick a shrewd blow over the breast then pressing through the crowd to the place where morgan stood he plucked him from thence and caused so great a disorder in the room that it brake the meeting up yet would not the people go away or disperse themselves but tarried to see what the issue would be    amongst others he asked judith parker the doctors wife what her name was which she readily gave and thence taking occasion to discourse him she so overmastered him by clear reason delivered in fine language that he glad to be rid of her struck out her name and dismissed her yet did not she remove but kept her place amongst us  when he had taken what number of names he thought fit he singled out half a dozen whereof morgan was one i another one man more and three women of which the woman of the house was one although her husband then was and for diverse years before had been a prisoner in the fleet for tithes and had no body to take care of his family and business but her his wife  us six he committed to alesbury goal which when the doctors wife heard him read to the constable she attacked him again and having put him in mind that it was a sickly time and that the pestilence was reported to be in that place she in handsome terms desired him to consider in time how he would answer the cry of our blood if by his sending us to be shut up in an infected place we should lose our lives there this made him alter his purpose and by a new mittimus sent us to the house of correction at wiccomb and although he committed us upon banishment which limited a certain time for imprisonment yet he in his mittimus imitted no time but ordered us to be kept till we should be delivered by due course of law so little regardful was he though a lawyer of keeping to the letter of the law  march      and were kept close prisoners there till the seventh day of the month called june      which was some days above twelve weeks and much above what the act required  then were we sent for to the justices house and the rest being released morgan watkins and i were required to find sureties for our appearance at the next assize which we refusing to do were committed anew to our old prison the house of correction at wiccomb there to lie until the next assizes morgan being in this second mittimus represented as a notorious offender in preaching and i as being upon the second conviction in order to banishment there we ay till the five and twentieth day of the same month and then by the favor of the earl of ancram being brought before him at his house we were discharged from the prison upon our promise to appear if at liberty and in health at the assizes which we did and were there discharged by proclamation  during my imprisonment in this prison i betook my self for an employment to making of nets for kitchinservice to boil herbs etc in which trade i learned of morgan watkins  though in that confinement i was not very well suited with company for conversation morgans natural temper not being very agreeable to mine yet we kept a fair and brotherly correspondence as became friends prisonfellows and bedfellows which we were and indeed it was a good time i think to us all for i found it so to me the lord being graciously pleased to visit my soul with the refreshing dews of his divine life whereby my spirit was more and more quickened to him and truth gained ground in me over the temptations and snares of the enemy which frequently raised in my heart thanksgivings and praises unto the lord and at one time more especially the sense i had of the prosperity of truth and the spreading thereof filling my heart with abundant joy made my cup overflow and the following lines drop out  for truth i suffer bonds in truth i live and unto truth this testimony give that truth shall over all exalted be and in dominion reign for evermore the childs already born that this may see honor praise glory be to god therefore   though death and hell should against truth combine it is glory shall through all their darkness shine this i saw with an eye of faith beyond the reach of humane sense for  as strong desire draws objects nigher in apprehension than indeed they are i with an eye that pierced high did thus of truth s prosperity declare after we had been discharged at the assizes i returned to isaac peningtons family at bottrels in chalfont and as i remember morgan watkins with me leaving isaac penington a prisoner in alesbury goal  the lodgings we had in this farmhouse  bottrels proving too strait and inconvenient for the family i took larger and better lodgings for them in berriehouse at amersham whither we went at the time called michaelmas having spent the summer at the other place  london through a divine opening in the motion of life in that eminent servant and prophet of god george fox for the restoring and bringing in again those who had gone out from truth and the holy unity of friends therein by the means and ministry of john perrot  this man came pretty early amongst friends and too early took upon him the ministerial office and being though little in person yet great in opinion of himself nothing less would serve him than to go and convert the pope in order whereunto he having a better man than himself john luff to accompany him traveled to rome where they had not been long ere they were taken up and clapt into prison luff as i remember was put in the inquisition and perrot in their bedlam or hospital for madmen  luff died in prison not without wellgrounded suspicion of being murdered there but perrot lay there some time and now and then sent over an epistle to be printed here written in such an affected and fantastic style as might have induced an indifferent reader to believe they had suited the place of his confinement to his condition  after some time through the mediation of friends who hoped better of him than he proved with some person of note and interest there he was released and came back for england and the report of his great sufferings there far greater in report than in reality joined with a singular show of sanctity so far opened the hearts of many tender and compassionate friends toward him that it gave keeping on the hat in time of prayer as well public as private unless they had  immediate motion at that time to put if off  now although i had not the least acquaintnce with this man not having ever exchanged  word with him though i knew him by ight nor had i any esteem of him for either is natural parts or ministerial gift but rather a dislike of his aspect preaching and way of writing yet this error of his being roached in the time of my infancy and weakness of judgment as to truth while i ived privately in london and had little converse with friends i amongst the many who were caught in that snare was taken with the notion as what then seemed to my weak understanding suitable to the doctrine of a spiritual dispensation and the matter comng to warm debates both in words and wriing i in a misguided zeal was ready to have entered the lists of contention about it not then seeing what spirit it proceeded from and was managed by nor forseeing the disorder and confusion in worship which must naturally attend it  but as i had no evil intention or sinister end in engaging in it but was simply betrayed by the specious pretense and show of greater spirituality the lord in tender compassion to my soul was graciously pleased to open my  but when that solemn meeting was appointed at london for a travel in spirit on behalf of those who had thus gone out that they might rightly return and be sensibly received into the unity of the body again my spirit rejoiced and with gladness of heart i went to it as did many more of both city and country and with great simplicity and humility of mind did honestly and openly acknowledge our outgoing and take condemnation and shame to our selves and some that lived at too remote a distance in this nation as well as beyond the seas upon notice given of that meeting and the intended service of it did the like by writing in letters directed to and openly read in the meeting which for that purpose was continued many days  thus in the motion of life were the healing waters stirred and many through the virtuous power thereof restored to soundness and indeed not many lost and though most of these who thus returned were such as with my self had before renounced the error and forsaken the practice yet did we sensibly find that forsaking without confessing in case of public scandal was not sufficient but that an open acknowledgment of open offenses as well as forsaking them was necessary to the obtaining complete remission  g f was moved of the lord to travel through the countries from county to county to advise and encourage friends to set up monthly and quarterly meetings for the better ordering the affairs of the church in taking care of the poor and exercising a true gospeldiscipline for a due dealing with any that might walk disorderly under our name and to see that such as should marry among us did act fairly and clearly in that respect  guli and her maid into the west of england to meet him there and to visit friends in those parts and we went as ar as topsham in devonshire before we found im he had been in cornwall and was then eturning and came in unexpectedly at topham where we then were providing if he ad not then come thither to have gone that day toward cornwall but after he was come o us we turned back with him through deonshire somersetshire and dorsetshire having enerally very good meetings where he was and the work he was chiefly concerned in went on very prosperously and well without y opposition or dislike save that in the general meeting of friends in dorsetshire a uarrelsom man who had gone out from riends in john perrots business and had not ome rightly in again but continued in the  not only george and alexander parker who was with him but diverse of the ancient friends of that country endeavored to quiet that troublesome man and make him sensible of his error but his unruly spirit would still be opposing what was said unto him and justifying himself in that practice this brought a great weight and exercise upon me who sat at a distance in the outward part of the meeting and after i had for some time bore the burden thereof i stood up in the constraining power of the lord and in great tenderness of spirit declared unto the meeting and to that person more particularly how it had been with me in that respect how i had been betrayed into that wrong practice how strong i had been therein and how the lord had been graciously pleased to show me the evil thereof and recover me out of it  this coming unexpectedly from me a young man a stranger and one who had not intermedled with the business of the meeting had that effect upon the caviller that if it did not satisfy him it did at least silence him and made him for the present sink down and be still without giving any further disturbance to the meeting and the friends were well pleased with this unlooked for testimony from me    i had always entertained so high a regard for marriage as it was a divine institution that i held it not lawful to make it a sort of political trade to rise in the world by and therefore as i could not but in my judgment blame such as i found made it their business to hunt after and endeavor to gain those who were accounted great fortunes not so much regarding what she is as what she has but making wealth the chief if not the only thing they aimed at so i resolved to avoid in my own practice that course and how much soever my condition might have prompted me as well as others to seek advantage that way never to engage on the account of riches nor at all to marry till judicious affection drew me to it which i now began to feel at work in my breast  the object of this affection was a friend whose name was mary ellis whom for diverse years i had had an acquaintance with in the  i had once a year or two before had an opportunity to do her a small piece of service which she wanted some assistance in wherein i acted with all sincerity and freedom of mind not expecting or desiring any advantage by her or reward from her being very well satisfied in the act it self that i had served a friend and helped the helpless  that little intercourse of common kindness between us ended without the least though i am verily persuaded on her part wellassured on my own of any other or further relation than that of free and fair friendship nor did it at that time lead us into any close conversation or more intimate acquaintan one with the other than had been before  but some time and that a good while after i found my heart secretly drawn and inclining toward her yet was i not hasty i proposing but waited to feel a satisfactory settlement of mind therein before i made an step thereto  after some time i took an opportunity  open my mind therein unto my much honoued friends isaac and mary penington who the stood parentum loco in the place or stead  parents to me they having solemnly weigd go and prevail and ith springing in my heart with the word  immediately arose and went nothing doubtg  when i was come to her lodgings which ere about a mile from me her maid told e she was in her chamber for having been der some indisposition of body which had liged her to keep her chamber she had not t left it wherefore i desired the maid to quaint her mistress that i was come to give r a visit whereupon i was invited to go  to her and after some little time spent in mmon conversation feeling my spirit weighy concerned i solemnly opened my mind un her with respect to the particular business ame about which i soon perceived was a eat surprisal to her for she had taken in an pprehension as others also had done that ine eye had been fixed elsewhere and nearer ome  i used not many words to her but i felt  divine power went along with the words  i made at that time but a short visit for having told her i did not expect an answer from her now but desired she would in the most solemn manner weigh the proposal made and in due time give me such an answer thereunto as the lord should give her i took my leave of her and departed leaving the issue to the lord  i had a journey then at hand which i foresaw would take me up about two weeks time wherefore the day before i was to set out i went to visit her again to acquaint her with my journey and excuse my absence not yet pressing her for an answer but assuring her that i felt in my self an increase of affection to her and hoped to receive a suitable return from her in the lords time to whom in the mean time i committed both her my self and the concern between us and indeed i found at my return that i could not have left it in a better hand for the lord had been my advocate in my absence and had so far answered all her objections that when i came to her again she rather acquainted me with them than urged them  from that time forwards we entertained each other with affectionate kindness in order to marriage which yet we did not hasten to but went on deliberately neither did i use those vulgar ways of courtship by making  while this affair stood thus with me i had ccasion to take another journey into kent and ussex which yet i would not mention here ut for a particular accident which befell me n the way  the occasion of this journey was this mary peningtons daughter guli intending to go to er uncle springetts in sussex and from thence amongst her tenants her mother desired me o accompany her and assist her in her busiess with her tenants  we tarried at london the first night and et out next morning on the tunbridgeroad and sevenoak lying in our way we put in here to bait but truly we had much ado to get either provisions or room for our selves or our horses the house was so filled with guests and those not of the better sort for the duke of york being as we were told on the road that day for the wells diverse of his guards and the meaner sort of his retinue had near filled all the inns there  i left john gigger who waited on guli in this journey and was afterward her menial servant to take care for the horses while i did the like as well as i could for her i got a little room to put her into and having shut her into it went to see what relief the kitchen  after this short repast being weary of ou quarters we quickly mounted and took the road again willing to hasten from a place where we found nothing but rudeness for the roysters who at that time swarmed there besides the damning oaths they belched out a one another looked very sowerly on us as i they grudged us both the horses we rode and the clothes we wore  a knot of these soon followed us designing as we afterward found to put an abuse upon us and make themselves sport with us we had a spot of fine smooth sandy way whereon the horses trod so softly that we heard them not till one of them was upon us i was then riding a breast with guli and discoursing with her when on a sudden hearing a little noise and turning mine eye that way i saw an horseman coming up on the further side of her horse having his left arm stretched out just ready to take her about the waste and pluck her off backwards from her own horse to lay her before him upon his i had but just time to thrust forth my stick between him and her and bid him stand off and at the same time reigning my horse to let hers go before me thrust in between her and him and being better mounted than he my horse  while we were thus contending i heard a noise of loud laughter behind us and turning my head that way i saw three or four horsemen more who could scarce sit their horses for laughing to see the sport their companion made with us from thence i saw it was a plot laid and that this rude felow was not to be dallied with wherefore i bestirred my self the more to keep him off admonishing him to take warning in time and give over his abusiveness lest he repented too late he had in his hand a short thick truncheon which he held up at me on which laying hold with a strong gripe i suddenly wrenched it out of his hand and threw it at as far a distance behind me as i could  while he rode back to fetch his truncheon i called up honest john gigger who was indeed a right honest man and of a temper so thoroughly peaceable that he had not hitherto put in at all but now i rouzed him and bid him ride so close up to his mistresss horse on the further side that no horse might thrust in between and i would endeavor to guard the near side but he good man not thinking it  i then told him i had hitherto spared him  but wished him not to provoke me further this i spoke with such a tone as bespake an high resentment of the abuse put upon us and withal pressed so close upon him with my horse that i suffered him not to come up any more to guli  this his companions who kept an equal distance behind us both heard and saw and thereupon two of them advancing came up to us i then thought i might likely have my hands full but providence turned it otherwise for they seeing the contest rise so high and probably fearing it would rise higher not knowing where it might stop came in to part us which they did by taking him away one of them leading his horse by the bridle and the other driving him on with his whip and so carried him off  one of their campany staid yet behind and it so happening that a great shower just then fell we betook our selves for shelter to a thick and wellspread oak which stood hard by thither also came that other person who wore the dukes livery and while we put on our defensive garments against the weather which he had drunk a little too iberally i let him know that one vice would ot excuse another that although but one of em was actually concerned in the abuse yet oth he and the rest of them were abettors f it and accessaries to it that i was not igorant whose livery they wore and was well ssured their lord would not maintain them in ommitting such outrages upon travelers on he road to our injury and his dishonor that i understood the duke was coming down and that they might expect to be called to an account for this rude action  he then begged hard that we would pass by the offense and make no complaint to their lord for he knew he said the duke would be very severe and it would be the utter ruin of the young man when he had said what he could he went off before us without any ground given him to expect favor and when we had fitted our selves for the weather we followed after our own pace  when we came to tunbridge i set john gigger foremost bidding him lead on briskly through the town and placing guli in the middle i came close up after her that i might both observe and interpose if any fresh abuse should have been offered her we were expected i perceived for though it rained very hard the street was thronged with men who  we had a good way to ride beyond tubridge and beyond the wells in byways among the woods and were the later for the hinderance we had had on the way an when being come to harbert springetts house guli acquainted her uncle what danger an trouble she had gone through on the way h resented it so high that he would have had the persons been prosecuted for it but since providence had interposed and so well preserved an delivered her she chose to pass by the offence  when guli had finished the business she wen upon we returned home and i delivered he safe to her glad mother from that time forward i continued my visits to my best beloved friend until we married which was on the    th day of the   th month called october in the year      we took each other in a select meeting of the ancient and grave friends of that country holden in a friends house where in those times not only the monthly meeting for business but the public meeting for worship was sometimes kept a very solemn meeting it was and in a weighty frame of spirit we were in which we sensibly felt the lord with us and joining us the sense whereof remained with us all our life time and was of good service and very comfortable to us on all occasions  my next care after marriage was to secure to my wife what moneys she had and will and thereby secured to r whatever i was possessed of as well all that which she brought either in moneys or in oods as that little which i had before i mared her which indeed was but little yet ore by all that little than i had ever gien her ground to expect with me  she had indeed been advised by some of her elations to secure before marriage some part t least of what she had to be at her own isposal which though perhaps not wholly ree from some tincture of selfinterest in the proposer was not in it self the worst of counsel but the worthyness of her mind and the sense of the ground on which she reeived me would not suffer her to entertain any uspicion of me and this laid on me the greater obligation in point of gratitude as well as of justice to regard and secure her which i did  i omitted in its proper place because i would not break in upon the discourse i was then upon to insert a few lines which i writ as a congratulation to an honored friend upon  my hearts affected with a weighty se of yesterdays proceedings and fr thence desire arises to congratulate my happy friend in his new married state not in that strain wherewith some use to cl mens ears with tedious peals of giving joy but shunning all extremes i choose to tread the middle path which does to virtue lead this then my heart desires for thee my frie thy nuptial joys may never here have end may happiness with thee take up her rest and sweet contentment always fill thy breast may god thee bless with numerous increase and may thy utmost offspring rest in peace accept this pledge of love though but a pa of what is treasured for thee in my heart from him who herein has no other end than to declare himself thy faithful friend t e stepney  th  d month      isaac and mary enington and her daughter guli to take a ourney into kent and sussex to account with eir tenants and overlook their estates in ose countries which before i was married  had had the care of and accordingly the ourney i undertook though in the depth of winter  my travels into those parts were the more ksome to me from the solitariness i underwent and want of suitable society for my business lying among the tenants who were a ustick sort of people of various persuasions and humors but not friends i had little oportunity of conversing with friends though  contrived to be with them as much as i could specially on the first day of the week  but that which made my present journey more heavy to me was a sorrowful exercise which was newly fallen upon me from my father harder to be born than any i had ever met with before  he had upon my first acquainting him with my inclination to marry and to whom not only very much approved the match and vountarily offered without my either asking or expecting to give me a hansome portion at present with assurance of an addition to it hereafter and he not only made this offer to me in private but came down from london into the country on purpose to be better acquainted with my friend and did there make the priest and liturgy the usage and evil treatment of us thereupo was a great trouble to me and when i endevoured to soften him in the matter he forbi me speaking to him of it any more and remoed his lodging that i might not find him  the grief i conceived on this occasion wa not for any disappointment to my self or to m wife for neither she nor i had any strict  necessary dependence upon that promise bu my grief was partly for the cause assigned b him as the ground of it which was that o marriage was not by priest or liturgy and part for that his lower circumstances in the world might probably tempt him to find some such though unwarrantable excuse to avoid performing his promise  and surely hard would it have been for m spirit to have born up under the weight of thi exercise had not the lord been exceedin gracious to me and supported me with the inflowings of his love and life wherewith h visited my soul in my travel the sens whereof raised in my heart a thankful remembrance of his manifold kindnesses in his former dealings with me and in the evening  a song of praise thy love dear father and thy tender care have in my heart begot a strong desire  celebrate thy name with praises rare that others too thy goodness may admire and learn to yield to what thou do require any have been the trials of my mind my exercises great great my distress ll often my ruin has my foe designed my

into buckinghamshire to my dear friends the afflicted parents and upon my return home going to visit them we sat down and solemnly mixed our sorrows and tears together  about this time as i remember it was that some bickerings happening between some baptists and some of the people called quakers in or about highwiccomb in buckinghamshire occasioned by some reflecting words a baptistpreacher had publicly uttered in one of their meetings there against the quakers in general and w penn in particular it came at length to this issue that a meeting for a public dispute was appointed to be holden at westwiccomb between jeremy ives who espoused his brothers cause and w penn  to this meeting it being so near me i went rather to countenance the cause than for any delight i took in such work for indeed i have rarely found the advantage equivolent to the  the issue of this proved better than i expected for ives having undertaken an ill cause to argue against the divine light and universal grace conferred by god on all men when he had spent his stock of arguments which he brought with him on that subject finding his work go on heavily and the auditory not well satisfied stepped down from his seat and departed with purpose to have broken up the assembly but except some few of his party who followed him the people generally stayed and were the more attentive to what was afterward delivered amongst them which ives understanding came in again and in an angry railing manner expressing his dislike that we went not all away when he did gave more disgust to the people  after the meeting was ended i sent to my friend i p by his son and servant who returned home though it was late that evening a short account of the business in the following distich  praevaluit veritas inimici terga dedere nos sumus in tuto laus tribuenda deo which may be thus englished  truth has prevailed the enemies did fly we are in safety praise to god on high the conventicle act if that may be allowed to be called a law by whomsoever made which was so directly contrary to the fundamental laws of england to common justice equity and right reason as this manifestly was for    st it brake down and overrun the bounds and banks anciently set for the defense and security of englishmens lives liberties and properties viz trial by juries instead thereof directing and authorizing justices of the peace and that too privately out of sessions to convict fine and by their warrants distrein upon offenders against it directly contrary to the great charter    by that act the informers who swear for their own advantage as being thereby entitled to a third part of the fines were many times concealed driving on an underhand private trade so that men might be and often were convicted and fined without having any notice or knowledge of it till the officers came and took away their goods nor even then could they tell by whose evidence they were convicted than which what could be more opposite to common justice which requires that every man should be openly charged and have his accuser face to face that he might    by that act the innocent were punished for the offenses of the guilty if the wife or child was convicted of having been at one of those assemblies which by that act was adjudged unlawful the fine was levied on the goods of the husband or father of such wife or child though he was neither present at such assembly nor was of the same religious persuasion that they were of but perhaps an enemy to it    it was left in the arbitrary pleasure of the justices to lay half the fine for the house or ground where such assembly was holden and half the fine for a pretended unknown preacher and the whole fines of such and so many of the meeters as they should account poor upon any other or others of the people who were present at the same meeting not exceeding a certain limited sum without any regard to equity or reason and yet such blindness does the spirit of persecution bring on men otherwise sharp sighted enough that this unlawful unjust unequal unreasonable and unrighteous law took place in almost all places and was vigorously prosecuted against the meetings of dissenters in general though the brunt of the storm fell most sharply on the people called quakers not that it seemed to be more particularly levelled at them but that they stood more fair steady and open as a but to receive all the  no sooner had the bishops obtained this law for suppressing all other meetings but their own but some of the clergy of most ranks and some others too who were overmuch bigoted to that party bestirred themselves with might and main to find out and encourage the most profligate wretches to turn informers and to get such persons into parochial offices as would be most obsequious to their commands and ready at their beck to put it into the most rigorous execution yet it took not alike in all places but some were forwarder in the work than others according as the agents intended to be chiefly employed therein had been predisposed thereunto  for in some parts of the nation care had been timely taken by some not of the lowest rank to choose out some particular persons men of sharp wit close countenances pliant tempers and deep dissimulation and send them forth among the sectaries so called with instructions to thrust themselves into all societies conform to all or any sort of religious profession proteouslike change their shapes and transform themselves from one religious appearance to another as occasion should require in a word to be all things to all not that they might win some but that they might if possible ruin all at least many  the drift of this design was that they who employed them might by this means get a full dissenters meetings of every sort there were in each county and where kept what number of persons frequented them and of what ranks who amongst them were persons of estate and where they lived that when they should afterward have troubled the waters they might the better know where with most advantage to cast their nets  he of these emisaries whose post was assigned him in this county of bucks adventured to thrust himself upon a friend under the counterfeit appearance of a quaker but being by the friend suspected and thereupon dismissed unentertaind he was forced to betake himself to an inn or alehouse for accommodation long he had not been there ere his unruly nature not to be long kept under by the curb of a feigned sobriety broke forth into open prophanness so true is that of the poet naturam expellas furca licet usque recurret   to fudling now falls he with those whom he found tippling there before and who but he amongst them in him was then made good the proverb in vino veritas for in his cups he out with that which was no doubt to have been kept a secret twas to his potcompanions that after his head was somewhat heated with strong liquors he discovered that he was sent forth by dr mew the then vice chancellor of oxford on the design before related and under the protection of justice morton a  sensible of his error too late when sleep had restored him to some degree of sense and discouraged with this ill success of his attempt upon the quakers he quickly left that place and crossing through the country cast himself among the baptists at a meeting which they held in a private place of which the overeasie credulity of some that went among them whom he had craftily insinuated himself into had given him notice the entertainment he found amongst them deserved a better return than he made them for having smoothly wrought himself into their good opinion and cunningly drawn some of them into an unwary openness and freedom of conversation with him upon the unpleasing subject of the severity of those times he most villanously impeached one of them whose name was  headache a man well reputed amongst his neighbors of having spoken treasonable words and thereby brought the man in danger of losing both his estate and life had not a seasonable discovery of his abominable practices elsewhere imprinting terror the effect of guilt upon him caused him to fly both out of the court and country at that very instant of time when the honest man stood at the bar ready to be arraigned upon his false accusation  this his false charge against that baptist left him no further room to play the hypocrite in those parts off therefore go his cloak and  but because the law provided that a conviction must be grounded upon the oaths of two witnesses it was needful for him in order to the carrying on his intended mischief to find out an associate who might be both sordid enough for such an employment and vicious enough to be his companion  this was not an easy task yet he found out one who had already given an experiment of his readiness to take other mens goods being not long before released out of alesburygoal where he very narrowly escaped the gallows for having stolen a cow  the names of these fellows being yet unknown in that part of the country where they began their work the former by the general voice of the country was called the trepan the latter the informer and from the color of his hair redhead but in a little time the trepan called himself john poulter adding withal that judge morton used to call him john for the king and that the a b of canterbury had given him a deaconry that his name was indeed john poulter the reputed son of one  poulter a butcher in salisbury and that he had long since been there branded for a fellow egregiously wicked and debauched we were assured by the testimony of a young man then living in amersham who both was his countryman salisbury as well s by a letter from an inhabitant of that place o whom his course of life had been well known  his comrade who for some time was only alled the informer was named ralph lacy of risborough and surnamed the cowstealer  these agreed between themselves where to ake their first onset which was to be and was n the meeting of the people called quakers hen holden at the house of william russell caled jourdens in the parish of gileschalfont in he county of bucks that which was wanting o their accommodation was a place of harour fit for such beasts of prey to lurk in for assistance wherein recourse was had to parson philips none being so ready none so willing one so able to help them as he  a friend he had in a corner a widowwoan not long before one of his parishioners er name was anne dell and at that time he lived at a farm called whites a

open to them what she ad was at their command  two sons she had at home with her both at mans estate to the eldest of which her maidervant not long before had laid a bastard which infamy to smother up

acto poulter behaved himself with such impetuo violence and brutish rudeness as gave occsion for enquiry who or what he was an being soon discovered to be the trepan so infmous and abhorred by all sober people and aftewards daily detected of gross impieties and ven capital crimes such as christning so the common term is of a cat in contempt of the practice which is used by many upon children naming it catharinecatherina in derision of t then queen and the felonious taking of ctain goods from one of brainford whom a he cheated of money these things raising  outcry in the country upon him made h consult his own safety and leaving his part  be acted by others quitted the country  soon as he could  he being gone satan soon supplied his pla by sending one richard aris a broken ironmer wiccomb to join with lacy in this service ompted thereto in hopes that he might therey repair his broken fortunes  of this new adventurer this single characr may serve whereby the reader may make dgment of him as of the lion by his paw at at the sessions holden at wiccomb in octor then last past he was openly accused of ving enticed one harding of the same town  be his companion and associate in robbing  the highway and proof offered to be made at he had made bullets in order to that sere which charge harding himself whom  had endeavored to draw into that heinous ickedness was ready in court to prove upon th had not the prosecution been discountenced and smothered  lacy the cowstealer having thus got aris e intended highwayman to be his comde they came on the   st of the month cal august    0 to the meeting of the people led quakers where lacy with poulter had en a month before and taking for granted at the same who had been there before were ere then they went to a justice of the peace led sir thomas clayton and swore at all adnture against one thomas zachary and his ife whom lacy understood to have been there e month before that they were then present  that meeting whereas neither the said thos zachary nor his wife were at that meeting t were both of them at london above twen miles distant all that day having been thom zachary of  0 l for his own offense  0 l f his wifes and  0 l for the offense of a prtended preacher though indeed there was n any that preached at that meeting that day and issued forth his warrant to the officers beconsfield where thomas zachary dwelt for t levying of the same upon his goods  i mention these things thus particularly t not an immediate suffering of my own cause in the consequence thereof it occasion no small trouble and exercise to me  for when thomas zachary returning h from london understanding what had been  against him and advising what to do was  formed by a neighboring attorney that his medy lay in appealing from the judgmen the convicting justice to the general qu sessions of the peace he thereupon ordering  said attorney to draw up his appeal in for law went himself with it and tendered  the justice but the justice being a man ne well principled nor well natured and u that he should lose the advantage both of  present conviction and future service of  in his judgment useful men as those bold informers were likely to be fell she upon thomas zachary charging him that hferd justly and that his suffering was  a religious account  the righteous are oppressed and  wicked go unpunished which the justice inpreting to be a reflection on the governnt and calling it an high misdemeanour reired sureties of the good man to answer it at e next quarter sessions and in the mean time  be bound to his good behavior but he ll knowing himself to be innocent of having ken any law or done in this matter any e could not answer the justices unjust dend and therefore was sent forthwith a prier to the county goal  by this severity it was thought the justice igned not only to wreak his displeasure on  good man but to prevent the further proution of his appeal whereby he should at e both oppress the righteous by the levy of the fines unduly imposed upon him d secure the informers from a conviction of ful perjury and the punishment due theree that so they might go on without control he wicked work they were engaged in  but so great wickedness was not to be suffer to go unpunished or at least undiscovered therefore although no way could be found at sent to get the good man released from his ust imprisonment yet that his restraint ght not hinder the prosecution of his appeal  wherefore at the next general quartersessi of the peace holden at highwiccomb in octber following i took care that four substant witnesses citizens of unquestionable cred should come down from london in a coa and four horses hired on purpose  these gave so punctual and full eviden that thomas zachary and his wife were in lond all that day whereon the informers had sw them to have been at an unlawful meeting a place more than twenty miles distant fr london that notwithstanding what endeavo were used to the contrary the jury found the not guilty whereupon the money deposi for the fines at the entering of the appe ought to have been returned and so was t pounds of it but the rest of the money bei in the hand of the clerk of the peace wh name was wells could never be got out aga  thomas zachary himself was brought from alesbury goal to wiccomb to receive his trya and though no evil could be charged upon hi yet justice clayton who at first committed hi displeased to see the appeal prosecuted and  conviction he had made set aside by imptunity prevailed with the bench to rema  while this was doing i got an indictment rawn up against the informers aris and lacy or wilful perjury and caused it to be delivered o the grand jury who found the bill and lthough the court adjourned from the town hall to the chamber at their inn in favor as t was thought to the informers on supposition we would not pursue them thither yet thither hey were pursued and there being two counells present from windsor the name of the one was starkey and of the other as i remember forster the former of which i had before retained upon the trial of the appeal i now retained them both and sent them into court again to prosecute the informers upon this indictment which they did so smartly that the informers being present as not suspecting any such sudden danger were of necessity called to the bar and arraigned and having pleaded not guilty were forced to enter a traverse to avoid a present commitment all the favor the court could show them being to take them bail one for the other though probably both not worth a groat else they must have gone to goal for want of bail which would have put them besides their business spoiled the informing trade and broke the design whereas now they were turned loose again to do what mischief they could until the next sessions  accordingly they did what they could and yet could make little or no earnings at it for  the next quarter sessions was holden at alesbury whither we were fain to bring down our witnesses again from london in like manner and at like charge at the least as before and though i met with great discouragements in the prosecution yet i followed it so vigorously that i got a verdict against the informers for wilful perjury and had forthwith taken them up had not they forthwith fled from justice and hid themselves however i moved by my attorney for an order of court directed to all mayors bailiffs high constables petty constables and other inferior officers of the peace to arrest and take them up wherever they should be found within the county of bucks and bring them to the county goal  the report of this so terrified them that of all things dreading the misery of lying in a goa out of which they could not hope for deliverance otherwise than by at least the loss o their ears they hopeless now of carrying o their informing trade disjoined and one o them aris fled the country so that whatever gallows caught him he appeared no mo in this country the other lacy lurked privily for a while in woods and byplaces ti hunger and want forced him out and the casting himself upon an hazardous adventu thomas zachary he cast himself on is knees at his feet and with appearance of orrow confessing his fault did so earnestly beg or forgiveness that he wrought upon the tener nature of that very good man not only to ut him in hopes of mercy but to be his advoate by letter to me to mitigate at least if ot wholly to remit the prosecution to which i so far only consented as to let him know i would suspend the execution of the warrant upon him according as he behaved himself or until he gave fresh provocation at which message the fellow was so overjoyed that relying with confidence thereon he returned openly to his family and labor and applied himself to business as his neighbors observed and reported with greater diligence and industry than he had ever done before  thus began and thus ended the informingtrade in these parts of the county of bucks the ill success that these first informers found discouraging all others how vile soever from attempting the like enterprise there ever after and though it cost some money to carry on the prosecution and some pains too yet for every shilling so spent a pound probably might be saved of what in all likelihood would have been lost by the spoil and havoc that might  but so angry was the convicting justi whatever others of the same rank were a this prosecution and the loss thereby of the sevice of those honest men the perjured informer for as i heard an attorney one hitchcock of alesbury who was their advocate in court sa a great lord a peer of the realm called them  in a letter directed to him whereby he recommended to him the care and defense of them and their cause that he prevailed to have the oath o allegiance tendered in court to thomas zachary which he knew he would not take because h could not take any oath at all by which sna he was kept in prison a long time after and  far as i remember until a general pardon rleased him  but though it pleased the divine providenc which sometimes vouchsafes to bring goo out of evil to put a stop in a great measur at least to the prosecution here begun yet i other parts both of the city and country  was carried on with very great severity and rgour the worst of men for the most part bing set up for informers the worst of magstrates encouraging and abetting them and the worst of the priests who first began to blo the fire now seeing how it took spread an blazed clapping their hands and hallowin them on to this evil work  the sense whereof as it deeply affected m heart with a sympathizing pity for the oppresed gigantomachia the wars of the giants against heaven not without some allusion to the second psalm thus  why do the heathen in a brutish rage themselves against the lord of hosts engage why do the frantic people entertain their thoughts upon a thing that is so vain why do the kings themselves together set and why do all the princes them abet why do the rulers to each other speak after this foolish manner let us break their bonds asunder come let us make have with joint consent their cords from us cast why do they thus join hands and counsel take against the lords anointed this will make him doubtless laugh who does in heaven sit the lord will have them in contempt for it his sore displeasure on them he will wreak and in his wrath will he unto them speak sion he his king has set to reign scepters must be cast down before him diadems must lie at foot of him who sits in majesty upon his throne of glory whence he will send forth his fiery ministers to kill all those his enemies who would not be subject to his supreme authority where then will ye appear who are so far from being subjects that ye rebels are against his holy government and strive others from their allegiance too to drive what earthly prince such an affront would bear from any of his subjects should they dare so to encroach on his prerogative which of them would permit that man to live what should it be adjudgd but treason and death he must suffer for it out of hand and shall the king of kings such treason see acted against him and the traitors be acquitted no vengeance is his and they that him provoke shall know he will repay and of a truth provoked he has been in an high manner by this daring sin  over mens consciences which should be free to serve the living god as he requires and as his holy spirit them inspires for conscience is an inward thing and none can govern that aright but god alone nor can a wellinformed conscience lower her sails to any temporary power or bow to mens decrees for that would be treason in a superlative degree for god alone can laws to conscience give and that is a badge of his prerogative this is the controversy of this day between the holy god and sinful clay god has throughout the earth proclaimed that he will over conscience hold the sovraignty that he the kingdom to himself will take and in mans heart his residence will make from whence his subjects shall such laws receive as please his royal majesty to give man heeds not this but most audaciously says unto me belongs supremacy and all mens consciences within my land ought to be subject unto my command god by his holy spirit does direct his people how to worship and expect obedience from them man says i ordain that none shall worship in that way on pain of prison confiscation banishment or being to the stake or gallows sent god out of babylon does people call commands them to forsake her ways and all her several sorts of worship to deny her whole religion as idolatry will man thus his usurped power forgo and lose his illgot government oh no but out comes his enacted be it that all who when the organs play will not down fall before this golden image and adore what i have caused to be set up therefore into the fiery furnace shall be cast and be consumed with a flaming blast or in the mildest terms conform or pay so much a month or so much every day which we will levy on you by distress sparing nor widow nor the fatherless and if you have not what will satisfy are like in prison during life to lie christ says swear not but man says swear or lie n prison praemunird until you die mans ways are in a word as opposite to gods as midnightdarkness is to light and yet fond man does stive with might and main by penal laws gods people to constrain to worship what when where how he thinks fit and to whatever he injoyns submit what will the issue of this contest be which must give place the lords or mans decree will man be in the day of battle found able to keep the field maintain his ground against the mighty god no more than can the lightest chaff before the winnowing fan no more than straw could stand before the flame or smallest atoms when a whirlwind came the lord who in creation only said let us make man and forthwith man was made  strike all mankind with an eternal death how soon can god all mans devices quash and with his iron rod in pieces dash him like a potters vessel none can stand against the mighty power of his hand be therefore wise ye kings instructed be ye rulers of the earth and henceforth see ye serve the lord in fear and stand in aw of sinning any more against his law his royal law of liberty to do to others as you would have them do to you oh stoop ye mighty monarchs and let none reject his government but kiss the son whiles wrath is but a little kindled lest his anger burn and you that have transgrest his law so often and would not him obey eternally should perish from the way the way of gods salvation where the just are blessed who in the lord do put their trust foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum  happys he whom others harms do wary make to be    a song of the mercies and deliverances of the lord had not the lord been on our side may israel now say we were not able to abide the trials of that day when men did up against us rise with fury rage and spite hoping to catch us by surprise or run us down by might then had not god for us arose and shown his mighty power we had been swallowed by our foes who waited to devour  against us did combine and with united forces fell upon us with design to root us out then had not god appeared to take our part and them chastized with his rod and made them feel the smart we then had overwhelmed been and trodden in the mire our enemies on us had seen their cruel hearts desire when stoned when stockt when rudely stripped some to the waste have been without regard of sex and whipt until the blood did spin yea when their skins with stripes looked black their flesh to jelly beat enough to make their sinews crack the lashes were so great then had not god been with them to support them they had died his power it was that bore them through nothing could do it beside  where pestilence was rife by bloodyminded men that longed to take away our life then had not god been with us we had perisht there no doubt twas he preserved us there and he it was that brought us out when sentenced to banishment inhumanly we were to be from native country sent from all that men call dear then had not god been pleased to appear and take our cause in hand and struck them with a pannick fear which put them to a stand nay had he not great judgments sent and compassed them about they were at that time fully bent to root us wholly out had he not gone with them that went the seas had been their graves or when they came where they were sent they had been sold for slaves  them favor where they came and in his truth they yet do live to praise his holy name and now afresh do men contrive another wicked way of our estates us to deprive and take our goods away but will the lord who to this day our part did always take now leave us to be made a prey and that too for his sake can any one who calls to mind deliverances past discouraged be at what is behind and murmur now at last o that no unbelieving heart among us may be found that from the lord would now depart and coward like give ground for without doubt the god we serve will still our cause defend if we from him do never swerve but trust him to the end  from us be torn and we of all things but our innocence should wholly stripped be would this be more than did befall good job nay sure much less he lost estate children and all yet he the lord did bless but did not god his stock augment double what twas before and this was writ to the intent that we should hope the more view but the lillies of the field that neither knit nor spin who is it that to them does yield the robes they are decked in does not the lord the ravens feed and for the sparrows care and will not he for his own seed all needful things prepare the lions shall sharp hunger bear and pine for lack of food but who the lord do truly fear shall nothing want that is good  that god will us defend who has been always on our side and will be to the end     spes consisa deo nunquam confusa recedet hope which on god is firmly grounded will never fail nor be confounded  outward persecution from the government blow over when satan raised another storm of another kind against us on this occasion t foregoing storm of persecution as it lasted lon so in many parts of the nation and particlarly at london it fell very sharp and violen especially on the quakers for they having  refuge but god alone to fly unto could n dodge and shift to avoid the suffering as other of other denominations could and in the worldly wisdom and policy did altering the meetings with respect both to place and tim and forbearing to meet when forbidden  kept out of their meeting houses so that of the sveral sorts of dissenters the quakers only he up a public testimony as a standard or ensig of religion by keeping their meeting duly a fully at the accustomed times and places  long as they were suffered to enjoy the use  their meeting houses and when they we shut up and friends kept out of them by forc  this bold and truly christian behavior in e quakers disturbed and not a little displeas the persecutors who fretting complained at the stubborn quakers brake their strength and e off the blow from those other dissenters whom  they most feared so they principally aimed at r indeed the quakers they rather despised an feared as being a people from whose aceable both principles and practices they held emselves secure from danger whereas havg suffered severely and that lately too by d under the other

were called baptists to express their kind and favorable opinion of us and of the priniples we professed which emboldened us to go through that which but to hear of was a teror to them    thomas hicks  preacher among the baptists at london took upon him to write several pamphlets successivel under the title of a dialogue between a christian and a quaker which were so craftily contrive that the unwary reader might conclude the to be not merely fictions but real discourse actually held between one of the people called  quaker and some other person in these feiged dialogues hicks having no regard to justice or common honesty had made his counterfeit quaker say whatsoever he thought would render him one while sufficiently erronious another while ridiculous enough forging i the quakers name some things so abominabl false other things so intolerably foolish a could not reasonably be supposed to have com into the conceit much less to have droppe from the lip or pen of any that went under the name of a quaker  dialogues shall i call them or rather iabologues were answered by our friend w enn in two books the first being entitled eason against railing the other the counterit christian detected in which hicks being harged with manifest as well as manifold foreries perversions downright lies and slanders against the people called quakers in general w penn g whitehead and diverse others by name complaint was made by way of an appeal to the baptists in and about london for justice against thomas hicks  baptists who it seems were in the plot with hicks to defame at any rate right or wrong the people called quakers taking the advantage of the absence of w p and g w who were the persons most immediately conerned and who were then gone a long jourey on the service of truth to be absent from the city in all probability for a considerable time appointed a public meeting in one of their meeting houses under pretense of calling thomas hicks to account and hearing the charge made good against him but with design to give the greater stroke to the quakers when they who should make good the charge against hicks could not be present for upon their sending notice to the lodgings of w p and g w of their intended meeting they were told by several friends that both w p and g w were from home traveling in the countries uncertain where and therefore could not be informed of their intended meeting baptists whose design was otherwise laid would not be prevailed with to deferr their meeting but glad of the advantage gave their brother hick opportunity to make a colorable defense where he had his party to help him and none to oppose him and having made a mock show of examining him and his works of darkness they in fine having heard one side acquitted him  this gave just occasion for a new complaint and demand of justice against him and them for as soon as w p returned to london he in print exhibited his complaint of this unfair dealing and demanded justice by a rehearing of the matter in a public meeting to be appointed by joint agreement this went hardly down with the baptists nor could it be obtained from them without great importunity and hard pressing at length after many delays and tricks used to shift it off constrained by necessity they yielded to have a meeting at their own meeting house in barbican london  there amongst other friends was i and undertook to read our charge there against thomas hicks which not without much difficulty i did they inasmuch as the house was theirs putting all the inconveniences they could upon us  wheelertreet near spittlefields london and gave em timely notice of i forbear here to menon there being in print a narrative of each  which for particular information i refer he reader  but to this meeting thomas hicks would not ome but lodged himself at an alehouse hard y yet sent his brother ives with some others f the party by clamorous noises to divert us from the prosecution of our charge against im which they so effectually performed that hey would not suffer the charge to be heard though often attempted to be read  as this rude behavior of theirs was a cause of grief to me so afterward when i understood that they used all evasive tricks to avoid another meeting with us and refused to do us right my spirit was greatly stirred at their injustice and in the sense thereof willing if possible to have provoked them to more fair and manly dealing i let fly a broadside at them in a single sheet of paper under the title of a fresh parsuit in which having restated the controversy between them and us and reinforced our charge of forgery etc against thomas hicks and his abettors i offered a fair challenge to them not only to thomas hicks himself but to all those his compurgators who jer ives to give me a fair and public meeting in which i would make good our charge against him as principal and all the rest of them as accessaries but nothing could provoke them to come fairly forth  yet not long after finding themselves galled by the narrative lately published of what had passed in the last meeting near wheelerstreet they to help themselves if they could sent forth a counter account of that meeting and of the former at barbican as much to the advantage of their own cause as they upon deliberate consideration could contrive it this was published by thomas plant a baptistteacher and one of thomas hicks his former compurgators and bore but falsely the title of a contest for christianity or a faithful relation of two late meetings etc  to this i quickly writ and published an answer and because i saw the design and whole drift of the baptists was to shroud t hicks from our charge of forgery under the specious pretense of his and their standing up and contending for christianity i gave my book this general title forgery no christianity or a brief examen of a late book etc and having from their own book plainly convicted that which they called a faithful relation to be indeed a false relation i in an expostulatory postscript to the baptists reinforced our charge and my former challenge offering to make it  this was the end of that controversy which was observed to have this issue that what those dialogues were written to prevent was by the dialogues and their unfair unanly unchristian carriage in endeavoring  defend them hastened and brought to pass  not a few of the baptistmembers upon this ccasion left their meetings and society and me over to the quakersmeetings and were yned in fellowship with them thanks be  god  though many of the most eminent among the baptists in and about london engaged themselves in this quarrel to have defended  at least to have brought fairly off if it ad been possible their brother hicks yet the ain service lay upon jeremy ives who having een an unsuccessful trader in cheese and theren failed more than once had now for some ime given over that employment and like a mercenary switzer undertook to be the chamion for the baptists and to maintain their quarrels against all comers  his name was up for a topping disputant but indeed on the best observation i could make of him both now and formerly i could not find him a clean and fair disputant he seemed i confess well read in the falacies of logic and was indeed rather ready than true and sound in framing syllogisms but his  epitaph in a drollin style as himself was wont to use and the it was  beneath this stone deprest does lie the mirror of hypocrisy ives whose mercenary tongue like a weathercock was hung and did this or that way play as advantage led the way if wellhird he would dispute otherwise he would be mute but he would baul nigh half a day if he knew and liked his pay for his person let it pass only note his face was brass his heart was like a pumicestone and for conscience he had none earth and air he was composed with water round about enclosed but earth in him had greatest share for questionless his life lay there and thence his cankred envy sprung which poisoned both his heart and tongue air made him frothy light and vain and pufft him up with proud disdain flouting and fleering more like a stage player than an anabaptist preacher and prayer fitter to be a mountebanks fool than peep into a divinityschool more tricks he had than jack pudding by half to raise the rude multitude into a laugh into the water often he went and through the water many sent that was ye know his element the greatest odds that did appear was this for ought that i can hear that he in cold did others dip but did himself hot waters sip sip said i nay more than so sipping would not serve his turn quaffing go it was much his guts he did not burn for if credit may be given to report he would fuddle even till he reeled to and fro and his cause he would never doubt if wellsoakd over night in stout but mean while he must not lack brandy or a draught of sack one dispute would shrink a bottle of three pints if not a pottle one would think he fetched from thence all his dreaming eloquence and his fourlegd syllogisms proving breakings are no schisms wot ye why himself brake twice say no more the point is nice but let us now bring back the sot unto his aquavitaepot and observe with some content how he framed his argument that his whistle he might wet the bottle to his mouth he set  thence he drew the major part but left the minor still behind good reason why he wanted wind if his breath would have held out he had conclusion drawn no doubt but to it again he went and thence he fetched a lusty consequence then finding all his drink was spent he thus wound up his argument my sides are not of iron neither are my lungs made of whitleather if therefore you have not i have done then leaping down from the dispute at wheelerstreet london the    th of october      away he run the controversy which had been raised by ose cavilling baptists had not been long end before another was raised by an episcopal iest in lincolnshire who fearing as it seem to lose some of his hearers to the quakers rote a book which he miscalled a friendly nference between a minister and a parishioner of  inclining to quakerism in which he misted and greatly perverted the quakers prinples that he might thereby beget in his pahioners an aversion to them and that he ght abuse us the more securely he concealed self sending forth his book without a name  truth prevailing and detecting erro published in the year       my answer i divided according to the sevral subjects handled in the conference into dvers distinct chapters the last of which treaed of tithes  this being the priests delilah and the chapter of mine pinching them it seems  a tender part the belly they laid their hea together and with what speed they could se forth a distinct reply to the last chapter tithes in mine under the title of the right  tithes asserted and proved this also ca forth without a name yet pretended to  written by another hand  a vindication of  friendly conference said to be written by  author of the feigned conference who was  yet willing to trust the world with his na so much of it as related to the subject i w then upon tithes i took into my rejoynde the right of tithes which i published in  year      with this title the foundat of tithes shaken etc  right of tithes asserted etc but ll without a name this latter book had ore of art than argument in it it was ined a hash of illcookd crambe set off with as uch flourish as the author was master of d swelled into bulk by many quotations but ose so wretchedly misgiven misapplied or verted that to a judicious and impartial ader i durst oppose my foundation of tithes ken to the utmost force that book has in it t it coming forth at a time when i was pret well at leisure i intended a full refutation ereof and in order thereunto had written beeen forty and fifty sheets when other buess more urgent intervening took me off d detained me from it so long that it was then ged out of season and so it was laid aside  hitherto the war i had been engaged in was  a sort foreign with people of other relius persuasions such as were open and avow enemies but now another sort of war ae an intestine war raised by some among  selves such as had once been of us and yet ained the same profession and would have n thought to be of us still but having ough illgrounded jealousies let in disconts and thereupon fallen into jangling chief about church discipline they at length ke forth into an open schism headed by two rthern men of name and note john wilon and john story the latter of which as ng the most active and popular man having ed a considerable interest in the west carried  among those william rogers a merchant  bristol was not the least nor least accounted  by himself and some others he was a bo and an active man moderately learned b immoderately conceited of his own parts a abilities which made him forward to engag as thinking none would dare to take up t gauntlet he should cast down this high opnion of himself made him rather a troubsome than formidable enemy  that i may here step over the various ste by which he advanced to open hostility  what i was not actually or personally engag in he in a while arrived to that height  folly and wickedness that he wrote and pulished a large book in five parts to which  maliciously gave for a title  the christian qker distinguished from the apostate and innovat thereby arrogating to himself and those w were of his party the topping style of christ quaker and no less impiously than unchatably branding and rejecting all others e the main body of friends for apostates a innovators  london at the ti of the yearly meeting then following and at  close thereof gave notice in writing to this ct viz that if any were dissatisfied with his ok he was there ready to maintain and defend h it and himself against all comers  this daring challenge was neither dreaded r slighted but an answer forthwith returned  writing signed by a few friends amongst whom i was one to let him know that as man were dissatisfied with his book and him he ould not fail god willing to be met by the xth hour next morning at the meeting ace at devonshirehouse  accordingly we met and continued the meetg till noon or after in which time he surunded with those of his own party as might et and assist him was so fairly foiled and bafd and so fully exposed that he was glad to it the place and early next morning the own also leaving in excuse for his going so bruptly off and thereby refusing us another meeting with him which we had earnestly prooked him to this slight shift that he had bere given earnest for his passage in the stagecoach home and was not willing to lose it  i had before this gotten a sight of his book and procured one for my use on this occasion ut i had not time to read it through but a while after providence cast another of them ino my hands very unexpectedly for our dear riend g fox passing through this country aong friends and lying in his journey at my house had one of them in his bags which he ad made some marginal notes upon for that ood man like julius caesar willing to improve amanuensis what h would have committed to writing i knew not that he had this book with him for he ha not said any thing to me of it till going in the morning into his chamber while he wa dressing himself i found it lying on the tabl by him and understanding that he was goin but for a few weeks to visit friends in the meetings hereabouts and the neighboring parts  oxford and berkshire and so return through the county again i made bold to ask him if  would favor me so much as to leave it wit me till his return that i might have the opportunity of reading it thorough he consente and as soon almost as he was gone i set my se to read it over but i had not gone far in i ere observing the many foul falsehoods malious slanders gross perversions and false doctrines abounding in it the sense thereof inflamed my breast with a just and holy indignation against the work and that devilish spi in which it was brought forth wherefor finding my spirit raised and my understandin divinely opened to refute it i began the boo again and reading it with pen in hand answered it paragraphically as i went and  clear were the openings i received from the lord therein that by the time my friend cam back i had gone through the greatest part of it and was too far engaged in spirit to think o giving over the work wherefore requesting him to continue the book a little longer with friends approbation was printed under he title of an antidote against the infection of w rogers his book miscalled the christian quaer etc this was written in the year      but no answer was given to it either by him r any other of his party though many others were concerned therein and some by name so ar as i have ever heard perhaps there might e an hand of providence overruling them herein to give me leisure to attend some other ervices which soon after fell upon me  for it being a stormy time and persecuion waxing hot upon the conventicleact through the busy boldness of hungry inforers who for their own advantage did not nly themselves hunt after religious and peaeable meetings but drove on the officers not only the more inferior and subordinate ut in some places even the justices also for ear of penalties to hunt with them and for them i found a pressure upon my spirit to write a small treatise to inform such officers ow they might secure and defend themselves from being ridden by those malepert informers and made their drudges  this treatise i called a caution to constables and other inferior officers concerned in the execution of the conventicleact with some observations thereupon humbly offered by way of advice to such wellmeaning and moderate justices of the peace as would not willingly ruin their peaceable neighbors etc  justices as constables etc as acted rather by constraint than choice by encouraging them to stand their ground with more courage and resolution against the insults of saucy informers  but whatever ease it brought to others it brought me some trouble and had like to have brought me into more danger had not providence wrought my deliverance by an unexpected way  for as soon as it came forth in print which was in the year      one william ayrs o watford in hertfordshire a friend and an acquaintance of mine who was both an apothecay and barber being acquainted with diverse of the gentry in those parts and going often to some of their houses to trim them took one o these books with him when he went to tri sir benjamin titchborn of rickmansworth an presented it to him supposing he would have taken it kindly as in like cases he had formerly done but it fell out otherwise for he lookin it over after ayrs was gone and taking it b the wrong handle entertained an evil opinion of it and of me for it though he knew me no  he thereupon communicated both the book and his thoughts upon it to a neighboring justice living in rickmansworth whose nam was thomas fotherly who concurring with hi in judgment they concluded that i should b taken up and prosecuted for it as a seditiou  wherefore sending for ayrs who had brought the book justice titchborn examined him if he knew me and where i dwelt who telling him he knew me well and had been often at my house he gave him in charge to give me notice that i should appear before him and the other justice at rickmansworth on such a day threatening that if i did not appear he himself should be prosecuted for spreading the book  this put william ayrs in a fright over he came in haste with this message to me troubled that he should be a means to bring me into trouble but i endeavored to give him ease by assuring him i would not fail with gods leave to appear at the time and place appointed and thereby free him from trouble or danger  in the interim i received advice by an express out of sussex that guli penn with whom i had had an intimate acquaintance and firm friendship from our very youths was very dangerously ill her husband being then absent in pennsylvania and that she had a great desire to see and speak with me  this put me to a great straight and brought a sore exercise on my mind i was divided betwixt honor and friendship i had engaged my word to appear before the justices which to omit would bring dishonor on me and my profession to stay till that time was come and past might probably prove if i  after some little deliberation i resolved as the best expedient to answer both ends to go over next morning to the justices and lay my straight before them and try if i could procure from them a respit of my appearance before them until i had been in sussex and paid the duty of friendship to my sick friend which i had the more hopes to obtain because i knew those justices had a great respect for guli for when william penn and she were first married they lived for some years at rickmansworth in which time they contracted a neighbourly friendship with both these justices and theirs who ever after retained a kind regard for them both  early therefore in the morning i rode over but being wholly a stranger to the justices i went first to watford that i might take ayrs along with me who supposed himself to have some interest in justice titchborn and when i came there understanding that another friend of that town whose name was john wells was well acquainted with the other justice fotherly having imparted to them the occasion of my coming i took them both with me and hasted back to rickmansworth where having put our horses up at an inn and leaving w ayrs who was a stranger to fotherly there i went with john wells to fotherlys house and being brought into a fair hall i tarried there while wells went into the parlour to him and having acquainted him that i was there and desired  after he had asked me in a tone which spoke displeasure what i had to say to him i told him i came to wait on him upon an intimation given me that he had something to say to me he thereupon plucking my book out of his pocket asked me if i owned my self to be the author of that book i told him if he pleased to let me look into it if it were mine i would not deny it he thereupon giving it into my hand when i had turned over the leaves and looked it through finding it to be as it came from the press i told him i wrote the book and would own it all but the errors of the press whereupon he looking sternly on me answered your own errors you should have said  having innocence on my side i was not at all daunted at either his speech or looks but feeling the lord present with me i replied i know there are errors of the press in it and therefore i excepted them but i do not know there is any error of mine in it and therefore cannot except them but added i if thou please to show me any error of mine in it i shall readily both acknowledge and retract it and thereupon i desired him to give me an instance in any one passage in that book wherein he thought i had erred he said he needed not go to particulars but charge me with the general contents of the whole book i replied that such a charge would be too general for me to give a particular answer to but if he would assign i needed not to be in so much haste for that i might have it timely enough if not too soon but this said he is not the day appointed for your hearing and therefore added he what i pray made you in such haste to come now i told him i hoped he would not take it for an argument of guilt that i came before i was sent for and offered my self to my purgation before the time appointed and this i spoke with somewhat a brisker air which had so much influence on him as to bring a somewhat softer air over his countenance  then going on i told him i had a particular occasion which induced me to come now which was that i received advice last night by an express out of sussex that william penns wife with whom i had had an intimate acquaintance and strict friendship ab ipsis fere incunabilis at least a teneris unguiculis lay now there very ill not without great danger in the apprehension of those about her of her life and that she had expressed her desire that i would come to her as soon as i could the rather for that her husband america that this had brought a great straight upon me being divided between friendship and duty willing to visit my friend in her ilness which the nature and law of friendship required yet unwilling to omit my duty by failing of my appearance before him and the other justice according to their command and my promise lest i should thereby subject not my own reputation only but the reputation of my religious profession to the suspicion of guilt and censure of willingly shunning a trial to prevent which i had chosen to anticipate the time and come now to see if i could give them satisfaction in what they had to object against me and thereupon being dismissed pursue my journey into sussex or if by them detained to submit to providence and by an express to acquaint my friend therewith both to free her from an expectation of my coming and my self from any imputation of neglect  while i thus delivered my self i observed a sensible alteration in the justice and when i had done speaking he first said he was very sorry for madam penn s ilness of whose virtue and worth he spoke very highly yet not more than was her due then he told me that for her sake he would do what he could to further my visit to her but said he i am but one and of my self can do nothing in it therefore you must go to sir benjamin titchborn and if he be at home see if you can prevail with him to meet me that we may consider of it  but i can assure you added he the matter which will be laid to your charge concerning your book is of greater importance than you seem to think it for your book has been laid before the king and council and the earl of bridgwater  who is one of the council has thereupon given us command to examine you about it and secure you  i wish said i i could speak with the earl my self for i make no doubt but to acquit my self unto him and added i if thou please to give me thy letter to him i will wait upon him with it forthwith for although i know continued i that he has no favor for any of my persuasion yet knowing my self to be wholly innocent in this matter i can with confidence appear before him or even before the king in council  well said he i see you are confident but for all that let me tell you how good soever your intention was you timed the publishing of your book very unluckily for you cannot be ignorant that there is a very dangerous plot lately discovered contrived by the dissenters against the government and his majestys life this was the rieplot then newly broke forth and laid upon the presbyterians and for you added he to publish a book just at that juncture of time to discourage the magistrates and other officers from putting in execution those laws which were made to suppress their meetings looks i must tell you but with a scurvy countenance upon you  if replied i with somewhat a pleasanter air there was any mistiming in the case it must  here our discourse ended and i taking for the present my leave of him went to my horse and changing my companion rode to justice titchborns having with me william ayrs who was best acquainted with him and who had casually brought this trouble on me  when he had introduced me to titchborn i gave him alike account of the occasion of my coming at that time as i had before given to the other justice and both he and his lady who was present expressed much concern for guli penns ilness  i found this man to be of quite another temper than justice fotherly for this man was smooth soft and oily whereas the other was rather rough severe and sharp yet at the winding up i found fotherly my truest friend  when i had told sir b titchborn that i came from justice fotherly and requested him to give him a meeting to consider of my business he readily without any hesitation told me he would go with me to rickmansworth from which his house was distant about a mile and calling for his horses mounted immediately and to rickmansworth we rode  after they had been a little while together i was called in before them and in the first place what was my intention an design in writing that book i told them the itroductory part of it gave a plain account o it viz that it was to get ease from the penalties of a severe law often executed wit too great a severity by unskilful officers who were driven on beyond the bounds o their duty by the impetuous threats of a sort of insolent fellows as needy as greedy who for their own advantage sought out ruin to prevent which was the design and drift of that book by acquainting such officers how they might safely demean themselves in the execution of their offices toward their honest and peaceable neighbors without ruining either their neighbors or themselves to enrich some of the worst of men and that i humbly conceived it was neither unlawful nor unreasonable for a sufferer to do this so long as it was done in a fair sober and peaceable way  they then put me in mind of the plot told me it was a troublesome and dangerous time and my book might be construed to import sedition in discouraging the officers from putting the laws in execution as by law and by their oath they were bound and in fine brought it to this issue that they were directed to secure me by a commitment to prison until the assize at which i should receive a further charge than they were provided now to give me but because they were desirous to forward my visit to madam penn they told me they would admit me to bayl and therefore if i would enter a recognizance with sufficient sureties for my appearance at the next assize they would leave me at liberty to go on my journey  i told them i could not do it they said hey would give me as little trouble as they could and therefore they would not put me to seek bail but ould accept those two friends of mine who were hen present to be bound with me for my appearance  i let them know my straight lay not in the difficulty of procuring sureties for i did supose my self to have sufficient acquaintance and credit in that place if on such an occasion i could be free to use it but as i knew my elf to be an innocent man i had not satisaction in my self to desire others to be bound or me nor to enter my self into a recogniance that carrying in it to my apprehension reflection on my innocence and the repuation of my christian profession  here we stuck and strugled about this a prety while till at length finding me fixed in my udgment and resolved rather to go to prison han give bail they asked me if i was against appearing or only against being bound with sureies to appear i told them i was not against appearing which as i could not avoid if i would so i would not if i might but was eady and willing to appear if required to nswer whatsoever should be charged against me but in any case of a religious nature or wherein my christian profession was concerned which i took this case to be i could not yield  give any other or further security than my word or promise as a christian  if i would promise to appear  answered yes with due limitations what d you mean by due limitations said they i mea replied i if i am not disabled or prevented by sickness or imprisonment for added i a you allege that it is a troublesome time i perhaps may find it so i may for ought i know be seized and imprisoned elsewhere on the sam account for which i now stand here before you and if i should how then could i appear at the assize in this county oh said they these ar due limitations indeed sickness or imprisonmen are lawful excuses and if either of these befall yo we shall not expect your appearance here but the you must certify us that you are so disabled by sicknes or restraint  but said i how shall i know when and where i shall wait upon you again after my return from sussex you need not said they trouble your self about that we will take care to giv you notice of both time and place and till you hea from us you may dispose your self as you please  well then said i i do promise you tha when i shall have received from you a fres command to appear before you i will if the lord permit me life health and liberty appear when and where you shall appoint  it is enough said they we will take your word and desiring me to give their hearty respect and service to madam penn they dismissed m with their good wishes for a good journey  worminghurst that i got thither pretty early next morning and to my great satisfaction found my friend in an opeful way toward a recovery  i stayed some days with her and then findng her ilness wear daily off and some other riends being come from london to visit her i mindful of my engagement to the justices and unwilling by too long an absence to give them occasion to suspect i was willing to avoid their summons leaving those other friends to ear her company longer took my leave of her and them and set my face homewards carying with me the welcome account of my riends recovery  being returned home i waited in daily exectation of a command from the justices to ppear again before them but none came i pake with those friends who had been with me when i was before them and they said they had heard nothing of it from them although ey had since been in company with them at length he assize came but no notice was given to me that i should appear there in fine they er troubled themselves nor me any further aout it  guli penn had not fallen sick if i had not thereupon been sen for to her i had not prevented the time of my appearance but had appeared on the day appointed and as i afterward understood tha was the day appointed for the appearance of a great many persons of the dissenting party in that side of the county who were to be taken up and secured on the account of the aforementioned plot which had been cast upon the presbyterians so that if i had then appeared with and amongst them i had in all likelihood been sent to goal with them for company and that under the imputation of a plotter tha which nothing was more contrary to my profession and inclination  but though i came off so easy it fared no so well with others for the storm increasing many friends in diverse parts both of city and country suffered greatly the sense whereo did deeply affect me and the more for that i observed the magistrates not thinking the laws which had been made against us severe enough perverted the law in order to punish riots which in the legal notion of the word  riot  a contradiction in terms they indicted our riends as rioters for only sitting in a meeting o nothing was there either said or done by em and then set fines on them at pleasure  this i knew to be not only against right and jstice but even against law and it troubled e to think that we should be made to suffer t only by laws made directly against us but en by laws that did not at all concern us or was it long before i had occasion offered ore thoroughly to consider this matter  for a justice of the peace in this county who as called sir dennis hampson of taplow breakg in with a party of horse upon a little meetg near wooburn in his neighborhood the   st  the fifth month      sent most of the men  the number of twenty three whom he found ere to alesbury prison though most of them were r men who lived by their labor and not ing himself to the next quarter sessions at ckingham on the   th of the some month sent  clark with direction that they should be incted for a riot whither the prisoners were ried and indicted accordingly and being essed by the court to traverse and give bail y moved to be tried forthwith but that was ied them and they giving in writing the ason of their refusing bail and fees were rended to prison till next quarter sessions but lliam woodhouse was again bailed as he had en before and william mason and john reeve recognizance as the court desired and so were released till next sessions before which time mason died and reeve being sick appeared not but got himself taken off and in the eighth month following the twenty one prisoners that remained were brought to trial a jury was found who brought in a prtended verdict that they were guilty of a rio for only sitting peaceably together without wo or action and though there was no proclamation made nor they required to depart but one  the jurymen afterward did confess he kne not what a riot was yet the prisoners we fined a noble a piece and recommitted to pson during life a hard sentence or the king pleasure or until they should pay the said fin william woodhouse was forthwith discharged  his kinsmans paying the fine and fees for hi thomas dell and edward moor also by other people of the world paying their fines and fees  them and shortly after stephen pewsey by t town and parish where he lived for fear  wife and children should become a charge u on them the other seventeen remained psoners till king jamess proclamation of pdon whose names were thomas and willi sexton timothy child robert moor richard jam william and robert aldridge john ellis geo salter john smith william tanner william bchelor john dolbin andrew brothers rich baldwin john jennings and robert austin  a supplement being a continuation of the history of the life of thomas ellwood giving account in particular of his books and writings our dear friend thomas ellwood for whom we cannot but have an honorable esteem for his service in the church aving written an historical account of part of is life well worth the knowledge of posterity  far as it goes viz to the year      and ere left off whether he writ any further  whether ever he designed it or for what eason he did not proceed is uncertain but so  is that no more of it can be found at present which is to be lamented he being a man so einent many ways that any part of it should e lost in consideration whereof it rose in my eart to write something in order to supply the eficiency thereof many things occurring to y mind which its pity should be omitted therefore for the respect i bore him and owe  his memory being acquainted with him for ore than the last twenty years of his life i all endeavor to make up that defect as far as  am capable of though far short of what himself ight have done by giving an account of some of the most material passages of the remaining part of his life and such memorials of him and his works as came to my hands which i shall set down with as much brevity and plainness as i can in sincerity to him and the truth he professed and adorned particularly of his labors writings sufferings and end from the time he left off  but first i must look back a little to give some additional account of some passages in relation to his answers to the priests about tithes for the readers information and satisfaction which every body may not know to preven misapprehensions in the case  in the year      he answered a namele book miscalled a friendly conference between  minister and a parishioner of his inclining to quakerism in a book entitled truth prevailing a detecting error which he divided into nin chapters according to the various subjects treaed of wherein that nameless author had endeavored to misrepresent us the last of which was of tithes this to use his own words pinching the priests in a tender part the bel as erasmus wittily said luther did the monk made them bestir themselves and lay the heads together to consider what was to b done preface to foundation of tithes shaken page     after diverse debates and much cosultation as he was informed about it it wa at last resolved to answer that first which the the last chapter in his book yet having the fi and chiefest place in the priests minds and afections the priests delilah the very darling a minion of the clergy says t e the oil by which their lamp is nourished the pay by which their army is maintained as the priest confesses and to take away tithes would be to stop the oil that nourishes the lamp and force them to disband for want of pay introduction page   right of tithes p    this being i say their chiefest concern and lying nearest at heart obtained from them the first and chiefest defense which at length came forth by a nameless author also in a book entitled the right of tithes asserted and proved to which t e replied in      in a large book entitled the foundation of tithes shaken and the four principal posts  of divine institution primitive practice voluntary donation and positive laws on which the nameless author of the said book had set his pretended right to tithes removed tracing them all along from the patriarchs to the time of the law showing the design and use of them under it and how they were abolished by the coming and suffering of christ in the flesh and how they came to be set up again in the declension of the church by popish kings and councils in the night of apostasy for supersticious and idolatrous ends and uses contrary to the gospel dispensation and consequently not obligatory on christians by any divine right to pay in this gospel day answering all the objections and pretenses which were brought by that author for them from the four forementioned topics  to this book of t es there was a pretended answer put forth two years after supposed by the author of the former but nameless still the author not daring to own his work with his name though since called combers entitled the right of tithes reasserted wherein the proofs from the four former points are said to be further strengthened and vindicated especially from the objections taken out of mr seldom s history of tithes as if it was chiefly designed against john seldom t es name or book not being so much as mentioned in the title page though often in the book as if it was however designed as an answer to him which therefore t e though not entitled to it took in hand to rejoin to and had begun and made some considerable progress in it but before he had gone through or finished it some other occasions falling in his way of which hereafter it was laid by and never finished though he had writ as he told me near sixty sheets though i find but forty six among his papers but these with his notes and quotations will make near sixty for he had collected a vast number of materials out of authors in order thereto as appears by his papers which i have since seen for thus it was that some of the priests party vaunting that this second book of the priests was not answered i took occasion once at london in the year      to speak to him about it and he told me that the substance of the priests arguments in this second book were answered in his former the foundation of tithes shaken only some new quotations which he had brought and that was what he chiefly designed to deal with the priest about to examine and clear by adding some new ones also but that he never expected to have the last word with the priests about tithes which their interest lay so much in that they would never be satisfied but always be cavilling about some way or other how little soever it was to the purpose and some other services taking him off as aforesaid he laid it by which i mention to satisfy any who may question in their minds why it was never answered or at least gone through and this is the reason why i resumed this matter  in handling the argument of tithes says he in a paper found among his manuscripts as an introdnction to his said intended answer i write with this disadvantage that i encounter a numerous party and order of men with whom interest is far more prevalent than truth whose profit will not permit them to yield to reason whose advantage will not suffer them to acknowledge the plainest demonstration their gain as apparently lying in that which i oppose as demetriuss and his fellowcraftsmen the silversmiths of ephesus did in that which the apostle preached against acts          hence is it that they bend all their strength and employ their utmost force to maintain this point by which they are maintained and like those shrinemakers of old they endeavor to carry it by noise and clamor instead of truth and reason nor do they regard what they say how false soever or whom they bespatter how undeservedly soever in order to the upholding their adored diana and enjoying their most beloved delilah tithes my present adversary is not ashamed to say p     that i and my fellow quaking speakers as he reproachfully calls us have our gain by railing against tithes a charge so apparently and rediculously false that it needs no more than its own malice and folly to detect it with equal reason might demetrius have charged st paul that he and his brethren had their gain by impugning the idolatrous worship of diana   sacrilege and idolatry the priests say are sins near of kin but covetousness and the clergy are perhaps nearer the great outcry against sacrilege is made for the most part by idolaters and false ministers who as they are most greedy and crafty to get so are they most solicitous and careful to keep most enraged and clamourous when they come to lose their unjustly acquired gains thus was it with the popish clergy after they had gulled the people by a religious cheat of a great part of their substance they labored to terrify them by the name of sacrilege from attempting to recover that which had been so fraudulently gotten from them and doubtless the english clergy as they derive in chief part the maintenance they possess from their predecessors the popish clergy from whom they received their priesthood have therewith also taken up from them their old cry of sacrilege with which as a bugbear they would scare all from attempting to discover the cheat but the legal alienation of a great part of those surreptitius acquisitions of the clergy begun in henry the eighths time carried on in edward the sixths and completed in q elizabeths of these three the two last were protestant princes has abated the edge of that clerical weapon and satisfied the disintrested part of the nation that the word  sacriledge in this case is but like a scarecrow especially when used by the priests for their own profit as most commonly it is for though they pretend the maintenance of gods worship yet it is their own maintenance they intend and herein demetrius and they most patly agree for he also urged as the most specious pretense and which was most likely to impress the people the danger lest by pauls preaching the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence destroyed acts       whereas the great inducement to him for stirring was the danger lest his craft should be set at naught and he should thereby lose the gains he made by dianas temple ver       do the priests now cry out against sacrilege so did demetrius and his craftsmen then did they cloak their private interest with a seeming regard and care for the temple and magnificence of their goddess dinna so do the priests theirs now with a pretense of zeal for the worship of god did they in their fury take no notice of the magistrates nor laws of their country s neither do many of the priests now who wit out regard to law or magistrates run furously and tumultuously into their neighbou grounds with their servants and teams and forcibly and arbitrarily take and carry away their corn and hay when where and in what quantity they please will the priests allege that notwithstanding these irregular practices yet they have the law and magistrates on their sides so had demetrius and his company too while the good apostle not backed by laws nor countenanced by magistracy was yet enabled by divine assistance to stand the shock of a their rage and fury and boldly to testify against that which was corrupt and naugh although it had the favor and support of  law and magistracy too and indeed so ap is the comparison in most respects betwee those shrinemakers and these tythetaker that my adversary in vain labors to reto it for even the very particulars he instanc to cast it upon me fix it the more firmly  the head of himself and his own party  nor is he less put to it to avoid the force  his own unwary expressions of the oil for t lamp and pay for the soldier whereby  has discovered that he and his brethren a mere mercinary men whose lamp will bu no longer than it is fed with the oil of tyth this was one of the arcana cleri a secret  seems that should not have been divulged but children and he knows who besides are said to tell true and he having inconsideratly blabd it out his chief care and art is now how to palliate extenuate and mince the matter and varnish it over with some kind of flourish that the ground of it may not be seen but this he does so weakly and lays his color so thin that even the weakest eye may easily see through it the mention i made of these passages in my former book he calls tedious and nauseous repetitions and tedious no doubt and nauseous it is to him and his brethren to see the false foundation of their ministry so openly exposed but so little do i fear those repetitions being nauseous or tedious to the indifferent reader that upon this occasion i desire him to peruse them again in the       and   pages of my former book   from tithes being the oil to their lamp and pay to their army he says i draw as i imagine a cutting consequence viz that their lamps will not burn without oil nor they fight without pay this cutting consequence as he calls it he touches as tenderly as if he was afraid it would cut his fingers though he well knew that in the wording of it he had taken off its edge as much as he could for if my consequence had been only that their lamps will not burn without oil it would not then have been so keen he might then have replied whose will can any lamp burn without oil no sure every lamp must have oil but the oil should be suitable to the lam an outward lamp should have outward oy an inward lamp inward oil now they prtending their ministry to be a spiritual lam a religious lamp as the true ministry inde is and is and can be nourished only by t spiritual heavenly oil of the divine eter word and yet confessing tithes to be the o that nourishes their ministerial lamp and wit out which their lamp will not burn this plaily shows their lamp is not spiritual nor the ministry what they pretend etc  by this we may judge ex pede herculem  the priests performance and t es answ had he gone through and finished it which y i hope so far as he has gone may one ti or other see the light being well worth t perusal as it is and had he finished it i am tisfied it would have been a very serviceab piece no hand in my judgment being m capable of such a performance but he ha as i said some other services on his hands divert him of which his answer to willi rogerss great book aforesaid in      intiled an antidote against the infection of william rogers s book miscalled the christian quak in five parts soon after no doubt was o containing above thirty sheets in which  answered him chapter by chapter and  most paragraph by paragraph in relation  church government and the good order  truth established amongst us and also as  most of the principles of truth which the  w r in one part of his work had endeavourd to pervert to his own ends a laborious work it was and difficult task to go through o evenly as he has done and though it is controversy yet pleasant to read as also his aution to constables and other inferior officers ncerning the execution of the conventicleact with some observations thereupon humbly offered  way of advice to such wellmeaning and modete justices of the peace as would not willingly in their peaceable neighbors etc which is entioned in his own account  no man knows the ngs of a man save the spirit of a man which is im so none can relate but himself or like self for as the wise man says the heart weth his own bitterness and the stranger can intermeddle whith his joy but what occurs m my own knowledge or from his books d papers pertinent to the case in hand shall thfully be related  therefore to resume the thread of his disrse and begin where he leaves off he intites at the close of his own account that the viz the conventicleact etc svere enough perverted the law by makin our peaceable meetings riots and indicting o friends as rioters that they might fine at pleasure which he knew to be contrary to law and justice nor was it long says he before h had occasion offered more thoroughly to conder this matter  viz the breaking up of t meeting near wooburn by justice hampso sending friends to prison and indicting the for a riot which shows he designed to write  book on that subject though he does not mention it and accordingly did this year aft the caution to constables etc as aforesaid t he called a discourse concerning riots occasion by some of the people called quakers being indict for a riot etc of which he gives by way  preface this further account the proceeings of late in city and country against  of the people called quakers for riots for o meeting peaceably together to serve and wship god first put me upon enquiring i the nature of riots what upon inquiry  have found i here present to public vie for common benefit that none through igrance may be the occasion of bringing an ujust suffering upon an innocent people a thereby guilt on themselves i do not prete much skill in law a study and profession was never bred to but having spent so hours on this occasion in searching what  law books say in this case i hope i  do good and prevent evil which consideration with men of candor and ingenuity will be i hope a sufficient apology for my seeming boldness in this undertaking and so he proceeds to set forth what riots are in the law and law books of which he cites diverse and scripture too to show that our peaceable meetitgs which in those days they used to make riots that they might imprison and fine us at pleasure could not be riots though through ignorance or envy they were often so rendered which showed their injustice saying how truly i have stated the case on the one hand with respect to riots the many quotations in the foregoing discourse will show how true an account on the other hand i have given of our meetings the whole nation and all nations where we have meetings may judge upon the whole says he my request is that all both justices and jurors who have or shall be concerned in this or the like case will seriously weigh the matter and not strain the law beyond its due extent adding to oppress any by color of law is the greatest abuse of law concluding with a serious recapitulation and application of the whole that none for the  about the same time or not long after he writ also a seasonable disswasive from persecution humbly and modestly yet with christian freedom and plainness of speech offered to the consideration of all concerned therein on behalf generally of all that suffer for conscience sake particularly the people called quakers in the beginning of which he defines what persecution is  persecution says he is a word of so harsh a sound and so generally distasteful to english ears that scarce any of those who are most forward and active in that work are willing to have their actions called by that name that none therefore who have set an hand to that work or whose minds are any whit inclining thereto may from the dislike they have to the word  persecution reject this disswasive as a thing wherein they are not concerned i think it needful here to declare what it is i mean by persecution by persecution then i intend a forcing or compelling any by pains or penalties bodily or pecuniary to relinquish or forsake that exercise of religion or way of worship which they believe to be the right way of worship and the true and acceptable exercise of religion which god has required of them and to receive embrace conform to and perform some other exercise of religion and way of worship which they who are so compelled are either firmly persuaded is not the right or at least have no belief that it is right this in short is that which i call persecution and this is that which i dissuade from whatever other name the actors of it may please themselves in calling it by  i to begin with the first of these viz the forcing or compelling any to forsake and and leave that exercise of religion or way of worship etc the reasons by which he endeavors to dissuade all men from such an undertaking are these  i e the heads of them   you may for ought you know be found fighting against god you are not you cannot be upon your own principles infallibly sure that that way of worship which you thus endeavor to force us from is not the true worship of god    by endeavoring to force us from that way of worship which we believe the lord has led us into and requires of us you endeavor to force us to make shipwreck of faith    in endeavoring by force and cruelty to restrain us from worshipping god as we are fully persuaded he has taught us and does require us you go out of the path of the righteous and tread in the steps of the wicked and ungodly    that exercise of religion which you would force us from is not simply of it self condemned and disallowed by that law by the severity of which you would force us from it    in thus eagerly pursuing us and disturbing our peaceable meetings you give your selves as well as us a great deal of needless refrain from these men and let them alone    and lastly be pleased to consider what sort of agents and instruments you are fain to make use of and not seldom are your selves made use of by to carry on this work concluding this part thus o never give cause for this epitaph to be written on your tombs here lies a persecutor of the people of god  ii now for the other branch of persecution viz the forcing or compelling of any by pains or penalties  to receive embrace conform to and perform some exercise of religion and way of worship etc the reasons by which he endeavors to dissuade all men from such an undertaking are these  viz the heads    in thus imposing your way of worship upon others you act quite contrary to christ and his apostles    in thus imposing your way of worship upon others you follow the worst of patterns nebuchadnezzar king of babylon etc    in forcing people to your way of worship who have no belief that it is the right you cause them to sin for whatsoever is not of faith is sin    in forcing people to your way of worship who have a firm persuasion and belief that it is not the right you make men hypocrites and timeservers    by obtruding and enforcing your religion upon others you greatly disparage and undervalue it and give men the more ground to suspect and dislike it    you break that great command which christ says is the law and the prophets viz all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them mat        all these reasons are illustrated and backed with scripture and reason concluding with a ery close and seasonable application to our percutors a solid serious discourse it is if any arguments had been sufficient to dissuade men om persecution of which there was very great bout this time particularly in london bristol and diverse other places the whole being well worth perusal and i should have inclined to inert it at large but that it has pleased god to cline the hearts of our superiors to ease us in that respect by granting a toleration to proteant dissenters for which we are thankful these three viz the caution to constables discourse of riots and disswasive from persecuion were all written or at least printed this year       william tournay to him unknown sent him a letter from london taking notice of the aforesaid tracts which he was so well pleased with that he desired his judgment on the   d   th and   th of q elizabeth in relation to the proceedings then upon them to which our friend t e returned him an answer in a large letter which is in his decades of letters among many others to diverse persons and on various subjects well worthy the perusal from the year    0 down to his latter times and if they were published  about this time he writ the following poem or hymn of praise to the lord which i think well deserves to be inserted in thi place entitled collaudemus dominum come let us praise the lord with on consent all ye whose hearts to honor him are ben come let us of his gracious dealings tell for with us he has dealt exceeding well when him we did not seek he did us find he gave us sight when we were dark and blind he brought us home when we were run astray and set our feet in the new and living way when hunger pined he gave us heavenly bread and with the choicest dainties has us fed he from misleading guides delivered has and led us forward in the just mans path he has with strength and courage us endud with zeal for truth and christian fortitude he wisdom from above does daily give to them that in his truth sincerely live in battle he has us preserved thus far and made us victors in the holy war our enemies he greatly has subdued his sword in blood of the slain has been imbrued he has preserved from the roaring lion and brought a little remnant safe to sion  eternal hallelujahs to their king who lives and reigns and may his reign extend throughout the universe and have no end t e    but to proceed  william rogers whom our author answered in the year      as aforesaid though he did not reply to it or ever attempted it that i have heard of putting forth a rhiming scourge for george whitehead against whom he bent his most inveterate spleen and who had also answered his great book falsely called the christian quaker in a book entitled the accuser of the brethren cast down etc t e writ an answer to his scourge in verse entitled rogeromastix a rod for william rogers in return for his rhiming scourge for which he gives the following reason to such as ask why i in verse have writ this answer i return i held it fit verse should in verse be answered prose in prose my adversary his own weapon chose he chose before in prose to write and then i answered him in prose so now again since he his style from prose to verse has changed and in the muses walks has boldly ranged in his own method him i chose to treat lest he should wise be in his own conceit prove         and begins thus the preacher tells us that beneath the sun there is no new thing for that which shall be done and what is now a doing shall acted be again in times ensuing let none be shaken therefore in his mind if he gods people now reviled find reproached with bitter words and vilifyd with filthy slanders loaded and belied by wicked men such was the churches state of old as sacred story does relate   and having recounted the opposition made by rabshaketh sanballat and tobiah etc to the jews and diotrephes to the apostles he proceeds page   by these examples plainly it appears how satan played his pranks in former years what arts he used how craftily he wrought what instruments whereby to work he sought one while professed enemies and then another while he chose false brethren and though those agents now are dead and gone satan remains the same the evil one he mischief always to the church intends and mischief to effect his agents sends though rabshaketh be dead tobiah rotten sanballat and diotrephes forgotten the wicked spirit that in them did strive against gods truth and church is still alive and other instruments does daily raise to hinder truths fair progress in these days he agents has great store of every size and sort how numerous are truths enemies yet blessed be god a greater numbers those that stand for truth than those that it oppose i list not here a musterroll to make of all who from without in hand did take to battle against truth and shake their spears at israels camp within these twenty years nor do i purpose to ennumrate all who in that time themselves did quakers call that through misguided zeal or discontent their bows against their brethren have bent but since some few of late appear to be with rage and envy filled to that degree that with more bitterness than all the rest their malice against truth they have expressed my purpose is to single out from these him that appears as their diotrephes and that is rogers for though crisp and bug with other some do at the same oar tug and toil hard at it too with all their might et can they do no more but show their spite and for the rest that lie behind the skreen and move the wheels but like not to be seen although they help to carry on the work take less notice of them while they lurk them therefore leaving i return again to view will rogers his poetic strain who having been too often foiled in prose to try his fortune now in verse has chose  verse without offense that may called which is delivered in rhimes so bald so flat so dull so rough so void of grace where symphony and cadence have no place so full of chasmes stuck with prosie pegs whereon his tired muse might rest her legs  she might with much a do hop on again his  words to that effect  why so  how so hence i observe  hence i conclude   do show his pursy muse was often out of wind and glad when she a perching place could find what drew thee william to this rhiming fit having no more propensity to it could think such hobling and unequal rhimes that make a jangling like disordered chimes could of a poem ever deserve the name or ever be read without the authors shame what clouds of darkness in thy lines appear how is thy style perplext how far from clear thy muse is wrapped in thickest fogs of night which shows thou art departed from the light nor sun nor moon nor star throughout thy boo is to be seen no spring nor crystal brook glides through thy margin no thy waters ru black like the streams of styx or phlegeton   and having gone through and answered this adversaries book he sums it up and concludes as follows page    william thy work is weighed thy spirit tried and both thy work and spirit are denied thy spirit is the same that wrought of old in sanballat tobiah and the bold assyrian railer rabshakeh who sought gods work and people to have brought to naught as thou have done and what the prophet cried in that case may to thee be well applied the virgin has despised thee zions daughte makes thee the object of her scorn and laughte  at thee her head with a disdainful look or whom have thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom have thou so loudly screamd and lift thine eyes on high thy spleen does swell against the holy one of israel to this effect the prophet did declaim against the proud assyrian from whom came that cursed railer who even seems to be  railing blasphemies a type of thee what nehemiah to sanballat said when he foul slanders to his charge had laid that i to thee of all thy slanders thus there are no such things acted amongst us as thy abusive pamphlet does contain but out of thine own heart thou do them feign and where thou carpst at what we do aright we can for truths sake in reproach delight the lord rebuilding is his holy city which thou and others envy mores the pity and put forth all the strength and art you have the work to stop the workmen to deprave but never be so vain to think you can the work obstruct it is not the work of man the god of heaven he will prosper us and therefore we his servants strengthened thus will rise and build as god shall us endue with courage strength and counsel for it but you no portion have who do the work condemn right nor memorial in jerusalem my soul laments your state who once have felt that tendring power which stony hearts can melt and have been in some measure tendred by it but now so hardened are as to defy it all you i mean who have in print appeared with envious hearts and conscience doubly seared to fight against the truth and to expose gods people to the fury of their foes and all you too who do that work abet although your names thereto ye have not set ah had ye kept unto the heavenly grace which in your inward parts the lord did place and not in discontented humor run after loheres lotheres as you have done ye might in truth the bond of peace have known and in the spirits unity have grown which is the churches girdle highly prized by all the faithful though by you despised whereas by letting in first false surmisings of others which ere long produced despisings and so made way for prejudice to enter till cancred malice in your hearts did center ye now are broke and into pieces shattered and from the body and head are scattered without the camp ye stand oh dismal state snarling amongst the dogs without the gate belching forth slander and calumniation against those that in the light have kept their station oh may the god of heaven stop your way that ye no more the simple may betray   i could not but recite thus much of the beginning and end of that book which is so excellent both for the subject and composure  friends which he did very solidly and weightily to stir up friends to faithfulness and to beware of the enemies wiles and avoid that rending dividing spirit which was then at work to cause division and strife among friends which being so seasonable and excellent both for matter and style the whole is thought meet to be here inserted at large and is as follows an epistle to friends dear friends unto whom the gathering arm of the lord has reached and who have known in your several measures a being gathered thereby into the heavenly life and are witnesses of the preserving power by which ye have been kept faithful to the lord and regardful of his honor unto you in an especial manner is the salutation of my true and tender love in the lord and for you as for my self are the breathings and fervent desires  and truly friends a great weight has been upon my spirit for many days and my mind has been deeply exercised in the sense i have of the enemys prevailing by one bait or other to unsettle the minds of some whom the arm of the lord had reached unto and in some measure gathered to a resting place but not abiding in that pure light by which they were at first visited and to which they were at first turned the understanding has been veiled again the eye which was once in some measure opened has the god of the world insensibly blinded again and darkness is again come over to that degree that they can now contentedly take up again what in the day of their convincement and in the time of their true tenderness they cast off as a burden too heavy to be born o my friends this has been the enemys work therefore it greatly behooves all to watch against him for it has been for want lusted after the fleshpots of egypt again or turned aside into some bypath or crooked way in the wilderness and thereby have fallen short of the promised good land  but you my dear friends in whom the word of life abides and who abide in the virtue and savor thereof ye know the wiles of the enemy and the power which subdues him and the rock in which the preservation and afety is so that i write not these things unto ou because ye know them not but the end f my thus writing is to stir up the pure mind n all upon whom the name of the lord is caled that we all may be provoked to watchfuless against the workings of the wicked one therefore dear friends bear i beseech you he word of exhortation though from one that is little and low and through mercy sensile of it and who has not been accustomed o appear after this manner for the wind ye now blows where it lists  byond the limits of the pure fear to entertain fmiliarity with the worlds people the spirit of the world in them will seek an entrance and if not diligently watched against will also g an entrance and bring a hurt and a loss upon him or them into whom it so gets for being once entered it will insensibly work and dispose the mind into which it is got to a condescension to and compliance with the people o the world it converses with first in one things words in behavior etc little things in appearance but great in consequence till at length an indifferency gets up in the mind and the testimony of truth by degrees is let fall but while the pure fear is kept to and dwelt in the watch is always set the spirit is retired and weighty and an holy awfulness rests upon the mind which renders such converse both safe to the friends and more serviceable to them they converse withal  and friends not only in your conversing with the worlds people but in all your conversation and course of life watch against the spirit of the world for it lies near to tempt and to draw out the mind and to lead back into the world again you know friends that at the first when the visiting arm of the lord reached to us he led us out of the worlds ways manners customs and fashions and a close testimony both in word and practice was born against them but how has this testimony been kept up and kept to by all who have since made profession of the truth ah how has the enemy for want of watchfulness stole in upon too too many and led out their minds from that which did at first convince them into a liberty beyond the cross of christ jesus and in that liberty they have run into the worlds fashions which the worldly spirit continually invents to feed the vain and airy minds withal that they may not come to gravity and solidity  new fashion come up or a fantastic cut invented but some one or other that professes truth is ready with the foremost to run into it ah friends the world sees this and smiles and points the finger at it and this is both a hurt to the particular and a reproach to the general therefore o let the lot be cast let search be made by every one and let every one examine himself that this achan with his babylonish garment may be found out and cast out for indeed he is a troubler of israel and all friends who upon true search shall find your selves concerned in this particular i warn and exhort you all return to that which at first convinced you to that keep close in that abide that therein ye may know as at the first not only a bridle to the tongue but a curb to the roving mind a restraint to the wandering desire for assuredly friends if truth be kept to none will need to learn of the world what to wear what to put on or how to shape and fashion their garments but truth will teach all how best to answer the end of clothing both for useful service and modest decency and the cross of christ will be a yoke to the unruly will and a restraint upon the wanton mind and will crucify that nature that delights in finery and in bravery of apparel in which the true adorning does not stand but in the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even a meek and quiet spirit   pet     and the grace of god which to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world titus         but will also lead those that obey it out of all excess and out of all superfluities and worldly vanities and will teach them to order their conversation aright therefore to this heavenly grace let every mind be turned and therein stayed that thereby all who profess the truth may be kept in the holy limits of it that in their whole conversation and course of life in eating in drinking in putting on apparel and in whatsoever else we do or take in hand that all may be done to the glory of god   cor  0    that our moderation in all things may appear unto all men  and let not any deceive and hurt themselves with a false plea saying i will be left to my liberty i have freedom to do go or wear so and so and religion stands not in cloths etc for that liberty which the worldly spirit leads into is not indeed the true liberty but is a false and feigned liberty which leads into true and real bondage and though religion stands not simply n cloths yet true religion stands in that which ets a bound and limit to the mind with respect o cloths as well as to other things so that where there is a running out into excess and vaity in apparel that is a certain indication and oken that the mind is got loose and has cast off he yoke and is broke away from its due subction to that divine power in which the true eligion stands  false freedom and crying up a wrong liberty for under this pretense have crept in great disorders some running out one way and some another some mixing in marriages with the worlds people and some going to the priest to be married and many loose and unclean spirits have shrouded themselves under this plausible pretense of being left to their liberty unto whom truths order is irksome and uneasy and they kick against it and call it imposition because it checks their licentious liberty therefore all who join with their plea examine and try what liberty it is ye claim and stand for for the true liberty is not inconsistent with the cross of christ nor repugnant to his yoke but agrees with it and is obtained through it and maintained by it and none whom the son has made free indeed will or can plead or make use of that liberty in opposition to any means which the god of order has appointed or set up in his church for the keeping out confusion disorder and looseness and hereby all may take a right measure and may certainly know what kind of liberty that is which some have so hotly contended for in opposition to that necessary and commendable order which god has led his people into and which the enemy in his agents labors so hard to lead them ou of for the enemy well knows that the tendency and service thereof is to detect and discover his secret workings and to bring his deeds t  away with your order let every one be left to his liberty by which seemingly fair and specious plea not only the loose disorderly factious spirits have been let up and encouraged to greater boldness and licentiousness but some simple and wellmeaning friends also not seeing the design of satan therein have been misled thereby and made use of by the enemy and the more subtle of his instruments to oppose the good order of truth thus has the enemy wrought and sought to lay waste the work of the lord but the lord magnified be his holy name has not been wanting to his people who in sincerity of heart have diligently waited on him and trusted in him for he has all along raised up some whose eye he has opened to see the design and working of the evil one and whose spirits he has engaged to stand up in a faithful testimony against him contending for the way of truth which when they in whom the enemy wrought perceived and found they could not run over the heads of friends and carry things on as themselves pleased they set themselves in a heady wilful spirit to raise disturbances in meetings for business by encouraging and abetting such heady loose contentious and disorderly persons as would join with them thus hardening themselves and provoking the lord to give them up to blindness and hardness of heart till at length the enemy prevailed so far upon them discontent to prejudice then to enmity and so at length in diverse places to an open defection apostasy and separation  now although i know my dear friends that ye who have kept your habitation in the light of the lord and whose eye is single therein have a clear sight and understanding that the spirit which has thus wrought and fought against the truth is not nor can be of god but is of the wicked one and although the fruits it has brought forth through the agents and instruments in and by which it has wrought viz making disturbances in meetings to the breaking the churches peace causing divisions amongst friends publishing to the world most wicked malicious railing and scandalous books against friend an effect of the greatest enmity shutting an keeping friends out of their common meeting houses in which they have a just right and property and not suffering them to meet therein which is a part of the persecution inflicted on friends by the world and at length also set up separate meetings in opposition to the meetings of gods people although i say these fruits are sufficient o themselves to discover and manifest to an unclouded mind what spirit that is and mus needs be which has brought them forth ye inasmuch as some partly through weakness o judgment and partly through personal affection to some of those leading separatists are yet in danger to be betrayed by their fair words and feigned speeches wherewith they lie in wait to deceive   for friends in the holy fear of the living god and in the openings of the spring of his pure life in my soul at this time and from the certain knowledge and clear demonstration which i have received from him therein i testify and declare unto you that this spirit which in this day has run out and has drawn out some into opposition against the way and work of the lord into division and separation from the people of the lord and from the holy assemblies which the lord has gathered and by his powerful presence has owned and daily does own this spirit i say is the same with that which has formerly wrought in other appearances against the truth in our time and is the same with that spirit that wrought against the work of the lord in the days of the holy apostles this mystery of iniquity then wrought and caused many to turn aside and to leave the right way of the lord and to forsake the assemblies of gods people heb  0    yea and to run into separation too jude    upon whom the holy ghost has set his brand that they were sensual having not the spirit and many close and sharp testimonies did the lord give forth through his servants in that day against this spirit and against those that were joined to it  yea friends this spirit that has led some now to set up their separate meetings is the same that led jeroboam the son of nebat to set up his separate altar at bethel of which you may read   kings    and    chapters he was afraid that if the people should continue to go up to the house of the lord to do sacrifice there as they had been accustomed to do and as the lord had required they would then forsake him and return to the lord again and this spirit now is afraid that if they whom he has seduced and drawn aside should still frequent the assemblies of gods people and continue to meet with friends as before that heavenly power which is eminently manifest in the meetings of gods people might at one time or other reach unto them touch their hearts open the right eye in them and give them to see the mischief and misery he is leading them into and therefore to prevent this and to keep his captives close unto him he has contrived to set up separate meetings in opposition to the meetings of gods appointment as jeroboam set up his separate altar in opposition to the altar which god has commanded to be set up and to keep the people from going thereto and so subtly did this spirit work then as well as now that jeroboam contrived to have his false worship bear some resemblance to the true that he might the more easily beguile the people for he ordained a feast like unto the feast that was in judah   kings       but it was in the month which he had devised of his own heart ver    mark that there is a blot upon it how fair or specious soever the worship he set up appeared or seemed to be yet it was but the devise of his own heart it was neither appointed by god nor accepted of god for you may read in the   th chapter that the lord sent a prophet a man of god out of judah to bethel and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and prophesied the destruction thereof by josiah which was afterward outwardly fulfilled as you may read   kings       etc now josiah signifies the fire or burning of the lord and in the holy dread of the living eternal god i declare the fire of the lord is kindled and kindling against this accursed separating spirit and against its work and against all those that join with it therein therefore all fear before the mighty god and stand still and consider your ways and let none resist or reject the warning of the lord lest such be hardened to destruction for jeroboam you may read stood by his separate altar verse   and when he heard the saying of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel he put forth his hand saying lay hold on him but his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him verse   o friends consider how has dryness and withering come upon many a great and stout one in this day who have lifted up themselves against devices of their own hearts to establish themselves in their own way against the way of the lord so that the hand they have put forth in that work they could not pull in again now mind i pray you friends and observe the way of the working of this spirit in that day here was the enmity the rough nature of cain and esau the spirit of persecution got up first in jeroboam to dismay the man of god lay hold of him says he but when he saw that would not do then the subtle serpent the crafty fox the fair speeches the smooth words the seeming friendship and show of kindness to betray him come home with me says he to the man of god and refresh thy self and i will give thee a reward verse   o friends stand in the fear and counsel of the lord and in the dominion of his power over this wicked spirit in all its twistings and twinings let neither the frowns nor the fawnings the threats nor the flatteries the hard speeches nor the oily words the pharisaical friendship the dissembling love the seeming kindness the familiar carriage the free entertainment the fine bit the offer of advantages etc have any influence upon you to draw you in the least measure to join or touch with gods enemy with him that sets up a separate altar a separate meeting in opposition to and to draw or keep from the right way of the lord mind well the answer which the man of god gave to jeroboams tempting invitation if thou will give me half thine house i ill not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor rink water in this place ver   this was where he separate altar was set up and he gives  forcible reason for it for so it was charged  by the word of the lord verse    here now you see both the charge of the lord and the good resolution of the man of god i will not go in with thee who have reolted from god neither will i eat or drink in is place where an ensign of separation and opposition to the way of god is set up conder this well i warn you all in whom there  yet any true breathings after the living god ho retain any tenderness and in whom there  any simplicity left consider this well i say hen thy pretended friend or friends in a eat deal of seeming love and kindness shall vite thee to partake with them at their separe altar to sit down with them in their serate meeting thou can not be a man of od and go in with them or eat or drink in at place thou can not sit down there to ait for the bread of life or the water of ife to be given thee there no the word of e lord if thou give heed unto it will arge thee otherwise therefore to that pure ing word let every mind be turned and ereto kept in a diligent waiting to receive wisdom strength and power from the lord erein that none may be betrayed by the btilty of the the enemy with whatsoever ir pretenses he may come for remember bethel t place where the separate altar was set up lo his outward life therefore ver    and   and if thou shall presume to go in to eat o to drink spiritually that is to join in worshi with the sons of nebat at this day in the sparate meetings which any of them have s up in opposition to the assemblies of god people and to the blessed way and work  the lord how know thou but thou may  for ever lose thy spiritual life and never kno a day of quickening more  therefore all friends watch against eve temptation thereunto as you love your liv as you regard the good and eternal welfare  your souls and let not the name nor pers of any man have power over you to dra you aside neither let numbers sway with yo in which i know these adversaries of tru do not a little boast though blessed be g with little reason but remember that jeboam of old had ten tribes out of twelve  cry up his separate altar notwithstandi which he is branded to posterity in the h record with this brand jeroboam the son nebat who made israel to s   kings       therefore let not any foll a multitude to do evil exodus      but  follow that which is good both among your selv and to all men   thessalonians      for friends y know whither the broad way leads and w it is the wide gate opens into which  many go in at but keep ye to the straight gate and walk ye on in the narrow way for in it is safety and at the end of it everlasting happiness  but friends because of the straightness of this gate and the narrowness of this way some that have attempted to walk in it are grown weary of it and have sought out another way a way which  jeroboam like they have devised of their own hearts wherein they may have more room more scope more company ease in the flesh liberty to the flesh and all without control and this i am satisfied has not been the least motive to the separation in this day as it was the greatest in days past though some that have been drawn into it may not perhaps see the ground upon which it was undertaken but the lord has opened an eye in many which sees the rise and ground entrance and end of this libertine spirit and its work and this eye will the lord daily open more and more in all that diligently and in sincerity wait upon him therefore all friends every where who have not yet a clear sight and a through understanding of the nature and work design and drift of this dividing spirit wait i beseech you in simplicity of heart and lowliness of mind upon the lord and keep to the measure of the grace you have received from him and suffer not your minds to be swayed or biased by any personal kindness natural affection relation kindred or acquaintance but stand single and  and you my dear friends whose spirits the lord has stirred up and whose hearts he has engaged in an holy zeal to stand up for his blessed name and truth and to bear a faithful testimony against this wicked rending spirit go on in the strength and power of the lord in the might of the god of jacob for you are assuredly on the lords side and the lord jehovah the strength of israel is on your side therefore friends be encouraged in the lord to stand steadfast in your testimony not giving way to the enemy no not for a moment and take heed i beseech you in the love of god how ye enter into any treaty of peace or terms of agreement with this ungodly treacherous spirit which is out of the truth and draws out of the truth and fights against the truth for there is no peace unto it says my god and they who have etc and to burn up the ground from whence they sprang for a flaming sword has the lord god set in his eden which turns every way and none that are gone out can ever come in again but they must pass under the flaming edge thereof therefore my dear friends stand your ground in the authority of the heavenly life and tamper not with gods enemies remember the word of the lord to the prophet let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them jer       and then what follows i will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee says the lord ver  0 so the god of life fill your hearts daily more and more with a phineas zeal for the honor of his name and furnish you abundantly with wisdom and counsel with boldness and courage with strength and power to encounter and overcome the enemy and make every one more watchful against the spirit of the world to  your faithful friend in the love and service of the unchangeable truth thomas ellwood the    th of the   d month         decades but lived retired till the year      in which time of privacy as fittest for it he began a work which he did not finish till many years after and that was the life of david king of israel in verse which he began for his own diversion not thinking then of printing it and carried it on to the end of the third book but then the prince of orange landing and the revolution following the nation being in arms against king james the noise of guns and sound of drums etc so desturbed his meditation and gentle muse which like the halcion breeds in calm weather that his poetical genius left him for a time and he thereupon left his work for above twenty years of which more hereafter in its place  and here he retired again for two years so that i find nothing to remark of him either public or private but some private letters john raunce and charles harris of wiccomb in that county publishing a memorial as they called it for the present generation and also for that which is to come being an account from wiccomb concerning the difference etc this thomas ellwood answered in a book entitled the account from wiccomb  lately published by john raunce and charles harris examined and found false and a warning thereof given to all such wellmeaning persona among the people called quakers as through personal affection want of consideration or weakness of judgment have been betrayed or may be in danger to be betrayed by them or any other in the same dividing spirit with them and led aside from the way of truth into a separation from the people of god for whose recovery and preservation this is written which begins thus  for your sakes it is o ye much pitied ones more than for any weight in the account it self or worth in the authors of it that i have thus taken notice of it for indeed as soon as i had perused it i felt a compassionate concern spring in my heart on your behalfs and a direction in spirit to open some passages therein and relating thereto to you that ye might be preserved from being taken or if in any measure taken might be rescued and delivered from the snare which the enemy of your souls and of all righteousness has made use of these men to set to entangle entrap and catch you by and to the true witness of the holy god in wherein he discovered their deceit as to their separation and that it was not for conscience but from a libertine spirit to lay waste the good order in the church as their actions manifested of which he gave some instances not to their advantage but their works have made them manifest  a reply to an answer lately published to a book long since written by w penn entitled a brief examination and state of liberty spiritual both with respect to persons in their private capacity and in their church society and conversation which book was written or at least published by w penn in the year      to distinguish between true and false liberty little understood by some and too frequently abused by others liberty from sin not to sin to do his gods will and not our own as w p expresses it which true spiritual liberty being abused by some in the profession of the truth as our friend t e observes in his preface who under pretense of being left to that liberty in themselves and to their own freedom therein both took liberty to do such things as were inconsistent with that true liberty and with the principle of truth which they professed and despising those useful good and necessary helps and means which what have thou to do with me leave me to my own freedom to reclaim if it might be those who are thus deceived and prevent others from being so the author being pressed in spirit for zions sake and for the peace of jerusalem and having a deep sense as himself expresses of the working of the enemy of zions peace to rend and divide the heritage of god did write the forementioned treatise for the establishment of the faithful information of the simplehearted and reproof of the arrogant and highminded which striking at the false liberty and preences of the separate party it seems it had ain on their stomachs undigested these ten years and then came forth an answer to it by j h supposed to be john hog one of the searates about hull this answer our friend t ellwood undertakes and replies to in a pretty arge book in which he shows what is meant y true spiritual liberty in w ps own defiition which he defends shows their abuse f it answers their arguments or rather cails against it in behalf of their false libertine spirit and practices which too many ran into  their own hurt and separation from the preface the god of truth knows i have no other end in this reply than to defend truth and the children of it against the slanderous suggestions false charges and wicked insinuation of the adversaries to lay open their deceitful dealing and to remove as the lord shall enable me the stumbling blocks which they have laid in the way of the weak whereby they have caused some to fall into misapprehensions and hard thoughts of friends without cause and i beseech the god of mercy to open the understandings and clear the sight of all those whose simplicity has been betrayed by the others subtilty that they may see and escape the enemies snares and return to the true fold from which they have been led astray to which i never heard of any rejoinder only some private letters past between j h and t e about some passages in it  viz t es answer to so much of leonard key s late printed sheet as relates to him which paper of l ks was intended mostly to excuse their shutting friends out of their meeting house at reading but therein taking occasion to slant at some passages in t es answer to the account from wiccomb gave our friend thomas an occasion not only to open that matter further but also to lay open their deceit in relation to that affair as well as l ks and his party at reading to which i refer the reader  viz deceit discovered and malice manifested in l key s late paper from reading thomas being then at london at the yearly meeting met with b coals expedients for a true reconciliation among the people of god called quakers which l k it seems promoted but when t e came home he found a letter at his house directed to him from l k with a printed sheet enclosed so different in terms and tendency from the other signed by b c and c h that proposing expedients for peace this renewing the difference and yet but one day different in the dates this being dated the  d the other the  th of the  th month      that he could not but admire at it which therefore he compares and shows the difference of and discovers their deceit in and not only in that but also in relation to the difference at wiccomb which they were not yet easy under and yet would not confess the truth but instead thereof j raunce endeavors to fix a slander on t ellwood about his fathers burial pretending he was not buried in the right ground but among strangers he and his party riding twenty miles or more about the country and j r going himself to the place where he was buried at holton to pick up a stone at the fathers grave to throw at the son above seven years after his death enquiring examining yea provoking some to pretend as if t e had been unkind to his father and that they had showed thomas under obligation of requital or upbraid him for ingratitude if he did not in all which j rs malice was manifest more than any thing else for as to the ground he was buried in t e confesses he was not so well acquainted with the graveyard as to know the difference of places in it or whether some parts of it be more holy than others which he thinks considering their former principles they should not have quarreled with him about however the place was not of his appointing for he was prevented of being at the burial by a message his father received in his sickness that his sister but which of them he does not say lay then sick in london near unto death after he had waited on his father until he had finished his life and given direction for his interrment he hastened up to his sister at london thinking he might be more serviceable to the living than to the dead and knew not in what part of the ground his father was buried till after his return from london he went thither to defray the charges of his sickness and funeral as some of them knew and therefore the more shame to raise such a story and as to the other of unkindness they could prove nothing but show their envy against him which we shall have occasion to take further notice of ere we have done  the next and last book he writ in relation to this controversy with the separates was a fair examination of a foul paper called observations and reflections etc lately published by john and leonard key who after their separate bickerings come now to join their forces together in this paper which seems to be reflections on t es last mentioned paper and which paper of theirs our friend answers in this examination wherein their envy is rebuked and their folly and falsehood laid open in endeavoring to excuse l ks former paper of revival of the difference at the same time when b cs expedient for reconciliation was for having it all forgotten and buried which t e exposes in its proper colors beginning thus we read among the proverbs of solomon that the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble prove      this is verified in j raunce and l key and others of their separate party since their turning against the truth their way is become as darkness they stumble and know not at what they fall into many idle absurdities many gross follies and errors and into many hurtful evils and labor to draw others better than themselves after them for whose sake chiefly the following lines are written that the deceit and hypocrisy of these men their falsehood and envy being further and further laid open the more simple and wellmeaning ones amongst them may see them as they are and be no longer beguiled by them so he goes on to answer their cavils confirming by certificate his former charge of their scandalous practice at wiccomb then answers their new slander the old proving false that he suffered his father to want raking into his ash when he had been dead above ten years to ca something at his son so restless is envy as if h had been short in his duty to his father which t e fairly and clearly wipes off vindicating himself as to his not being at his fathers burial which j r throws at him though thoma in his last had fairly related the occasion which was his sisters ilness at london though she recovered and which one would think might have satisfied any one not overgrown with envy which yet j r revives again and also about his burial etc all which appears to be nothing but j rs rancor which seeing he has made so much ado about out of his inveterate malice to t e under pretense of friendship to his father but to be sure hatred to the son and as t e says if this be the effect of his friendship he should not desire to be numbered among his friends to set which in a clear light i shall here set down his vindication in his own words because it bears some analogy to his relation of the former part of his life viz page  0 of the fair examination it is well known to many that my father was possessed of a good estate and they that knew him well knew also that he had the spending of it himself how he spent it becomes not me to speak he was my father to whom i owed and always paid respect and honor while living and whose frailty being dead i desire to cover it is enough for me to say i did not help him spend his estate nor was  though upon his marriage he promised both him and his intended wife to do something considerable for them yet after they were married he refused to give them any thing as aforesaid p     and so far withdrew himself that he would not let him know where he lodged   notwithstanding this says t e he would sometimes come to my house which was always open and free to him to come when he pleased and to tarry as long as he pleased whenever he came he was well habitted both for linen and woolen and made no appearance of want other than such as may befall any man to have his money fall short in a journey upon which occasion when he had as he said been longer from home than he expected or when being here he had a mind to go further than at his coming forth he intended he  this i hope will satisfy the reader of t es carriage toward his father which we are beholding to j r for or else perhaps might never have had this account which one would think envy it self should not be able to cavil at yet after this j r being restless trumpt up another story answered by t e in his postscript to that book which we shall meet with again hereafter on another occasion and therefore i shall say no more of it here  here ends his controversy with the separates in which i must needs say he acquitted himself g fox dying n the eleventh month    0 and leaving beind him an excellent journal of his travels and sufferings our friend t e as no body fiter about this time was at the pains of trancribing it and fitting it for the press a laboious work which was printed next year in  large folio to which t e prefixed a notale account concerning him which is the only ingle testimony printed with it except his wifes m fs and an excellent preface by w penn  george keith who had known better things than most oppoers that ever rose up against truth and friends aving been a quaker and a preacher among them near thirty years and had writ many books in vindication of truth and friends but ow falling out and differing with some of his brethren in pennsylvania whither he went some years before because he could not have his own way in every thing came over with some of his party full fraught with contention against the yearly meeting      which difference coming before the meeting by some letters from beond sea which were read in course in the meeting whereupon g k desired to be heard which after the other business of the meeting was over friends condescended to for several days to hear him and his party and s jenings etc on the other side in hopes to have econciled the difference before it went any further hos     said wh i would have healed israel then the iniquity of phraim was discovered etc which may be applie to him for the more endeavors were used  reconcile him to his brethren the more his dceit appeared and the more tenderness an showed toward him the more perverse he wa in turning it to a wrong use and strengtening himself in his opposition there was  holding what would away as the proverb is resolved he was for a breach by opposin friends more and more till he ran himself qui out from among them which our friend t  observing the bent and tendency of not only i the yearly meeting but after and how he edeavoured to make divisions among friends  divide the heritage of god he took up  pen again and writ an excellent epistle  friends briefly commemorating the gracious deaings of the lord with them and warning them  beware of that spirit of contention and divisio which has appeared of late in george keith  which he addresses to friends thus  dear friends whom the lord has calle with an holy calling and who through faithfulness to the heavenly call are becom the chosen of the lord it is in my hear in the openings of the love of god to se these few lines amongst you as a salutatio of true and hearty love unto you and in the tendering sense of the lords unspeakab goodness unto us which at this time rest with an affecting weight upon my spirit which he commemorates as follows  great and manifold have been the mercies of our god unto his people in this his day and his loving kindnesses are beyond expressing when we were young and little his fatherly care was over us he preserved us and nourished us and caused us to grow up before him how did he carry his lambs in his bosom when the beasts of prey roared on every side seeking to devour who can rehearse the many deliverances he has wrought for his people in their passage from spiritual egypt how has he girded their loins with strength and covered their heads in the day of battle how has he subdued their enemies before them and put to flight the armies of aliens how has he fed them with bread from heaven and made them to suck honey out of the rock yea he has caused the rock to give forth water abundantly and has been to his people as a brook in the way and the shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land so that from a sencible experience we can say to his praise our bread has been sure and our water has not failed as we have singly relied on him oh his goodness is unutterable and his faithfulness has never failed them that have trusted in him when have we ever been in prison for his sake and he has not visited and comforted us there what sufferings have any undergone on his account and he touch not mine anointed an do my prophets no harm in all our exercises h has been with us and he has stood by us i our sorest trials yea he has caused his angel to encamp round about us so that no weapon formed against us has prospered but every tongue that has risen up against us the lord has given us power to condemn blessed be his holy name and exalted and magnified be his glorious power for ever  these things and much more than i can write i doubt not but ye my dear friends are witnesses of ye especially my elder brethren who were called early in the morning of this day and have stood faithful in your testimony for god until now who from your own both early and late experiences can set your seals to the truth hereof and unto you i do believe this brief commemoration of the goodness and loving kindness of the lord to his people will be pleasing and delightful as i hope it may prove useful and profitable unto us all in the stirring up of the pure mind and putting us in fresh remembrance of the lords manifold favors toward us and gracious dealings with us which should be as a renewed engagement upon us to cleave fast unto the lord and in humility of heart to walk closely with him both that we may as far as in us lies answer his great loving kindness  for friends ye know we have a restless adversary to watch against and to war with one that sometimes walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and sometimes creeps about as a subtle serpent seeking whom he may betray whom in each appearance it is our duty and interest to resist steadfast in the faith which overcomes i need not recount unto you my friends the many winds and floods storms and tempests of open and cruel persecutions which this roaring adversary has often raised and and caused to beat upon us to have driven us if possible from off our foundation ye cannot have forgotten it nor that noble arm of the lord which was made bare for our preservation and by preserving us against the most furious shocks gave evidence even to the world that we are that people whose house is founded and built upon the immovable rock christ jesus at this sort of fighting the enemy has been foiled which has made him shift his hand and like a cunning hunter spread his nets set his snares lay his baits to catch the simple and unwary ones thus wrought this subtle enemy in the early jews and gentiles to fall with violent and bloody hands upon the little flock of christ and sometimes in the intermissions of those storms covering his hooks with the taking baits of pleasure profit and preferment catch some perhaps of those that had withstood the strongest storm of outward persecution and made them instruments for himself to work by to betray others such was diotrephes of old whose aspiring mind loving and seeking praeeminence labored to make a schism in the church prating against even the elders thereof with malicious words etc   john    0 what mischief the wicked one has wrought in our day by such ambitious spirits i need not recount nor is it pleasing to me to remember ye know it to your grief as well as i but this in all such cases is observable that such as have made disturbances in the church and have run into divisions and separations from friends have framed to themselves some specious pretense or other as the inducement to their undertaking which they have industriously spread abroad and varnished over with the fairest colors they could to allure and draw others to join with them etc  this with much more to the same purpose which might be cited i thought meet to mention of the mercies of the lord to his people and preservation of them from the beginning well worth the reading then recounting the g keith yet to show the difference between the former and this and consequently the confusion of their pretenses theirs relating to discipline this to doctrine they alleged that friends were gone too much from the inward to the outward this that friends were gone too much from the outward to the inward etc for our adversaries seldom agree in their charges and so he goes on to examine and compare his books published beyond sea with those he writ here as to the ground of the difference and separation which he lays at his door manifesting his deceitful pretenses falacies and selfcontradictions answering his cavils and confuting his calumnies that none might be deceived by him concluding by way of application and warning to friends to beware of the enemies wiles which i doubt not had a good effect as to many in preserving them out of the enemies snare who were in danger of being staggered by him  when our friend t ellwood had written this epistle he went up to london with it and presented it to the seconddays morningmeeting where such books and writings of friends as are intended for the press use to be read and g keith pretended that it was printed in great disunity and against the mind of many friends as though it was only approved and promoted by a party etc which i mention to show that he stuck at nothing to make good his part  against this book of t es g k made a heavy complaint to friends to have it called in as very injurious to him to his cause to be sure poor man who had writ so many books against friends after he had writ so many for them and would not take friends advice himself and how then could he expect they should answer him so that his complaint and clamor not prevailing to stifle it he takes another way first putting out a sheet against it called a loving epistle but envious enough in which he charged t e with fifty pervertions etc which he said he had noted in his book but left his proofs behind to come after the first by post as the proverb is the second by tom long the carrier in another book which he threatened to publish if t es was not called in and disowned which not prevailing neither some weeks after he sent forth his threatened book miscalled a seasonable information etc but very unseasonable for himself as to his reconciliation with friends which he pretended he had rather lay down his natural life or have his t es epistle and to contain his proofs such as they were of the charge he had published before to both these our friend t ellwood replied this year      in a book entitled a further discovery of that spirit of contention and division which has appeared of late in george keith etc wherein his cavils are answered his falsehood is laid open and the guilt and blame of the breach and separation in america etc are fixed faster on him written by way of epistle as the former was and recommended as a farther warning to friends which begins thus  dear friends who have received the truth in the love of it and have kept your habitation therein unto whom the truth is exceeding precious and who desire the prosperity thereof above all things unto you is the salutation of my endeared love in this blessed truth in which the fellowship of the faithful stands in this it is i desire to know you to be known by you and to have fellowship with you earnestly breathing to the god of truth the father of spirits that he would be pleased to pour forth more abundantly of his good spirit into all our hearts and fill us with the blessed fruits thereof that there may be no room for the enemy to enter to break this holy fellowship but that all who profess to believe in the light may so walk therein that a clear sight they may briefly to commemorate the gracious dealings of the lord with his people and as in a general way to remind you of the many attempts the enemy has made by force and fraud to hinder the work of god from going on so more particularly to warn you to beware of that spirit of contention and division which has appeared of late in george keith and some few others that join with him who have made a separation from friends in some parts of america in writing that epistle i did not consult flesh and blood neither had i an eye to my own ease and quit as outwardly for i had no reason to expect rest from so restless a man nor fair treatment from one who in his late writings and personal debates has so notoriously let loose his pen and tongue to an unbridled liberty of railing and reviling but i cleared my conscience in discharging my duty to god and to his church and  and so he proceeds to clear himself of the perversions etc which g k charged him with and answers all his cavils against his book manifesting his deceit evasions and sophistry so effectually that i do not find that g keith ever replied to it being answered home and having his belly full i suppose of the controversy with t ellwood for though our friend thomas answered several other of g keiths books afterward of which hereafter he never replied to any of them which shows he had enough of it  at the end of this book of g keiths j raunce came forth again with a new slander against t e all his old ones being bafled as if his father had not been buried decently which however false g ks mean mind it seems could not resist j r s slight offer to take off an hundred of his books but rather glad of any help to run down his opponent if he could with slander which he found he could not do with arguments but had g k been a man of any worthiness says t e or his cause defensible he would not though an adversary have suffered j r to have clapped on his abusive piece at the end of his book to throw dirt at his opponent and had j r been a manly adversary he would have scorned to have crept in at the tail of anothers book to renew his slander no way relating to the subject of the book when t es fair examination had lain a twelvemonth at his door unanswered but to creep behind such g k was taken to be j r perhaps might count it no disgrace to repeat his slander which t e had answered in his postscript to the fair examination and for a final stroke to it he produces certificates from those who were concerned about his father at the time of his death and interrment that he was decently buried as usual which may be seen at the end of this book in reply to g k and there is an end of all those lying stories raised concerning the dead to asperse the living to the shame and confusion of all the inventors and fomentors of them the man was dead and in his grave and there should have rested without envy or detraction and i am only sorry he seemed to retain his aversion to his son for the truths sake which he received in his early days to the honor of which i attribute it that he was preserved and carried through and over all opposition and lived in reputation and renown to his dying day  his next book is in      entitled truth defended and the friends thereof cleared from the false charges foul reproaches and envious cavils cast upon it and them by george keith an apostate from them in two books by him lately published one called a true copy of a paper delivered into the yearly meeting etc the other the pretended yearlymeetings nameless bull of excommunication etc in which last g k gives an account of his coming to the yearly meeting      and of his entertainment in it when admitted as if he had never been there viz that he was allowed to sit at the great square table among the ministers and commissioners as he calls them that could hold about it either fully or near double to the number of twenty four whether by allusion to the twenty four seats and elders mentioned rev   but doubling the number he does not determine adding i think it suits not their crying out so much as they were wont against chief seats in the synagogues to erect such a stately fabric in their meeting house at that time little differing from the manner of a throne but that it is low upon the floor covered with green cloth all which only serves to show his own pageantry and which our friend t ellwood corrects him for according to his deserts for the table will hold few more than twenty four or twenty eight at most and only necessary to lay books and papers on to write  in the beginning of this book our friend t e resumes the controversy from the beginning shows the rise of the difference and proceedings thereupon in relation to george keith particularly after his coming into england in the beginning of      and how he came to be disowned by the yearly meeting in      for his rejecting the advice of the former and opposite carriage thereunto which being so excellent to the matter in hand and setting the controversy in a clear light i shall here insert it which begins thus  it is an old observation that none prove more angry and implacable enemies to any society of people than those that for their tim        pet     john      etc   john   etc jude verse   among those in this age whom satan has drawn to this degree of malice and madness george keith a scotchman is the latest but not the least whether with respect to his anger or his envy he having been bred a scholar before he came amongst the people called quakers and having acquired more of schoollearning than most it may be in his own opinion than any of that people have has given in himself a demonstrative proof of the apostles proposition   cor     knowledge puffs up where edifying chais not joined with it for humane knowledge is apt of it self to lift up mens minds that have or think they have it in any degree of eminency and makes them think better of themselves than of others or than themselves deserve whereas true charity uses knowledge to instruct and thereby builds up not to puzzle and confound and thereby destroy america among a plain people who better understood the plain and simple truth than the nice distinctions and subtilties of the schools and there advanced to the office of a schoolmaster with a standing sallary as i have been informed of an hundred and twenty pounds by the year he soon began like diotrephes of old   john    0 to affect praeeminence in the church and nothing less would serve his turn than to rule and overruled all and that he might not want matter to work upon and some pretense to begin on he not only found fault with friends ministry and discipline there but having in private discourses put some captious and ensnaring questions to some particular persons there whose simplicity he thought he might most easily betray he by wresting their answers to a wrong sense took advantage to complain against them for holding as he said gross and vile errors and with impetuous heat prosecuted his charge and not being so fully nor speedily answered as he expected by those friends to whom he complained who seeing the innocence of the accused and his evil design in accusing could not countenance him therein he involved them also in the like charge of cloaking or covering gross and vile errors damnable heresies and doctrines of devils america but in these of europ also these things drew friends there afte much patience and long forbearance to dea with him in a church way and to give forth at length a testimony against him which proving uneasy to him he came over from thence to england about the beginning of the the year      of which some friends o pennsylvania having notice came over also and at the yearly meeting of the people called quakers holden at london in the  th mon that year the matters relating to that difference being fully heard and considered the sense of that meeting was that the separation lay at g k s door and that he had done ill in printing and publishing those differences as he had done and the advice of the meeting to him thereupon was to call in those books of his or publish something innocently and effectually to clear the body of the people called quakers and their ministers from those gross errors charged on some few in america and retract the bitter language in them so far as he was concerned and sincerely to use his utmost endeavors with his friends concerned to remove the separation etc which sense and advice being drawn up at large in writing was then in that meeting delivered to him and soon after printed by one of his party with very envious reflections upon it as may be seen in a small pamphlet called a true account etc to which i refer but so far was g k from regarding the sense or following the advice of that yearly meeting that in several printed books by him soon after published he rejected it denying it to be the sense or advice of the yearly meeting or that to be the yearly meeting that gave it which abuse this last yearly meeting in the  d month past taking notice of and upon further dealing with him finding him instead of being humbled and sorry for the evil he had done more hardened therein justifying himself both by word and writing and rejecting the meetings advice that meeting after it had heard him patiently till he of his own accord withdrew gave forth a testimony against him which he has since printed with his answer thereunto as he has also in another pamphlet a copy of his paper which he read in the meeting together with a narrative of his own making of the proceedings of the meeting with him and a list of errors charged by him on some particular persons to each  this i thought fit to insert being so materia as to the ground of the controversy with  keith after which t e proceeds to answe all his cavils in his said two books or papers and shows that by his disorderly practices h had excluded himself from our society before friends disowned him so leaving him without excuse and the weight of his iniquity upon hi own head which he could never get from under but waxed worse and worse as evil me and seducers use to do so that truth was se over his head and friends were clear of him  gerard croese a dutchman publishing a general history so called of the quakers containing the lives tenets sufferings trials speeches and letters as pretended of the most eminent of them first in latin which was translated and printed in english in the year      wherein though he had represented some things pretty fairly yet in others through inadvertancy or ignorance i hope not wilfully he had misrepresented us and our principles and practices whereupon our friend t ellwood according to an advertisement at the end of the said history in english that some remarks on it would be published he writ some remarks latin perhaps before the english came out which would no doubt have been turned into english intending doubtless to publish em but in the mean time before they were finished a book of the same nature and to the same purpose in latin was published in holland by way of remarks or observations on the said history which seemed again to circumvent him in his intended remarks on it so that he laid em by and never finished them and so the world was deprived of this piece also  but now g keith being gone out from the fellowship of the faithful and hardened in his enmity against friends he arrived to the top or height of opposition he had been playing small stakes hitherto but now came to throw all at once in order to which he erected a stage of contention at turnershall in philpotlane london where he had held separate meetings for some time before to oppose friends in general under pretense of discovering diverse errors out of the quakers books that were never in them and published an advertisement of a meeting he intended to hold there in the   th month      to discover the quakers errors though he had been one so long himself and vindicated them as to all that any could object against and yet now came to accuse them himself but friends slighted him not thinking it worth their while to follow him or dance after his pipe to turnershall of which contentious meeting he afterward published a narrative which our friend t e answered this year in an answer to george keith s narrative of his proceedings at turnershall etc wherein his charges against diverse of the people called quakers  in that and another book of his called gross errors etc are fairly considered examined and refuted and he made his title good in a close answer and entire confutation of all his cavils against our friends books which because i have given the preambles or introductions of his former to illustrate the matter i shall also in like manner introduce this with his general account of the controversy by way of introduction to his answer being so pertinent to the case in hand for the readers better information and satisfaction which follows beginning thus  it is not surely without good reason that the church of christ here on earth is called the church militant for besides the inward and spiritual enemies which her several members have to encounter with in their pilgrimage through this troublesome world such has been and is her lot and portion that she has rarely been free from outward enemies of one kind or other her great adversary satan continually raising up some evil instruments or other to fall upon her all aiming at her ruin though after diverse ways and manners sometimes the civil powers under which she has lived have been stirred up to proclaim as it were open war against her and to inflict severe and heavy penalties upon her for her faithful adherence persecution against her of another kind by instigating some or other either such as were always avowed enemies to her or such as for sometime appeared to be of her but by the sweep of his tail had been struck off from her to speak or write against her falsely to accuse her and load her with the foulest reproaches and most infamous slanders and scandals that by so misrepresenting her they might hinder others from joining to or favoring her and stir up the civil magistrate again to persecute her afresh this has been the lot this the condition of the little flock of christ in former ages as ecclesiastical histories declare as for the present age and with respect to the people called quakers whom god by an invisible arm of power has raised up and held up and made a peculiar people to himself experience gives sufficient proof the matter being yet fresh in memory for not to look back so far as that which was called the commonwealths time wherein many of the leading men in most professions put forth their utmost strength against us both in preaching and printing raising those false reports concerning doctrine and practice which others of our adversaries that followed after have taken up upon trust from them no sooner was that great persecution a little abated which soon after the restoration of k charles the second through the fault of some dissenters fell upon all but most heavily upon us and that a little calm and quiet ensued but out came several books against us written by some of those professors who either in some measure did suffer or if they had been faithful to their own principle should have suffered in the same storm with us by that time the dust which those books had raised was laid by our answers thereunto a fresh persecution from the government arose upon the informing act the main weight of which it is well known fell upon us they who before and afterward assaulted us in print finding ways then to hide and save themselves from suffering but when that storm was a little over out they came again and in diverse books written by faldo hicks and others heaped up many wrong charges defamations slanders and false accusations against us all which were refuted and wiped off in our books printed in answer thereunto nor have those of other professions been so forward to attack us since but now that liberty of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship is by authority granted and thereby outward sufferings in a great new war against us by stirring up some who have formerly walked with us and for some time professed to be of us but upon some peevish discontent or other have turned aside and left us to turn now against us and oppose us and to pour forth floods of reproach slanders and false accusations upon us his chief agent at present in this work is george keith a scotchman whose ambitious aims not being answered nor his absurd and fantastical notions received by and amongst the people called quakers he is now become of a seeming friend a real enemy he having published many books against us and in defense of those books wrangled with us for a while in print till he found himself too closely pinched to be able to give an answer fit to be seen in print has at length bethought himself of a wile to excuse himself from answering which was to set up a kind of judicial court of his own head and by his own authority in a place at his own command on a day of his own appointing there to charge and try diverse of us who are called quakers whether present or absent concerning matters of faith and doctrine and that the rude multitude might not be wanting to his assistance there he gave public notice of it some time before by an advertisement in print and therein a sort of summons to some of us by name to others arbitrary proceeding and usurped authority as we judged it unreasonable in him to impose so we did not think fit to submit to or own and therefore forbore to appear at the time and place by him appointed yet lest any whom he should draw thither might mistake the cause of our not appearing the reasons thereof drawn up in short heads were sent thither to be read and given among the people which they were however according to his before declared intention to proceed whether any of us were there or no he being judge in his own court overruled our reasons and went on to arraign and convict us absent the pageantry of which days work as acted there by himself he has since published with his name to it under the title of an exact narrative of the proceedings at turners hall etc together with the disputes and speeches there between g keith and other quakers differing from him in some religious principles how idle is this in him to pretend in his title to give an account of disputes and speeches between him and other quakers when as his narrative it self gives no account of any dispute there nor any thing like it and of that little that was said by any of those few quakers that were present most was to the people tending to show them the unreasonableness of his undertaking and desiring them to reserve one ear for the other side very little of it to him  g ks falshood in calling it an exact narrative and yet not inserting the reasons why our friends did not appear which he confesses were read and his falacies in evading them which therefore t e sets down obviates g ks quibbles on them so proceeds to answer his narrative clearing the quotations he brought out of our friends books from his perversions being either unfairly or falsely quoted or perverted in their sense to what they never intended according to his carping and caviling way vindicating the soundness of their doctrine showing g ks selfcontradictions in opposing what he had so often vindicated as orthodox and yet pretending to hold the same doctrines and principles still and laying open his deceit falsehood and prevarications so plainly and effectually that g k never replied to it and good reason why because he could not to the purpose being answered home and defeated in all his vile pretenses envious cavils and false accusations  but being pinched and driven to a nonplus by quotations out of his own books in favor of what he opposed which he could not answer wherein he had asserted or defended the same doctrines and principles in as plain or higher words which he now blamed friends for as gross errors etc which yet he would not allow to be so in himself but paliated them under the soft term of mistakes saying narrative p    i know not any fundamental principle nor indeed any one principle of christian faith that i have varied from to this day ever since i came among the quakers which is about thirty three years ago  and in his preface to his nar p   he says the things he does not call them errors nor hardly ever uses the word error with respect to himself and his own writings  that need correction in my books compared with the vile errors in theirs are but as my motes to their beams  nor are they such things as oppose any christian principles of faith but of an inferior nature and yet they were as full in the points as any he could cite out of ours and in the true copy of a paper printed      where in p    he faintly intimates a purpose to publish some short explication etc  of some words and passages in his former books he adds for upon a review of my former books  i freely acknowledge i have found some passages and words that not only need some farther explanation but even in some part an emendation and correction how gently does he touch himself says t e how softly does he handle his own sores not a syllable of errors or heresy there no the hardest word he can afford to give them is his former mistakes and lest the reader should extend them too far he explains it in the next page saying upon the most impartial search i have made i find not any cause to correct either my judgment or books as touching any of the great doctrines and principles of the christian religion nor do i know that i am of another faith in any one principle of christian doctrine contrary to what i believed ever since i went under the profession of a quaker so called with much more to the same purpose  vile errors against the quakers for the same things he had held himself which yet were no errors in him such a hypocrite was he to dissemble with god and man so that when he found his doctrines compared with what he accused friends of and saw they were the same or parallel twas to no purpose for him to go to vindicate or clear himself of what was so notorious and therefore procured another or at least he undertook it for him under disguise of the snake in the grass and so to slide by the quotatious out of his books that lay in his way which would have been a shame for g k to do a snake in the grass indeed pretending in his preface that it was not meant as a defense of george keith any further than he defended the truth of the christian faith for which reason says he i have wholly omitted all the personal reflections cast upon him and the contradictions which thomas ellwood pretends to find in his former books while he was a quaker of their communion to the doctrine he now sets up in opposition to them and so gave the go by to whatever pincht him which was the design as t e observes to help g keith off at a dead lift from his manifold and manifest self contradictions which it was impossible for him to reconcile or defend and because it had been as absurd for him to have undertaken a reply to t es answer and not have attempted to acquit himself of those contradictions charged upon him therein as it  so that any one might plainly see this was a contrivance as our friend t e observes to help g k out at a dead lift to which book of the snakes t e writ an answer though he did not quite finish it or publish it of which and that controversy he gives the following account  this controversy begun by george keith upon a pick he took against the people called quakers because they could not answer his ambitious desire of rule nor receive some wild and fantastical notions of his has been carried on by him in his own name till he could go no further the doctrines he condemns us for as erroneous and heritical have been either so clearly cast off by us as slanders or so rivetted on himself by undeniable instances and proofs taken out of his own books that having foreclosed his way to a retractation of them as shall be achelous who being too weak for his antagonist in fair force was fain to shift from one shape to another first to that of a snake then to that of a bull and is thereupon brought in by the poet saying inferior virtute meas divertor ad arts elaborque viro longum formatus in anguem etc metam lib   fab   in strength too weak i to my wiles betake and slide from man into a twining snake somewhat a like crafty course has g keith taken who finding himself over pressed the last year with books which he knew not how to answer got as was supposed an adjutant of his to publish a book against us under disguise without a name to it and with the very title of the snake in the grass thereby to have diverted us from pursuing the controversy then and still in hand with him but when he found that would not do for the design was seen he roared against us like a bull at turnershall in the month called june      and afterward in his narrative thereof the answer to that which soon followed has it seems involved him in such difficulties that he has not thought fit to appear against it in his own shape but either assuming another snake they have amongst them lately thrust forth another book as a reply to that answer of mine to g keiths narrative this without a name too and said to be written by the author of the snake in the grass is called satan disrobd from his disguise of light but the observant reader will find cause enough i think to conclude that whoever writ it was fully inrobd in satans overguise and proper dress of darkness from the many bitter and scornful invectives therein used against the light  and for the controversy it self he remarks    that the matters therein charged upon us are generally the same that have been charged on us heretofore by faldo hicks and other adversaries and always refuted over and over both formerly and of late    that the things they charge on us as errors and heresy are not pretended to be proved by any plain express positions or assertions of ours but from our adversaries own perverse meanings and wrested constructions of our words always denied and rejected by us    that the words and passages brought by our adversaries for proof of their charges against us are not taken out of our doctrinal treatises or declarations of faith and principles but for the most part out of controversial books wherein often times the scope    that however any of our former adversaries might have been misled in their judgments concerning us g keith who has now moved this controversy against us knows full well that we do not hold those things either generally as a people or as particular persons which he has charged on us as errors as a people he has clearly acquitted us from them in his preface to his narrative p   where hesays i charge them not either upon the generality far less upon the universality of all them called quakers for particular persons hear what he says of george whitehead one of the principal butts he shoots at nar p    where having charged him with denying that christ in heaven has any bodily existence without us being conscious that g whitehead did not so hold but that he had therein abused him he immediately adds if he g w has said otherwise in any of his late printed books i am glad of it and a line lower there is a g whitehead orthodox and a g whitehead not orthodox he is  in this and some other things orthodox and not orthodox and a little further i own it that i have cited diverse passages out of his later books that are orthodox to prove him sound g whitehead was orthodox and sound in his own both intentions and expressions not orthodox in g keiths perverse and false constructions and whereas he harps upon the word later books thereby to insinuate as if g w had of late altered his judgment he has cut off that also in his nar p    where he gives an account that in the year      which is eighteen years ago some whom he would not name questioning him about some principles in a book of his both g whitehead and w penn took part with him against them though those principles as he calls them which he says he was then questioned about were of the same nature with some of those he now charges upon them as errors from whence it appears that he found them then as well as now sound and orthodox in those principles    that as this controversy lies properly and directly between g keith and us and that he being bafled in it and driven to a ne plus ultra on his own part has contrived to carry it on under disguise by the assistance of another yet without a name who under pretense of indifferency and being unconcerned with or for g keith should drop the quotations i had loaded him with out of his own books against himself and thereby free him if he could from those pinching dilemmas which lay against him and draw dun as the proverb speaks out of the mire he was plunged into so to obviate and disappoint the design g keith slip away which i perceive he would fain do while i am contending with i know not whom in this quarrel therefore as i pass through the several heads of the controversy i purpose not only to answer the most material cavils of the present adversary but withal to repeat some at least of those passages that lay so heavy upon g keith and settle not to use his own smithing metaphors of clinching and rivetting them faster on him to the end that both the reader may more plainly see the true reason why g keith did not himself reply in his own name to my answer to his narrative and g keith may know that i expect it from him and in the mean time look upon him but as a bafled shifting adversary  he begins his epistle with telling his reader that his reply is short in comparison of the answer therein he and i agree but in words rather than in meaning for he means in number of pages i mean in truth and fair dealing in which i am confident the indifferent reader will find his reply short indeed and even as to bulk upon due consideration the disproportion is not so great as he would represent it for his book is rather more than half as big as mine though he replies not to and yet this is the man that cautioned the quakers that if they answered his book snake  d edit p     that they would reply distinctly  and not answer a book as rats do by nibling at some corners of the leaves stealing through it like moths to no other purpose than to deface some words at a venture who yet could reply thus slightly himself nay in his first page he throws off no less than twenty five pages at once and barely mentioning in less than nine lines a few words contained in some of them without a syllable of reply thereto sets in his margin reply to the first twenty three pages and yet he has the confidence to miscal his book and that even in the same page a full reply he might better have called it a foul and false reply to t ellwood s answer and in his epistle says he has omitted nothing that is material i suppose he means that he has omitted nothing which he thought might tend to abuse and defame the quakers and me for that he has omitted the most material parts of my book and thrust in many passages idle impertinent false and wholly foreign to the subject only that he might misrepresent ridicule and slander us i shall have occasion hereafter by plenty of instances to show  i might cite a great deal more to explicate this controversy and show their disingenuity snakes was and by this taste to use his own words at the end of the snake the reader may guess what a plentiful meal we might have had if t e had published his rejoinder but that as i said he did not for what reason i cannot justly assign for though our friend george whitehead in his answer to the snake in the grass writ also a brief examination of some passages in the said book of the snakes styled satan disrobed etc as being concerned therein yet he referred to a further answer by t e p     judging it no fair reply to t ellwoods answer and so it appears says he and i expect will be made further appear if t ellwood deems it worth the while to undertake it which he did and writ twenty seven sheets in order thereto and why he should be prevented from publishing it by g whiteheads brief examination i do not see being much larger and fuller but perceive he was so modest that he was apt to be put by of his work if any other put in before him as will further appear on another occasion hereafter and so i shall leave it hoping however one time or other to see this and some other of his posthumous works published by themselves as they well deserve  and here our friend dropped his pen till another occasion offered  and that was next or at least the next he laid hold on after a vacancy of two or three years on this occasion  norfolk on our friends having a meeting near one of them and truth spreading to their regret they challenged a dispute with some of our friends at westdeerham in that county the  th of the tenth month school where some of our friends appearing and answering them so disappointed the priests in their envious designs in the said dispute that they afterward promoted two petitions against our friends to the parliament one from norfolk the other from suffolk to stir up persecution against them that what they could not do by arguments they might by force to which two petitions our friend t ellwood having obtained copies of them writ a sober reply on behalf of the people called quakers to two petitions against them  the one out of norfolk and the other from bury in suffolk being some brief observations upon them etc london in attending the parliament and delivering printed papers particularly a few considerations humbly offered to the members of parliament to obviate some evil jealousies and designs against the people called quakers so quashed their malicious purposes that their petitions were never delivered to or received by the parliament but fell and came to nothing and their evil designs were frustrated friends were preserved and truth prospered over their heads  william penn being gone to pennsylvania in the  th month this year and g keith continuing his opposition against truth and friends sometimes more general at turnershall where as the course of his dilirious distemper returned as joseph wyeth observes in his answer to his advertisement this year he held his contentious meetings once a year to pick passages out of our friends books to cavil at though he could not answer nor clear himself of t ellwoods or others that were writ against him and sometimes more particularly against single persons especially william penn against whom he chose to vent his malice above most others especially now in his absence making him the butt of his indignation and published two books against him one called the deism of william penn and his brethren etc this our friend t ellwood undertook to answer and made a considerable progress in it in a large book of between thirty and forty sheets which i shall cite some of beginning thus  we read of one in former times who because he had given up himself to do evil was said to have sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord   kings     0 and    whether george keith has directly sold himself or only let himself out to hire i will not undertake to determine but evident it is that since he crept into the interest of that which is called the church of england and become a mercenary hackney to some of the clergy he has laid out himself with his utmost vigor to work wickedness not only in the sight of the lord but in the sight of the sun asserting defending maintaining and upholding diverse both doctrines and practices in religion which upon a declared full conviction and from a professed assurance of divine openings and immediate guidance of the holy spirit he had before not only renounced but declared and written against as false superstitious if not idolatrous and antichristian and to fill up his measure of iniquity and heap it up that it might run over he has not only to gratify his supporters shot his unadvised bolts at the several other bodies of protestam dissenters but in an especial manner and in a most virulent and to him peculiar style has evomitted floods not of reproach only and bitter revilings but of the most malicious slanders and falsehoods that ever perhaps were poured from the pulpit or squeezed through the press against the people called quakers whom once he owned for his brethren and with whom he professed to hold communion for more than thirty years herein he has exceeded good joseph of old in his liberality but in another kind that good man bestowed a fivefoldmess of his good things on his brother benjamin as a token of his peculiar and abundant love to him this bad man has bestowed double and treble that proportion of his evil things on us the effect of his peculiar and superabundant hatred to us to say the deism of william penn and his brethren destructive to the christian religion exposed etc the word  deism being somewhat an uncommon term may not perhaps be readily understood by every reader as it has been opposed to atheism it has been taken in a good sense but as it is now used it is taken in an ill sense as importing an acknowledgment or owning of god only or of the godhead but not of christ with respect to his incarnation or being manifest in the flesh for the redemption of man so that to charge any one now with deism is to charge him with denying that christ is come and has suffered in the flesh now herein g keiths both injustice and malice is the greater in charging w penn and his brethren the quakers with deism in as much as he assuredly knows which some other adversaries have not had the like opportunity to know as he has had by certain experience drawn by so many years intimate conversation with w p and the quakers in free and familiar conferences and in reading their books that w p and the quakers both in word and writing publicly and privately have always and on all viz that the word was made flesh john      that when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law gal       that christ jesus being in the form of god and thinking it no robbery to be equal with god made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross phil           christ dyed for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures   cor        that he was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification romans      that he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world   john     that he ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things ephesians    0 that he is the one mediator between god and men   timothy     that he is at the right hand of god and makes intercession for us romans      and is our advocate with the father   john     and that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead acts  0    these things i say g keith certainly knows have been constantly held believed professed and owned by w penn quakers in general both privately and publicly in word and writing these things are so often testified of in our meetings and have been so fully and plainly asserted and held forth in our books that we might call in almost as many witnesses thereof as have frequented our meetings or attentively read our books  the book of w ps called a discourse of the general rule of faith and life to which g ks deism is an answer g k tells us in his preface was first printed in the year      as an appendix to w ps part of the christian quaker a folio book in two parts the former written by w penn the latter by g whitehead in that former part of the christian quaker written by w penn though the tendency of it is to assert and defend the divinity of christ and his spiritual appearance by his divine light in the hearts of men yet there it enough said concerning his manhood his outward appearance and sufferings in the flesh to free w penn from the imputation or suspicion of deism  in p  0  w p says notwithstanding the same light and life with that which afterward clothed it self with that outward body did in measure inwardly appear for the salvation of the souls of men yet as i have often said never did that life so eminently put forth it self to that end as in that sanctified and prepared body so that what he then suffered and did in that transcendent manifestation may by way of manhood insencible of it under the load of this did he travel he alone trod the wine press etc  not that we would irreverently rob the holy body of whatsoever acknowledgement is justly due nor yet separate what god joined p  0   chap    a confession in particular to christs redemption remission justification and salvation  which was actually to the salvation of some and intentionally of the whole world  as there was a necessity that one should die for the people so whoever then or since believed in him had and have a seal or confirmation of the remission of their sins in his blood  this grand assurance of remission do all receive in the ratifying blood of christ who repenting of their sins believe and obey the holy light with which he has illuminated them  p  0  but there is yet a further benefit that accrueth by the blood of christ viz that christ is a propitiation and redemption to such as have faith in it for though i still place the stress of particular benefit upon the light life and spirit revealed and witnessed in every particular yet in that general appearance there was a general benefit justly to be attributed tragedy and died impenitent yet doubtless it thus far turned to very great account in that it was a most precious offering in the sight of the lord and drew gods love the more eminently to mankind at least such as should believe in his name p  0  doubtless it did greatly influence to some singular tenderness and peculiar regard unto all such as should believe in his name among other his weighty performances for the sake of that last and greatest of all his external acts the resisting unto blood for the spiritual good of the world thereby offering up his life upon the cross through the power of the eternal spirit that remission of sin gods bounty to the world might be preached in his name and in his very blood too as that which was the most ratifying of all his bodily sufferings and indeed therefore might it seem meet to the holy ghost that redemption propitiation and remission should be declared and held forth in the blood of christ unto all that have a right faith therein as says the apostle to the romans  because it implies a firm belief that christ was come in the flesh and that none could then have him as their propitiation and redemption who withstood the acknowledgment of and belief in his visible appearance  p   0 faith in his blood was requisite he who then appeared was and is the propitiation etc and in him was redemption obtained by all those who had such true faith in his blood  thus much and much more which i have omitted against deism in that very treatise of w ps to which the book out of which g k by his art of counterfeit chemistry would extract deism was an appendix and yet this was not the direct subject of that treatise but only touched on occasionally or by the by should i gather up all quotations on this argument out of our other books such especially as have more directly handled this subject i might therewith fill a large volume to prevent which i refer the reader to my answer to g keith s first narrative of his proceedings at turnershall from p    to    where he may find this cavil fully confuted which answer to his first narrative may serve for an answer to his other following narratives also they for the most part being but the scraps of his first heated again and served up afresh with some new garnish  it is observable that that book called a discourse of the general rule of faith and life was first printed as g k in his preface to his deism takes notice in the year      which is    years ago and about  0 years before he quite left us it appears he had read it in the first impression for making as if so little had i read or considered the contents of it both read it then it seems he had and considered the contents of it and though here he would suggest he had but slightly read it yet he would not be taken for an heedless reader or a superficial considerer of what he reads now since he held the same doctrine with respect to the general rule of faith and life which is laid down by w penn in that discourse during the time he was amongst us and professed himself one of us as well after the publishing of that book in the year      as before and did not only openly defend and maintain that doctrine in public disputations both in england and in scotland after the year      but no longer ago than in the year      nineteen years after that book of w penns called a discourse of the general rule of faith and life was in print g k in his serious appeal p   says according to the best knowledge i have of the people called quakers and those most generally owned by them as preachers and publishers of their faith of unquestioned esteem among them and worthy of double honor as many such there are i know none that are guilty of any one such heresies and blasphemies as thou accusest them and i think i should know and do know these called quakers better than c mather against whom he then writ or any of his brethren having been conversant with them in public meetings as well as in private discourse with the most noted and esteemed among them for above    years past and that in many places of the world in europe and for these diverse years in america i say all this considered how will g keith upon the charges he now makes against w p acquit himself from having been a professed deist all the while he was among the quakers yet he himself well knows that neither he nor w penn nor any of the quakers ever were deists ever did deny disown or disbelieve the coming incarnation sufferings and death of christ as man outwardly in the flesh his resurrection ascension and mediatorship and he himself has undesignedly acquitted w penn from his present charge of deism by a story he told in his first narrative p    that upon some urging him to give an instance of one english quaker that he ever heard pray to christ w penn being present said i am an english man and a quaker and i own i have often prayed to christ jesus even him that was crucified this he says was in the year      which was five years after the publishing of that book from which he attempts to prove him a deist that is a denyer of the man christ jesus who was crucified judge now reader how rank the malice of g keith must needs be against w penn and his brethren the quakers who would choose to subject himself with them to the foul imputation of deism though in his own conscience he knows the charge is false on them as well as apologue who desired that he might loose one of his eyes on condition his neighbor might loose both his whence the observation rose a wicked will would wound it self to work anothers ill   benjamin cool of bristol published a book there entitled honesty the truest policy showing the sophistry envy and perversion of george keith in his three books viz his bristol quakerismbristol narrative and his deism on perusal of which viz his answer to g keiths deism etc t e writ the following verses indeed is then the work by me begun and which i labored at with such good will already by a readier workman done who nimbleness has added to his skill well may it thrive successful may it prove truths way to clear and stumbling blocks remove i never was ambitious to appear in print nor to my self applause have sought with satisfaction therefore i can bear what thon designst another hand has wrought this superceeds my work i am glad to see such help come in that there is no need of me this is the third time i have thus been put besides my work which makes me think my friend the controversial door to me is shut and of my scribbling service there is an end if so content i can with pleasure see the work well done although not done by me t e   th   th month   00   the three times he was put besides his work of which he says this was the third the other two i suppose were his remarks on gerrard croeses history of the quakers and his answer to the snake in the grass his book called satan disrobed both before mentioned  however this of b cs anticipating his answer to the deism he laid it by and never finished it thinking perhaps the other though far short of his might suffice at present for an answer thereto and so we were deprived of his labor in this respect also which yet i hope one time or other may be published for the service of truth which its pity the world should be deprived of  john shockling a priest of ash near sandwich in kent having got some of the snakes books set up for an opposer or disputant about water baptism and sends a paper to john love called a question upon those words in matthew       go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost whether the apostles were not commanded by them to baptize with water this paper and question our friend t e answered in the  th month   0  very much to the purpose to which the priest being unwilling to take an answer and let it drop so replying i might say to little purpose t e writ a rejoinder in the  th month  history of the old testament which at his leisure he had in hand for some years and both he and we had this advantage of his being put by his work in answering adversaries particularly that of the snake and g ks deism having now seemed to have done with controversy that he had the more time and leisure to prosecute this more excellent work which having finished in london to show it to friends for their perusal and approbation which being done it was published in folio the next year sacred history or the historical part of the holy scriptures of the old testament gathered out from the other parts thereof and digested as near as well could be into due method with respect to order of time and place with some observations here and there tending to illustrate some passages therein in his preface to cicero viz that it is the witness of times the light of truth the life of memory etc which he thinks cannot be so well verefied of any particular history as of that which being written by divinelyinspired penmen is contained in the books of the old and new testament then speaking of the motive or inducement to the undertaking two things he says more especially led him to it one that the divine providence the wisdom power goodness and favor of god in ordering disposing providing for preserving defending and wonderfully delivering his servants and people out of the greatest straits difficulties hardships dangers and sufferings being more directly and in a continued series and course of actions set before the readers eye he might be thereby the more stirred up and engaged to admire and magnify to love reverence and fear the lord and be the more careful not to offend him the other motive was that all the youth especially of either sex under what soever religious denomination they go might be furnished with such an entertainment to spend at least their leisure hours upon as might yield them at once both profit and delight after which he proceeds to speak of the manner of performance under eight heads the substance of which are    that in digesting the following history he has not strictly tied himself to the letter and very syllables of the text but with all etc   where he has left the last english translation of the bible he has followed for the most part some other english or latin or the judgment of some eminently learned expositors   as to the chronology especially with respect to the times of the judges and kings of israel and judah he found so much incertainty and so little certainty or agreement amongst interpreters about it that he had a mind to have left it out but at the desire of some he added it in the margin wherein for the most part he followed r blomes history of the old and new testament   the few helps he says he had were chiefly from dr gells essay toward an amendment of the last english translation of the bible hugh broughtons consent of scripture godwins moses and aaron the annotations of tremelius and junius and for names of persons and places the tables of robert f herry   the whole work is divided into three parts without any particular regard had to the seven periods of time into which chronologers and historiographers out of a desire to reduce them to some sort of proportion with the six days work and seventh days rest in the first week of the creation have generally divided the ages of the world from adam until now   of these three parts the first reaches from the creation to the death of moses when the children of israel being come to the borders of the promised land moses taking in job between genesis and exodus   the second part beginning with the book of joshua goes through that and the book of judges with the first book of samuel and carries on the history from the death of moses to the death of saul and the account that was brought to david of it in which are recounted the transactions of chief note under all the judges and saul the first anointed king of israel   the third part by much the largest goes on with the second book of samuel through the rest of the canonical scripture sets forth the reigns of the kings of israel and judah throughout the jewish monarchy with the most remarkable acts and occurrences therein from david to the return of the last babylonish captivity and rebuilding of the temple taking in the prophets as near as may be in their several times  then he gives account who has writ on this subject particularly a treatise called the general view of the holy scriptures supposed to be the learned broughtons which t e commends as a useful discourse in its kind and of late years chr ness his history and mystery of the old and new testament in four volumes a book says he well fraught with variety of useful matter but wittily observes the mystery is not only interwoven with the history but has also so much overgrowu it that the reader who desires to peruse the history by it r blomes history of the old and new testament a work indeed says he not only instructive and delightful but pompous and magnificent a character that may justly be applied to his own except the word pompous a work indeed it is both pleasant and profitable such judicious observations and witty though grave turns on passages and things as make it as well as his other writings not only pleasant to read but profitable to the reader a work that will remain a monument of his worth and ingenuity to generations to come  i would only add that there is a book of sulpitius severus entitled sacred history but as that is in latin and far short of this of t es so this cannot interfere with that or be justly thought to be in imitation of it  about this time we entered into a more particular correspondence by letters on several occasions which we continued at times almost till his death so that i usually imparted to him the most remarkable occurrences that passed here and often advised with him in the most important affairs as i had occasion and he in requital was always ready to answer me in a very obliging manner in any thing i desired and i must acknowledge he was very helpful to me by his advice in some controversies i had with some late adversaries which i shall not now name some of them being gone decades  viz   0  there followed an intercourse of some letters between him and william sewell of holland upon some particular points which led into a friendly correspondence between them in some other matters not unpleasant to read several of which letters of t es are in his decades with many others to diverse persons friends and others on various subjects which if ever it should be thought meet to publish them or any of them they would i doubt not be very instructive as well as diverting  his next public work was on this occasion about this time a book was published by a nameless author called a divine treatise written by way of essay pretending to demonstrate according to the mosaical philosophy water baptism imposition of hands and the commemoration of the death and passion of our ever blessed lord and savior under the species of bread and wine etc this treatise coming accidentally or providentially to our friend thomas ellwoods hands as he says in his preface he observed that the design of the author therein was to reintroduce and set up again those typical representations therein treated of among those who have been led by the lord out of the use thereof into a more spiritual observations which he had made thereon that others might the more clearly see and readily escape the snare therein laid to entangle them and draw them into bondage to outward ceremonies and elementary shadows again this he did in a book printed the glorious brightness of the gospelday dispelling the shadows of the legal dispensation and whatsoever else of humane invention has been superadded thereunto and hoped to make it evident that they are not of the nature of the gospel dispensation nor have by any divine institution a continued place or service in the church of christ without taking notice who or what he was that writ it since the author of the treatise says t e under my observation has thought fit to conceal his name i shall not pry behind the curtain which himself has thereby drawn before him or concern my self to enquire either who or what he is or has been but without any regard to that shall directly apply my self to give a plain answer to the most material parts of his treatise which he did to the purpose in a close and nervous answer it being indeed an excellent treatise well worth the perusal of every impartial reader to whom therefore i recommend it  jewish in their original and popish in their revival and that the obligation of paying them was ceased under the gospel as to any divine right from scripture and now it fell to his lot to suffer also in his turn for his testimony against the payment of them for to him it was given in the behalf of christ not only to believe in him and bear witness to his coming in the flesh and offering up himself to put an end to the law and priesthood tithes and offerings but also to suffer for his sake being prosecuted with three friends more viz john penington abraham butterfield and william catch in the exchequer for tithes at the suit of joshua leaper tythefarmer of amersham in the county of bucks under humphry drake clerk rector and parson so called of the rectory and parish church of agmondesham alias amersham aforesaid thomas ellwood with the rest were subpoenad to appear at westminster in trinityterm   0  which they did by an attorney to prevent being in contempt of the court and took a copy of the complainants bill but for not answering attachments were issued out in michaelmas term to take them up on which they were taken into custody in the eleventh month and afterward an habeas corpus sent down to the sheriff of bucks to bring them up to the exchequerbar trinity term   0  on which they came up and to to prevent the plantiffs going on to a sequestration by default they put in their answers setting forth the value of the tithes according to the best of their knowledge yet so vexatious was the adversary that he would not be satisfied with their answer but got a commission of enquiry to examine witnesses in the country as to the value of the tithes which they did at amersham in the tenth month the first witness they examined was one e  g  of the parish of chesham aged as they say forty four years or thereabouts who deposed that he knew the complainant and defendants and had known the complainant about sixty years which was about sixteen years before he was born whereby we may judge of the rest of his evidence the charge of which commission and executing it came to between thirty and forty pounds though some of it was abated on taxing the cost and yet they proved little if any thing more than the defendants had set down in their answers yet went on to a hearing on it and obtained a decree for the tithes and cost for not performing which attachments were issued out afresh against them in trinityterm hartfordshire  te ab and wc living in that county but jp living in bucks was dropped because the attachments to the sheriff of hartfordshire would not reach him and then a proclamation but the sheriff living remote did sequestration on their goods and estates than their bodies so that seeing them resolved to go on the defendants to prevent it offered to surrender themselves to the sheriff but he returned them each non est inventus and they got a commission of rebellion antedated and moved for a sergeant at arms the same day to run them to a sequestration in all haste  leaper being sick and bad like to die least he should not live till it was accomplished but being so illegal at least in point of time for that there ought to be eight days between the test and return of the writ in  0 miles off london and    beyond on our appearing against it they could not obtain it till hillary term in which time leaper recovered and one might have hoped that he might have repented but instead thereof then got a sequestration against them and their estates both real and personal for tithes of thomas ellwood which was but 00    0 and abraham butterfields         and william catchs    0    and cost as taxed by the deputy         in all for tithes and cost  0       for which they seized and took from t e in housholdgoods bedding pewter etc throwing out the meat to take the dishes to the value of    l and a horse he used to ride on which he would not have took five gueneas for in all about     0 0 which they sold working and hobling about the horse till they had almost spoiled him all for about       0 and from abraham butterfield cattle corn hay etc to the value of which they sold by their own account for so much       0 and from william catch they took by their account grass etc        and a years rent of his house deducting for taxes    shillings   0  0 being about   l per annnm which they seized and kept till paid which for four years since the time called michaelmas   0  when they gave in their account came to      0 in all from w c about  0      seized and taken in the whole about     0    for tithes and cost  0       more than demanded 0        and yet what by charge of sequestration making out and selling the corn selling underhand etc they brought in the defendants in debt and wanted more  i have been the larger in this account to show the proceeding of the exchequer and the fruit of tithes to ruin the queens subjects for small matters when they might recover justiceswarrants to the value of  0 l with the hundredth part of the charge  now we come to the second volume of his great work the history of the new testament which he had had in hand at times for the most part since he finished his former and when he had finished this he brought it up to london for friends perusal and approbation where it was read and afterward published this year   0  in folio under the same title with the former only as that was of the old testament this was of the new viz sacred history or the historical part of the holy scriptures of the new testament etc as in the title of the former which as i gave some account of so it behooves i should of this the former treatise says he in his preface having found a favorable reception he was thence encouraged to resume his pen which at the close of that volume he had let fall and proceed to the methodizing of the historical part of the new testament in two parts in the first part whereof the reader will find an account of the conception birth life travels doctrines discourses miracles sufferings death burial resurrection and ascension of our blessed lord and savior jesus christ the author of the true christian religion plainly fairly and succinctly given ushered in with a brief account of the conception birth manner of life ministry and death of his forerunner john surnamed the baptist and attended in the second luke in the acts of the apostles has recorded or the clue or thread of the holy text leads him beyond which he says he was not willing to adventure etc  in this undertaking he says he aimed at the same end as in the former viz that all the youth especially of either sex under whatsoever religious denomination they go might be further furnished with such an entertainment to spend at least their leisure hours upon as might yield them at once both profit and delight and might be thereby drawn off from misspending their precious time upon other either hurtful or at best unprofitable subjects then he gives account why he has with the matter of fact delivered the discourses speeches sermons and doctrines delivered by our blessed lord to his disciples etc viz that the nature of the history required it and that without it the discourse would have been less profitable and pleasant to the reader and by that means less conducive to the end he proposed which is to allure him to read the holy scriptures with delight etc according to the poet he certainly does hit the white who mingleth profit with delight   evangelists to reduce the several parts and passages of the history in the first part to their due and proper times and places which he endeavored to do though difficult as near as he could but the second part the acts being all written by one hand the method he says is more regular and the course of the history more clear yet the apostolical epistles being without date are hardly he conceives to be reduced with indubitable certainty to exact order which yet he has endeavored to place them right according to the best of his understanding then owning the helps he had in compiling this history had been chiefly from the critics and cradocks harmony of the four evangelists and his apostolical history with a few words of the performance which if not done as it should nor as he would yet as well as he could and therefore in all humility recommending and committing it to the divine disposal he concludes his preface  next to the preface is an introduction concerning the penmen of the new testament and in what language originally written and in what order of time particularly of the four evangelists matthew mark luke and john what they were the time of their writing and some particular circumstances concerning them and their ends well worth the readers perusal for the better understanding the history both of the evangelists and apostles so proceeds to promised seed after the fall for mans restoration which the prophets foretold the coming of and which he pleasantly draws out at large in order of time and explains with the like judicious observations as in the former taking in the epistles of st paul etc in the second part in their proper places as near as could be and gives an account of them the occasion why the manner how and time when they were written ending with the revelations which he renders as a revelation unrevealed with some brief notes on it the whole as i said of the former being both pleasant and profitable both which will remain a lasting monument of him in time to come  oliver sansom formerly of faringdon since of abington in berkshire who had long war with the priests about tithes dying in the  d month and leaving behind him an account of some remarkable passages of his life which he communicated in his life time to our friend t ellwood to peruse who being always ready to be helpful and serviceable to all especially his friends he transcribed the same and fitted it for the press which was printed this year to which t e prefixed a testimony concerning him pertinent to the occasion  there is one book more of his which he published in his lifetime which it seems he had had by him for the most part a long time and after he had finished his sacred history of the new testament he took in hand to finish and completed and that is the life of david in verse first begun for his own diversion not then thinking of the press and carried on by degrees to the end of the third book in the year      as hinted before in that year when the prince of orange landing and the nation being in arms the noise of guns and sounds of drums and trumpets so affrighted and disturbed his peaceful muse as he says in his preface that both she for a while forsook him and he thereupon the work for above twenty years save that on a review observing how abruptly david was brought in he added the first chapter of the first book to introduce his hero from the beginning of his story where it rested again without any prospect of its ever going further until the last winter davids life i wish he had done so by his own and giving a kind invitation to his gentle muse to return which by some short visits on particular occasions in the interval had given him some ground to hope she had not quite forsook him he entered again upon the subject where he had warlike hero to his peaceful grave  posthume to be published by some kind hand after his death for some reasons particularly that if any should carp at it he might be capable to answer for himself he thought best to publish it in his life time and accordingly brought it up with him when he came to the yearly meeting      but not having then an opportunity to have it read he came up again with it some time after which i think was the last time he was at london and after reading committed it to the press this year under the title of davideis the life of david king of israel a sacred poem in five books in octavo though as he observes abraham cowley writ a poem called davideis he had not read it till after he had finished his and besides their different way of writing a cs was but of the troubles of david in his youth and that not half finished and that he had the same aim in this as in that of his sacred history aforesaid which book begins thus i sing the life of david israel s king assist thou sacred power who did him bring from the sheepfold and set him on the throne thee i invoke on thee rely alone breath on my muse and fill her slender quill with thy refreshing dews from hermonhill that what she sings may turn unto thy praise and to thy name may lasting trophies raise   but i would not anticipate the reader but leave him to read and judge for himself as it deserves  i shall conclude his works and writings with a copy of verses he formerly writ which though out of course as to time is so well worth the inserting that i hope they will make amends for being misplaced viz o that mine eye might closed be to what becomes me not to see that deafness might possess mine ear to what concerns me not to hear that truth my tongue might always ty from ever speaking foolishly that no vain thought might ever rest or be conceived in my breast that by each word each deed each thought glory may to my god be brought but what are wishes lord mine eye on thee is fixed to thee i cry o purge out all my dross my tin make me more white than snow within wash lord and purify my heart and make it clean in every part and when it is clean lord keep it too for that is more than i can do t e    thus having gone through his printed books and papers which i have endeavored to give  he lived many years if not most of his time especially after he was married at hungerhill in the parish of agmondesham alias amersham in buckinghamshire though his house stood in hartfordshtre as aforesaid where the monthly meetings of men and women were constantly kept for that part of the county of bucks wherein he was very serviceable in writing advising and exhorting to keep all things well and in good order according to truth and the testimony thereof and had a peculiar gift for government in the church and ordering things in monthly and quarterly meetings and used to come up constantly to the yearly meeting at london and was very serviceable therein not only by his grave counsel and advice but also in reading and writing on occasion especially in difficult matters he had a singular talent in indicting and composing of things epistles and papers beyond many so that i must needs say he was an ornament to the meeting and will be much missed therein and many other ways his wife died about five years before him being a solid weighty woman who had a public asthma and at last he was taken ill of a palsy the   d day of the  d month having served his generation according to the will of god he fell a sleep and was honorably buried the  d day following being the  th of the  d month at jordans being accompanied from his own house by a great many friends and others to the meeting house there the meeting he belonged to and interred in the buryingground belonging thereto where was a very large meeting and great appearance of friends and others several public friends being there from london and other parts and diverse living testimonies born to the truth he lived and died in in a living remembrance of him and his services in the church a man of a comely aspect of a flock and family as watchmen upon sions walls for his honor and the benefit of his church and people says my soul amen  j w london the  0 th of the   th month      postscript since the writing of the foregoing supplement i have understood that our friend thomas ellwood after he had finished and published his davideis signified that he had but one thing more that lay upon his mind and that was to add something to his journal or account of his life which was chiefly to give an account of his books and writings which as it shows he had not done it or finished it before and it is to be doubted he did not after not living long after that and so no more to be expected mores the pity from his own hand so it shows what his design was as to what he intended to have added to it had he lived to perform it or had not death prevented him so that the foresaid supplement seems in some sort at least to answer his own intention though far short as was said of what his own hand could have done yet so far as it does any way answer his mind i am therein glad that i have done any service to his memory or the truth in that respect having endeavored to represent things according to his own mind and to speak of him and things as probably he would have done it he had been living and hope the reader will accept it the better to whom therefore i recommend it as giving at least a fair character of the books he writ and controversies he managed both published and unpublished which i hope will be no disservice but service to the truth as it is intended in the fear of god to whose honor and the service of his truth i

moderate enquirer robert snow we received a paper subscribed by thee and directed to the church or people of god called quakers etc which paper contains some objections which thou say thou have heard spoken against us and wherein thou desire to be satisfied to which we say it is no strange thing to us to be spoken against by the worlds teachers that being no more than befell the people of god in the first breaking forth of christianity in the world of whom it was said acts       as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against but we are willing to endeavor thy satisfaction by answering the objections  the first is you own no day either the first or last as a sabbath to the gentiles  answer the sabbath which was the seventh or last day of the week was given to the jews ex       romans     not to the gentiles psalm         0 romans      and was to last as other typical ordinances were until the time of reformation heb    0 till the seed should come gal      which was christ ver    the lord of the sabbath mat      who in the fullness of time did blot out the hand writing of ordinances etc and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross col      from whence the apostle thus infers let no man therefore judge you the saints and faithful brethren col     in meat or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days col      which says he are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ ver    thus was that sabbath which was given by god to his people the jews ended and taken away by christ before the gentiles were called to be his people and as for the first day of the week we do not read in the holy scriptures that it is called the sabbath day or commanded to be kept and observed for a sabbath as the seventh day had been but on the contrary we find the apostle paul writing to the romans who were gentiles though not without some mixture of believing jews amongst them as appears acts      says one man esteems one day above another there was the believing jew another esteems every day alike there was the believing gentile well what then does he commend the former of these and condemn the latter no but he says let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind romans      and in the   th  0 th and    th verses disswades them from judging one another about the observing or not observing a day as well as about the eating or not eating of meats and seems to lay no more stress upon the one than the other and if the drift of the apostles discourse there be heedfully minded it will appear that as he sets him who believed he might eat all things with him that esteemed every day a like and him that esteemed one day above another with him that eat herbs so he imputes the weakness to the latter ver   and sets himself on the other side saying we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak chap      and he tells the galatians which though a gentile church had also jewish believers in it i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain gal      why so ye observe days and months and times and years says he ver  0 so jealous was the apostle lest any that had been gathered from outward observations and from a shadowy state should imbondage themselves again in shadows and fall short of enjoying the substance which is the true gospel rest that remains to the people of god heb     which in the next verse is described to be their ceasing from their own works as god did from his into which rest we says the apostle that have believed do enter ver   and in the    verse he presses others to labor to enter into that rest now when the apostle says there remains a rest it plainly implies that the former rest the outward sabbatical rest did not remain but was passed away and gone nor is it reasonable to suppose that the rest here mentioned which is said to remain to the people of god was an outward bodily resting from outward bodily labor on whatsoever day both as that would be but to change one type or figure for another and as the entering into this rest is set forth in the text as a matter of labor and difficulty ver    as it is indeed yet blessed be the lord he has enabled some that have believed in his name and subjected to his power to enter into this rest in this his day and many are pressing after it as the true abiding gospelrest which the legal sabbath was but a type or shadow of  the  d objection is you deny the scriptures to be any rule for man or woman to walk by so as to direct them to the saving of their souls  answer in this we are misrepresented we sincerely own love and regard the holy scriptures believing with the apostle that they were given by inspiration of god and are profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works   timothy         and that they are able to make wise unto salvation through faith that is in christ jesus ver    and great benefit and delight we find in them reading them in the openings of that divine spirit by which they were given forth we are so far from denying them to be any rule etc that we acknowledge them to contain many excellent rules precepts doctrines and instructions directing man and woman how to walk that they may obtain the salvation of their souls yet we do not say as some have done that the scriptures are the only rule or the chief and principal rule because we dare not give the honor and office of the holy spirit unto the scriptures for the scriptures themselves declare that it is the office of the holy spirit to guide believers into all truth john       and indeed the true meaning and benefit of the scriptures themselves is not attained to in the reading of them unless the spirit that gave them forth do open them and unseal the mysteries contained in them so that the holy spirit is greater than the scriptures and therefore we cannot but give the chief place unto him for he is able to manifest himself unto man and to lead man into the way of salvation either with and by the scriptures or without them as he pleases but the scriptures cannot do that without the operation of the holy spirit justly therefore do we affirm the spirit of god to be the chief rule and yet acknowledge the holy scriptures to be a true rule and proper instrument in the hand of the spirit to direct men and women how they ought to walk to obtain salvation to their souls as the spirit of the lord makes use of the scriptures to that end  the  d objection is you deny the resurrection of this mortal body that this mortal shall not put on immortality  answer in this also we are misrepresented we do not deny but own the resurrection of the dead believing with the apostle that this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality   cor       and indeed if we did not believe this we might well say as he did if in this life only we have hope in christ we were of all men most miserable ver    and why stand we in jeopardy every hour ver  0 but the lord knows and we have openly and sincerely declared that we believe and own the resurrection of the dead according as the holy scriptures testify concerning it which say thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain etc but god gives it a body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body ver       it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body ver    the reason of which follows ver  0 namely that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption and as we firmly believe this so we take this to be sufficient without being so curiously inquisitive as he who would needs ask how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come ver    and was called fool for his pains ver     the  th objection is you suffer women to be your teachers that were forbid by the apostle for he says that they should keep silence  answer the jews of old had a strong persuasion grounded upon some misunderstood places of scripture that the salvation of god was confined to them and belonged not at all to the gentiles and this opinion had prevailed so far upon them that even those of them that received the gospel could not easily shake it off in so much that after peter had been with cornelius the centurion and was come back again to jerusalem he was called before the church for it they that were of the circumcision contending with him and saying thou went in to men uncircumcised and did eat with them act        to whom having related the occasion and particulars of that matter he concludes his defense thus for as much then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god ver    and in the next verse it follows when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god etc this answer which the apostle gave in that case may be suitable we think for us to give in this case to such as from some misunderstood places of scripture are offended at us for suffering women to speak in our assemblies viz for as much as god has given them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what are we that we should withstand god god by his servant joel in the time of the law had made this promise with relation to the times of the gospel viz and it shall come to pass afterward  or in the last days as peter repeats it act      that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit joel         and they shall prophecy adds peter act      here was no distinction of sex made but this promise of pouring out the spirit and of prophesying thereby is extended as expressly and fully to the daughters as to the sons to the handmaids as to the servants and this the apostle peter does expressly apply to that great pouring forth of the spirit upon the church at the pentecost immediately after christs ascension saying this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel acts      now at that great and eminent pouring forth of the spirit it appears the women were not excluded for when after the ascension the apostles and disciples were returned from mount oliver to jerusalem it is said these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus etc acts      the number of the names together being about an hundred and twenty ver    and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place chap     and in ver   it is said the cloven tongues sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance ver   here was no distinction made no shutting out the women but all were together all received the gift of the spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance nor was it thus only at that time and upon that extraordinary occasion but continued in the church afterward for we read that philip the evangelist had four daughters that did prophecy acts        phebe a woman is recommended by the apostle paul to the church at rome not only as a sister but as a servant of the church romans      priscilla a woman is called by the same apostle my helper or fellow labourer in christ jesus ver   tryphena and tryphosa two godly women are saluted by him as laborers in the lord and of the beloved persis another holy woman he testifies that she labored much in the lord ver    the same apostle in his epistle to the philippians says i entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel phil     which is the phrase by which the apostle does frequently express his own ministry and which he particularly applies to timotheus whom he calls our brother and minister of god and our fellow labourer in the gospel of christ   these     which is a clear evidence that those women that had received the gift of prophesy did minister therein to the edification of the church as well as the men nay the apostle paul in that very epistle wherein he is thought by some to discountenance womens preaching does give directions for the manner of their preaching or prophesying viz that they should do it with their heads covered for having first said every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors his head   cor      he adds but every woman that prays or prophesyeth with her head uncovered dishonors her head ver   this puts it out of doubt that womens praying and prophesying in the church was at that time both lawful and usual as well as mens  now that by prophesying here is meant preaching not barely foretelling things to come may not only be inferred from the use of the same word in the verse foregoing where being spoken of men it is granted on all hands to intend preaching and from thence the general practice of mens preaching uncovered is defended but may also fairly be concluded from the explanation the apostle gives of it in chap    ver    where he tells that church in general we may all prophesy one by one that all may learn which manifests that by prophesying he intended preaching or teaching that being the proper way or means of learning and in the beginning of that chapter where he prefers prophesying before speaking whith tongues ver   and   he says he that prophesyeth speaks unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort ver   and he that prophesyeth edifieth the church ver   which plainly show that by prophesying he meant preaching or teaching that being the proper means or way of edifying and therefore seeing he not only allowed women to prophecy but directed and advised them how they should perform it chap      and that in this place prophesying and preaching appear to be one and the same thing it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the liberty of preaching being gifted and called thereunto as for those words of his   cor       let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but to be under obedience as also says the law observe first that those words  as also says the law relate only to the womens being under obedience not to their keeping silence in the church for that was never enjoined them in the law but they were permitted to speak in the congregation and both miriam who was a prophetess did sing the triumphs of the lord in the public congregation ex     0    and deborah who was a prophetess did recount the noble acts of the lord and celebrate his praises in a triumphant song judges   read also what hanna spoke in the house of the lord in shiloh   samuel   and anna who was a prophetess did not only give thanks unto the lord but spoke of christ to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem luke      this was direct preaching and that in the temple so that the women were not enjoined silence under the law but were permitted to speak in the next place consider what speaking it was that was forbidden by the apostle in that place   cor       which from his following words will appear to be not a speaking of the words of life and salvation not a speaking as the spirit of god gives utterance but speaking disorderly asking questions unseasonably and out of place not speaking for the edification of others but speaking for their own information only for he immediately adds if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home ver    these words  learn and ask plainly show that the speaking here condemned was not a speaking the doctrines of the gospel for the edification of the church but asking questions for their own satisfaction which they might have done at home but not there therefore he adds for it is a shame for women to speak in the church and so indeed it was in such a disorderly manner as they spoke to interrogate or catechize either the minister or their husbands openly in the church to ask the meaning of this or call for an explanation of that which might look like a throwing off their obedience to their husbands and must needs occasion disorders and confusion in the assembly which we may perceive was the thing that troubled the apostle and which he labored to reform for he said before god is not the author of confusion but of peace ver    and he concludes the chapter with this admonition let all things be done decently and in order so that it was the disorderly practice of some women in that church which he reproves who it seems when any thing was spoken which they did not understand would interpose and ask questions for information sake which was uncomely in them offensive and troublesome to the congregation this sort of speaking was not permitted them but was a shame to them and from which they ought to have kept silence in the church and if they will learn any thing says he let them ask their husbands at home of like import are those other words of the same apostle to timothy and probably on the same occasion let the woman says he learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence   timothy         for hence it appears still that the occasion they took of speaking was under pretense of learning wherein they took an undue liberty to ask questions as if they would catechize or teach their husbands but though the apostle would not suffer such sort of speaking in the church as might give occasion to any to think that the women did cast off the obedience they owed and did usurp authority over their husbands nor after such a manner as might breed confusion in the congregation for he was so watchful against that that he enjoins the man to be silent in that case as well as the woman if any man says he speaks in an unknown tongue  let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church   cor          yet we have before showed that he allowed of women prophesying and that by prophesying he meant preaching we have also given many instances of women that labored in the work of the gospel in that day and could from a living and sure experience multiply instances of many women in this day whom the lord has committed the word of life and reconciliation unto and who in the quickening power and virtue thereof have sounded forth the same to the awakening of many that were asleep in sin and turning of many from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god who are now become living seals of their ministry neither would this seem so strange as it does to some did they duly consider that god is no respecter of persons but that as in the old creation male and female were created in the image of god so in the new creation male and female are all one in christ jesus gal      but as they that contended with peter for conversing with the gentiles when they had heard his defense held their peace and glorified god saying then has god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life acts       so we hope they that have taken offense at us for suffering women to speak in the church when they shall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their satisfaction will hold their peace as to any opposition thereunto and glorify god saying then has god committed unto women also the word of reconciliation  the fifth objection is you are a people that have gained health to your immortal souls and are sure of heaven when the scriptures say that the righteous man falls seven times a day and the apostle paul said that sin was still actually in him  answer we do not desire to boast of any seize yet we cannot but confess to the glory of god and the praise of his holy name that his saving health has appeared in this his day and we through his mercy have tasted of it christ the savior is manifested in spirit and we through grace have felt the healing virtue of his divine life and power through the tender mercy of our god the dayspring from on high has visited us and has given light to us that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death and has guided our feet into the way of peace and has helped us to make our calling and election sure as for the scripture thou mentionest we do not find that the scripture says the righteous man falls seven times a day but in prove       we find it thus written for a just man falls seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief and as the verse before shows the occasion of these words where it is said lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place so the latter part of this   th verse  but the wicked shall fall into mischief implies that the just man does not fall as the wicked man does into mischief and seeing all sin is mischief it seems as if the fall here spoken of the just man were not a falling into sin but into some outward calamity or exercise however the place speaks nothing of daily or continual falling nor do we remember that paul does use that very expression concerning himself viz that sin was still actually in him though we know that he does in diverse places run through as it were and open the various states and travels of the soul in some of which he cried out o wretched man that i am who shall deliver etc but he rested not there but quickly breaks forth into a rejoicing and cries out i thank god through jesus christ our lord romans         and then in the next chapter having said there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says expressly concerning himself for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death ver   and again thanks be to god which gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ   cor       this victory we press after this freedom from the law of sin and death we labor and travel to attain unto by a subjection through divine assistance to the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus  the  th objection is why your teachers persuade you that all other people are in a barren and desolate condition and are out of christ  answer our teachers do not persuade us so nor do we judge so of all other people for we our selves were gathered out of various professions states and conditions and some of us who had been seeking after the lord in other professions can remember that before we were thus gathered to this divine principle of light which the lord has set up in this his day as an ensign for the nations to be gathered unto and to walk in we were not wholly barren and desolate but had at seasons some touches and tastes of the virtue of that hidden life which we were then strangers to the lord having regard to the sincerity of our hearts and answering in some measure the breathings of our souls to him so far at least as to cherish and keep alive those good desires which were begotten in us and to beget in us a greater hunger and thirst after him and it is not hard to us to believe that so it may be with others at this day who have an integrity to the lord though not acquainted with his outgoings and manifestations of himself in this dispensation of light and life and both our prayers to god the father in and through his son jesus christ and our labor and endeavors in the openings of his love and life in our hearts are that all these in whatsoever profession may be drawn off from all the dry hills and barren mountains and gathered into the true sheepfold for we remember our savior said other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd joh  0    the lord grant that none of these may mistake his voice or disobey it  the last objection is you deny all outward ordinances as baptism and the six principles that were taught to the first primitive christians  answer the dispensation of the law was outward and the ordinances appertaining to that dispensation were outward also but the dispensation of the gospel is spiritual and inward and the ordinances appertaining to this dispensation are of a spiritual nature the baptism with water was johns and came up under the dispensation of the law nor did properly belong to the gospel dispensation though for a time by condescension continued as circumcision and some other legal rites were and this was that baptism which paul says christ sent him not to baptize with   cor      but the baptism of christ the true gospelbaptism that by which the true believer is baptized into jesus christ romans     and buried with him into death ver   the one baptism ephesians     is the baptism with the holy ghost and with fire and is plainly distinguished from the baptism with water both by john to whom the water baptism belonged and by christ to whom the spiritbaptism belonged for john said i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than i whose shoos i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire mat      and christ as luke records a little before his ascension said john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence acts     which was the promise of the father ver   delivered by christ to his apostles and disciples just before his parting from them luke       let it therefore be fairly considered   that the dispensation of the gospel is spiritual and therefore the ordinances belonging to it should be so too   that in mat       from which place the commission for water baptism is usually fetched there is no mention of water   that baptism with water is no where in scripture called christs baptism   that baptism with water is frequently called johns baptism   that the baptism with the holy ghost is called christs baptism   that the apostle paul acknowledges but one baptism ephesians     which cannot be supposed to be that with water since then he must exclude the baptism of the spirit   that the apostle peter speaking of the baptism that saves says expressly it is not the putting away the filth of the flesh   pet      which it is the property of water to do as if he had said the baptism which now saves us is not water baptism   that baptism with water is no where expressly commanded in scripture as it would doubtless have been had it been intended by christ for a gospel ordinance   that though it was sometimes used after christs ascension yet that cannot authorize the use of it now any more than of circumcision and other legal ordinances which in condescension to the weakness of believers in that day were also used after christs ascension yet are confessed by all not to be in force now for john as himself said was to decrease joh    0 which related to his ministry or dispensation not to his person now a decreasing implies a growing less or wearing away by degrees not all on a sudden or at once and therefore no wonder if his water baptism was continued for a time even after christs baptism of the holy spirit took place but as christs baptism was to increase so johns was to decrease till christs came to be all in all and johns water baptism wholly to give place let these things we say be duly weighed and we hope we shall not be blamed for leaving the baptism of john and cleaving to the baptism of christ  as for the six principles thou mentionest seeing thou have not declared what they are it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time but we recommend to thee that holy divine principle of light wherewith christ lights every man that comes into the world joh     in which light the nations of them that are saved shall walk rev       and we heartily desire thou may walk therein  t e  an account of tithes in general the only command from god that we read of in holy scripture for the payment of tithes was given by moses to the people of israel in the time of the levitical law then god first reserved to himself the tithe of the land of canaan lev     0 which he did for this reason that intending to take the tribe of levi more peculiarly into his service as he did numb     in stead of or in exchange for all the first born of israel ver       and    and chap   ver    having before reserved and appropriated the first born to himself ex      he might bestow those tithes on the levites for and toward the maintenance of that whole tribe as a reward for their service in the tabernacle of the congregation numb          and in lieu of and compensation for their part or share of and in the land of canaan which thereupon they were expressly cut off from ver  0          now although it was grounded on a principle of moral justice and equity that the levites thus engaged in a continual attendance on a public service and shut out from their share in the inheritance of the promised land should receive a sufficient maintenance from them for whom they performed that service and who enjoyed their part of the land yet the ascertaining of the quot a of that maintenance to the exact proportion of a tenth part of the increase of the land was not grounded on moral justice but had its dependence on the ceremonial law adapted and limited to the polity of that dispensation and people only and that it might not be extended beyond its appointed time and bounds it pleased the divine wisdom to subject it to such ceremonial circumstances as plainly rank it amongst those carnal ordinances rites or ceremonies which were imposed but till the time of reformation spoken of heb    0 for as god appointed the levites to be offered for a waveoffering by moses in the name and on the behalf of the children of israel when he said to moses thou shall bring the levites to the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shall gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together and thou shall bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites and aaron shall offer in the margin wave the levites before the lord for an offering in the margin waveoffering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord numb      0    so the tithes which were assigned for the maintenance of the levites were to be first offered by the people as an heave offering unto the lord  the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites etc numb       and even the tithe of those tithes which the levites were to yield unto the priests were to be offered by the levites as an heave offering to the lord before the priests might have them thus speak unto the levites said god to moses and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor etc thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give there of the lords heave offering to aaron the priest ver          this makes it evident beyond doubting that the tithes which were given by the people to the levites and by the levites to the priests under the law had their dependence on the ceremonial law as that priesthood had and were to stand no longer than that law and that priesthood stood which was but till shiloh came and by the offering of himself once for all had put an end to all the shadowy offerings under that law    this the author of the epistle to the hebrews did so well understand that he positively declared that the levitical priesthood being changed there was made of necessity a change also of the law of that law by which that priesthood and the maintenance of it had stood see heb      and it is also evident from scripture and primitive antiquity that neither the apostles themselves nor for some ages after them any of the christians did meddle with or at all concern themselves about tithes but let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated part viz offerings etc and of the ceremonial law of moses    but after that the mystery of iniquity which in the apostles time began to work   these     had wrought to that degree amongst some christians and had drawn them so far from the purity and simplicity of the gospel as to form and model the church in many things by and according to the jewish pattern amongst other ceremonial parts of the jewish religion which had been abolished by the coming and death of christ tithes were preached up again about the latter end of the fourth century and beginning of the fifth by some at first under the notion of alms and charity because part of the tithes under the levitical law were appointed for the maintenance of the fatherless the widow and the stranger deuteronomy          and by others as then still due by the mosaic law which had required them to be paid to the levitical priesthood which plea afterward corruptions increasing in the church and in those especially who were called the churchmen or clergy more and more prevailing the payment of tithes was reintroduced as due by those levitical laws which had been given to the israelites of old and upon that bottom tithes have stood been claimed and the claim defended unto this day    now not only he that thus claims and receives tithes but he that consents to and complies with such claim by paying tithes thus brought in and thus claimed does thereby implicitly and vertually at least deny that christ has put an end to the ceremonial law of moses and consequently that he is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind and that this may appear as plain as is possible i shall draw the matter into an argument thus to uphold any thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ is to deny that christ is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind but to receive or pay tithes now is to uphold a thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ therefore to receive or pay tithes now is to deny that christ is come and has suffered in his flesh for mankind the major must be granted and the minor i thus prove whatsoever was a part of the ceremonial law of moses was to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ but tithes were a part of the ceremonial law of moses therefore tithes were to be taken away and cease at and by the death of christ the major here again is unexceptionable and the minor is thus proved every heave offering among the jews was a part of the ceremonial law of moses but tithes were an heave offering among the jews number       therefore tithes were a part of the ceremonial law of moses     by this it appears that without regard had of the person to whom or the use for which tithes are paid the paying of tithes as well as the receiving them being a part of the abrogated ceremonial law of moses imports a denial of the coming and death of christ hence it is that tithes have been and are commonly called antichristian or against christ and hence has risen that saying often used not only by our ancient friends but by some of the martyrs long before viz he that pays tithes does thereby deny that christ is come in the flesh that conclusion could not have been drawn from the paying of tithes to a wrong ministry or for a wrong use only though such payment be evil nor could any thing justify that inference but the consideration that tithes depending on the ceremonial law of moses which must of necessity and in course fall and cease when christ suffered the paying of tithes carries in it a supposal that that law is not yet ceased but is still in force and consequently that christ whose death must needs have ended it is not yet come nor has yet suffered in his flesh for mankind    that other objection not less weighty than common against paying tithes to the clergy so called viz the unlawfulness of upholding a false ministry to perform a false worship being it self so clear and plain that it needs no illustration i shall in this discourse no further meddle with than to observe in my way how far it may affect those tithes also which the impropriators claim wherefore having premised what is said before concerning tithes in general to what hand or for what use soever paid let us now inquire into those tithes which are called impropriate  of impropriate tithes   that these tithes which are claimed by the impropriators are of the same nature and stand originally on the same root and ground on which the other tithes stand which are claimed and exacted by the priests is evident from hence that they were all heretofore these as well as those claimed by and paid to some or other of the romish clergy or their appendices the religious orders so called and upon the same foot that is these impropriate tithes were paid to those religious orders or houses as being due to god by virtue of the levitic law as well as the other tithes were paid to the parish priests on the same supposed right from the same law but how these tithes came to those religious houses first and how afterward from them to the impropriators is next to be inquired    until the lateran council so named because it was holden in the popes palace at rome called the lateran in the year      it was in the choice of every man to give his tithes to what church he pleased so he gave them to some church and even after that council the popes as heads of that church by their dispencing power did give leave to such as would sue and pay for it to give their tithes from the parish priest to such order of religious people whether monks friars or nuns as they were best affected to by which means the parish priests called seculars and those of the several religious orders called by a general title regulars being left to scramble as they could for maintenance the regulars  mendicant friars and others swarming in all places and pretending at least to greater sanctity and austerity of life than the parish priests prevailed with the people either living or dying to give not only very considerable estates in lands but also the tithes of other lands and of whole parishes from the parish priests to their religious houses or convents    the tithes or parsonages so given were then called appropriations because they were appropriated to this that or the other religious house or convent and i have read that there were in england about      parsonages thus appropriated and as tithes were then held to be due to god and holy church and those religious orders were reputed a part of that church so the tithes as well as the lands thus given them were continued to them and possessed by them till that general storm arose in k henry   his time which overturned those religious houses and orders together and here by the way it may be noted that while those religious houses stood a great part of the lands which had been given to them were by papal authority exempted from paying tithes whence it is that many of those estates which had belonged to those religious houses remain discharged from the burden of tithes still    as tithes were set up here on the authority of the levitic law and in imitation of the jewish practice consonant to that law so while those religious houses stood and the popes power prevailed here not only the seculars or parish priests but all those regulars who received tithes were bound to pay the tenths out of the tithes they received to the head of their church the pope as the levites under the ceremonial law were required to do to the priests    but after that k hen   upon a quarrel between the pope and him about his divorce from his first queen catharine which he earnestly desired and the pope would not grant fell off from the pope though not from popery for after that he retained the most pernicious doctrines of the romish church contained in the six articles and burnt some for denying them he threw off the popes supremacy here and assumed it to himself declaring himself and being declared first by the clergy in their convocation and soon after by lords and commons in parliament the only supreme head in earth of the church of england this was done by the statute of    hen   c   and therein it is enacted that the king his heirs and successors kings of this realm shall be taken accepted and reputed the only supreme head in earth of the church of england and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm as well the title and style thereof as all honors dignities praeeminences jurisdictions privileges authorities immunities profits and commodities to the said dignity of supreme head of the same church belonging and appertaining and shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit repress redress reform order correct restrain and amend all such errors heresies abuses offenses contempts and enormities whatsoever they be which by any manner of spiritual authority and jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed repressed ordered redressed corrected restrained or amended etc by which it is evident the intention of the parliament then was to transfer confer and settle unto and upon king henry all the powers profits and privileges which had been before supposed to be in or belong to or had been enjoyed or exercised by the pope while he was received as supreme head of the church    and therefore as the pope while he retained the supremacy here had the first fruits which are the profits of every spiritual or ecclesiastical living for one year upon the advancing of any ecclesiastical person to such a living and also the tenths that is the tenth part of all the tithes so these two revenues as appendant to that supremacy followed it being settled on the king in the same session of parliament wherein the supremacy was vested in him the words of the statute    h   c   relating to the first fruits are these that for the more surety of continuance and augmentation of his highness royal estate being not only now recognized as he always indeed has heretofore been the only supreme head in earth next and immediately under god of the church of england but also their most assured and undoubted natural sovereign liege lord and king etc it may therefore be enacted and ordained by etc that the kings highness his heirs and successors kings of this realm shall have and enjoy from time to time to endure for ever of every such person and persons which at any time after the first day of january next shall be nominated elected perfected presented collated or by any other means appointed to have any archbishopric abbacy monastery priory college hospital archdeaconry deanery provostship prebend parsonage vicarage chauntry freechappel or other dignity benefice office or promotion spiritual within this realm or elsewhere within any of the kings dominions of what name nature or quality soever they be or to whose foundation patronage or gift soever they belong the first fruits revenues and profits for one year of every such archbishopric bishopric abbey monastery priory  parsonage vicarage etc then after provisions made for finding out the value of those spiritual livings and for paying receiving and recovering those first fruits the settlement of the tenths that other part of the popes revenue upon the king follows in the same statute in these words  and over this be it enacted by authority aforesaid that the kings majesty his heirs and successors kings of this realm for more augmentation and maintenance of the royal estate of his imperial crown and dignity of supreme head of the church of england shall yearly have take enjoy and receive united and knit to his imperial crown for ever one yearly rent or pension amounting to the value of the tenth part of all the revenues rents farms tithes offerings emoluments and of all other profits as well called spiritual as temporal now appertaining or belonging or that hereafter shall belong to any archbishopric bishopric abbacy monastery priory archdeaconry deanery hospital college housecollegiate prebend cathedral church collegiatechurch conventualchurch parsonage vicarage chauntry freechappel or other benefice or promotion spiritual of what name nature or quality soever they be within any diocese of this realm or in wales etc and so goes on to direct the time place and manner of payment of these tenths with the penalty for nonpayment    thus were these two great pillars of papal supremacy first fruits and tenths transferred from the pope the old head to the king the new head of the church to support and maintain that headship in him as they had done before in the pope which ecclesiastical headship the king was no sooner possessed of than he began to exercise it amongst those religious orders suppressing as herbert in his life p     relates the observant friars at greenwich canterbury richmond and other places and substituting the augustines in their places which he did says herbert there for the finding out how his people would take his design of putting down religious houses to which he proceeded the next year beginning with the lesser sort and suppressing all those monasteries priories and other religious houses of monks canons and nuns which had not in lands tenements rents tithes portions and other hereditaments above the clear yearly value of two hundred pounds by which means     of those religious houses being dissolved a revenue of above thirty thousand pounds a year beside an hundred thousand pounds in money raised by sale at low rates of the goods and chattels of those houses a sum not small in that age came to the king for support of his ecclesiastical supremacy    the statute which countenanced this proceeding is the    of hen   cap    and a new court called the court of augmentations was then erected and settled by parliament for receiving and ordering these new accessional revenues the act for which in our printed statute books is set before that for the suppression of those lesser monasteries but though that for suppressing those monasteries be by an hysterosis set after that for establishing the court of augmentations yet it must have been made before it for it is recited in it    in that statute    hen      for suppressing those smaller monasteries mention is made of monasteries abbeys and priores which within one year before the making of that statute had been given and granted to the king by any abbot prior abbess or prioress under their conventseal or that otherwise had been suppressed or dissolved all which were by that statute confirmed to the king and to all those unto whom the king either then before had conveyed or then after should convey any part or parts thereof to hold to them in like manner form and conditions as the abbots priors abbesses prioresses and other chief governors of any religious houses which had the same might or ought to have had if they had not been suppressed for upon the kings falling as was noted before upon the observant friars at greenwich and other places some of the more considerate of the abbots priors etc seeing the storm arising which then threatened and soon after brought destruction on those orders thought it better policy to comply with the times and surrender upon terms in hopes to save something than hold out to the last as many did and lose all   0 and indeed the suppressing of those     lesser monasteries struck so great a fear into the greater that the statute made four years after    hen   cap    whereby the rest of the religious houses were given to the king recites that diverse and sundry abbots etc of their own free and voluntary mind since the fourth of feb in the    of his reign had by due order of law and by their sufficient writings of record under their convent and common seals severally given granted and confirmed to the king his heirs and successors for ever all their said monasteries abbeys priories etc and all the manors lordships lands tenements tithes etc to them belonging and had voluntarily renounced left and forsaken the same and therefore in the said statute it is enacted that the king shall have hold etc all such late monasteries etc and all the sites circuits manners lands tenements etc thereunto belonging in the ennumeration of the particulars whereof which are many tithes parsonages appropriate and vicarages are expressly mentioned all which as likewise all other religious houses with the revenues thereof which should there after be dissolved suppressed relinquished forfeited or given to the king and which by that statute are settled on him he was to hold and enjoy in as large and ample manner and form as the late abbots etc had held or of right ought to have held the same in right of their said late monasteries etc     from hence this observation arises that since those religious orders did hold the tithes which they possessed upon the supposed right of their being due to god and holy church which they held themselves and were by others holden to be a part of and the king received those tithes and parsonages amongst the rest of the revenues of the religious houses as well those that were resigned to him by the governors of those houses themselves as the rest which by act of parliament he took upon the same right on which those religious orders had holden them he also must hold them upon that supposed right of their being due to god and holy church which he then held himself and was holden by all both clergy and laity to be the only supreme head of here in england and as upon that supposed right of their being due to god and holy church on which the religious houses held them they passed them from those houses to the king as supreme head of the church so on the same supposed right of their being due to god and holy church they passed from the king as supreme head of the church to those whether spiritual or lay persons unto whom the king granted them for they stuck not long in the kings hand but he of his own mere motion liberality and benignity as the statute in the   d year of his reign cap    relates had by that time freely given and granted etc unto diverse and sundry of the lords and nobles as well spiritual as temporal and unto diverse and many other persons and bodies politic etc diverse and many sundry honors castles manors lands tenements and among the rest rectories etc     but great care was taken to retain and keep up the character of spirituality which had formerly been stamped upon those rectories parsonages and other revenues by tithes into what hands soever they were passed and therefore by the statute of    hen   cap   in case of withholding or denying to pay the tithes all persons claiming them impropriators as well as priests are restrained from suing in the temporal courts and limited to the ecclesiastical or spiritual courts only for the recovery of them     and that they might still have dependence upon the supremacy care was taken from the first by the statute of    hen   cap    that none of these estates which then had come or should come from any of those religious houses to the king should pass from him by grant to any person whatsoever without an express reservation of a tenth and in a subsequent statute    hen   cap    complaint being made that although out of those grants which the king had made to sundry persons of honors castles manors lands tenements rectories etc which were under the survey of the court of augmentations the tenths had been reserved yet the persons unto whom such grants had been made though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the issues and profits of those lands rectories etc had not paid the reserved tenths to the king provision was made in that statute by several forfeitures and nominepoenaes to enforce the payment thereof  nor was care taken of the ecclesiastical head the king only but of the ecclesiastical members the clergy also many if not most of which had pensions or portions issuing out of those parsonages rectories or other spiritual benefices as they were counted which the religious orders held for besides that upon the increasing of those appropriations whereby the parish priests were pinched there had been provision made early in the time of k richard the second for the vicars as well as for the poor the statute of    ric     directing that upon the appropriation of such churches the diocaesian of the place or bishop of the diocese shall ordain according to the value of such churches a convenient sum of money to be paid and distributed yearly of the fruits and profits of the same churches to the poor parishioners and also that the vicar be well and sufficiently endowed which statute so far at least as concerned the vicars was afterward confirmed by another statute of   hen   cap    which expressly ordains that the statute of appropriation of churches and of the endowment of vicars in the same made the   th year of k ric the   d be firmly holden and put in due execution i say besides these the stat of    and    of hen   cap    takes notice that the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons of both provinces of canterbury and york having formerly in right of their churches received out of the late monasteries etc diverse pensions and other profits had after the dissolution of those houses been disturbed and denied of the having receiving and gathering of the said pensions etc whereupon it is in the said statute enacted that if any person or persons being farmer or occupier of any manners lands tenements parsonages benefices or other hereditaments of any of the said late monasteries etc by the kings gift grant sale exchange or otherwise out of which any such pensions etc have been heretofore lawfully going answered or paid to any of the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons abovesaid do at any time after the first day of april next coming wilfully deny the payment thereof then it shall be lawful for the said archbishops bishops archdeacons or other ecclesiastical persons aforesaid being so denied to be satisfied and paid thereof etc to proceed in the ecclesiastical courts for the recovery thereof     by which statute all pensions payable to archbishops bishops archdeacons or other ecclesiastical person that had been possessed thereof at or within ten years next before the time of the dissolution of the monasteries out of the parsonages rectories or tithes holden by the said monasteries etc are confirmed and assured to such archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastical persons still     so that upon the whole besides what has been said of tithes in general with respect to the judaizing and denying of christ by the paying thereof which extends a like to all tithes those claimed by the impropriator as well as those claimed by the priest the impropriate tithes being generally charged either with some payment to the vicars for enlarging of their stipends or with pensions to the archbishops bishops archdeacons and other ecclesiastics all such of them as are so charged come under the same objection that is made against paying to the priest viz the upholding of a false ministry to perform a false worship and if any impropriation may be supposed to be free from all those charges yet all impropriators as well as priests being bound to pay the reserved tenths to the king as supreme head of the church which were wont before to be paid to the pope while he was owned for head of the church the paying of tithes to an impropriator is a recognizing and acknowledging of a man bad or good popish or protestant as it happens to be the only supreme head on earth of the church which is to set an human head to a spiritual body and to divest and deprive our lord jesus christ of his undoubted right who the apostle says expressly is the head of the body the church col      and that not of mans making or appointing but god says the apostle has given him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body ephesians          t e  finis
