spring a poem  spring a poem  by mr thomson  et nunc omnis ager nunc omnis parturit arbos nunc frondent silvae nunc formosissimus annus virg london printed and sold by a millar at buchanans head over against st clements church in the strand and g strahan at the golden ball in cornhill mdccxxviii  price  s   d  to the right honorable the countess of hertford madam i have always observed that in addresses of this nature the general taste of the world demands ingenious turns of wit and disguised artful periods instead of an open sincerity of sentiment flowing in a plain expression from what secret impatience of the justest praise when bestowed on others this often proceeds rather than a pretended delicacy is beyond my purpose here to enquire but as nothing is more foreign to the disposition of a soul sincerely pleased with the contemplation of what is beautiful and excellent than wit and turn i have too much respect for your ladyships character either to touch it in that gay trifling manner or venture on a particular detail of those truly amiable qualities of which it is composed a mind exalted pure and elegant a heart overflowing with humanity and the whole train of virtues thence derived that give a pleasing spirit to conversation an engaging simplicity to the manners and form the life to harmony are rather to be felt and silently admired than expressed i have attempted in the following poem to paint some of the most tender beauties and delicate appearances of nature how much in vain your ladyships taste will i am afraid but too soon discover yet would it still be a much easier task to find expression for all that variety of color form and fragrance which enrich the season i describe than to speak the many nameless graces and native riches of a mind capable so much at once to relish solitude and adorn society to whom then could these sheets be more properly inscribed than to you madam whose influence in the world can give them the protection they want while your fine imagination and intimate acquaintance with rural nature will recommend them with the greatest advantage to your favorable notice happy if i have hit any of those images and correspondent sentiments your calm evening walks in the most delightful retirement have often inspired i could add too that as this poem grew up under your encouragement it has therefore a natural claim to your patronage should you read it with approbation it is music shall not droop and should it have the good fortune to deserve your smiles it is roses shall not wither but where the subject is so tempting lest i begin my poem before the dedication is ended i here break short and beg leave to subscribe my self with the highest respect  madam your most obedient humble servant james thomson  advertisement that the following poem appears at present in public is not any way in prejudice of the proposals i lately published for printing the four seasons etc by subscription but at the solicitation of some of my friends who had seen it in manuscript and the better to carry on a work i stand engaged to finish for subscription is now at its last gasp and the world seems to have got the better of that manyheaded monster however those gentlemen and ladies who have been or may hereafter be so good as to honor me with their names shall have the book next winter according to my proposals and if it should in any degree be judged worthy their encouragement i have my best reward  spring a poem come gentle spring aetherial mildness come and from the bosom of yon dropping cloud while music wakes around veiled in a shower of shadowing roses on our plains descend oh hertford fitted or to shine in courts with unaffected grace or walk the plain with innocence and meditation joined in soft assemblage listen to my song which thy own season paints when nature all is blooming and benevolent like thee and see where surly winter passes off far to the north and calls his ruffian blasts his blasts obey and quit the howling hill the shattered forest and the ravaged vale while softer gales succeed at whose kind touch dissolving snows in sudden torrents lost the mountains lift their green heads to the sky as yet the trembling year is unconfirmd and winter often at eve resumes the breeze chills the pale morn and bids his driving sleets deform the day delightless so that scarce the bittern knows his time with bill ingulpht to shake the sounding marsh or from the shore the plovers theirs to scatter over the heath and sing their wild notes to the listening waste at last from aries rolls the bounteous sun and the bright bull receives him then no more the expansive atmosphere is cramped with cold but full of life and vivifying soul lifts the light clouds sublime and spreads them thin fleecy and white over allsurrounding heaven forth fly the tepid aires and unconfined unbinding earth the moving softness strays joyous the impatient husbandman perceives relenting nature and his lusty steers drives from their stalls to where the wellusd plow lies in the furrow loosened from the frost there unrefusing to the harnessed yoke they lend their shoulder and begin their toil cheered by the simple song and soaring lark meanwhile incumbent over the shining share the master leans removes the obstructing clay winds the whole work and sidelong lays the glebe white through the neighbring fields the sower stalks with measured step and liberal throws the grain into the faithful bosom of the earth the harrow follows harsh and shuts the scene be gracious heaven for now laborious man has done his due ye fostering breezes blow ye softening dews ye tender showers descend and temper all thou influential sun into the perfect year nor ye who live in luxury and ease in pomp and pride think these lost themes unworthy of your ear twas such as these the rural maro sung to the full roman court in all it is height of elegance and taste the sacred plow employed the kings and fathers of mankind in ancient times and some with whom compared youre but the beings of a summers day have held the scale of justice shook the lance of mighty war then with descending hand unused to little delicacies feizd the plow and greatly independent lived ye generous britons cultivate the plow and over your hills and long withdrawing vales let autumn spread his treasures to the sun luxuriant and unbounded as the sea far through his azure turbulent extent your empire owns and from a thousand shores wafts all the pomp of life into your ports so with superior boon may your rich soil exuberant natures better blessings pour over every land the naked nations cloth and be the exhaustless granary of the world nor through the lenient air alone this change delicious breathes the penetrative sun his force deepdarting to the dark retreat of vegetation sets the steaming power at large to wander over the vernant earth in various hues but chiefly thee gay green thou smiling natures universal robe united light and shade where the sight dwells with growing strength and evernew delight from the moist meadow to the brownbrowd hill led by the breeze the vivid verdure runs and swells and deepens to the cherished eye the hawthorn whitens and the juicy groves put forth their buds unfolding by degrees till the whole leafy forest stands displayed in full luxuriance to the sighing gales while the deer rustle through the twining brake and the birds sing concealed at once arrayed in all the colors of the flushing year by natures swift and secretworking hand the garden glows and fills the liberal air with lavish fragrance while the promised fruit lies yet a little embrio unperceived within it is crimson folds now from the town buried in smoke and sleep and noisome damps often let me wander over the dewy fields where freshness breathes and dash the lucid drops from the bent bush as through the fuming maze of sweetbriar hedges i pursue my walk or taste the smell of dairy or ascend some eminence augusta in thy plains and see the country fardiffusd around one boundless blush one snowempurpled shower of mingled blossoms where the raptured eye travels from joy to joy and hid beneath the fair profusion yellow autumn spies if brushed from russian wilds a cutting gale rise not and scatter from his foggy wings the bitter mildew or dryblowing breathe untimely frost before whose baleful blast the fullblown spring through all her foliage shrinks into a smutty widedejected waste for often engendered by the hazy north myriads on myriads insectarmies waft keen in the poisoned breeze and wasteful eat through buds and bark even to the heart of oak their eager way a feeble race scarce seen save to the prying eye yet famine waits on their corrosive course and starves the year sometimes over cities as they steer their flight where rising vapor melts their wings away gazed by the astonished crowd the horrid shower descends and hence the skillful farmer chaff and blazing straw before his orchard burns till all involved in smoke the latent foe from every cranny suffocated falls or onions steaming hot beneath his trees exposes fatal to the frosty tribe nor from their friendly task the busy bill of little trooping birds instinctive scares these are not idle philosophic dreams full nature swarms with life the unfaithful fen in putrid steams emits the living cloud of pestilence through subterranean cells where searching sunbeams never found a way earth animated heaves the flowery leaf wants not it is soft inhabitants the stone hard as it is in every winding pore holds multitudes but chief the forestboughs which dance unnumberd to the inspiring breeze the downy orchard and the melting pulp of mellow fruit the nameless nations feed of evanescent insects where the pool stands mantled over with green invisible amid the floating verdure millions stray each liquid too whether of acid taste milky or strong with various forms abounds nor is the lucid stream nor the pure air though one transparent vacancy they seem devoid of theirs even animals subsist on animals in infinite descent and all so fine adjusted that the loss of the least species would disturb the whole stranger than this the inspective glass confirms and to the curious gives the amazing scenes of lessning life by wisdom kindly hid from eye and ear of man for if at once the worlds in worlds enclosed were pushed to light seen by his sharpened eye and by his ear intensely bended heard from the choice cate the freshest viands and the brightest wines he would turn abhorrent and in dead of night when silence sleeps over all be stunned with noise the northeast spends his rage and now shut up within his iron caves the effusive south warms the wide air and over the void of heaven breathes the big clouds with vernal showers distent at first a dusky wreath they seem to rise scarce staining ether but by fast degrees in heaps on heaps the doubling vapor sails along the loaded sky and mingling thick sits on the horizon round a settled gloom not such as wintry storms on mortals shed oppressing life but lovely gentle kind and full of every hope and every joy the wish of nature gradual sinks the breeze into a perfect calm that not a breath is heard to quiver through the closing woods or rustling turn the manytwinkling leaves of aspin tall the uncurling floods diffused in glassy breadth seem through delusive lapse forgetful of their courseit is silence all and pleasing expectation herds and flocks drop the dry sprig and muteimploring eye the falling verdure hushed in short suspense the plumy people streak their wings with oil and wait the approaching sign to strike at once into the general choir even mountains vales and forests seem expansive to demand the promised sweetness man superior walks amid the glad creation musing praise and looking lively gratitude at last the clouds consign their treasures to the fields and softly shking on the dimply pool prelusive drops let all their moisture flow in large effusion over the freshend world it is scarce to patter heard the stealing shower by such as wander through the forestwalks beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves but who would hold the shade while heaven descends in universal bounty shedding herbs and fruits and flowers on natures ample lap imagination fired prevents their growth and while the verdant nutriment distills beholds the kindling country color round thus all day long the fulldistended clouds indulge their genial stores and wellshowrd earth is deep enriched with vegetable life till in the western sky the downward sun looks out illustrious from amid the flush of broken clouds gayshifting to his beam the rapid radiance instantaneous strikes the illumined mountain through the forest streams shakes on the floods and in a yellow mist farsmoaking over the interminable plain in twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems moist bright and green the landscape laughs around full swell the woods their every music wakes mixed in wild consort with the warbling brooks increased the unnumberd bleatings of the hills the hollow lows responsive from the vales whence blending all the sweetened zephir springs meantime retracted from yon eastern cloud bestriding earth the grand aetherial bow shoots up immense and every hue unfolds in fair proportion running from the red to where the violet fades into the sky here mighty newton the dissolving clouds are as they scatter round thy numerous prism untwisting to the philosophic eye the various twine os light by thee pursued through all the mingling maze not so the swain he wondering views the bright enchantment bend delightful over the radiant fields and runs to catch the falling glory but amazed beholds the amusive arch before him fly then vanish quite away still night succeeds a softened shade and saturated earth awaits the morning beam to give again transmuted soon by natures chemistry the blooming blessings of the former day then spring the living herbs profusely wild over all the deepgreen earth beyond the power of botanist to number up their tribes whether he steals along the lonely dale in silent search or through the forest rank with what the dull incurious weeds account bursts his blind way or climbs the mountainrock fired by the nodding verdure of its brow with such a liberal hand has nature slung their seeds abroad blown them about in winds innumerous mixed then with the nursing mold the moistening current and prolific rain but who their virtues can declare who pierce with holy eye into these secret stores of life and health and joy the food of man while yet he lived in innocence and told a length of golden years unfleshd in blood a stranger to the savage arts of life death rapine carnage surfeit and disease the lord and not the tyrant of the world then the glad morning waked the gladdend race of uncorrupted men nor blushed to see the sluggard sleep beneath her sacred beam for their light slumbers gently fumed away and up they rose as vigorous as the sun or to the culture of the willing glebe or to the cheerful tendance of the flock meantime the song went round and dance and sport wisdom and friendly talk successive stole their hours away while in the rosy vale love breathed his infant sighs from anguish free fragrant with bliss and only wept for joy nor yet injurious act nor surly deed was known among these happy sons of heaven for reason and benevolence were law harmonious nature too looked smiling on clean shone the skies cooled with eternal gales and balmy spirit all the youthful sun shot his best rays and still the gracious clouds dropped fatness down as over the swelling mead the herds and flocks commixing played secure which when emergent from the gloomy wood the glaring lion saw his horrid heart was meekend and he joined his sullen joy for music held the whole in perfect peace soft sighed the flute the tender voice was heard warbling the joyous heart the woodlands round applied their quire and winds and waters flowed in consonance  such were these prime of days this to the poets gave the golden age when as they sung in allegoric phraze the sailorpine had not the nations yet in commerce mixed for every country teemed with every thing spontaneous harvests waved still in a sea of yellow plenty round the forest was the vineyard where untaught to climb unprund and wild the juicy grape burst into floods of wine the knotted oak shook from his boughs the long transparent streams of honey creeping through the matted grass the uncultivated thorn a ruddy shower of fruitage shed on such as sat below in blooming ease and from brown labor free save what the copious gathering grateful gave the rivers foamed with nectar or diffuse silent and soft the milky maze devolved nor had the spongy fullexpanded fleece yet drunk the tyrian die the stately ram shone through the mead in native purple clad or milder saffron and the dancing lmb the vivid crimson to the sun disclosed nothing had power to hurt the savage soul yet untransfusd  the tygers heart burned not his bowels nor his gamesome paw drove on the fleecy partners of his play while from the flowery brake the serpent rolled his fairer spires and played his pointless tongue but now whateer these gaudy fables meant and the white minutes that they shadowed out are found no more amid these iron times these dregs of life in which the human mind has lost that harmony ineffable which forms the soul of happiness and all is off the poise within the passions all have burst their bounds and reason half extinct or impotent or else approving sees the foul disorder anger storms at large without an equal cause and fell revenge supports the falling rage close envy bites with venomed tooth while weak unmanly fear full of frail fancies loosens every power even love itself is bitterness of soul a pleasing anguish pining at the heart hope sickens with extravagance and grief of life impatient into madness swells or in dead silence wastes the weeping hours these and a thousand new emotions more that from their mixture spring distract the mind with endless tumult whence resulting rise the selfish thought a listless inconcern cold and averting from our neighbors good then dark disgust and malice winding wiles sneaking deceit and coward villainy at last unruly hatred lewd reproach convulsive wrath and thoughtless fury quick to every evil deed even natures self is deemed vindictive to have changed her course henoe in old time they say a deluge came when the drycrumbling orb of earth which arched the imprisoned deep around impetuous rushed with ruin inconceivable at once into the gulf and over the highest hills widedashd the waves in undulation vast till from the center to the streaming clouds a shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe the seasons since as hoar tradition tells have kept their constant chase the winter keen poured out his waste of snows and summer shot his pestilential heats great spring before greend all the year and fruits and blossoms blushed in social sweetness on the selfsame bough clear was the temperate air an even calm perpetual reigned save what the zephirs bland breathed over the blue expanse for then nor storms were taught to blow nor hurricanes to rage sound slept the waters no sulphurous glooms swelled in the sky and sent the lightning forth while sickly damps and cold autumnal fogs sat not pernicious on the springs of life but now from clear to cloudy moist to dry and hot to cold in restless change revolved our droopipg days are dwindled down to naught the fleeting shadow of a winters sun and yet the wholesome herb neglected dies in lone obscurity unprizd for food although the pure exhilerating soul of nutriment and health salubrious breathes by heaven infused along it is secret tubes for with hot ravine fired ensanguind man is now become the lion of the plain and worse the wolf who from the nightly fold fiercedrags the bleating prey never drunk her milk nor wore her warming fleece nor has the steer at whose strong chest the deadly tiger hangs ever plowed for him they too are tempered high with hunger stung and wild necessity nor lodges pity in their shaggy breasts but man whom nature formed of milder clay with every kind emotion in his heart and taught alone to weep while from her lap she pours ten thousand delicacies herbs and fruits as numerous as the drops of rain and beams which gave them birth shall he fair form who wears sweet smiles and looks erect on heaven ever stoop to mingle with the prowling herd and dip his tongue in blood the beast of prey it is true deserves the fate in which he deals him from the thicket let the hardy youth provoke and foaming through the awakened woods with every nerve pursue but you ye flocks what have ye done ye peaceful people what to merit death you who have given us milk in luscious streams and lent us your own coat against the winters cold whose usefulness in living only lies and the plain ox that harmless honest guileless animal in what has he offended he whose toil patient and everready clothes the fields with all the pomp of harvest shall he bleed and wrestling groan beneath the cruel hands even of the clowns he feeds and that perhaps to swell the riot of the gathering feast won by his labor thus the feeling heart would tenderly suggest but it is enough in this late age adventurous to have touched light on the numbers of the samian sage high heaven beside forbids the daring strain whose wisest will has fixed us in a state which must not yet to pure perfection rise but yonder breathing prospect bids the muse throw all her beauty forth that daubing all will be to what i gaze for who can paint like nature can imagination boast amid his gay creation hues like here is and can he mix them with that matchless skill and lay them on so delicately sweet and lose them in each other as appears in every bud that blows if fancy then unequal fails beneath the lovely task ah what shall language do ah where find words tinged with so many colors and whose power to life approaching may perfume my lays with that fine oil these aromatic gales which inexhaustive flow continual round yet though successless will the toil delight come then ye virgins and ye youths whose hearts have felt the raptures of refining love oh come and while the rosyfooted may steals blushing on together let us walk the morning dews and gather in their prime freshblooming flavours to deck the flowing hair and for a breast which can improve their sweets see where the winding vale her lavish stores irriguous spreads see how the lilly drinks the latent rill scarce oozing through the grass of growth luxuriant or the humid bank profusely climbs turgent in every pore the gummy moisture shines new luster lends and feeds the spirit that diffusive round refreshes all the dale long let us walk where the breeze blows from yon extended field of blossomed beans arabia cannot boast a fuller gale of joy than liberal thence breathes through the sense and takes the ravished soul nor is the meadow worthless of our foot full of fresh verdure and unnumberd flowers the negligence of nature wide and wild where undisguisd by mimic art she shows unbounded beauty to the boundless eye it is here that their delicious task the bees in swarming millions tend around athwart this way and that the busy nations fly cling to the bud and with inserted tube it is soul it is sweetness and it is manna suck the little chemist thus allmoving heaven has taught and often of bolder wing he dares the purple heath or where the wildthyme grow and yellow loads him with the luscious spoil at length the finished garden to the view it is vistas opens and it is alleys green snatched through the verdant maze the hurried eye distracted wanders now the bowery walk of covert close where scarce a speck of day falls on the lengthened gloom protracted darts now meets the bending sky the river now dimpling along the breezyruffled lake the forest running round the rising spire the aetherial mountain and the distant main but why so far excursive when at hand along the blushing borders dewybright and in yon mingled wilderness of flowers fairhanded spring unbosoms every grace throws out the snowdrop and the crocus first the daisy primrose violet darkly blue softbending cowslips and of nameless dies anemonies auriculas a tribe peculiar powdered with a shining sand renunculas and iris manyhued then comes the tuliprace where beauty plays her gayest freaks from family diffused to family as flies the fatherdust the varied colors run and while they break on the charmed florists eye he wondering stands and newflushd glories all ecstatic marks nor hyacinths are wanting nor junquils of potent fragrance nor narcissus white nor deep carnations nor enameled pinks and showered from every bush the damaskrose infinite numbers delicacies smells with hues on hues expression cannot paint the breath of nature and her endless bloom hail mighty being universal soul of heaven and earth essential presence hail to thee i bend the knee to thee my thoughts continual climb who with a masterhand have the great whole into perfection touched by thee the various vegetative tribes wrapped in a filmy net and clad with leaves draw the live ether and imbibe the dew by thee disposed into cogenial soils stands each attractive plant and sucks and swells the juicy tide a twining mass of tubes at thy command the vernal sun awakes the torpid sap detruded to the root by wintry winds that now in fluent dance and lively fermentation mounting spreads all this innumerouscolourd scene of things ascending from the vegetable world to higher life with equal wing ascend my panting muse and hark how loud the woods invite you forth in all your gayest trim lend me your song ye nightingales oh pout the mazyrunning soul of melody into my varied verse while i deduce from the first note the hollow cuckoo sings the symphony of spring and touch a theme unknown to fame the passion of the groves just as the spirit of love is sent abroad warm through the vital air and on their hearts harmonious seizes the gay troops begin in gallant thought to plume their painted wings and try again the longforgotten strain at first faintwarbled but no sooner grows the soft infusion prevalent and wide than all alive at once their joy overflows in music unconfined upsprings the lark shrillvoiced and loud the messenger of morn ere yet the shadows fly he mounted sings amid the dawning clouds and from their haunts calls up the tuneful nations every copse thickwove and tree irregular and bush bending with dewy moisture over the heads of the coy quiristers that lodge within are prodigal of harmony the thrush and woodlark over the kindcontending throng superior heard run through the sweetest length of notes when listening philomela deigns to let them joy and purposes in thought elate to make her night excel their day the blackbird whistles from the thorny brake the mellow bullfinch answers from the grove nor are the linnets over the flowering furze poured out profusely silent joined to these thousands beside thick as the covering leaves they warble under or the nitid hues which speck them over their modulations mix mellifluous the jay the rook the daw and all these jangling pipes when heard alone here aid the consort while the wooddove breathes a melancholy murmur through the whole it is love creates their gaiety and all this waste of music is the voice of love which even to birds and beasts the tender arts of pleasing teaches hence the glossy kind try every winning way inventive love can dictate and in fluttering courtship pour their little souls before her wide around respectful first in airy rings they rove endeavoring by a thousand tricks to catch the cunning conscious halfaverted glance of their regardless charmer should she seem softening the least approvance to bestow their colors burnish and by hope inspired they brisk advance then on a sudden struck retire disordered then again approach and throwing out the last efforts of love in fond rotation spread the spotted wing and shiver every feather with desire connubial leagues agreed to the deep woods they haste away each as their fancy leads pleasure or food or latent safety prompts that natures great command may be obeyed nor all these sweet sensations they perceive indulged in vain some to the hollyhedge nestling repair and to the thicket some some to the rude protection of the thorn resolve to trust their young the clefted tree offers it is kind concealment to a few their food it is insects and it is moss their nests others apart far in the grassy dale their humble texture weave but most delight in unfrequented glooms or shaggy banks steep and divided by a babbling brook whose murmurs sooth them all the livelong day when for a season fixed among the roots of hazel pendant over the plaintive stream they frame the first foundation of their domes dry sprigs of trees in artful manner laid and bound with clay together now it is naught but hurry hurry through the busy air beat by unnumberd wings the swallow sweeps the slimy pool to build his hanging house ingeniously intent often from the back of herds and flocks a thousand tugging bills pluck hair and wool and often when unobserved steal from the barn the straw till soft and warm clean and complete their habitation grows meantime the patient dam assiduous sits not to be tempted from her tender task or by sharp hunger or by smooth delight though the whole loosened spring around her blows her sympathizing lover takes his stand high on the opponent bank and ceaseless sings the tedious time away or else supplies her place a moment while she sudden flits to pick the scanty meal the appointed time with pious toil fulfilled the callow young warmed and expanded into perfect life their brittle bondage break and come to light a helpless family demanding food with constant clamor oh what passions then what melting sentiments of kindly care seize the new parents hearts away they fly affectionate and undesiring bear the most delicious morsel to their young which equally distributed again the search begins so pitiful and poor a gentle pair on providential heaven cast as they weeping eye their clamant train check their own appetites and give them all nor is the courage of the fearful kind nor is their cunning less should some rude foot their woody haunts molest stealthy aside into the center of a neighbring bush they drop and whirring thence alarmed deceive the rambling schoolboy hence around the head of traveller the whitewingd plover wheels her sounding flight and then directly on in long excursion skims the level lawn to tempt you from her nest the wildduck hence over the rough moss and over the trackless waste the heathhen flutters as if hurt to lead the hot pursuing spaniel far astray be not the muse ashamed here to bemoan her brothers of the grove by tyrant man inhuman caught and in the narrow cage from liberty confined and boundless air dull are the pretty slaves their plumage dull ragged and all it is brightning luster lost nor is that luscious wildness in their notes that warbles from the beech oh then desist ye friends of harmony this barbarous art forbear if innocence and music can win on your hearts or piety persuade but let not chief the nightingale lament her ruined care too delicately framed to brook the harsh confinement of the cage often when returning with her loaded bill the astonished mother finds a vacant nest by the hard hands of unrelenting clowns robbed to the ground the vain provision falls her pinions ruffle and lowdrooping scarce can bear the mourner to the poplar shade where allabandond to despair she sings her sorrows through the night and on the bough sadsitting still at every dying fall takes up again her lamentable strain of winding woe till wide around the woods sigh at her song and with her wail resound and now the feathered youth their former bounds ardent disdain and weighing often their wings demand the free possession of the sky but this glad office more and then dissolves parental love at once for needless grown unlavish wisdom never works in vain it is on some evening sunny grateful mild when naught but balm is breathing through the woods with yellow luster bright that the new tribes visit the spacious heavens and look abroad on natures common far as they can see or wing their range and pasture over the boughs dancing about still at the giddy verge their resolution fails their pinions still in loose libration stretched the void abrupt trembling refuse till down before them fly the parentguides and chide exhort command or push them off the surging air receives the plumy burden and their selftaught wings winnow the waving element on ground alighted bolder up again they lead farther and farther on the lengthning flight till vanished every fear and every power roused into life and action in the void the exonerd parents see their soaring race and once rejoicing never know them more high from the summit of a craggy cliff hung over the green sea grudging at it is base the royal eagle draws his young resolved to try them at the sun strongpouncd and bright as burnished day they up the blue sky wind leaving dull sight below and with fixed gaze drink in their native noon the fatherking claps his glad pinions and approves the birth and should i wander to the rural seat whose aged oaks and venerable gloom invite the noisy rook with pleasure there i might the various polity survey of the mixed household kind the careful hen calls all her chirping family around fed and defended by the fearless cock whose breast with ardour flames as on he walks graceful and crows defiance in the pond the finelycheckerd duck before her train rows garrulous the statelysailing swan gives out his snowy plumage to the gale and arching proud his neck with oary feet bears onward fierce and beats you from the bank protective of his young the turkey nigh loudthreatning reddens while the peacock spreads his everycolourd glory to the sun and swims in floating majesty along over the whole homely scene the cooing dove flies thick in amorous chase and wanton rolls the glancing eye and turns the changeful neck while thus the gentle tenants of the shade indulge their purer loves the rougher world of brutes below rush furious into flame and fierce desire through all his lusty veins the bull deepscorcht receives the raging fire of pasture sick and negligent of food scarceseen he wades among the yellow broom while over his brawny back the rambling sprays luxuriant shoot or through the mazy wood dejected wanders nor the enticing bud crops though it presses on his careless sense for wrapped in mad imagination he roars for the fight and idly butting feigns a rival gored in every knotty trunk such should he meet the bellowing war begins their eyes flash fury to the hollowed earth whence the sand flies they mutter bloody deeds and groaning vast the impetuous battle mix while the fair heifer redolent in view stands kindling up their rage the trembling steed with this hot impulse seized in every nerve nor hears the rein nor heeds the sounding whip blows are not felt but tossing high his head and by the wellknown joy to distant plains attracted strong all wild he bursts away over rocks and woods and craggy mountains flies and neighing on the aerial summit takes the informing gale then steepdescending stems the headlong torrents foaming down the hills even where the madness of the straightened stream turns in black eddies round such is the force with which his frantic heart and sinews swell nor undelighted by the boundless spring are the broad monsters of the deep through all their oozy caves and gelid kingdoms roused they flounce and tumble in unwieldy joy dire were the strain and dissonant to sing the cruel raptures of the savage kind how the red lioness her whelps forgot amid the thoughtless fury of her heart the lank rapacious wolf the unshapely bear the spotted tiger fellest of the fell and all the terrors of the lybian swain by this new flame their native wrath sublimed roam the resounding waste in fiercer bands and growl their horrid loves but this the theme i sing transported to the british fair forbids and leads me to the mountainbrow where sits the shepherd on the grassy turf inhaling healthful the descending sun around him feeds his manybleating flock of various cadence and his sportive lambs this way and that convolvd in friskful glee their little frolicks play and now the race invites them forth when swift the signal given they start away and sweep the circly mound that runs around the hill the rampart once of iron war in ancient barbarous times when disunited britain ever bled lost in eternal broil ere yet she grew to this deeplaid indissoluble state where wealth and commerce lift their golden head and over our labors liberty and law illustrious watch the wonder of a world what is this mighty breath ye curious say which in a language rather felt than heard instructs the fowls of heaven and through their breasts these arts of love diffuses  what but god inspiring god who boundless spirit all and unremitting energy pervades subsists adjusts and agitates the whole he ceaseless works alone and yet alone seems not to work so exquisitely framed is this complex amazing scene of things but though concealed to every purer eye the informing author in his works appears his grandeur in the heavens the sun and moon whether that fires the day or falling this pours out a lucid softness over the night are but a beam from him the glittering stars by the deep ear of meditation heard still in their midnight watches sing of him he nods a calm the tempest blows his wrath roots up the forest and oerturns the main the thunder is his voice and the red flash his speedy sword of justice at his touch the mountains flame he takes the solid earth and rocks the nations nor in these alone in every common instance god is seen and to the man who casts his mental eye abroad unnoticd wonders rise but chief in thee boon spring and in thy softer scenes the smiling god appears while water earth and air attest his bounty which instills into the brutes this temporary thought and annual melts their undesigning hearts profusely thus in tenderness and joy still let my song a nobler note assume and sing the infusive force of spring on man when heaven and earth as if contending vie to raise his being and serene his soul can he forbear to smile with nature can the stormy passions in his bosom roll while every gale is peace and every grove is melody hence from the bounteous walks of flowing spring ye fordid sons of earth hard and unfeeling of anothers woe or only lavish to yourselves  away but come ye generous breasts in whose wide thought of all his works creative bounty most divinely burns and on your open front and liberal eye sits from his dark retreat inviting modest want nor only fair and easy of approach your active search leaves no cold wintry corner unexplord like silentworking heaven surprising often the lonely heart with unexpected good for you the roving spirit of the wind blows spring abroad for you the teeming clouds descend in buxom plenty over the world and the sun spreads his genial blaze for you ye flower of human race in these green days sadpining sickness lifts her languid head life flows afresh and youngeyd health exalts the whole creation round contentment walks the sunny glade and feels an inward bliss spring over his mind beyond the pride of kings ever to bestow serenity apace induces thought and contemplation still by small degrees the love of nature works and warms the bosom till at last arrived to rapture and enthusiastic heat we feel the present deity and taste the joy of god to see a happy world it is harmony that worldembracing power by which all beings are adjusted each to all around impelling and impelled in endless circulation that inspires this universal smile thus the glad skies the widerejoycing earth the woods the streams with every life they hold down to the flower that paints the lowly vale or insectwing waved over the shepherds slumber touch the mind to nature tuned with a lightflying hand invisible quickurging through the nerves the glittering spirits in a flood of day hence from the virgins cheek a fresher bloom shoots less and less the live carnation round her lips blush deeper sweets she breathes of youth the shining moisture swells into her eyes in brighter flow her wishing bosom heaves with palpitations wild kind tumults seize her veins and all her yielding soul is love from the keen gaze her lover turns away full of the dear ecstatic power and sick with sighing languishment ah then ye fair be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts dare not the infectious sigh the pleading eye in meek submission dressed deject and low but full of tempting guile let not the tongue prompt to deceive with adulation smooth gain on your purposed wills nor in the bower where woodbines flaunt and roses shed a couch while evening draws her crimsoned curtains round trust your soft minutes with betraying man and let the aspiring youth beware of love and shun the enchanting glance for it is too late when on his heart the torrent softness pours then interest sinks to dirt and distant fame dissolves in air away while the fond soul is wrapped in dreams of ecstacy and bliss still paints the illusive form the kindling grace the alluring smile the full ethereal eye effusing heaven and listens ardent still to the small voice where harmony and wit a modest melting mingled sweetness flow no sooner is the fair idea formed and contemplation fixes on the theme than from his own creation wild he flies sick of a shadow absence comes apace and shoots his every pang into his breast it is naught but gloom around the darkened sun loses his light the rosybosomd spring to weeping fancy pines and yon bright arch of heaven lowbends into a dusky vault all nature fades extinct and she alone heard felt and seen possesses every thought fills every sense and pants in every vein books are but formal dullness tedious friends and sad amid the social band he sits lonely and inattentive from the tongue the unfinished period falls white born away on swelling thought his wafted spirit flies to the dear bosom of his absent fair and leaves the semblance of a lover fixed in melancholy site with head declined and lovedejected eyes sudden he starts shook from his tender trance and restless runs to glimmering shades and sympathetic glooms where the dun umbrage over the falling stream romantic hangs there through the pensive dusk strays in heartthrilling meditation lost indulging all to love or on the bank thrown amid drooping lillies swells the breeze with sighs unceasing and the brook with tears thus in soft anguish he consumes the day nor quits his deep retirement till the moon peeps through the chambers of the fleecy east enlightened by degrees and in her train leads on the gentle hours then forth he walks beneath the trembling languish of her beams with softened soul and wooes the bird of eve to mingle woes with his or while the world and all the sons of care lie hushed in sleep associates with the midnight shadows drear and sighing to the lonely taper pours his sweetlytorturd heart into the page meant for the moving messenger of love but ah how faint how meaningless and poor to what his passion swells which bursts the bounds of every eloquence and asks for looks where fondness flows on fondness love on love entwisting beams with here is and speaking more than ever charmed ecstatic poet sighed to listening beauty bright with conscious smiles and graceful vanity but if on bed delirious flung sleep from his pillow flies all night he tosses nor the balmy power in any posture finds till the gray morn lifts her pale luster on the paler wretch exanimate by love and then perhaps exhausted nature sinks awhile to rest still interrupted by disordered dreams that over the sick imagination rise and in black colors paint the mimic scene often with the charmer of his soul he talks sometimes in growds distressed or if retired to secretwinding flowerinwoven bowers far from the dull impertinence of man just as he kneeling all his former cares begins to lose in vast oblivious love snatched from her yielded hand he knows not how through forests huge and long untraveld heaths with desolation brown he wanders waste in night and tempest wrapped or shrinks aghast back from the bending precipice or wades the turbid stream below and strives to reach the farther shore where succourless and sad his dearer life extends her beckoning arms but strives in vain born by the outrageous flood to distance down he rides the ridgy wave or whelmed beneath the boiling eddy sinks then a weak wailing lamentable cry is heard and all in tears he wakes again to tread the circle of revolving woe these are the charming agonies of love whose misery delights but through the heart should jealousy it is venom once diffuse it is then delightful misery no more but agony unmixt incessant rage corroding every thought and blasting all the paradise of love ye fairy prospects then ye beds of roses and ye bowers of joy farewell ye gleamings of departing peace shine out your last the yellowtinging plague internal vision taints and in a night of livid gloom imagination wraps ay then instead of loveenlivend cheeks of sunny features and of ardent eyes with flowing rapture bright dark looks succeed suffusd and glaring with untender fire a clouded aspect and a burning cheek where the whole poisoned soul malignant fits and frightens love away ten thousand fears invented wild ten thousand frantic views of horrid rivals hanging on the charms for which he melts in fondness eat him up with fervent anguish and consuming pine in vain reproaches lend their idle aid deceitful pride and resolution frail giving a moments ease reflection pours afresh her beauties on his busy thought her first endearments twining round the soul with all the witchcraft of ensnaring love strait the fierce storm involves his mind anew flames through the nerves and boils along the veins while anxious doubt distracts the tortured heart for even the sad assurance of his fears were heaven to what he feels thus the warm youth whom love deludes into his thorny wilds through flowerytempting paths or leads a life of feavord rapture or of cruel care his brightest aims extinguished all and all his lively moments running down to waste but happy they the happiest of their kind whom gentler stars unite and in one fate their hearts their fortunes and their beings blend it is not the courser tie of human laws unnatural often and foreign to the mind which binds their peace but harmony itself attuning all their passions into love where friendship fullexerts his softest power perfect esteem enlivened by desire ineffable and sympathy of soul thought meeting thought and will preventing will with boundless confidence for naught but love can answer love and render bliss secure let him ungenerous who alone intent to bless himself from sordid parents buys the loathing virgin in eternal care wellmerited consume his nights and days let barbarous nations whose inhuman love is wild desire fierce as the suns they feel let eastern tyrants from the light of heaven seclude their bosomslaves meanly possessed of a mere lifeless violated form while those whom love cements in holy faith and equal transport free as nature live disdaining fear for what is the world to them it is pomp it is pleasure and it is nonsense all who in each other clasp whatever fair high fancy forms and lavish hearts can wish something than beauty dearer should they look or on the mind or mindillumind face truth goodness honor harmony and love the richest bounty of indulgent heaven meantime a smiling offspring rises round and mingles both their graces by degrees the human blossom blows and every day soft as it rolls along shows some new charm the fathers luster and the mothers bloom then infant reason grows apace and calls for the kind hand of an assiduous care delightful task to rear the tender thought to teach the young idea how to shoot to pour the fresh instruction over the mind to breathe the inspiring spirit and to plant the generous purpose in the glowing breast oh speak the joy you whom the sudden tear surprises often while you look around and nothing strikes your eye but sights of bliss all various nature pressing on the heart obedient fortune and approving heaven these are the blessings of diviner love and thus their moments fly the seasons thus as ceaseless round a jarring world they roll still find them happy and consenting spring sheds her own rosy garland on their head till evening comes at last cool gentle calm when after the long vernal day of life enamored more as soul approaches soul together down they sink in social sleep the end errata page    line    for retracted read refracted p    l    for these read those p
