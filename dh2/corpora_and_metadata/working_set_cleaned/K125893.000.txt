the answer of philip francis esquire to the charges exhibited against him general clavering and colonel monson by sir elijah impey knight when at the bar of the house of commons on his defense to the nunducomar charge  london printed for john abraham no   st swithins lane lombard street and to be had of all other booksellers in town and country  house of commoms february         the order of the day being read on the motion of sir gilbert elliot and the house having resolved itself into a committee of the whole house to consider further of the charges against sir elijah impey mr wyndham in the chair   mr francis rose and said i lament that there is not a fuller attendance and especially am i concerned that some gentlemen are not present who heard sir elijah impey deliver his speech at the bar in which he thought fit to pass a censure on the conduct of general clavering colonel monson and myself i will however if the committee will grant me that indulgence now proceed according to my notice on a former day to answer the imputation  the consent of the committee being signified to mr francis he again rose and said   mr wyndham  i flattered myself sir that when the house thought proper to exclude me from the committee of managers whether that resolution was meant to be a discharge from a service or a relief from a duty it would have had this effect at all events that from thenceforward i should be suffered to remain in a state of neutrality and that as i was deprived of the honor i should also be exempted from the cares and censures to which the managers of an impeachment must unavoidably submit but much more had i reason to expect that after the public declaration which i made in parliament almost two years ago that i would never sit in judgment upon him and that i would never give a judicial vote in any cause in which sir elijah impey might be a party unless i could safely give it for him and having avowed that declaration in print as the most public mode of avowal of it and having also since repeatedly declared to my friends and particularly to the hon baronet near me sir gilbert elliot that i would never directly or indirectly take a part of any kind in the prosecution of sir elijah impey and having strictly adhered to the spirit of those declarations i should not have been implicated in any shape in the impeachment of that gentleman least of all did i expect that i should be accused by him of having borne testimony to his good conduct and be compelled by him to answer as a criminal for declarations which he tells you i have heretofore made in his favor i do not mean to deny his right of mixing accusation with defense if to criminate others be in any degree material or even useful to his own exculpation in some cases undoubtedly the weapons of attack are the best perhaps the only instruments of defense with some men such is the only defense that can be made whether the use he has made of this weapon and the manner in which he has availed himself of his undisputed right on this occasion be perfectly prudent or not can only be determined by the event all i assert and contend for is that i in my turn may be allowed the same latitude which he has taken and which i allow him it is not my direct object this day to criminate him or any man but it may be necessary to my defense it may be unavoidable defense and accusation in this particular case may be inseparable if that should happen i desire it may be remembered that besides the general right which for myself i admit i stand upon the specific use he himself has made of it and follow the precedent which he has himself specifically set me  sir the situation in which i have lately stood in this house has been very painful to me indeed i have been repeatedly the personal object of debate the middle passive subject between the action and reaction of the powers of the house between the hammer and the anvio how irksome such a situation must have been i leave to the sensations of those who have stood in the same situation themselves much has been said of my character much of my temper i have by one learned gentleman not now present the master of the rolls been accused of comparing myself with him and and with others of his profession such a comparison i never presumed to make arrogance is one thing passion is another passion i have ever conceived to be an honest open and manly emotion of the mind arrogance on the contrary i take to be a cold settled and determined rule of conduct resulting from illiberal and unwarrantable ideas i may have made use of warm or passionate language perhaps but i was never guilty of the presumption and arrogance which has been imputed to me i stand up now as the defendant in the present case as such i hope to be heard patiently and with a fair and liberal construction  that is all i desire  the charge brought against sir j clavering col monson and myself by sir elijah impey as i understand it amounts to this it is his own fault if i do not state it correctly i mean to do it fairly  that whereas we had by sundry declarations and minutes both before and after the event expressed or strongly intimated our opinion that the prosecution trial and execution of nunducomar were sounded on political motives and pursued for the sole purpose of saving mr hastings from the effect of that mans evidence no credit ought to be given to the same because we had in a few days after the execution ordered a paper purporting to be a petition from nunducomar against the judges to be burnt the entries of it to be expunged and the translations to be destroyed and because he had on that occasion declared that we considered the informations contained in it as wholly insupported and of a libellous nature and that to send a copy of it to the judges would be giving it much more weight than it deserved  if this be the charge i admit all the facts and deny the conclusion if i have omitted any part of the charge if i have not stated it in as strong terms against myself as it is possible to be stated i beg any gentleman who hears me to correct me i request the committee to divide the charge into two parts and to consider it first as it regards us collectively secondly as it personally regards general clavering in particular  but i entreat the committee to consider preliminary first how this paper came into sir elijah impeys hands and in what state and with what proof of its authenticity it is now brought before the house  here mr francis read an extract from the bengal appendix p     dated the   th of august       on that day we resolved upon a motion made by me that the original should be burnt and burnt by the hands of the common hangman to which mr hastings repeatedly said he had no objection but observed that this would not be enough as the paper stood on our records and would that way become public to remove that objection i proposed that the entry should be expunged and it was agreed that it should be expunged accordingly and that the translations should be destroyed the resolution was unanimous mr hastings approved of it and was party to it on the   th of august the judges wrote to us in the following words  a paper containing a false scandalous and malicious charge against the judges of the supreme court produced at your board having been by you declared a libel and ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman we return you our thanks for having shown so due a sense of this outrage to public justice but as we must be interested as well in the minutes introducing and condemning the paper as in the paper itself we find ourselves obliged to desire that you will furnish us with a copy of the libel and of such minutes which relate to it as stand on your consultations and must therefore be conveyed to england that we may judge whether they contain any matters necessary for us to take notice of  the following was our reply dated sept          we shall be much obliged to you if you will be pleased to acquaint us from whom you received the imperfect information which appears to have been conveyed to you on this and other occasions of the proceedings of this board in our secret department such communications cannot regularly be made to you but by the authority of the board nor can they be obtained without a breach of trust in some of our officers which we are persuaded you would not encourage  and this letter is signed by mr hastings who knew that he alone had given the information  it is true he disapproved of the draft but not for the reason which he ought to have assigned and which would have prevented our writing that paragraph neither can he pretend that he held himself bound by the sense of the majority to sign the letter because upon another occasion viz on the   th of june      he positively refused to sign a letter to the judges of which he disapproved  sir elijah impey tells you on another occasion that he knew nothing of the contents of the charges of nunducomar against mr hastings how should he they were produced before a secret council they were examined by a secret committee of which all the members their clerks and secretaries were sworn to secrecy mr hastings nevertheless communicates this paper to him and through his channel to the other judges i shall presently show that he imparted many other parts of our proceedings to him  sir elijah impey affirms that although the paper was imparted to him he never saw the minutes till very lately when he procured a copy of them from the india house this is very extraordinary and indeed it is incredible that mr hastings should show him one and not the other especially as it appears that in the month of january following he communicated to him several other minutes signed by us in which charges against him were certainly expressed and especially as these very minutes were printed by the directors and in possession of many people in bengal in the course of      or      and i believe read by every body in calcutta i know they were by many mr hastings takes upon him not only to communicate the paper after he had agreed that the entry should be expunged and the translations destroyed but even alters the translations in many parts with his own hand who will say that a paper so communicated so altered and so produced deserves any credit what is a secret commitee the name sufficiently speaks its character and in respect to the secret committee of council in calcutta not only mr hastings and every member was bound by an oath of secrecy but the secretaries and clerks and every one of their officers even if there had been no oath mr hastings was bound in truth and honor by his own agreement in my own breast i hold such an agreement to be equally binding with an oath  the original paper i have no doubt contained insinuations against the judges and that those insinuations being wholly unsupported deserved no weight that the description i gave of it was exact and that it was a libel upon the whole court of justice in the strict and proper sense of that word the question is whether by these declarations i contradict many others in which i have charged the prosecution and execution of nunducomar against sir elijah impey as a political measure of the most atrocious kind at first sight it is not very likely that we or any men who were not absolute idiots should enter such contradictions on the same records and place ourselves before the directors in a pointof view which must utterly annihilate their confidence in us  let the committee judge of the following declarations made by us before and after the execution of nunducomar  minute of mr francis april         i beg leave to observe that a prosecution for a conspiracy is now instituted or is intended to be instituted against maha rajah nunducomar and others the tendency of which seems to me to be to prevent or deter him from proceeding in making good those discoveries which he has laid before the board i cannot but think that the east india company and consequently this board have a very great concern in every step taken in that prosecution whether it be actually begun or intended  extract of a minute of clavering monson and francis sept         after the death of nunducomar the governor we believe is well assured that no man who regards his safety will venture to stand forth as his accuser  on a subject of this delicate nature it becomes us to leave every honest man to his own reflection it ought to be made known however to the english nation that the forgery of which the rajah was accused must have been committed several years that in the interim he had been protected and employed by mr hastings that his son was appointed to one of the first offices in the nabobs household with a salary of one lack of rupees that the accusation which ended in his destruction was not produced till he came forward and brought a specific charge against the governorgeneral of corruption in his office  ditto dated nov         it seems propable such embezzlements may have been universally practiced in the present circumstance it will be difficult if not impracticable to obtain direct proofs of the facts the terror impressed on the minds of the natives by the execution of mahah rajah nunducomar is not to be effaced for though he suffered for the crime of forgery yet the natives conceive he was executed for having dared to prefer complaints against the governor general  this idea however destitute of foundation is prevalent amongst the natives and will naturally deter them from making discoveries which may be attended with the same fatal consequences to themselves  punishment is usually intended as an example to prevent the commission of crimes in this instance we fear it has served to prevent the discovery of them  ditto march         some of the facts with which he mr hastings has been personally charged have been proved the presumptive evidence in support of the rest will we apprehend lose none of its force by the precipitate removal of maha raja nunducomar  the petition was brought before us after the mans death it charged the judges with having murdered him for having accused mr hastings or to that effect it came before us without a responsible accuser without a witness to prove or evidence to support it the fabrication of a man publicly executed for a crime and consequently no longer capable of proving his allegation this being the case it was what i called it a libel and nothing else i called it so then i call it so still though i was not then nor am i now convinced that the substance of it was untrue but it included all the judges concerning two of whom justice hyde and sir robert chambers we never had a suspicion of corrupt motives and concerning another of whom mr justice le maistre we had then no ground of suspicion excepting his intimacy with sir elijah impey his acting on all occasions as his instrument and the notorious violence of his deportment we therefore treated it as a libel against a whole court of justice ought to be treated  this is no new distinction by me no afterthought no ex post facto vindication when mr hastings accused me personally about three months before of presenting a libel to the board what was my answer on that occasion  extract of a minute of mr francis march         the governor general who had long expected the appearance of such a letter and was apprised of the contents of it made no objection however to its being received and read at the board when the man who advances a specific charge declares himself ready to come forward and support it and to hazard the consequences of failing in his proofs it may still be presumed that the charge is false but it does not partake of the nature of a libel a libeller advances charges which he does not in the end or is unable to make good  when called upon to appear and produce his evidence he shelters himself sometimes in the obscurity sometimes in the superiority of his situation and leaves the accusation without an accuser to operate as far as it can in the opinions of men against the honor and reputation of the party accused rajah nunducomar is not an obscure person in the country nor does he in this instance act the part of a libeller he is himself of very high rank he publicly accuses the governorgeneral of misconduct in his office and desires to be heard in person in support of his charge  this is my defense against the charge as it affects us collectively on the face of our proceedings but we had other motives for our conduct which do not appear upon the records and which i shall now lay before the house  this concerns general clavering and not myself in this part he is properly the defendant and not i if favor protection and indulgence are due to a man who is here to defend himself and they have been shown in an eminent degree to sir elijah impey how much more are they due to a man of great character who is not here who is not only absent but dead and who died in the service of his country not in an honorable but a most odious service not in the field of battle where his gallant mind would have led him but in an odious unprofitable contest with men of whom he had the worst opinion possible i cannot undertake to answer for all the motives of his conduct in this transaction but i think i can for some of them  let gentlemen recollect the general temper of the settlement the union between the governor general mr barwell and the judges or some of them and the general combination amongst them against us that we were considered in the settlement as the common enemy and mr hastings looked up to as their common protector that sir elijah impey in one of his letters to us had already declared that reports were publicly circulated in calcutta that if the judges could not be prevailed upon to release nunducomar he would be delivered by force manu forti by the commander in chief  extract of a letter from sir elijah impey to the board may         the particular reason which called upon me in this case to make that requisition was the reports publicly circulated in this town that if the judges could not be prevailed upon to release the maha rajah he would be delivered by force  against this imputation genesis clavering thought it necessary for his safety to exculpate himself by oath i say safety because i am firmly of opinion that he would have been in as great danger as nunducomar if the judges could have found any thing to lay to his charge the general says in his minute of the   th of august      that he was resolved not to make any application whatever in favor of nunducomar he knew by experience that all such applications would be needless that they would be much more likely to injure than to serve nunducomar and that our intercessions would rather hasten than delay his execution in support of this assertion i beg leave to read to you some passages from our records the house will observe that we had often applied to sir elijah impey for some indulgence to this unfortunate man in the mode of his imprisonment particularly that he would not suffer him to perish for want of sustenance sir elijah says in reply in his letter of the  th of may       i must make it my request that the maha rajah may be acquainted by the board that if he has any further application to make for relief that he must address himself immediately to the judges who will give all due attention to his representations for should he continue to address himself to the board that which will and can only be obtained from principles of justice may have the appearance of being obtained by the means of influence and authority the peculiar turn of mind of the natives being to expect every thing from power and little from justice  in another letter dated may         he says  i did not nor do not question the authority of the board in receiving petitions i carefully restricted what i said to this individual prisoner i did not desire his petitions should not be received but when received if they were to require any thing from the judges of the court that the answers given to those petitions should be that he must apply himself directly to the judges and this i did to avoid the imputation i then alluded to and which would be equally derogatory to the character of the council as that of the judges  on the   th of june we sent to the judges an application from the nabob of bengal in favor of nunducomar to which the following is the answer of the judges sent by message june          that the court is of opinion that all claims of individuals ought to be made directly to the court by the individuals and not by the authority of the governor general and council  that it is contrary to the principles of the english constitution for any person or persons to address a court of justice by letter missive concerning any matter pending before such court and that the higher the station of the person or persons so addressing the act is the more unconstitutional  to another application made at the same time by the nabob through us in favor of his own vaqueel or minister at calcutta sir elijah wrote as follows  extract of a letter from sir elijah impey june         as to communicating petitions to the judges i apprehend that no board even of the highest authority in england can refer any matter either to a court of justice or any judge thereof otherwise than by suit legally instituted  in a subsequent resolution upon the same subject the judges say  it is with the deepest concern we find the council still persist to address the court by letter on subjects pending in court or on which the court have given their opinion and that notwithstanding the frequent declarations and unanimous opinion of the court upon the impropriety of that mode of address  and sir elijah declared from the bench that the governor general and council whom he considered as nothing more than as agents of the east india company could only apply to the court by humble petition and that the court could not receive in future any letters or messages but in that form  extract of a declaration from the bench made by sir elijah impey on the   d of june      the company as well as all other appellants must not claim it but prefer a humble petition this being thus explained to prevent any further altercations of this nature the court must inform the board that they cannot respect being had to the dignity of his majestys courts and to the welfare of the country receive in future any letter or messages but in that form  after all this passed it is not much to be wondered at that general clavering should resolve not to make any more applications in favor of nunducomar genesis clavering was a strict rigid man not as some thought cruel but rigid over much even to prudery as i sometimes told him in consequence of his refusing even a dish of fruit and civilities that certainly did not come within the legal prohibition of presents very tender of public reputation and particularly fearful of the imputation of supporting and encouraging the accuser of mr hastings an imputation which he was sure he should incur and equally sure of doing nunducomer no service what he did was in truth a most rash and inconsiderate action namely the bringing the petition at all before the board the man was dead and genesis clavering made himself the publisher of the libel he put himself in the power of his enemies who infallibly would have ruined him this let it operate as it may i declare upon my honor and i shall if necessary upon my oath was a strong concurrent motive with col monson and me for getting the paper destroyed as mr hastings entirely agreed with us in every thing we did relative to the paper i never had a doubt that all the translations of it were destroyed until sir elijah impey produced a copy of it at the bar of this house of the authenticity of which you have no evidence and which admitting it to be authentic must have been obtained by means the most unjustifiable by means which prove what we always suspected that we were betrayed by one of our own board to sir elijah impey and by means which prove to demonstration the collusion and confederacy that subsisted from the first between sir elijah impey and mr hastings  i beg the committee to consider whether such facts were not convincing proofs of a confederacy and collusion existing between the governorgeneral and sir elijah impey to me they appeared such and so i conceive they must to every candid man i hesitate not to declare in the most explicit and in the most solemn manner that the private motive of my standing so forward as i did for the destruction of the copy and translations of the petition sent by nunducomar previous to his execution to general clavering was not the public one i assigned viz that it was a libel but my fear for the safety of general clavering colonel monson and myself observing that the judges had gone all length that they had already dipped their hands in blood for a political purpose and that they might again proceed on the same principle with respect to what passed relative to nunducomars application to be removed from the common gaol of calcutta to some place where he could take sustenance and perform his ablutions and other ceremonies in a manner conformable to his religion i beg to declare to the committee that however absurd to many such opinions as nunducomar entertained on that subject may be considered yet i believe and always did believe nunducomar to be serious in those scruples he gave a strong proof that he was so by continuing to refuse any kind of nourishment for siuty or seventy hours together the manner in which general claverings daughters have been treated by sir elijah impey at the bar of this house was in the most unbecoming in the most unwarrantable manner the conduct of these ladies had been most grossly misrepresented  not their sex their virtue their youth their beauty nor their many accomplishments could rescue them from the most illiberal misrepresentation a misrepresentation hazarded merely for the purpose of making them by a false and forced construction of their conduct to appear as the accusers of their father the act they did was an act of humanity an act of charity which had they been ugly deformed loathsome or even prostituted would have cast a veil over their vilest vices but that act had been by sir elijah impey perverted and falsely urged as a proof against their parent those ladies visited nunducomar in his confinement and endeavored to make his situation as light as possible if such conduct was a crime in the ladies i am equally criminal i visited nunducomar frequently and should have considered myself devoid of humanity had i done otherwise the sufferings of nunducomar were great confined in the common gaol of calcutta so miserable so horrid a place that the bare commitment to it was equal to death many confined in that prison had died in consequence of such confinement and particularly a mr maynard many who hear me know what i assert to be a fact let gentlemen then consider what the unfortunate nunducomar must have felt in such a confinement a man esteemed of higher rank in his own country than any of the council a man who had been the prime minister of the country and was of the highest cast of his religion it was undoubtedly true that the supreme court sent pundits to nunducomar to examine into his scruples and that they declared that he might take sustenance without incurring more than a very slight and trivial penance but it should be considered what the pundits were they were men of small income and of a lower cast of religion than nunducomar and could not consequently judge of his scruples nunducomar himself told me that the pundits not being of so high a cast as himself were wholly incapable of advising him or feeling the same scruples that he did nunducomar was of the highest order of the bramins and it was therefore most probable that what he had asserted was true especially as he continued though upwards of seventy years of age to refuse all sustenance till the judges themselves were alarmed at the idea of a legal murder and caused nunducomar to be removed to a place of confinement more adapted to his being able to perform what his conscience told him his religion required  i conceive sir the best evidence that can be brought against any man to be that mans own evidence such evidence generally makes the deepest impression i will undertake to satisfy the committee that sir elijah impey when in bengal never looked on the transaction on which he now pretends to place so much reliance in the same sense in which he represented it at the bar of this house i will prove that sir elijah impey never did before his defense at the bar give that construction to the act of general clavering colonel monson and myself of burning the petition of nunducomar as he has lately endeavored to fix upon it namely that it amounted not only to a flat contradiction of any opinions we had or might deliver to the disadvantage of the judges in that business but did express and convey a direct and explicit justification of their conduct to prove that this was not the opinion of sir elijah impey in the year      i beg leave to read several passages from a letter sent by sir elijah impey to the secretary of state dated the  0th of january      written on purpose to vindicate his character from the aspersions uniformly thrown upon it by general clavering colonel monson and myself for his conduct in the business of nunducomar and to charge us with having constantly imputed to the court the most atrocious motives for their conduct by strong insinuation malignant sarcasm and severe censure and to accuse us also of attempting on sundry occasions to overawe and reduce the authority of the court  extract of a letter from sir elijah impey to the secretary of state dated calcutta jan  0        the governor general has within these few days communicated to me several minutes signed by general clavering colonel monson and mr francis they are severally fraught with direct charges or plain insinuations against the characters of the judges and the conduct of the court of judicature some seem more particularly levelled at me    the crimes either directly charged upon the judges or indirectly insinuated which i think we have more reason to complain of as being less liberal are of so horrid and detestable a nature that if they are well grounded ought to subject each of them to the highest punishment a parliamentary impeachment can inflict and brand their names with infamy to the latest posterity    i do sincerely attribute the offensive parts of the paragraphs to immaginations heated by party disputes and entertain so high a sense of the honor of the gentlemen that at a period some distance from the events which shall have given time for their judgments to cool they will themselves be shocked at what they have wrote and be willing to retract the charges    a public notification is professedly made to the english nation by which it is attempted to persuade them that the court of judicature established by his majesty for protecting the natives of this country and the east india company from the violence and oppression of the companys servants has been by the judges converted into an execrable instrument in the hands of mr hastings of destroying the innocent native for the sake of protecting the guilty servants of the company    it should be known that the conduct of the council to the judges and to the prisoner during his confinement had raised an almost universal belief in the natives and even among the europeans that the prisoner would be protected from justice in defiance of the court    rajah gourdass son of nunducomar has caused it to be intimated to me that he was very desirous to pay his respects to me but is possitively enjoined he must mean forbidden entering my house by members of the council  n b the majority of the council in one of their minutes had said we are ignorant of any attempts to overthrow or reduce the outhority of the supereme court    in answer to this i must refer to the letters sent me by the council in may last concerning nunducomar the letter addressed to mr justice hyde and justice lemaistre the universal tenor of the minutes of the council whenever the conduct of the judges made part of their consultations  had sir elijah impey at the time he wrote that letter considered our declaraion that nunducomars petition was a libel and the burning it in consequence thereof as any proof of our opinion in his favor can it be imagined by any reasonable man that he would not have stated and urged it for that purpose in his letter to the secretary of state which consisted of several sheets and was from beginning to end a professed defense of himself against our charges and a labored effort to recriminate upon us instead of doing so the fact was not mentioned or even alluded to in this voluminous letter  that was the time if ever for him to have availed himself of our evidence against ourselves and to have invalidated any declarations we might have made against him on other occasions  his not availing himself of that opportunity warranted a conclusion the most irresistible it proves beyond a doubt that while he was in bengal or at least however when he wrote the letter that he had not the most remote idea that our act on which he now insists could bear the construction he now gives it  but why sir did sir elijah impey declare that he never saw the minutes of the secret committee till lately the reason is obvious  because had he admitted that he had seen the minutes in calcutta as in fact he must have done his letter to the secretary of state dated jan         would have been a manifest falsehood as a charge and palpably defective as a defense it would have been false upon the face of it and his answer to the charge criminating him on account of the execution of the nunducomar would have been most unaccountably defective by the omission of that which if true and agreeable to his construction of it would have been the best answer of all viz our own acquittal of him by the minutes in question  i appeal sir to the judgment of the committee and to common sense whether by the facts i have stated i have not fully answered the accusation and censure by sir elijah impev on genesis clavering colonel monson and myself  i think i have done so in a manner that must be satisfactory to the feelings of every gentleman present and to every honest man who hears me  i have been under much difficulty on account of sir elijah impeys having made his imputation oath i will act a more fair part i challenge sir elijah impey to put upon paper his charge against us if he does so i pledge myself to the house and to the world that i will deliver the defense of genesis clavering col monson and myself in writing likewise  sir i wish to make one further observation to the committee and that is to remind them of the extraordinary mode adopted by mr hastings and sir elijah impey when defending themselves at the bar of this house against charges stated in express terms and in a specific form  the very first thing those men thought necessary to do in that situation was to mark me as their enemy they seemed to conceive it essential to their safety to single me out as a person proper to attack to calumniate to discredit to disqualify and to remove  i know not how other gentlemen may feel but i own myself proud of the distinction  i consider it an honor i am not the personal enemy of those men but i hope as long as my name shall exist it may be known in opposition to theirs and that my character my conduct and my name may everlasting remain contrasted and considered as in everlasting hostility with the names conduct characters and hearts of mr hastings and sir elijah impey  finis just published price two
