ode by dr samuel johnson to mrs thrale  price one shilling  entered at stationers hall  ode by dr samuel johnson to mrs thrale upon their supposed approaching nuptials   tauri ruentis in venerem tolerare pondus  hor london printed for r faulder newbondstreet m dcc lxxxiv  preface by the editor mr henry thrale brewer in the borough of southwark i say it without flattery or interested hopes of reward from his surviving relict and daughters was one of the most eminent and opulent traders that england ever had he was moreover a well built stout man in his person his wife mrs hester lynch whose maiden name was salusbury was of creditable welsh extraction she was rather a little woman but smart of pregnant parts and some share of booklearning they kept a very plentiful table both for meat and drink to which those who are called wits and also many ingenious artists gladly repaired as to a convenient house of call where they had nothing to pay except their court to mrs thrale who doubtless deserved while she was flattered by their compliments the most distinguished of them and as one may say the foreman of the whole was dr samuel johnson the celebrated lichfield author who wrote an english dictionary and several works of a good moral tendency and was famous besides for shrewd sayings and lively jokes he was a very large man and by no means welllooking but rather the contrary neither was he neat and cleanly in his person and dress he was notwithstanding a no small favorite with mrs thrale both in her husbands lifetime and for some short while after and from a collection of their letters which is extant and has been put forth in print by herself it appears that there was no overdelicate niceness but truly the plainest familiarity between them as witness these and the like passages  i hope in time to be like the great bull let     dr tailor desires always to have his compliments sent he is in his usual way very busy getting a bull to his cows and a dog to his bitches old shakespeare is dead and he wants to buy another horse to his mares let   0  you must take the chance of finding me better or worse this you may know at present that my affection for you is not diminished and my expectation from you is increased let      i am harrassed by a very disagreeable operation of the cantharides which i am endeavoring to control by copious dilution let  0   on the   th of last month i evacuated twenty pints of water let      mr thrale and his wife had a family of five daughters to whom they did not grudge to give every piece of genteel education signor baretti was entertained in the house at bed and board to teach them the italian tongue and signor piozzi it is believed was liberally rewarded for teaching them to sing and play on the harpsichord mrs thrale had not an ear as the saying is but she had an eye to this her daughters musicmaster who it appears by her said publication was permitted to love her piozzi i find is coming and when he comes and i come you will have two about you that love you let     this was in her widowhood and indeed it is plain that dr samuel johnson himself had then also pretensions to her the disappointment of which by her preference of signor piozzi whom she afterward married no doubt contributed with other considerations to his writing that severe answer on her informing him of her resolution which answer she has very prudently suppressed  indeed recently after the death of mr henry thrale there were not wanting many who conjectured that a matrimonial union would take place between the widow and dr samuel johnson and some went so far as to assert that it was his determined purpose not only to carry on the business under the firm of the brewery but even to assume the name and arms of thrale upon this foundation and no better the bellman or some other such rhymster of the borough bantered the business in the following homely lines  hail johnson thrale johnson brewer of good ale johnson while thus you drive so bold a trade your cash will never sail johnson though madams somewhat stale johnson you will find she will yet be frail johnson for many years she tried your head and now she will try  johnson whether it was that a copy of this balderdash reached dr samuel johnson and made him anxious lest posterity should look upon his tender passion as of a very coarse and vulgar nature or whether he was merely incited by her blandishments to give a specimen of his juvenile vivacity or from whatever other cause it would seem that in the confidence of their being speedily joined in marriage he sent her the following wedding verses of which it is probable she gave a copy to signor baretti or to some other person with whom she at that time was intimate  the same having by some strange chance fallen into my hands i thought i could not do better than lay them before the public  with respect to their being certainly written by dr samuel johnson i honestly confess i am no judge of such matters and therefore will not pretend to say any thing of my own knowledge upon that head but i am well assured by a person of skill that they have the undoubted sterling mark and that no other man in the kingdom could make them but himself  argument the poet pleased with the reminiscence of his poetical powers prepares to concentrate them in his mistress  he prostrates his dignity to her in versatility of character  plumes himself on his fancied felicity and by a bold image equal to any in anacreon at once personifies and personates that beer which was the glory of her house  touches on his jealousy of signor piozzi  exults in his supposed victory over his rival  describes the congratulations on the nuptials between him and his dearest dear lady but characteristically hints at the malignity of human nature  represents the envy with which their happiness is beheld  weary of continence solaces himself with the prospect of future enjoyment  paints it with vigorous strokes and glowing colors  takes care to give it the delicate sanction of sentiment  assumes a reflex honor by projecting illustrious matches for his ladys daughters by her first husband but maintains his own superiority by figuring himself the father of an heir male  concludes in mythological enthusiasm that he is greater than atlas  ode if ever my fingers touched the lyre in satire fierce in pleasure gay shall not my thralias smiles inspire shall sam refuse the sportive lay my dearest lady view your slave behold him as your very scrub eager to write as author grave or govern well the brewing tub to rich felicity thus raised my bosom glows with amorous fire porter no longer shall be praised it is i myself am thrales entire piozzi once alarmed my fears till beauteous marys tragic fate and rizzios tale dissolved in tears my mistress ere it was too late indignant thought to english pride that any eye should ever see johnson one moment set aside for tweedledum or tweedledee congratulating crowds shall come our newborn happiness to hail whether at ball at rout at drum  but human spite will still prevail for though they come in pleasing guise and cry the wise deserve the fair they look askance with envious eyes as satan looked at the first pair ascetick now thy lover lives nor dares to touch nor dares to kiss yet prurient fancy sometimes gives a prelibation of our bliss convulsed in loves tumultuous throws we feel the aphrodisian spasm tired nature must at last repose then wit and wisdom fill the chasm nor only are our limbs entwined and lip in rapture glued to lip locked in embraces of the mind imaginations sweets we sip five daughters by a former spouse shall match with nobles of the land the fruit of our more fervent vows a pillar of the state shall stand greater than atlas was of yore a nobler charge to me is given the sphere he on his shoulders bore i with my arms encircle heaven the end
