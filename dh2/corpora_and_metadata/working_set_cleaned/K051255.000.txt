the so much talked of and expected old womans dunciad  or midwifes masterpiece  containing the most choice collection of humdrums and drivellers that was ever exposed to public view  by mary midnight  with historical critical and explanatory notes by margelina scribelinda macularia  quos fama recens and celebravit anus barrow no author ever spared a brother wits are game cocks to one another gay out with it dunciad pope published pursuant to act of parliament as the greatest work ever before attempted in any age country or language  london printed for theo carnan and sold by f stamper in popeshead alley cornhill j robinson at the goldenlion ludgate street r wilson in pall mall and at all the pamphletshops mdccli  preface by margelina scribelinda macularia as there are so many impostors and imitators abroad it is highly requisite the public should be satisfied that this is the true and genuine dunciad of mrs mary midnight to which end i have wrote this short preface the reader therefore is desired to attend to me with a little patience before he enters upon this great and wonderful work the extensive fame our author has gained by her learned lucubrations in all the courts and universities in europe has excited many who have by some means or other met with some of her fragments to vend among them their heaps of trash in her name but it is hoped the world will do her the justice to think she is not the author of such poor paultry wishy washy shimsham performances  to reward among many others the authors of such proceedings in a manner due to their deserts mrs midnight has designed and executed this work but as an affair of so much consequence could not but get air in the world several of these who were conscious of their guilt applied to her to be excused a place or in other words to be left out of her dunciad among which came the celebrated pentweazle and meanly offered her five guineas in part on subscription to her miscellany of poems to be published some time in february next but mrs midnight being above any mercenary view was deaf to all overtures however considerable of this kind upon which with their usual assurance her enemies advertised even this intended work the old womans dunciad in here is and in my name intending to impose some trumpery or other on the world before this poem could appear and with the most consummate impudence put out advertisements against the fictitious imitators of mrs midnights works to outface if possible the very truth itself but we have through a surprising quickness of genius peculiar to our author anticipated their designs to their utter confusion since the world will by reading the following work be convinced of the genuine and elevated spirit of mrs midnight and will not for the future be so easily imposed on i shall just add a word or two on our authors character in general and on this work in particular as to mrs midnights reputation as an author notwithstanding she has made herself known but lately under that name yet it has been very extensive under the more general one of old woman she having had the principal hand in most of the performances that have been wrote within these few years past all which have been infallibly known by the critics who upon perusal of them have immediately laid them down and crying out the authors an old woman intimating thereby their knowledge of her works and her established reputation that raised them above criticism as to this poem in particular the public can never enough acknowledge the obligations they owe her in these improvements of our language which however fall vastly short of what she purposes to do having selected several thousands of the most curious and copious in the sea eulogium on the welsh tongue cambria book ii line  0 gemerian or welsh tongue which will far exceed any embellishment whatsoever drawn from the greek or latin  margelina scribelinda macularia  the old womans dunciad o thou whatever title to thine ear whether tom jones joe andrews or what not sound pleasing thou to my aspiring song indulgent smile while to high pindus top line i o thou etc our judicious and learned author mrs midnight seems at first setting out to give us an instance that she knows what she is about by this imitation of the great satyrist mr pope in whose dunciad are the following lines addressed to swift as are the above to fielding o thou whatever title please thine ear swift drapier bickerstaff or gulliver     apex excelse i volitate nor frown elenthical of dunces and the tribe of noseobesate atramental sons i sing nor phoebus call but to my aid invoke melpomene of all the nine my chief best patron and thalia thou haste thee from avons banks nor cull more flowers for shakespeares wreath but help to assist my flight line   apex excelse  high top we never can enough admire this instance of the superexcellent beauty of expression made use of by our modern poets in endeavoring to make our tongue so nearly resemble that truly noble and elevated language the latin martina scribeinda macularia  line   of nose obesetesnotty noses this epithet which as a compound one is not a little to be commended is yet more admirable as it has its derivation from the latin in which language a judicious and witty man is signified by a man with his nose wiped and a blockhead by a fellow with a nasty or fat nose according to our vulgar phrase a snotty one martina scribelinda macularia  line    cull more flowers  nor rosemary cull the text is here extremely well expressed in the interpretation as the so often repeated thought of the muses gathering flowers upon the banks of the river avon for shakespeare can certainly mean no more than the old fashioned custom of gathering rosemary for the dead  the reader may find the above thought in the pleasures of imagination also in a late piece called the rosciad and many others whose merit is a sufficient reason i suppose for its being inserted here    for high on pegasean wing i mean to soar velocitate o swifter far than fleet the winged atoms in the air when auster its euroclydon dilates or when pervading night excessive pours the twilight dun with archimagic art a thrice repeated charm by hecate taught the dame venefic on a virgult borne or courser stramentitious ether wings line    when austor its euroclydon dilates mrs midnight is here openly indebted to the author of the rosciad line    we have before observed the beauty of latinizing our language we have in this line a happy instance of both greek and latin without the least variation in the idiom becoming easy and flowing english very intelligible to the meanest reader and notwithstanding the herd of critics of low taste inveigh bitterly against this practice and call it a bastardizd innovation of dialect i advise all who would make any figure in these days to lug in by the ears all manner of uncommon phrases and epithets they can lay hold of and subject them to their own use as lawful prizes margelina scribelinda macularia   thanks to the power of verse lo now i soar and lo the house of dullness is in view see towering pauls eeclesiastic dome its head rears altitudinate o far the meaner emulating tribe above of spires parochial so famed cambrias hills like alps on alps pelion over ossa pild line    the meaner emulating tribe above i cannot think mrs midnight the author of that surprising beauty in this line by the position of the preposition above it seeming to me that she has borrowed the hint from the celebrated dr young whose elegances of that kind are numerous he says if i mistake not life is a stage inch high the grave above   line    like alps on alps etc this and the following line are taken from cambria where they seem to be the effect to use the authors own words of a regard for a land renowned of old for nobelst deeds for which reason every mountain must be the highest in the world as he says the pyrenoeans appenine and alps with meaner altitude invade the skies than cambrian mountains  now it is not to be supposed that the author has ever seen italy france or spain or that he has taken the altitude of his own country hills with the barometer  no  reader there is a figure in rhetoric called the hyperbole by which a man may assert what he knows nothing at all of and tell as many lies as he pleases  it is by this figure reader that mrs midnight has ornamented her poem by this simile from the above famous writer for it is impossible she should know so little as to imagine the alps etc stand in the same comparison below the welsh mountains as the common parish churches do to st pauls  margelina seribelinda macularia    high as olympus lose in airy height their heads as ancient as the pen of time there is a cave fast by the house of prayer where hebetudo dwells so low its site that it may merit well speluncal name its vestibule that gulphy influx near where the colluvian current pouring on line  0 as ancient as the pen of time endless have been the disputes that mrs midnight has had with some critics to which she has communicated this design on this passage  they assert that it is the first time time ever was taken for an author as giving him a pen seems to imitate he is but that on the contrary they are a set of people he has a mortal aversion to as they are enemies to his employment by immortalizing those very persons and things he endeavors to erase  in answer to this let them only see cambria line    book i and be satisfied from the credit of that author of its propriety whose very words she has borrowed margelina scribelinda macularia    rushing sonorous falls the hoarse cascade the illucid lapse adown with torrent thick regurgling lutulent the cave within the torpid wretch by igneal glimmer seen line    the illucid lopse etc the reader may observe how our author has imitated the great men of our own day in five or six of the preceding lines in which she has not an elegant word but belongs to some of them nay she has even almost copied whole lines from them in particular from cambria and the beautiful expression of the lucid lapse from the excursion of mr mallet  i am somewhat surprised however that mrs midnight could condescend to imitate in so unpoetical a line as there is a cave fast by this house of prayer a writer of so little credit in point of language as milton since it might have been modernized beautifully thus this deem eretial near a cave exists but there is no work as mr pope says without some blemish whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what never was nor is nor ever shall be it is therefore excuseable if in a poem like this so crammed with beauties there should he found one fault  line    the torpid wretch the reader to taste the beauty of this picture and come to a right understanding of our author must turn to the frontispiece of the old womans magazinea work of which notice has been taken in our preface where he will find the pictures of dullness and poverty represented under the characters of mrs mary midnight and her consederate succubus canidia  see front to old wom mag and page    no iii    with succubus canidia by that name if rightly she be called sit hovering so in culmiferous fields or frondose woods with all their opulence and native worth the egyptian tribe itinerant repose at prandial noon and dire mundungus fume line  0 by that name etc it is a matter of no little dispute whether the consederate of dullness should be called succubus canidia  the christian name signifying a devil in the shape of an old woman and the surname being taken from that of a neapolitan jezebel whom horace calls a witch  the query is since we know the figure represented is poverty whether poverty can be justly called a witch some have asserted yes because witches are always poor and old but this is consuted by the learned and judicious author of the spectator who says that though poverty and age make women suspected of being witches it is nevertheless no proof of their being so and as to shakespeares representing his witches in this manner every body knows his poetical genius never consined himself to historical truth it is in fine so abstruse and intricate a point that though i have consulted glanville moreton and others i must leave it to the decision of abler critics  line    in culmiferous etc the propriety of these epithets are admirable and particularly consonant to horaces rule  they seem to be borrowed from cambria and are not a little akin to the author of this line and tamed the rough ferocity of men rosciad here we see the beauty of the latinized english since it would else have been the rough roughness which would have been a very rough expression indeed martina scribelinda macularia    so they the loved nicotian masticate or through shiptonian syrinx it inhale fumifical while in her better hand the goddess a pyxidicule sustains and autographs and schedals grace her right her daily lucubrations thoughts prelaute thoughts which her meditative owl inspires line    in her better hand doubtless many people will wonder why the left hand should be here expressed by the better and will dispute why one hand is better than the other but mrs midnight has not wrote this without a precedent the reader will find this same epithet in the rosciad ver    to specify the right hand which she has here given to the left admirably intimating that dullness is left handed or in other terms unlucky martina scribelinda macularia  line    daily lucubrations the reader will do well to consider that as dullness lives in a cellar it is no wonder she burns candle in the daytimebeside the text says they are thoughts her owl inspires and who knows but her owl may be in as bad a situation as mr smart who wanted light to see that it was dark as a late epigram intimates  see kapelion no   it is however certain that all authors have not the clearest ideas of day and night  you will find in the rosciad that at night  the lunar queen shines forth with splendour round the dimmer day   line     thoughts prelaute doubtless the critics of a fine ear for the flow of verse will be as much offended at the disagreeable sound i might have said cacophony of these two open words coming together as were the fine tympanumd gentry in the court of angustus against a certain line in virgil which as i dont remember i must pass over but mrs midnight has in this shown her respect for the modernizes of poetry  i will give you an instance  a certain writer who stands much on his merit in this point has used often these two words together natal land now there is a surprising harshness in the two else and almost an impossibility of pronouncing them both without making a stop between the words  it is true mr row with wonderful sweetness has used the word native here more than myself i prize my native land  here now is a softening syllable to harmonize the strength of the preceding and following ones  but what of this native is a vulgar word and every consideration should be given up for an epithet obsolete or uncommon as the abovementioned refiner of plain english has shown us such as patriotic worth  treaty of pacification and numberless others  it must be owned  patriot worth  treaty of peace would be equally expressive and a thousand times more elegant and beautiful but as that would be a common way of speech the dignity of the language would have been degraded    for he the sodale of her studious hours sung ululatious contemplating deep bright contemplation dignate of himself illustrious son of hebetudos race o all ye numerous tribe who in her cave delight to dwell of you the muse shall sing the verse as

sapient bubo first stands pendent in his mounted carcer held restrictive here he genders thought on thought as tween his nods meditabundate want and hunger gaunt awake his bardate soul line    steed pendent it is probable some of the witty gentlemen of the present age may laugh here and accuse the author of hibernianism and say it is only a mean imitation of a saying of the celebrated barnaby buxtm who told an acquaintance he steed like a man hanging in chains but with submission to these facetious critics if they reflect upon the situation of a bird perched in a hanging cage it is possible they may reconcile this passage to english  line    astween her nods this is a true and lively image of any author who writes for pay whose genius is never awake but when he is hungry   ah

epigrammatist  line    into bubonic form the metamorphosis of pentweazle into an owl is so admirably fancied that i cannot help preferring it to every thing i have met with in ovid the similitude of an authors being confined to study in his or his booksellers garret for means of livelihood is prodigiously similar to an owls perching on the beam of a barn meditating on the mice which she is to have  if she can catch them  line    solertial smart this passage bears some dispute as it is questioned by many whether there should be a comma between these two words  some assert the former to be an adjective and the last a substantive and suspect mrs midnight of a pun in heroics others will have the comma stand and assert they are hoth adjectives i have considered the point very seriously and finding so many reasons on both sides must leave it to the decision of the grammarians    he laughed and sung ever yet canidia cursed her macerated corpse in sacell laid where in the form of vacuum she dwelt and banished every golden rhyming thought just then in fatal hour grave hebes woke and in her leaden hand a crustule bore line    woere in the form of vacuum it is likely many of our brother authors especially those of the mathematical and philosophical turn will very learnedly and wittily ask in what form is the form of nothing however i must confess for my own part that i think mrs midnight goes in this place as infinitely beyond herself as all other authors have fallen short of her  this is a very bold and caring expression and is beyond criticism itself and whether the writers of the present day will allow the beauty and justice of this passage or not they have undoubtedly often experienced it so that i think their disputes of the existence of a vacuum in the universe would be better supplied by a study to destroy the vacuum they find in their pockets  line  0 golden rhyming thought notwithstanding tom brown has written a long and learned dissertation in praise of poverty and mr moore an admirable fable to prove that want is ths greatest help to genius yet there are few even poets i believe but think the jingling of one guinea against another infinitely better rhyme than pope gay or moore ever wrote in their lives and would approve a bank note of an hundred pounds as the best prose they ever read nay i believe with a little persuasion mr r  t himself would be brought to accept it notwithstanding there should be no hard word in it    charm more coercive to the inedial gout then noctial incantation of an hag than orient talsman or mysterious cast by

perverted into form anicular he verrates coenal trash with miscellaneous art cracks kernelld nuts line    or he is pent  line    in shape mustelar this is the second time in this work where a pun may be suspected  in the former passage i forbore to give my judgment but here i must own the words point immediately to the name pentweazle yet is not this passage to be degraded since it is only introducing a new and bold figure called the allusla which i would recommend to all the refiners of language whatever margelina seribelinda macularia  line    cracks kernelld nuts some of our readers may perhaps imagine here are meant nuts with kernels in them  to free them from that mistake i beg leave to assure them that mrs midnight means nuts without kernels as is expressed in the interpretation to come at the true and full meaning of the text it is necessary we subjoin the following advertisement given out by the fictitious etc to make you all merry at christmas and to open

point at some late advertisements put out in her name by the fictitious attempters to her humor and genius which as they are remarkable instances of the considence of these people we shall give an instance or two  advertisement whereas several egregious idiots have been flinging dirt at mrs midnight and her works the public is desired to take notice that there is now in the press and speedily will be published the old womans dunciad with notes  the gentleman who sent five guineas to be excused a place or in other words to be left out of my dunciad is desired to call at my publishers and receive his money for upon enquiry he appears to be such an egregious blockhead and is in all respects so fit for celebration and so worthy of public notice that i cannot prevail on myself to omit any character which will afford my friends such high entertainment  the reader is here desired to recollect or turn back to the preface    behold him into a monedule turned rostrate the ingenial cloac

tragedy he is engaged in as a work of nature requires undoubtedly a great deal of solidity  line  0  rostrate the ingenial cloac this is admirably natural and peculiarly adapted to the nature of a

than his own  line     femes loud retrovert many of our readers will perhaps think this sentiment rather ludicrous than momentary but it is seldom very seldom that our author writes without a meaning though it is possible an ordinary genius may be at a loss to find it out i presume by fames proclaiming the name of this gentleman backwards is intended the pains and trouble he himself takes to tell people he is a great man which is undoubtedly the reverse way to fame  line     manducating thoughts here is not a little beauty in this expression which it is probable the reader of little penetration will suffer to escape him  chewing thoughts  intimating hereby that this author chews his sentiments so long that they come from him with all the sweetness sucked out of them like dried

that in accursed hour on vile intent smackem a hostile and mischievous wight entered this cavern of cimmerian gloom line     in vaccal rumination here seems to be a very extraordinary meaning couched under the epithet vaccal  ruminating like a cw  it is a question well wertly the study and decision of our candid disputants and free enquirers in what manner cows may be said to ruminate or how for those ideas may comprehend or whether they are in a capacity of entertaining complex or only simple ideas  for my own part as i never imagined a cow chewing the cud a picture of reflection so i never gave myself the trouble to ask any one what she was thinking of i imagine our author mrs midnight is indebted for this thought to a late work where is this passage stretched in the clover ditch saintlowing herds couch ruminant you see from hence that the sentiment is however a very good one but perhaps this gentleman as well as mrs midnight might be acquainted with some cow of genius and therefore have done this honor to their species  line     smackem etc the reader will be better acquainted with this celebrated personage by perusing the following advertisement the magazines blown up

of which the jakes of genius is placed near the goddess dullness and in the last it is blazing on the fire  line   0 dire amazement ab nothing can add more to the dignity of verse then the frequent use of the ecphenesis or exclamation  it being a privilege peculiar to poetry which renders ordinary affairs or those of no consequence at all matters of the greatest moment thus a modern author introducing a sentiment as common as that of one day passes away and another comes beautifully exclaims  dire amazement ah is that small mart is newport all the spoil of glorious isca    at first the

it may here be observed how far the poets of the present day exceed in point of style all that ever went before them and how ignorant in the true beauties of expression were the most celebrated critics of yesterday  says mr pope words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found again such labored nothings in so strange a style amaze the unlearned and make the learned smile and again he says it is not enough no harshness gives offense the sound must seem an echo to the sense now how foreign is the sound of the word euthanasy to its meaning a gentle dying  and yet the beauty and propriety of this word as it derives from the greek is beyond all doubt margelina scribelinda macularia  line   0 o famed carnan t carnan not the true and genuine

make a sentiment which is in it sels mean and despicable equal to the most refined and sublime  here is a specimen of true wit  nature to adventage dressed what often was thought but never so well expressed i imagine mrs midnight has given this as an instance of that power and beauty of language she is mistress of which may not only serve to enlighten all who may write hereafter but may also convince them of the ignorance of the best of our predecessors in this point  says mr pope a vile conceit in pompous words expressed is like a clown in regal purple dressed an undeniable proof of the injudicicus taste of this author in so material a point  and how widely does he mistake the truth of the matter in saying  true expression like the unchanging sun clears and improves whatever it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none now who does not see in the above passage in the text that the sentiment is so altered that it is scarce discerned to be the same who would imagine that like horreal valve it beam refulgent signified no more than it shines like a shitten born door or as the reader may recollect several of the preceding passages that  nor glow inflaming kilus to dence the conculcated clay intimated nothing else than nor glow the brickkilns piping hot to lake the clay trod under foot to enumerate these remarks would here be needless as this whole work may be said to be one continual beauty of this kind margelina scribelinda macularia    auricular remains there ought as yet amid this cave within the muses lore a calamarian crowd in limbo lo like the famed

midnight and desire to know if crocodile is greatest how woodville can be greater  but sure gentlemen it is impossible but you must have heard of the new degree of comparison founded on a bold figure in rhetoric and called the supersuperlnive  it is by this that the celebrated author of the actor says that the tragic player requires fire in the greatest degree but the comic player in a much gater margelina scribelinda macularia  line     our castern bramin  it is presumed no body is ignorant of the celebrated author of the economy of human life whose name coming from so great a distance has made the world not a little suspicious of an imposture  the contest here pointed at is that between the original bramin and the authors of second parts suppliments etc which gentlemen are a set of writers who rather than go without a dinner at all are contented to take up with the victuals half cold after others have made a meal yet boast much of their dining at the same table  it is however to

would be unpardonable in a work of less merit than this dunciad virgils aeneids and some others of equal worth in this day  line     now is that work etc mrs midnight has closed this poem with as much confidence and as justly as the celebrated ovid whose words are jam opus exegi quod nec jovis ira nec ignis nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere vetustas the following lines to the end are borrowed from the most modest writer of the present age    call it a cacosyntheton or me stygmatize with hyberbation name but if fond regard fot modern verse deserve exsibilation or the frown of quaint derision if it is so let loose the storm of momus i can bear it all the reader will no doubt much approve this design of printing the interpretation to this work for the sake of the herd of readers who are void of a taste for the sublime though it was for a much greater end which our celebrated author intended it and this was the extensive utility it would be of in our academies and in
