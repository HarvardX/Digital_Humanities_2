osric the lion  a romance  london  printed in the year mdccxcvii  osric  the lion a romance swift roll the rhines billows and water the plains where falkenstein castles majestic remains their mosscoverd turrets still rear often loves the gaunt wolf midst the ruins to prowl what time from the battlements pours the lone owl her plaints in the passengers ear no longer resound through the vaults of yon hall the song of the minstrel and mirth of the ball those pleasures for ever are fled there now dwells the bat with her lightshunning brood there ravens and vultures now clamor for food and all is dark silent and dread ha do thou not see by the moons trembling light directing his steps where advances a knight his eye big with vengeance and fate it is osric  the lion his nephew who leads and swift up the crackling old staircase proceeds gains the hall and quick closes the gate now round him young carloman casting his eyes surveys the sad scene with dismay and surprise and fear steals the rose from his cheeks his spirits forsake him his courage is flown the hand of sir osric he clasps in his own and while his voice falters he speaks  dear uncle he murmurs why linger we here it is late and these chambers are damp and are drear keen blows through the ruins the blast oh let us away and our journey pursue fair blumenbergs castle will rise on our view soon as falkenstein forest is past why roll thus your eye balls why glare they so wild oh chide not my weakness nor frown that a child should view these apartments with dread for know that full often have i heard from my nurse there still on this castle has rested a curse since innocent blood here was shed she said too bad spirits and ghosts all in white here use to resort at the dead time of night nor vanish till breaking of day and still at their coming is heard the deep tone of a bell  loud and awful  hark hark twas a groan good uncle oh let us away peace serpent thus osric  the lion replies while rage and malignity gloom in his eyes thy journey and life here must close thy castles proud turrets no more shall thou see no more betwixt blumenbergs lordship and me shall thou stand and my greatness oppose my brother lies breathless on palestines plains and though once removed to his noble domains my right can no rival deny then stripling prepare on my dagger to bleed no succor is near and thy fate is decreed commend thee to jesus and die thus saying he seizes the boy by the arm whose grief rends the vaulted halls roof while alarm his heart of all fortitude robs his limbs sink beneath him distracted with fears he falls at his uncles feet bathes them with tears and  spare me oh spare me he sobs but ah it is in vain that he strives to appease the miscreant in vain does he cling round his knees and sue in soft accents for life unmoved by his sorrow  unmoved by his prayer fierce osric has twisted his hand in his hair and aims at his bosom a knife but ever the steel blushes with blood strange to tell selfstruck does the tongue of the hollowtond bell the presence of midnight declare and while with amazement his hair bristles high hears osric a voice loud and terrible cry in sounds heart appalling  forbear straight curses and shrieks through the chambers resound with hellish mirth mingled the walls shake around the groaning roof threatens to fall loud bellows the thunder blue lightnings still flash the casements they clatter chains rattle doors clash and flames spread their waves through the hall the clamor increases the portals expand over the pavements black marble now rushes a band of demons all dropping with gore in visage so grim and so monstrous in height that carloman screams as they burst on his sight and sinks without sense on the floor not so his fell uncle he sees that the throng impels loudly shrieking a female along and well the sad spectre he knows the demons with curses her steps onward urge her shoulders with whips formed of serpents they scourge and fast from her wounds the blood flows oh welcome she cried and her voice spoke despair oh welcome sir osric the torments to share of which thou have made me the prey twelve years have i languishd thy coming to see ulrilda who perished dishonored by thee now calls thee to anguish away my ruin completed thy love became hate thy hand gave the draught which consigned me to fate nor thought i death lurked in the bowl unfit for the grave stained with guilt swelled with pride unblest unabsolvd unrepenting i died and demons straight seized on my soul thou come and with transport i feel my breast swell full long i have suffered the torments of hell and now shall its pleasures be mine see see how the fiends are athirst for thy blood twelve years has my panting heart furnished their food come wretch let them feast upon thine she said and the demons their prey flocked around they dashed him with horrible yell on the ground and blood down his limbs trickld fast his eyes from their sockets with fury they tore they fed on his entrails all reeking with gore and his heart was ulrildas repast but now the gray cock told the coming of day the fiends with their victim straight vanished away and carlomans heart throbbd again with terror recalling the deeds of the night he rose and from falkenstein speeding his flight soon reached his paternal domain since then all with horror the ruins behold no shepherd though strayed be a lamb from his fold no mother though lost be her child the fugitive dares in these chambers to seek where fiends nightly revel and guilty ghosts shriek in accents most fearful and wild oh shun them ye pilgrims though late be the hour though loud howl the tempest and fast fall the shower from falkenstein castle be gone there still their said banquet hells denizens share there osric  the lion still raves in despair breathe a prayer for his soul and pass on
