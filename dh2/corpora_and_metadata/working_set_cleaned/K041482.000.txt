belgrade a tragedy  introduction sigismond the son of the emperor charles iv was elected king of hungary      and emperor of germany    0 his first wife mary being dead he espoused about the year      barbara the daughter of hernan count of cilley sigismond made the counts of cilley independent princes of the empire and called them to the diets without the consent of the house of austria their supreme lords who unwilling to emancipate the county from its dependence upon them declared war against the count in possession by barbara sigismond had only one child a daughter named elizabeth sigismond died       albert v duke of austria who had married elizabeth sigismonds daughter succeeded him in the empire and the kingdom of hungary albert died    0 leaving two daughters his queen elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death the child proved a son and was named ladislaus  upon the death of albert ii as emperor and v as duke of austria his cousin frederick great grandson of albert ii duke of austria was immediately elected emperor  the hungarians almost constantly engaged in war against the turks either for the defense of their own country or of the neighboring states deemed an infant prince and a queen regent unequal to the safe government of a kingdom which by frequent wars was kept in continual alarm the crown of hungary by the constitution of the kingdom being elective though sometimes possessed in hereditary succession uladislaus the young king of poland was chosen king by the advice of john corvin huniades earl of bistrie whom uladislaus made vaywode of transylvania huniades was as celebrated for his virtues as for his valor he was pious toward god faithful to his country and his prince and kind and benevolent to his friends as a warrior he was politic of invincible courage and mostly fortunate he was the first christian commander who showed that the turks might be overcome and he obtained more victories against them than any one of the christian princes before him sir william temple says that huniades was one of the three worthies who deserved a crown without wearing one the reward merited by the virtues and great talents of the father was paid to the son for in      the hungarians from their love to huniades and grateful remembrance of his long services chose his son matthias corvinus for their king   elizabeth unable to prevent this choice put her son uladislaus under the protection of the emperor frederick iii thus of alberts possessions only austria and the kingdom of bohemia remained unalienated from his posthumous son ladislaus  in the battle of varna      fought between the turks commanded by their king amurath ii and the hungarians led by huniades uladislaus the king of hungary was slain huniades by whose side he fought having left him to go and rally the left wing of the christian army  the hungarians now elected alberts son ladislaus king and they chose huniades their general governor of hungary during his minority the emperor frederick detaining the infant king in germany huniades as governor of hungary declared war against him after a long contest which the hungarians were obliged to intermit on account of their wars against the turks the emperor not strong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incursions of the hungarians at last in      delivered up their king then eleven years of age an assembly was appointed at vienna to which the nobles of hungary and bohemia were invited at this assembly it was decreed that during the minority of ladislaus huniades should govern hungary that george podiebrad should govern bohemia and that ulrick count of cilley great uncle to the king should govern austria and be guardian of his person  count cilley envious of the glory of huniades excited some parties of bohemians and moravians to attack upper austria but they proved unsuccessful when opposed by huniades ambitious of the government of hungary count cilley accused huniades the governor to the king but he justified himself from the accusation count cilleys ambition increasing with the power which he derived from being the kings guardian he attempted to make himself absolute master of austria to effect which he secured the principal fortresses by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his interest gradually removing elsinger and the austrian nobility from all offices of importance this conduct gave great umbrage to the people elsinger took advantage of their discontent and aided by huniades obliged ulrick to retire to his own territory of cilley thus by the bravery and conduct of these two warriors austria was wrested from count cilleys usurpation  mahomet ii the seventh king and the first emperor of the turks who took constantinople may         which his great grandfather bajazet i and his father amurath ii had unsuccessfully besieged marched      new universal history vol xxvi p     there is a mistake in the date of this siege of belgrade which is there put down ad      and in vol xxxii p     the date is      which last agrees with other historians with an army of   0000 men to besiege belgrade then thought the key to hungary  as soon as the report of mahomets intention to besiege belgrade reached the young king ladislaus then fifteen years of age he fled to the court of the emperor frederick which much displeased his hungarian subjects as it had before cost them a long and tedious contest to get him out of the emperors power  besides his numerous army of   0000 men mahomet provided a fleet of  00 ships and galleys which he sent up the danube from viden to belgrade to the intent that no relief or aid should be brought into the city out of hungary by the great rivers of the danube and the save upon the confluence of which the city of belgrade stands not contented with thus closely blockading the city on all sides mahomet sent part of his fleet further up the danube and landing troops spoiled the country in many places on the banks of the river on his first coming before belgrade he made a fierce assault but was repulsed he found the hungarians ready to receive him and prepared to skirmish with his troops without the walls as well as to defend the city mahomet finding his arms so resolutely opposed began to proceed more warily and entrenched his army he provided for its safety against the sudden sallies of the besieged by casting up deep trenches and strong rampires after planting his battery he began to shake the wall of the city most furiously with his great artillery insomuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground but the defendants with great labor and industry speedily repaired it by casting up new fortifications and rampires so that it was stronger than before  campestran a franciscan monk having at this time preached in germany a crusade against the turks had collected an army of  0000 men with these his followers he entered belgrade to assist in its defense against mahomet who was become the terror of all christendom by his conquests his enterprising genius his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age his indefatigable industry in the pursuit of whatever he undertook his irresistible courage his insatiable cruelty his avowed impiety his bloodthirstiness his immeasurable ambition his impious treachery and his unrelenting flintyhearted severity so that against his ambition there was no mound on his faith or friendship no dependence and in his least displeasure death  huniades who was gone to upper hungary to raise supplies was expected to sail from buda with a fleet of ships and galleys stored with warlike provisions when mahomet having been a month before belgrade

perceived by persons acquainted with the nature of stage effect  huniades or the siege of belgrade act first scene first  a hall of state several doors from inner apartments opening into the hall in the front folding doors count cilley coming forward through them a couch seen in the inner apartment from which he rises as the curtain draws up rodolpho following him count cilley rodolpho count cilley it mocks belief huniades arrived his fleet in sight engaging with the turks demons of air in whirlwinds scatter both thou roaring danube whelm them in thy flood destroy huniades though he destroyed plumed victory should forsake the christian banner and give to mahomet unbounded empire  rodolpho this passionate deportment tends to ruin your bounty has allured the peoples hearts because they see no motive but their interest which stimulates your ardour to relieve them the mine you dig should they suspect your purpose would be blown up with danger to yourself let circumspection guard what art has won opposeless is a foe newcrownd by victory huniades now reigns in every heart these succors swiftly raised and timely come to their relief have changed the peoples murmurings to joy and gratitude should you exclaim against their idol you excite suspicion still in the peoples interest seem absorbed seem joyful that huniades is come with fresh supplies to feed their wives and children this if he bring them not sows discontent  count cilley curse on his coming for it gives the lie to all i prophesied of his delay and drooping courage long has he been seen  rodolpho three hours  count cilley why instantly was i not told when the fleet came in sight art thou too leagued with fortune and my foes against my wishes my favors merit better service from thee thy too late warning leaves me now no power to form such plans as should have foiled his speed  rodolpho vain fruitless thought thy passion warps thy judgment thou might as well hope to arrest yon sun in mid career as stop this gallant chief when ardent in his countrys cause he comes yet had i known my lord you would have thanked the man who told you that your foe was near i could have summoned you from needed sleep to see a grateful people mad with joy to hear one voice of praise ascend the skies that great huniades their guardian genius their tutelary god was come to save them  count cilley peace for my illplaced anger taunt me not huniades the man i fear and envy whom i with deadly hate detest  he comes unsated vengeance fires my soul to phrenzy gods he triumphant comes give me some hope contrive some means that he may fall my victim  rodolpho be calm and opportune event may aid you without supplies the city must surrender if now huniades relieve belgrade the frighted king will strait return to celebrate his sisters marriage with the servian prince the princess gone the regents power is sappd the guardianship of such a peerless gem as your fair niece gives power to rise still higher it is rumored that his son corvinus dared to ask her hand   count cilley how my niece wed corvinus by heaven she never shall whilst i have life i first would give belgrade although the key of the hungarian realm to mahomet and he would rid me both of son and father huniades his blood commix with mine corvinus and agmunda then would mount my coward nephews throne supplanting me accursed scheme rise every fiend to blast it  rodolpho the regent has himself that danger warded glory and not ambition is his god he made the princess at the altar swear never to wed his son but other cares demand your present thoughts a hasty council has been convened which soon broke up commanding such troops to muster in saint julians square as can be spared from duty on the walls these from the western gate led by corvinus in one vast column through the turkish camp must fight their way against redoubling foes whilst with his troops and hoped supplies huniades shall disembark in this their purposed sally a thousand of your austrian troops they ask to march with the rearguard and flank the river the ground maintaining which the van shall gain and their retreat back to belgrade secure  count cilley ask me to aid the triumph of huniades bid the wrecked seaman quit the plank he clings to bid the parched wretch when fever fires his blood part with the cooling beverage from his lip it is a gross insult to demand my troops not one shall march beneath corvinus standard  rodolpho think of the consequence of this refusal twould sound unpopular and most suspicious that austrias regent the kings guardian and his great uncle too refused his aid stores to convey into a town besieged where every citizen eats scanty bread without these succors famine will ensue belgrade must yield and with it falls a kingdom your aid is not of service to your foe but to yourself worded the peoples friend you lose their confidence if in this misery your deeds desert them let not fury blind you weigh with your wonted policy your interest revenge and hate must wait a riper hour  count cilley i know not that their hour perhaps is now my spirits feel a prescience which prolaims the balance of my fate aloft is poised and shall i make the adverse scale preponderate pauses gods give me empire let me reign or die i would command my fate nor owe to chance my envied height huniades destroyed the regency of hungary is mine then this boy king the people will depose huniades whilst regent more defends him than could embattled legions armed to save him  rodolpho my lord the exigence demands despatch zilugo urged me for a speedy answer resolve lest your delay excite suspicion and make him penetrate your secret motive i know he views your conduct with distrust and lynxeyed jealousy may view it right unless you warily avoid its ken  count cilley be thine the craft telude his penetration smoothing my answer to a courteous form this governor i fain would win so tell him my troops should in this enterprise take part to the last man but that i fear the sultan when we shall sally to convoy the succors will try to force the eastern gate by storm this and the wall adjacent i must guard to draught my troops should an assault be given would be most certain danger to belgrade i but withhold them for important service more perilous far than that which i decline grace this with all the artifice of speech and speak me such as he would wish to find me to my lieutenant then the order give that cosmo shall the eastern gate command and hernans regiment surround the palace report my fears that the turks mean to storm and instantly to arms my austrians call  rodolpho is this parade meant but to blind the council or have these preparations other motives instruct me lest i fail to aid your purpose  count cilley this palace i will seize my niece the princess leagued with my foes or not shall be my prisoner till i succeed and if i fail my victim i must harangue the crowd distribute money accuse huniades of breach of faith that he has planned his son should wed the princess dethrone my nephew and usurp his crown if this inflame the people as i wish corvinus and huniades returned spoken with insidious meaning shall be for treason seized and thou their guard as thou wast elsingers the monk campestran fanatic priest shall writhe beneath my vengeance i will seize the sword his insolence refused me blessed by the pope the people hold it sacred thinking miraculous power attends the wearer campestran shall repent his proud defiance without his aid sole regent of this realm belgrade shall hail me and ere long its king with thy accustomed zeal my orders execute  exit rodolpho scene second count cilley the governor michael zilugo zilugo enters hastily as rodolpho goes out count cilley what trouble read i in your looks zilugo  zilugo grief at the loud laments of starving thousands and at the silent tears of hardy veterans drooping dismayed  the fleet is now in flames   count cilley the regents fleet which came this morn in sight  zilugo is now destroying naught can be seen of it for bursting flames and volumes of thick smoke which the west wind toward the city blows we fear our godlike champion now expires or chained is led in triumph by the victor i have just called the council to advise what in this exigence we ought to do fain would corvinus sally forth with all our force at the west gate and through the invaders on that side now redoubling force a passage and save from mahomet his gallant father with those brave troops who may escape the flames  count cilley the attempt is madness what risk our whole force to save one man hazard belgrade for him  zilugo huniades that one  hazard an empire though gratitude were dumb yet interest pleads for seven score thousand turks inured to war round our beleaguered walls have trenches opened and our own safety now demands his aid who but himself had fought against their fleet this morn yet he undaunted chief engaged their ships at fearful odds had victory smiled boldly must he his landing have made good in the teeth of all the sultans chosen soldiers and after that although you think it madness for us to pass athwart the turkish lines yet he with not the tenth of half our force would through their camp have hewn himself a path then with tired troops from a third battle panting belgrade had been again by him relieved this godlike man shall we with coward caution desert now when for us he stands the mark of hostile rage  count cilley defeat in mid career his boldness stops and with less daring prudence warns us to act nor by our ruin grace his fall huniades or dead or captive the tottering state must choose another regent a nations praise will that brave man deserve who in this peril dares to take the helm  zilugo now at this stormy crisis to be regent is to encounter toil and certain danger a thankless office where all may be lost and nothing can be won much the kings flight to fredericks court the people has displeased this beardless king deserting his own cause is grown unpopular the soldiers fight deadhearted yet where great corvinus leads adoring him with ready swords they follow another regent strewn with thorns will find his road unless our wellplacd choice select that hero whom the soldiers love and fear  count cilley a regent must be chosen or this corvinus this boy will arrogate his fathers power defy the councils orders waste our strength and lose the city of the most importance in the hungarian realm if you should aid this rash exploit i shall suspect your loyalty traitors i deem corvinus and huniades who would usurp my infant nephews throne to guard his rights i claim the generals truncheon  enter a messenger messenger addressing the governor my lord approaching toward the eastern gate a train of turks appears so very numerous that it resembles more a hostile army than a state embassy they sound a parley  zilugo let trumpets from the eastern tower accept it and send forth heralds to demand their purpose which here report  exit messenger count cilley now show your zeal to serve the state and in the council name me regent  zilugo forego that thought nor hazard a repulse my lord at present if the council choose a man for that high office much i doubt nay i foretell they never will name you  count cilley and yet this realm demands my care zilugo this new alliance with the prince of servia will keep the sword for ever in our hands against the turk who when he quits belgrade with fire and sword will ravage servia which by the treaty we are bound to succor huniades has some base views in this some secret tribute or some promised service my niece is sold  zilugo unjust are your suspicions the regent knows no interest but his countrys and servia aided by our arms will prove hungarias bulwark against the turks invasion therefore he gives the princess to matthias although her heart in secret loves another yet has his counsel over that love prevailed for the states welfare and his sovereigns safety  count cilley and can you governor approve this marriage the servian prince will like his treacherous father deceitful prove that father who before you murdered your brother basely in cold blood  zilugo my sword the traitor slew and justice satisfied resentment sleeps within its victims tomb  count cilley had i a regents power i would oppose this purposed marriage highly i dislike it formed by huniades it hides some treason let my niece wed with some hungarian lord whose service such a high reward may merit amongst the gallant nobles of this realm i know not who has from the state zilugo such claims to honor as yourself your son   zilugo haughtily i understand you count i know my interest is with the council of sufficient weight for such a bribe and when inclined to sell honor and faith i know a purchaser who wanting both would give a prodigal price glut my revenge and my ambition feed  count cilley i prize your zeal and therefore court your friendship it is my esteem for you which makes me choose your son to wed my niece whilst to your merit i am thus just you through mistake oppose me  zilugo it now behooves me bluntly to inform you you lose your dignity in these attempts your sanguine temper grasps at unjust power which vested in you would prove dangerous the man who asks more than he ought to have must meet repulse when honest minds are roused to oppose audacity respect is lost in that contempt which all unfair designs whether in public or in private life sooner or later ever must incur  count cilley half drawing his sword i will teach your bluntness to contemn my power  zilugo drawing his sword and retreating ulrick this sword is practiced against assassins   count cilley drawing his sword advances as man to man in equal fight advance  zilugo no whilst my sword can serve my countrys cause i will not use it but for her except to guard my life if i escape the peril which now awaits us call me forth  the friend of elsinger will meet you brave fallen elsinger his and our noble regents threatening sword kept from your grasp all austrias rich domains for had not they in your career opposed you instead of guardian to your infant nephew you first had rebel been and then usurper the power you have our nobles think unsafe therefore the council will not choose you regent  count cilley they shall by force elect me if not peaceably the army shall control them in my favor  zilugo only that army which you hither brought ulrick you now confess what all suspected that here your troops were stationd with design most hostile to this state we knew your purpose was not to grace the nuptials of your niece though that was your pretense to gain them entrance yet as twas rumored that the unnumberd host which mahomet led was marching to belgrade its gates were opened to receive your forces unquestioned your designs  count cilley and who should question them am i a german

not be importunate in speech choose of us three or make another choice i swear implicitly to obey your will  d isabella smiling beneath this deference this profound respect we spy the leaven of concealed indifference and as your heart sighs for anothers charms it is thus on both sides that you homage pay  d alvarez madam  d isabella a truce my lord   donna isabella mounts the step of the platform and seats herself upon the throne the queens of arragon mount the platform and seat themselves the dowager queen leonora on the righthand side of the throne and elvira on the left d isabella let each take place   the three counts and the grandees who form the court seat themselves on the seats prepared for them don lopez on the right hand side of the throne don alvarez and don manrique on the left carlos who stands on the righthand side of the throne in a line with the grandees but below them nearest the audience seeing a place unoccupied next to don lopez near to whom he stands seats himself don manrique rising steps from his rank and speaking carlos rises don lopez rises the instant carlos attempts to seat himself d manrique rise carlos rise whence such audacity  d lopez what title have you to assume this rank and seat yourself with the grandees of spain  carlos vacant the place my lords and as in camps so often in council with my king i sat i thought in courts to fill a place as well  d manrique a soldier to usurp the rank of count the favors of your prince make you forgetful  carlos think me not count ashamed of what i am nor yet forgetful of what first you knew me soldiers a title for a prince to boast carlos though now he holds a generals truncheon remembers that five years are not elapsed since as a soldier in the common ranks he fought unnoticd and without distinction one of that mass whose valor gains the war whilst he who leads claims all the wreath of fame the late good king your royal master lords who knew my deeds from rank to rank promoted me he thought that i had earned my generals staff if otherwise you judge the time is come when sovereign power may give you to reclaim it  d manrique presumptuous carlos how dares your arrogance a second time offend was it not enough to rank yourself with our nobility that when rebuked you dare our justice question had i or brave don lopez now the power we should disdain to take your honors from you deeds which will grace our historys future page deeds but acknowledged not rewarded yet your godlike arm invincible has done the royal standard of castile was taken in the kings sight your youthful arm redeemed it this perilous action turned the tide of battle inspired our troops with courage to drive back the conquering moors even to their rocky fastness till from the vanquished we became the vanquishers  carlos my lord i ask you not to word my deeds a soldier glories more to act than vaunt them  d manrique unasked i speak them to convince your pride i bear no envy to the worth i value from chains you saved the king in andalusia when pierced with wounds upon a heap of dead your body was so long his shield his troops gained time to rally those foes who hemmed him in were sacrificed and the same squadron which went to rescue him a victor brought him back and you almost expiring you mounted first upon the walls of seville slew roderigo and maintained the breach whilst the castilians entered then at their head stormed the strong citadel and forced its gates of many great exploits these are but some don lopez and myself to you indebted stand for life and liberty for when surrounded by triumphant moors then when we trembled prisoners to their arms by you our guardian genius bade them fall fate to our foes and providence to us you conquered numbers to redeem us bled  carlos my soul rejoiced to aid the valiants cause t was but a soldiers part i did brave count and had your fate been mine yourself or lopez would have done more to guard my life or liberty  d manrique to speak your worth is due to my own honor lest i be thought invidious of your glory your rank and not your courage i dispute i think your valor has not had its meed the late king promised to reward it further but death surpised him just as he resolved it  d isabella i carlos who his crown inherit take his debt on me and amply will repay you my brother held you high in his esteem he thought few equal in his court to carlos for valor in the field or in the council for wisdom prudence and distinguished vigor  counts let this difference end be seated carlos  d lopez ere he takes rank with the grandees of spain first madam order him to name his family we in no wise contest his bravery supernal power has nervd his youthful arm to achieve such deeds as would become a god let him declare his race and genealogy his lineage state for valor without birth had never right to occupy such place  carlos let him who wills boast honors others earned i will owe naught to those who gave me life i would rather equal caesar in the field than trace my lineage to the julian race what do we know of macedonias kings worthy record till philip rose in arms and alexander triumphed over the world  hereditary honors i disdain and know proud counts i would not give the name my sword has earned to be medinas duke even though don manriques blood enriched his veins i claim no parents but my past exploits my valor be my race my arm my lineage  d lopez the proof is clear that carlos is not noble  d isabella then i whose son soever he be or what his race ennoble him contest no more  d manrique permit me yet one word   d isabella not one don manrique for this audacity assumes too much must i have leave from you to ennoble carlos  d manrique no  but that place is due to highest dignities and though ennobled carlos cannot take it t is sacred to the high grandees of spain one less than count or marquis would profane it  d isabella henceforth then carlos marquis of santillane count of pennafiel and governor of burgos your titles claim don carlos i create thee one of the high grandees assert your privilege   he puts on his hat and take your rank   he seats himself is this enough don manrique to give him privilege to take that place does there remain one scruple in your mind  d manrique madam complete your work and make him king to grace him by such dignities is less to equal him to us than to exalt carlos to your own rank your skilful prelude princess and those exacted oaths we have just sworn show that your heart has made its choice of carlos we bound by vows must ratify that choice i shall obey nor aught attempt against it to him i here resign you and your kingdom i quit your presence ere you make him king not as one jealous at it but through fear lest for you queen i blush when you shall name him  going   the queen rises precipitately from her throne and descends from the platform the whole court rises the queens of arragon remain standing upon the platform donna elvira is much agitated during the last speech when risen she leans for support upon her chair her mother observes her very attentively d isabella  with anger stay insolent   d manrique returns  recovering her temper your queen forgives you manrique what an unworthy fear imprudently suspects to silence which i condescend so far as to declare that in my states just choice i acquiesce that you  still hold the rank you held in my esteem and i attribute this fiery transport to excess of love injurious as it is i pardon it ere your reflection pleads for loves offense  d manrique your conduct queen gave rise to my offense honors so lavished warranted suspicion excuse too madam some antipathy   d isabella forbear to justify your insolent pride though pardoned manrique it shall learn humility my sacred rights as woman and as queen you have profaned with impious disrespect slandered my conduct and my power insulted grant that i carlos love or that i solely through pure esteem pay tribute to his worth raising his rank above your lordly scorn whatever be my design you should respect either the choice my heart has made or what my power creates and will support proud vassal to curb your scorn still higher will i raise him grant him prerogative beyond my own myself and crown i to his power entrust i made him marquis he shall name a king you own his merit he shall judge of yours  to don carlos twice has your arm redeemed my throne and kingdom now let your wisdom like your valor shine and worthily bestow the crown you saved  advancing a step or two toward don carlos and presenting her ring to him lord marquis take my ring and as your testimony on the most worthy of these three bestow it and hail him king  what of this day remains is yours to weigh their merits and reward them ambitious rivals pay your court to him he who presents me with my ring from carlos shall instantly receive my hand and crown queens let us go and leave them to determine to whom in preference i would give my kingdom   the queens retire the scene closes upon the court leaving the three counts and carlos at the frot of the stage scene fourth don manrique don alvarez don lopez don carlos d lopez  ironically will my lord marquis deign to inform his suppliants what may be requisite to win his favor he is our judge he therefore must be softened  d carlos this illplacd raillery is most unseemly  d manrique to supplicate you carlos is unseemly  d carlos a truce with raillery or supplication lords let us continue friends well will i use the trust the queen has in my hands reposed nor shall you counts complain of my decision for i refuse to be the judge myself i give you one that it will be dishonor but to suspect the impartial sword brave lords a queen and kingdom on this ring depend both are well worth the contest you have courage  i guard this ring  carlos puts it upon his finger  d lopez and for whom guard it carlos  d carlos my vanquisher  he who can take it from me pledge of his worth shall to the queen present it the order time and place amongst yourselves agree i will await your summons and obey it  scene fifth don manrique don alvarez don lopez d manrique think of his arrogance  d alvarez t is thus a soul by valor nobly formed repels an outrage  d manrique if he expect to measure swords with us his pride has most egregiously deceived him  d alvarez refuse a challenge  d manrique yes beneath our rank grandees of spain all jealous of their honor do not expose their lives to bold adventurers  d alvarez how can you thus degrade a valiant warrior nay were he what your hatred has presumed we ought to treat him as the queen has ranked him  d lopez when the queen braves us nor regards our blood but dares the luster of our rank to tarnish raising this minion to an equal rank  d alvarez are kings accountable for whom they title our equals flourish or neglected fade just as their pleasure wills  d manrique my lord youre politic in the respect you pay to majesty but own your thoughts do you not judge she loves him that had she dared she would have named him king were not her speeches artful and mysterious  d alvarez you showed such high disdain of valiant carlos and with such contumacy braved the queen arraigned her conduct and her power disputed she was constrained to go the lengths she did or yield her dignity forego her power desert the brave and side with his high scorners you piqued her pride her sexs niceness wounded your speech indelicate and haughty carriage were more than queen or woman ought to bear would you my lord be by your vassal braved having the power to humble him to earth would you not use that power till his pride yielded subordinate to reason and respect  d manrique my lord you are a warm apologist but are you friend or lover in this cause do you indeed pretend to isabella t is said that arragons fair queen has charms   d alvarez her charms are not the subject of discussion my country honors me with that esteem to think me worthy to become its king grateful for this and my own fame respecting i will not counts refuse the grace it shows me i therefore with the marquis brave don carlos will measure swords nor think my rank dishonored if from his valor i can win the ring then lords with you i will contest the crown  d lopez gladly with you we shall dispute this prize you are a rival worthy of our swords but for this marquis he must seek his equals   exeunt severally don alvarez the same way that don carlos went don manrique and don lopez at the opposite side end of the first act act second scene first  a room of state donna isabella blanch d isabella seated on a sofa i pray thee blanch retire  blanch insist not madam i cannot leave you thus  d isabella why will thou stay  i blush that mortal should behold my tears or view the pangs that rend my anguishd heart thy feeble pity cannot change my fate nor thy calm reason argue me to peace  rising for i am doomed to feed a hopeless flame is this to be a queen ah dearbought greatness a queen a wretch in state chained down by prejudice a pageant slave a vassal to a throne great but for others powerless for myself  blanch madam control this grief think of your rank   d isabella rank can it root out passion from my soul and change my mould of mind annihilate the softness from my heart the cherished thoughts the oftrecurring hopes of fabled bliss i have so fondly formed but must not share  pride guard my mind and apathy my heart and let my feelings with my fate agree  blanch o madam how i trembled for your glory for from the oath you made your lovers swear i thought you fixed to give your crown to carlos but you have nobly conquered your own heart whilst you sustained your regal dignity  d isabella say rather blanch that love usurped my throne and with a monarchs wrath avenged my lover i thought that i was master over my heart i had not planned to act as thou have seen me although i meand to honor carlos highly i only willed to try the counts respect and to secure my power and royal rights for as alas this choice was dreaded by me it seemed like a relief a sort of pleasure to lose a little time to loiter lingering thus to retard my doom and put off fate yet i was going to name  i had no choice  and could don manrique have restrained his pride castile perhaps ere this had hailed him king he urged my temper to its utmost bearing and scarcely i refrained from naming carlos to gall his pride for daring to insult me  blanch i marvel not that you chastise his insolence which on you cast such shame and rude reproach  d isabella under the specious plea to avenge my power love found a fair pretense to scatter favors i have made carlos marquis count and governor oh with what joy could i have hailed him king how my heart pleaded yet by these profusions i thought to satisfy and silence it for to pronounce against him much distressed me and when i bade him give away my crown twas only that he might himself exclude i parleyd with my power to soothe my heart and did an outrage where i seemed to honor  blanch fearing to make him king you make him more  d isabella my heart indifferent to all the three thought that it best could like whom carlos chose this sudden fancy swayed my conduct blanch but now i wish i had repressed the thought and humbled manrique by some other means for i have erred in making carlos judge he bids the sword decide ah does he hope to gain me thus himself does he then love me  i dare not trust my thoughts that dangerous length i must prevent the sword from being drawn and by my choice stifle these dreaded feuds  blanch twill be an arduous task to wrench the sword from valors hand when custom bids it grasp it he who retracts is ignominious held and honor to great souls is more than life  d isabella i would not so disgrace my power to affront that valor i admire for when obedience is by dishonor stained kings go too far and undermine their own omnipotence feigning to grant i will prevent this combat if they remit it then i hold it broken see carlos to obey my order comes   exit blanch scene second donna isabella don carlos d isabella marquis castile has by your arm been saved its gratitude i till this day reserved to make its favors more conspicuous shine granted in full assembly of my states much has it grieved me when i meand reward but to stand forth the champion of your worth and ere my purpose to yourself was known to have those honors to your merit due extorted as an act of justice from me as if i wanted soul in virtues cause freely to pay where i indebted stood for services almost beyond reward  yet whilst i own no recompense can reach them i trust that i have shown i prize your virtues spite of that envy which pursues your merit i unsolicited have raised your fortune yet if not equal to your just ambition if other recompense you hoped or wish for speak to your own content i will oblige you  d carlos my queens exalted spirit has bestowed such high such fullblown honors as my soul dared not in thought conceive far less expect troubled amazed confused overwhelmed with bounty let her not think i have one wish ungratifyd  d isabella yet when above your hopes i raise your fortune grace and distinguish you with all my favor lean on your judgment with a sisters confidence you give me marquis reason for complaint  d carlos how madam have i sinned  d isabella your sword is raised against the states repose and against mine the strongest pillars of the state are manrique lopez and alvarez in them you undermine it in them you seek to shed its purest blood think to what height my people prize these counts since worthy each is deemed to share my throne  d carlos madam  this blame   d isabella my lord when thus i censure you and to yourself whatever complaint i make such frankness tells in what esteem i hold you i would prevent you from incurring blame guarding your honor thus i mean you favor  your pride against the counts has armed your vengeance there was no need my lord to draw your sword i had avenged the insult you sustained nor did i leave your triumph incomplete when i deputed you to give my diadem i made you the counts judge but not their foe bidding the sword decide you much mistake me  d carlos then has my judgment not my duty erred only my courage do the counts allow me therefore in that i humbly put my trust to prove who worthiest   d isabella  interrupting him did you then hope if over all three your prowess gave you vantage it would be said choosing castile a king the state could find none to compare with you  if thus presumptuous and thus vain i thought you    stops short d carlos  kneeling after a moments pause oh spare the injurious accusation madam  if you repent your favors gracious queen my ruin is no difficult achievement yet do not charge me with unthoughtof crimes nor arm your anger with unjust suspicions  the queen signs to him to rise i love you queen but with a flame as pure as from the hallowed sacrifice ascends as we love honor virtue heaven itself  and if the matchless luster of my sovereign dazzles a moment my enchanted soul sudden it back returns and downcast shrinks into itself ambitious sighs vain hopes and criminal desires i never breathed  d isabella it is well  i find myself mistaking carlos  d carlos i madam only as a queen can love you for should unhallowed passion rise within my guilty breast should you o pardon princess the impious thought should you so far forget your sacred self and what you owe your rank as to partake the passion you inspired and suffer me to breathe my vows before you if by some fatal fascination cursed your sensibility should so degrade you as to descend even from your throne to me know my esteem would instantly decrease and my love raised on that would soon expire  d isabella marquis your thoughts are worthy a great soul  d carlos your glory madam is my hearts first object in combating the counts i have no wish but to make known him who deserves you most ill should i answer your high confidence if only on my judgment i depended to choose your spouse and partner of your throne  allseeing power direct the sword of him who best deserves her through my ready heart  d isabella carlos forbear nor interest heaven itself against my peace  why must the sword decide   blushing with shame at weakness unsubdud i own i love one of the purposed combatants yet should i not have named whom i prefer for though i love my countrys good outweighs my tenderest thoughts my heart foregoes its choice and seeks the hero who deserves to reign and by my subjects will be most approved after don manriques most opprobrious insolence fearing my partial heart might sway my judgment to yours i trusted and consigned my crown not thinking you would bid the sword decide and harrass with new woes my wounded peace carlos respect his life whom i esteem reflect how hard his fate to lose a throne respect the sufferings of my sorrowing soul torn for my peoples good from him i love let me not have to mourn his hapless death with poignant anguish neverending tears  d carlos o queen i would not dare to wrest your confidence guessing the secret which your scruples veil nor solve the mystery hidden beneath your words yet hear your faithful servant gracious princess trust me such equal heroes are these counts on your hearts choice you safely may rely  why then reject with cruel heroism the good which heaven has placed within your reach let not the thirst of glory now deceive you it soon will pall and to vacuity will leave your heart or else a prey to grief did virtue claim the purposed sacrifice that motive in full force would constant last and lenient sooth at once and heal your mind o dread the agony of hopeless passion it steeps the warriors manly cheek in tears and makes him joyless though with laurels graced brave not this ceaseless torment of the soul it is the baleful poison of sweet peace no balm can medicate no time assuage to which night brings no sleep nor dayspring joy  o heaven instruct me in which happy lover i may revere my gracious royal mistress that by an easy and a sudden victory   d isabella it must not be  if through respect for me one of the three you spare you give the prize you make me judge  i dare not must not choose  you urge me carlos to the brink of fate  you add fresh conflicts to an oerchargd heart  your eager valor hazards all my peace heedless you pierce my heart with wounds immedicable   turns from d carlos to hide her emotion i would avoid discussion on this subject   though as a queen i might forbid these combats i will not wound your honor nor the counts the lists shall be prepared the challenge held who of the three is first to try his fortune  d carlos  observing the queen alvarez madam  d isabella he for another sighs  d carlos yet he alone the glorious prize contests  d isabella gallant alvarez first though thou love me not tomorrow shall his courage be displayed  d carlos this day the challenge of alvarez names  d isabella if i consent not what avails his challenge on your allegiance be it then deferred carlos adieu  respect my prohibition  scene third d carlos  alone defer the fight is not my valor stained by this command and will not honor blush has the queen right to give me law am i her subject no i was born in arragon  heavens i remember that and dare stand here count  marquis  governor of burgos too  yet know myself born of the meanest race only the son of a poor peasant shepherd taught by a pious priest through charity till learning made me wild with mad ambition to act the heroic deeds i joyd to read oh should these lords discover my mean birth with what insatiate scorn would they exult how would my royal mistress blush disdainful and sweet elvira then reject my sword nor own my arm to prop her tottering throne cruel remembrance of my original self cease cease to haunt and terrify my mind  kings were once chosen from victorious soldiers who serves his country needs no ancestry for like the sun he gives not borrows light my cottage blood has been exhausted all in glorys field no drop of it remains but it has bought me all my soul holds dear the palm of victory and the wreath of fame behold she comes my rightful unownd queen  scene fourth donna elvira don carlos d elvira ah carlos scarcely can i call you marquis although you merit your exalted rank but then i wished myself to raise you to it why have the charms of glory thus seduced your wavering honor to desert that cause to which your faith was pledged your sword devote your valor should compel the rebel garcia to yield obedience to my sovereign sway your sword held ready till i bade it strike to place my longlost scepter in my hand yet count and with that selfsame sword your faith to me engaged you undertake to fight three single combats which are not for me you have forgotten count what carlos promised back to the queen resign penafiel burgos and santillane for trust me arragon shall grateful give you more than you refuse  d carlos either as carlos or as marquis madam i nor forget nor will desert your rights the traitor garcia shall your victim fall yet though this sacrifice i owe to you the queen in gratitude first claims my sword and highly it behooves the favored marquis to pay the mighty debt of humble carlos and to resent the outrage done the queen  d elvira did she entrust her ring with that intent  d carlos when your bright sex insulted wants a champion forbid it honor glory courage manhood that they should need to stoop to ask for aid or intimate the means to right their cause  d elvira i think these combats might have been avoided unless the counts had challenged you in arms  d carlos then had i been ungrateful and dishonored could disrespect assume an air more taunting than to assert with scornful insolence that her high heart indulged a secret passion unworthy of herself manrique averred it and infamy would blot my name with cowardice not to stand forth in her most sacred cause when duty honor gratitude command it my royal mistress in protecting me incurred this insult by her noble spirit sdeigning submission still the count defied her forcing her new restrictions to invent or tamely shrink insulted on her throne i must protect her rights assert her power maintain her cause her injuries avenge that done my sword with heartfelt zeal is yours  d elvira carlos i comprehend from this excuse that the queens service is preferred to mine because her subject you break faith with me  d carlos for her or you i feel an equal zeal your cause or hers is mine nor have i seen aught yet of sleepless toil or perilous hazard but what for either i would wish to encounter nay though engaged to fight for her tomorrow sustained you wrong which this day called for vengeance instant would i expose my breast to more than three such combats in your cause elvira without reflecting what i owed the queen misconstrue not the conduct which i hold nor wound my soul by undeserved reproaches know the high rank to which the queen has raised me has but one charm for me but as your champion donna elvira are those honors prized which in the eye of undiscerning crowds will give respect to him who fights your battles beyond what unplumd courage ever meets  d elvira to grace my cause i wanted but your valor i can invest you with still higher honors them marquis you disdain and me betray  d carlos i wished but one reward from bright elvira i thought it mine  but find myself deceived  d elvira deceived my lord by whom  d carlos my own vain thoughts  for from your gentle manners i presumed that in esteem you held the humble carlos that in your breast such hallowed friendship dwelt as pure religion with allhealing balm tells us the blessed in the next world enjoy where all distinctions cease of earthly rank but i was mocked with visionary joy the queen of arragon suspects my zeal changes the sweet complacence of her temper for dark distrust anger and keen reproach my mind feels anguish all unknown before a comfortless dismay subdues my spirit joyless forlorn and desolate i seem as if my guardian angel left his charge and every cheering passion joined his flight  d elvira if i be changed your conduct wrought the change anger suspicion and reproaches carlos are not the natives of elviras breast your instability excites them all glory allures you to forget your faith which unconditiond marquis carlos promised my friendship brooks not this nor my esteem  i hear alvarez enters first the lists you know the history of his faithful love  d carlos over alvarez soul i know your power his virtues make him worthy of your heart  d elvira when you fight with him think of whom i love and be his blood respected as your own  d carlos do you command me then to make him king  d elvira i only ask that you would think of me i go in hopes of justice from the queen and if i can these combats to prevent   exeunt severally end of the second act act third scene first donna elvira don alvarez d elvira forbear my lord and choose some other theme how dare you to pretend you love me still when in the lists you fight to gain the queen what star malevolent thus rules your fate making your arm a traitor to your heart  d alvarez imperious honor claims excuse from love  d elvira a lovers honor is fidelity my lord you now can have no hopes from me to what does your ambitious heart pretend  d alvarez that you should pity a poor wretchs fate your cruelty involves in such distress oh could my faithful love have won your heart this fatal honor never had been mine the states would not have named me as a suitor nor forced me by their choice to woo the queen oh would to heaven that i may either die or win the queen but to acquire elvira  d elvira vain are your prayers to wish for miracles embrace the glittering prize which fortune offers so much to your advantage is the change that it wipes off that censure and disgrace which levity and fickleness excite but yet beware alvarez that brave carlos does not avenge me to your glorys downfall and make your pride repent of this desertion  d alvarez princess this forced desertion more befriends me than have whole years of persevering love when honor forces me to break my chains how i rejoice to be so much esteemed as to excite your anger and resentment  d elvira count you mistake the source of my displeasure much it offends me that you still persist to persecute my heart when you forsake me and that you term my coldness cruelty hope gave i none nor sought to gain that love i feared my unwilling heart could never share i own with gratitude your generous services when heavens inflictions did most sore beset me my best esteem must be your sole reward a heart magnanimous expects no more nor seeks it to enslave whom it has served  d alvarez ah think me not so mean of soul to plead those services your sacred sex commands from valors arm which i triumphant paid von all the poor merit that alvarez claims is from tried love and constant adoration too happy had i been could these have won you  d elvira no consort will i choose till i am queen the nuptial tie no hero shall involve in my disastrous fortunes to his ruin europe through all her states has no alliance for isabel or me no king nor prince whose power might safely combat for my kingdom and should my present shining prospects fade had i the meanness to accept your hand my wars would drain the treasures of your house for when contending monarchs play for empires the noblest fortune scarcely pays one stake  an undisputed and more splendid throne presents itself to your unsteady love willing perhaps it found your heart to share it  d alvarez no t was your cruelty exposed me to it when on a rock you drive me to destruction then you revile the shipwreck you have caused  d elvira i blame you not that you accept this fortune more favored lovers might have listened to it yet be what will the motives of your conduct with much less warmth it might have been embraced but you fight first and this impatient zeal proclaims with how much joy you break the chains of illrequited love and gain your liberty  d alvarez how could you bear the people should behold your lover the most cowardly of the three not daring to attack this glorious carlos till first his rivals had his force exhausted  d elvira those rivals come with them my lord i leave you   exit d elvira scene second don manrique don alvarez don lopez d manrique which treats you best alvarez love or fortune can the queen charm so near the bright elvira  d alvarez when i have won the ring i will declare  d lopez t is thought that carlos rivals you in both and gives you cause for jealousys keen pangs  d alvarez he makes more jealous than myself i fear   d lopez through pity he should yield you one or to other ending the contest who shall make him king the fair castile and arragon both wish it two queens in beautys prime both sigh for carlos  d alvarez then let that thought our lofty spirits humble though pride and honor storm with giant strength love gives the palm where justice might decree it  d manrique yet you defy this idol of your praise  d alvarez my lord my honor is distinct from pride honor impels me to demand the lists and pride alone could make me scorn brave carlos  d manrique the queen has ordered us to meet her here but on what subject to confer we know not this is a day of wonders and caprice but you alvarez patient bear each change with calm indifference and stoic apathy whilst various torments rack my burning soul and love and pride by turns my bosom rule  scene third donna isabella don manrique don lopez don alvarez d isabella leave us alvarez i to these counts would speak on matters of concernment to myself your interest shall obtain my best regard you shall find all the favor you can wish  d alvarez when you command i know but to obey   exit d alvarez scene fourth donna isabella don manrique don lopez d isabella i will remove all cause of discontent and since my choice more honor will confer i will reclaim my ring and choose myself but from my choice alvarez i exclude yet the sole cause of this exclusion lords is that i know he loves the queen of arragon  in one of you i view the future king   d manrique  kneeling o madam how your words transport my soul even whilst i tremble between hope and fear if lopez win you i shall be less wretched resigning you to such a worthy lover speak madam my impetuous soul eager with hope demands to know my bliss or woe  d isabella rise  ere i speak my choice fain would i see some certain proof that t is myself you love and not the splendor of my sovereign rank counts i shall think myself most loved by him who can my sentiments and thoughts adopt like whom i like and whom i hate despise  d lopez lest we mistake your will speak plainly madam  d isabella if i have liberal been to valiant carlos let me behold in you a like esteem honor his virtues do his merit justice for never presume i will a consort choose to have the king i make my work destroy reclaim my favors or disgrace my friends therefore let neither hope to share my throne till something worthy on your parts confirms what i have done for carlos that by such act i may remain assured the structure which my gratitude has reared shall not be razed for i must know it safe from storm or stratagem  d manrique don carlos madam is most highly honored his happiness so much employs your thoughts ours is to his inthralld yet since to honor him is to please you instruct us how to act  the palm of victory nor the trump of fame never gave renown to one more brave than carlos he is most worthy your munificence and well deserves to be what you have made him our gratitude to him indebted stands and we wished largely to acknowledge it  d lopez but after you we can do nothing for him carlos is raised above our power to favor what is there in our power left to propose that would not be a degradation to him  d isabella gifts in your power there are he might accept gifts that would clear your names from black ingratitude and free my anxious mind from its disquiet gifts which without disgrace he might possess  d lopez then name them madam power and not will we lack to clear us from this charge of black ingratitude  d isabella counts you have each a sister t is my will that he whom i shall please to choose for king when he receives my hand at the same altar shall to the warrior carlos give his sister  the counts testify by their looks much surprise embrace him as his brother and his friend and thus secure him from my husbands enmity not that i need to fear his hate to carlos as in castile i shall be always queen for the new king whatever his project be will though enthroned be only my first subject but to exert my plenitude of power over the heart to which i gave my own would pain my inmost soul in the extreme i urge this union as of strife preventive then answer will ye give your full consent  d manrique yes queen our full consent  to doom us both to the most cruel death rather than see the bright pure honors of a thousand years by such a marriage in one moment tarnishd  too dear an empire at a price like this  d isabella thus then audacious count thus then you testify that carlos is most worthy my munificence and well deserves to be what i have made him thus to except against the rank i give proud manrique is to scorn my sovereign power  d manrique i do not queen dispute your power to exalt carlos or whom you please even to our rank no sovereign stands accountable for dignities which he confers or gifts his liberality bestows if he support or raise the unworthy t is his own work and the shame all his own but to disgrace by misalliance blood which from my ancestors unsullied flows no monarch ever shall by my consent first be it on a public scaffold spilt rather than know such vile contamination  mine from inheritance i owe account of it to my brave ancestors and all posterity pure from my great forefathers i received it pure shall it still remain or cease to flow  d isabella then manrique i who owe account to no one will of your vaunted noble blood dispose be mine the shame of its contamination what mad extravagance makes you presume to think i should propose what would dishonor you how dare you to suspect me of such turpitude what law of rectitude or nicest honor have i infringed throughout my life proud lord or what disgrace incurred i know of none but what i now incur  being forced to wed  degrading thought  the vassal of my crown who  whilst i thus descend  scorns to entrust his honor to my care  say in what character subject or lover dare you to treat me thus  d lopez pardon the ardour which infatuates him and makes him disrespectful in his speech in marriage both our sisters are betrothed  d isabella to whom  d manrique his sister madam is to me affiancd  d isabella  to manrique to whom is yours engaged  d manrique to lopez madam  d isabella then i am wrong in making either king go happy lovers go to your chosen mistresses and to enhance the value of your love tell them with what contemptuous galling scorn you have a queen insulted and disdained a throne  retire we hold no further conference  d lopez  kneeling yet hear us madam  d isabella and what have you to urge to speak in praise of constancy in love and that no earthly grandeur should seduce it if t is a crime to violate this virtue i too perhaps my lords may learn to practice it  d lopez practice it madam  but permit us first to explain ourselves that you may fully know don manriques heart and mine where you reign absolute as queen respected and adored as mistress  your choice will make the one on whom it falls supremely blessed the other doom to woe but to prevent all jealous feuds between us a mutual promise binds us in one interest if he be chosen then i wed his sister if i obtain you mine with him unites thus carlos cannot to the king be brother  d isabella and know you not that being what you are the feudatory vassals of my state your sisters are my subjects and on me depend  without my order and expressly against my will in marriage to engage them is to usurp my throne and give me law  d manrique assert your high prerogative as sovereign command us as the vassals of your state do not request unless we may refuse command we at our peril must obey  d lopez but queen remember  never will consent   d manrique and yet in deference to your election thus far we will recede through love and duty carlos is generous and he knows his birth let him in secret judge upon that knowledge and if his blood be worthy of such union to us let him this marriage then propose and we the alliance shall an honor deem he has free choice to wed one of our sisters if after knowing these strict terms he dare t is at his peril if his birth be mean  thus far we stoop to gain our royal mistress modest let carlos be or else this marriage must in innumerable evils plunge him  d isabella yourself take care lest him too much disdaining i teach you what a queen should do how reign retire my lords  i wish to be alone  scene fifth donna isabella alone whence this mysterious mutiny in both when their obedience would a throne obtain does it arise from pride from envy springs it is it malignity contempt defiance or can it be that noble generous spirit which wrestles with the power its fortune wants fearing complacency might falsely seem like a vile parasite through interest courteous perhaps t is heavens high hand that interferes yet wherefore  my weak sense searches in vain  why wars affection with my fame and glory if only by these cruel ceaseless conflicts of reason pride and shame love is controlled grant me the fortune heaven i dare not take and since for me thou have not made a king to the most worthy of my subjects give me inspire my people let them name don carlos scene sixth donna isabella blanch d isabella i have misspent my time the haughty counts at such a price refuse the diadem  blanch i madam am returned successless too for carlos on such terms rejects all fortune  d isabella what is he bent to render hate for hate and for contempt  contempt  blanch oh no far otherwise the sisters of the counts he much esteems thinks them deserving of a monarchs love  d isabella why does he then reject this high alliance  blanch some secret obstacle obstructs your plan for though obscure and all confused his speech i could perceive a something from his words as if some vow of constancy were made and his whole soul were wedded to the object  d isabella ah  does he love elsewhere  blanch i judge so madam  d isabella whom does he love  blanch one of exalted rank  isabella alas  but tell me whom  blanch he loves a queen  d isabella he loves a queen  elvira is his choice he quits castile and goes with her to arragon  love and not glory makes him quit my court  blanch you should desire his absence as the means to root this fatal passion from your heart  d isabella have i to lose him aggrandizd him then and shall a queen in the same cradle nursed with me reared and protected by my royal parents castile her refuge and her sole defense shall she

blanch why should his love or his retreat offend you i know not which he loves you or elvira nor can i comprehend your wrathful jealousy  d elvira then thou have never loves disquiet known stormy and fearful does it make my mind and tempests every feeling of my heart elvira has no loftiness no pride more generous more exalted than myself she with the noble spirit of a queen bestows her crown she is beloved adored whilst i am  left scorned hated and renounced my pride that dares not choose him king yet brooks not his desertion  blanch since you respect your honor too much to choose him king why wish his heart  d isabella i love him  can i bear to be disdained no let him doting to distraction love me yet so respect me never to break silence  blanch respect your self  combat conceal this passion  d isabella carlos contemns me he can reign without me he loves elvira hence his false respect that dared not love me but as heaven is loved she loves him too and to a throne will raise him the queen her mother is indulgent blanch and her consent will sanctify their union a parents judgment justifies the child elvira loves him and will make him king  blanch madam t is said she will not now be queen for fame reports that yet her brother lives  d isabella it cannot be he died in early infancy  blanch i but declare the rumor which i heard that this prince is not dead and that he comes now with the expected deputies from arragon  d isabella the queen of arragon believes him dead but in a son restored to prop her state how will her sorrowing widowed heart rejoice let mine though lost to every hope of bliss expand benevolent to greet her joy   exit followed by blanch end of the third act act fourth scene first donna leonora don manrique don lopez d manrique accept our joint congratulations madam that heaven restores a son you mourned as dead for though a throne and queen in beautys bloom were never yielded but with strong regret although to one of us they both are promised we seeing a king competitor resign them before the states revoke their choice of us the prince your son back to your arms restored shall find us faithful subjects till he claims these his high rights accept for him our homage  d lopez we mourn as lovers but rejoice as patriots our faithful hearts are to the state devoted therefore we ardent wish castile with arragon to be united firm by this alliance that their leagued forces may the moors subdue unblushing we resign this glorious fortune which whilst it honored us our queen degraded let isabella and don sancho reign  d leonora my lords this generous resignation flatters too soon my new raised hopes  alas what hopes my princely son in infancy expired and this report excites my grief and wonder opens the sources of my woes afresh renews my sorrow for my firstborn hope with all the yearning anguish mothers know who mourn an only sons untimely death oh did he live now might his arm protect his own his sisters and his mothers cause  d lopez doubtless for this heaven has preserved your son  d leonora alas my lord he has not been preserved  nineteen long years i over his tomb have wept he cannot be alive  unless some miracle from heavens high hand compels the yawning grave to yield its prey  all that concerns my son i will relate then judge if this report have aught on which a mothers hope may build  i will not trace my troubles to their source for arragons revolt and garcias usurpation from my long biding here must be well known  d manrique often from our fathers have we heard your woes how ferdinand was from his kingdom driven and you ere eighteen summers suns had graced your brow were forced to seek for shelter here before the fair elvira saw the light thus much we know in what remains instruct us  d leonora just as don ferdinand beheld the rebel garcia ready to mount his throne my son was born don sancho was my hapless infant named from barbarous garcias fury to protect him my royal husband urged me to consent to his conveyance to a safe retreat the place where ferdinand concealed my child i never knew  d manrique had you no clew to trace him that so one day you might reclaim your son  d leonora my husband with our infant tokens sent mine and his portrait with a braid of hair pledge of my love ere yet my bridal day and a deed written by ferdinand himself that owned and that identifyd our son these in an iron casket were enclosed its secret spring known but to him and me  ah these precautions proved but useless care twelve moons had scarcely wand when my child died ere i again had clasped him to my breast  d lopez perhaps some false report might then deceive you we came expecting you could solve our doubts and realize the hope and wish of all to find your son in a most valiant hero fain would i hope this rumor may prove true and that your son still lives to glad your eyes  d leonora oh t is impossible his father he himself told the dire tale he saw my babe expire  caught his last breath  and closed his beamless eyes  d manrique would we could doubt the truth of his report  d leonora a year of woe and bloody contest passed then ferdinand rejoined his son in death within my arms he died his last words were   don raymond has in charge when time shall be  a most important secret for thy ear  fly to castile live for our unborn infant   long did i hope this secret was my son but raymond never gave me hope it was raymond is lost and i shall never know it five years are passed since he was prisoner made by garcias spies i fear they murdered him too faithful to my cause brave raymond perished  scene second donna leonora don manrique don lopez don alvarez d leonora have thou learned count whence this report arises  d alvarez don raymond lives by me he greets you madam  d leonora for my true servants life kind heaven i thank thee  d alvarez more joy awaits you queen   d leonora  with wild ecstasy have i a son  d alvarez don sancho lives   d leonora oh lead me  let me see him  weep on his neck and clasp him in my arms  my son  my son  yet can it be great god oh bring me to him make me know he lives   going d alvarez staying the queen don raymond seeks him   d leonora seeks him oh all is false   leans halffainting upon d manrique i hoped him come with raymond this the secret which dying ferdinand declared he knew  d alvarez madam it is and raymond seeks don sancho here in this court  d leonora ah vain research alvarez will you conduct don raymond hither to me  d alvarez he to the assembled troops is gone in hopes to find don sancho midst their captains don raymond joined the deputies from arragon after their messengers were sent to announce to you their near approach then he declared that their prince lived that here he hoped to find him as in the armies of castile he long has served  i will seek raymond madam but so eagerly do your brave arragonians press around him their prince demanding that i doubt to bring him hither i must bring the whole wild multitude  scene third donna leonora don manrique don lopez d manrique as here don raymond seeks him i believe either that heaven has torn don sancho from you or that he lives in the illustrious carlos  d leonora carlos my lord  and thinks don manrique thus  d lopez this is the thought and wish of a whole people  when it was known that here your son was sought all with one voice exclaimed he must be carlos we judged that you could have explained the mystery and therefore sought your presence to explore it  d manrique madam though envious of carlos deemed i own that his whole life since we have known him throughout its wondrous course appears one miracle himself and fortune almost supernatural his high strung virtue that enchants all minds his lofty valor which transcends my praise his port majestic and his winning mien give him access beyond a subjects reach to thrones two queens all emulous strive who shall esteem and honor him the most nay even from love can scarce defend their hearts the prompt respect of an adoring people who like some god gaze at him as he passes all with resistless evidence evinces that valiant carlos is your longlost son  d leonora in such a son how might a mother triumph but yet beware my lords how you inspire the thought that carlos is my longmournd child lest i mistake a womans conscious pride that would exult to own a son like him for natures sacred voice within my breast he has a princes spirit not his birth himself by his own conduct this attests leaving the queen to choose amongst her subjects the partner of her royal bed and throne  d manrique see you not madam that his princely spirit prepares to gain this conquest over all three have you forgotten what he said before you  i will owe naught to those who gave me life  nobly his heart resigns that high advantage to owe his greatness only to his courage  d lopez behold him we shall know from him the truth  scene fourth donna leonora don carlos don manrique don lopez  carlos enters with precipitation donna leonora flies to him with open arms carlos retreats d leonora am i so blessed to have a son like thee a mothers happiness  a widows joy hangs on thy answer  carlos art thou my son  speak ere a mothers exstasy of hope oercomes my soul and my arms clasp thy neck if thou be alien to my blood o speak but let my longlost son come to my arms  d carlos o queen i grieve to find this error spread reserve these transports for your happy son i am not he  i sought you to complain and beg release from an offensive honor  the people obstinately bent to take away my name declare i am don sancho and prince of arragon his presence soon will prove how much mistaking they have been in thinking me that prince i am raised up the phantom of an hour such cruel mockery abases you o queen as well as carlos  d leonora often is the peoples voice the voice of heaven impulsively at once it bursts inspired  d lopez my lord we know from wellconfirmd report that in the armies of castile don sancho serves unknown t is true save to himself alone therefore all eyes are fixed on you as one whose dazzling merit speaks exalted rank no longer prince deny what heaven proclaims you have obliged us to transgress against you when you should not have forced our disrespect our high esteem for carlos was well known our pride warred not with him but with his birth though carlos we disdained yet we respect don sancho will accept him for our monarch when to our queen he deigns to own himself quit your disguise my lord and as don sancho and our chosen king receive our loyal homage   they take off their hats and with their right hands upon their hearts they bow d carlos this false respect with which you have surprised me is more injurious counts than your contempt i thought this strange report the work of chance not doubting any bold enough to dare to make a pageant king of me for sport is this the jest of your exuberant spirits then learn gay lords that the brave honor valor and that your equals in the field respect nor make of mine a mockery a may game if this be your intent first vanquish then deride me victorious you may railly me with grace now you anticipate your privilege the queens ring still i guard and this derided carlos his family and race unknown the scepter of castile from you withholds this arm which from captivity redeemed you may still control and humble your ambition  d manrique your speech is that of monarch not of carlos your mien assumes the prince though you deny it we still defend the honor of our rank though prompt to pay what we hoped due to yours madam we leave to you to explain this mystery a secret charm for carlos pleads most strongly but you can best develop natures voice we go lest by his pride carlos should force us to lay aside that high respect we owe you  scene fifth donna leonora carlos d carlos madam you see with what contempt they treat me  d leonora leave this dispute and speak we of don sancho these lords though proud yet generously declare that in this court no stranger but yourself has of a prince disguised the port and virtues that if don sancho live he lives in you say are you well acquainted with your birth  d carlos alas i am  were i some infant winds and waves had spared some little wretch forlorn by parents in a desert left  to milder beasts exposed  through hatred fear or cruel shame by hazard sound and from kind pity nurtured my pride at this report would rise to hope beholding you thus doubtful thus distressed for i am high of heart and most ambitious sceptres and diadems transport my soul and my presumptuous mind impetuous soars beyond all bounds in useless idle flights whilst a few warlike deeds sustain vain thoughts  sudden my eyes cast inward they are dashed from godlike heights to deep humiliation   i know my parents  i am not don sancho  he with your deputies perhaps is come and a few hours will bring him to your arms  d leonora the counts have lighted in my mind a hope i fain would cherish  always i esteemed you a secret movement in despite of me inclined me ever to admire nay love you and something now intuitively strong within my breast disowns your words and says you are deceiving me or else deceived what animates me thus i cannot tell whether the ardour of a mothers love or admiration for transcendent merit whether the sacred voice of nature speaks or my esteem pays tribute to your worth whether my heart drawn by mysterious instinct thus owns its blood or my soul makes a choice  d carlos such thoughts as these deceive their followers as the nightmeteor travelers misleads they are delusions all then queen resist them if the least gleam of dawning hope could rise within my breast that i your son could be think with what towering joy what exultation i at your feet should fall and claim your love the lofty pride of my aspiring mind would glory to be master of a throne but with a dearer triumph would rejoice in such a mother whose exalted rank is less conspicuous than her longtryd virtues again  with solemn truth  i reassure you  i know my parents  i am not don sancho  d leonora with pain my heart relinquishes the thought  o god of heaven had thou for me preserved a son like this how would my widowed heart exult with joy and praise thy wondrous mercy how should i glory if thou were my son  d carlos would that i were but i am not so blessed   d leonora since you deny it you are not my son no longer hide your birth reveal this mystery however high your thoughts may have aspired carlos my condemnation fear not so great is my esteem that in your favor my prosperous fortune and my regal power i will exert to honor and distinguish you even to the height of most ambitious thoughts i think your virtues worthy of a throne if noble blood flow in your veins don carlos a fate awaits you will reward your merits  d carlos the secret of myself  must rest with me never to mortal ear to be revealed  d leonora if with this secret you will not entrust me at least refuse me not another boon which as a mother earnestly i crave  d carlos name it for you elvira and the queen i live and in the cause of each had i ten thousand lives i would expend them all  d leonora the boon i ask is to withdraw your services we now can reign without your succor carlos the death of garcia has repaired his crimes and renders arragon back to its sovereign a child of mine in peace now mounts its throne don sancho if he live or else my daughter no longer then prepare to follow us constrain us not that honor to accept with candor carlos does a mother own that with such dazzling virtues much she fears you to judgment such as yours this may suffice  d carlos why must i thus be treated in extremes loved as a son or hated as a foe in what do i offend whence your disdain why of the only joy i had bereave me  d leonora brave youth i see with grief the pain you feel your birth concealed commands this conduct from me in me t is prudent and to you most friendly i but prevent the wretchedness of all forbidding hopes which never must be answered i am constrained your service to relinquish  d carlos i thought my griefs had reached their worst extreme but this rejection of my humble aid wounds with a pang i never thought to feel the last bright ray that cheered my lonely mind it is your pleasure to obscure for ever  the sun will never rise for me again  d leonora farewell grateful i thank the zeal you showed to serve our cause i hold you generous carlos in high esteem  respect you  beyond words accept a friends best wishes who regrets you may every blessing heaven reserves for virtue your portion be may peace content and honor make your life happy and long flourish round you when next your happy mothers arms shall clasp you tell her she has more joy than thrones can give a joy i would were mine a son like you   speak not  this moment rends my heart  may heaven    the queen retires with precipitation much agitated scene sixth don carlos blanch blanch what can thus agitate the queen my lord  d carlos her just rejection and disdain of me  blanch disdain a hero who is owned for king  d carlos fair lady aid not envy thus to mock me i have no claim to such a glorious title  blanch the queen herself believes you prince of arragon to her your silence has been most ungrateful her generosity to valiant carlos deserved the instant thanks even of don sancho i came to summon your attendance on her and see she comes to give you audience here   exit blanch scene seventh donna isabella don carlos d isabella why has don sancho thus concealed himself i dare not offer gratulations to him those he despises since he would not claim them rejecting his advantages as king  d carlos i have no claim to gratulations madam you are deceived in thinking me don sancho  permit me instantly to quit castile and shun the gathering storm that threats my head  d isabella what can you fear what thus appalls you marquis because a monarch deemed are you offended when your own virtues force us to presume it if not don sancho tell me who you are though you disdained when braved to name your race yet i entreat you now confide in me  d carlos already is my secret half betrayed in vain i hid my country and my race in vain assumed another name disdainful hating the one fate gave me at my birth my name and country are discovered both i am of arragon  there sancho named  thus much this fatal error has unravelled i fear fates malice will disclose the rest and soon reveal with shame and dire disgrace what count what marquis you have deigned to make  d isabella have i nor power nor courage to protect the structure i have reared who shall destroy it then trust me carlos trust me with this secret as to a chosen and most zealous friend and i who wrought your fortune will maintain it  d carlos let me depart ere i a victim fall to the dire fate that menaces me here and screen myself from what its wrath prepares  d isabella count you deceive me this weak idle fear is loves pretense to quit my court and kingdom hence your disdain of the fair bride i offered you go into arragon your princess follow  go openly nor thus descend to counterfeit since your proud heart is by her charms enslaved do not abase yourself to ask my leave depart triumphant in despite of me to go without my knowledge is less insult than to depart against my prohibition  d carlos in mercy madam add not to my woes your cruel scorn and undeserved reproach  d isabella why then delude me with evasive art act from one motive and another own for such deceit is most ungrateful carlos you love elvira  therefore quit my court  d carlos no madam no i love not bright elvira though i would fight her cause and die to serve her death is my only wish t is the sole good heaven has in store for me   d isabella whence this despair art thou not graced by fortunes richest gifts and has not nature with a lavish hand endowed thee amply with her choicest blessings who is more envied carlos than thyself then why repine and whence this strange despondency is it within the compass of my power to cure thy griefs  speak for i wish thee happy  d carlos can thou reverse the stern decrees of heaven and by a miracle change natures course  annul the past from memorys fixed record and change the future destiny of things  d isabella i understand a sorrow in your words but not their purport carlos what afflicts you  d carlos a cureless grief which i must never speak which till it almost bursts my heart has borne for pitys sake o queen no more reproach me but grant me leave to spend in solitude my rest of days  i must not  cannot stay   d isabella though to a friends entreaties you are silent yet surely to a queen some reason s due for quitting thus her service and her court how can you justify this sudden conduct so strange and so unlike the intrepid carlos  d carlos  wildly adoring you i cease to be myself no more i wish for fame nor value life  oh must i see you in anothers arms my mind is fired to phrenzy at the thought love envy and despair uproot my soul  i thought to hide this secret in the grave i sought to die without offending you but love this day dethrones my feeble reason   kneels can you forgive a wretch who on the rack has failed in firmness and breathed forth one sigh which though repented cannot be recalled for you my heart felt the first pulse of love a heaven inspired emotion undebasd by self regard or thought of due return hopeless i sighed nor one fond wish dared form  i go for ever  must i go unpardoned   the queen turns weeping to him madam you weep oh whence proceed those tears  d isabella carlos  stops unable to speak  d carlos o isabella  o my royal mistress what have i done have i fresh cause for anguish those tears  burst they from aught but indignation scorn were less poignant to my tortured mind than to have grieved your heart or caused one tear and can i ask  yes  pity me and frown your anger that will lacerate my heart will glad my soul when reason reigns again  d isabella against one who so unwillingly offends i feel no anger  carlos you are pardoned   signs to him to rise d carlos that pardon is more dear than all your gifts madam receive your ring revoke your trust i must depart and hide my guilty head   d isabella  irresolute after a pause stay till the prince of arragon appears give him my ring a queen for all the favors she has bestowed entreats that one from you  d carlos o madam let me shun impending fate if i obey you i incur its wrath  the haughty counts seek to dishonor me i would preserve my honor to my grave let my heart burst with grief but not with shame  d isabella stay till don sancho comes ere you depart let me in this command  oblige me carlos  d carlos oh fatal mandate but your will is law you doom me queen to what is worse than death to contumelious scorn from those who hate me yet  if you wish it  why should i repine  i will stay and brave the malice of my fate when you command i have no selfregard  d isabella why art thou not don sancho hapless carlos o heaven  believe me not  what have i said   going d carlos what with strange magic tortures and delights consoles me whilst it wounds my aching sense what has charmed all the horrors of my fate what i most joy to hear yet grieve to know   exeunt severally end of

received that your son lives the different couriers who for this month arrive come but with treaties from arragon revolted in your favor its deputies by your appointment come this day to swear allegiance to their queen but of don sanchos life or garcias death why has the information been delayed  d leonora nor my sons life nor garcias death were known till raymond joined last night the deputies when first from saragossa they departed our party were besieging in their last fortress the traitor garcia and his rebel son they being slain the garrison surrendered and raymond who was prisoner there set free he instantly proclaimed that their prince lived and he set out with speed to seek don sancho thinking with him to overtake the deputies who of his life or garcias death were ignorant last night he joined them after their messengers to me had been dispatched and he informed them that their young prince resides here in your court all anxious as i am no more i know i have

marchioness adelinda marchioness why adelinda when i sent last night to entreat you to spend this morning in my dressing room would you not oblige me  you may one day perhaps experience the pang which a mother feels when she begs in vain for a proof of kindness and common civility from her child   adelinda lord madam i thought my father would be there and i was so wearied out last night with hearing of my ungrateful rebellious conduct of my incorrigible vulgarity of my want of taste and judgment and of what a disgrace i am to his name and blood that i was truly glad to escape from his passionate exclamations which gall and irritate me so that i am forced to say things which he does not like    marchioness adelinda you must take care how you provoke your father you made him so very angry last night that i trembled for you   adelinda yes there was reason to tremble i expect that he will give me a good beating in one of his passions for sure never was mortal in such a rage as he was in with me last night it is very unfortunate for me that i have either eyes understanding or the use of speech since i can neither look think nor speak without putting my father into a most horrible pucker   marchioness it was impossible to forbear from being angry with you last night i assure you that i should have joined in resenting your behavior but your fathers severe determination after he had commanded you from his presence terrified me to death and i forgot my own displeasure against you in my sorrow at the punishment which your father swore to inflict upon you and but for my interposition he would this day have sent you back to your convent   adelinda what to make a nun of me   marchioness i fear so    adelinda merciful stars i did not think that he had been in such a wicked passion as that came to neither  and all for my telling him an unwelcome truth i fear and esteem my father but he has never taught me to love him he is justice herself he holds the scales with a steady hand and wields the sword with unrelenting rigor  except when he is himself the culprit but thanks to you madam for interposing so that he has broken the oath t was rashly made and not fit to be kept but in his next passion he will again swear and as easily break the vow   marchioness i hope for your own sake that you will not make the experiment for however willing i may be to sue for your peace i may lose my influence for your mother adelinda could not last night obtain your pardon till she knelt for it at your fathers feet   adelinda o my dear mother what do i not owe to your patience and your goodness  but t is all all in vain for i was born to disgrace and grieve you yet do not hate  do not curse me    marchioness horrid thought  no more of this we will not awaken humiliating sensations  let the future redeem the past  i have promised for you that you will change your conduct that you will behave with more duty and attention to your father and that you will treat your cousin more properly   adelinda oh that cousin of mine is as plagueful as a ghost in a haunted house i am never at quiet for him i am always engaged either in a quarrel with himself or with my father about him i wish that the chaplain would exorcise him for an evil spirit and confine him to the bottom of the red sea for nine hundred and ninetynine years i am sure that i would never light the end of candle that should release him   marchioness i am astonished that neither his birth his rank nor his accomplishments procure him respect or even common civility from you and yet you are much indebted to his generous disinterestedness  your father has offered if you will not change your conduct to settle his whole fortune upon him but he most nobly rejected it declaring that he would never enjoy what he considered as your birthright unless you shared it with him he laments yet always lessens your imperfections  and he avers that notwithstanding your foibles that both in heart and mind you are capable of great things   adelinda he sticks to his text i find for he always begins his sermons by telling me what fine things i could do if i would but give my soul elbow room yet i suspect he treats me with the oil of fool alias flattery only for the ostentation of displaying his own sagacity whilst i question his seeing further into a millstone than other people   marchioness adelinda be serious and give me your attention  if your fathers intentions be not altered by his last nights anger you will you know be very shortly your cousins wife even within a few days therefore my dear child this is the crisis of your fate and i am trembling for your future happiness with all the anxiety of a mother who sees the rock upon which your heedless youth will drive to its assured destruction   adelinda alas madam i cannot new make myself either to show my gratitude to you or my obedience to my lordly father he might as well quarrel with his pack of hounds because they have not flowing manes like his coachhorses as with me for not being a fine lady  and when all is said and done for my share i do not perceive what there is so outrageously amiss in me to make all this constant havoc about   marchioness that you have good qualities every body allows  but your bluntness your rudeness of speech your intractable temper your churlish manners your inflexible obstinate humor disgrace the nobleness of your birth and disgust every one who lives or converses with you and indeed unless you correct your untoward disposition you cannot expect to live on comfortable and pleasant terms with the count when the lover will be lost in the husband and would you not wish to be considered as your husbands first friend and favorite companion could you like to live neglected despised forgotten   adelinda no faith i do not say that neither   marchioness then for your own sake determine to polish your manners and soften the ruggedness of your temper   adelinda there is so much wanting to be done madam to make me what you with that i shall never have the heart even to begin i might toil up a high hill but alas i am quite hopeless of walking up the outside of a church steeple  indeed madam my reformation is a moral impossibility and you always paint me so much of a blackamoor that i am sure t is labor in vain to attempt to wash me white   marchioness no my dear child it is not if you would but once resolve to constrain your temper  make the effort at least  reflect seriously upon the consequence of your first steps in life they will stamp your character with the world and have you no wish to be admired   adelinda oh no there is more cost than worship in it  to gain your sort of admiration i must be constantly in the pillory  and for what  why only the hopes of a mouthful of moonshine   marchioness but surely you would at least wish to be esteemed   adelinda esteemed yes i cannot live in any comfort without that esteem is requisite to be sure t is like the air one breathes a want but not a pleasure   marchioness but adelinda even esteem is very reluctantly paid if not refused to those whose strange humor and rude offensive familiarity disgust and affront every body and if you will persist in retaining your churlishness and inattention how will you appear in polished society   adelinda o lord madam like a carp out of water the society which delights you is not my element and i shall never be any thing in it but a queer fish gaping and floundering about for the fine folks and fine manners of your polished societies are my hatred and utter aversion their maxims would suffocate every natural feeling of my heart and annihilate every useful property of my understanding for i must love and hate by a factitious rule and measure and judge and give my voice by weights which i know to be false the fastidious drams and scruples illegally stamped as standard by the usurped authority of folly falsehood affectation and nonsense   marchioness what a sarcastic ungovernable spirit we have lost our two sons and you the only child whom providence has spared to us are determind to be the constant source of disquiet and affliction to our minds  o adelinda you have blasted all my comfort  long very long have i looked forward to your present age of reason and anticipated the treasure that i hoped to find in your tender affection as a child and your sympathy as a friend but all these flattering dreams vanish you have filled my heart with grief and bitter disappointment for the present and i look forward to the future with that fearful agony which makes even the very thoughts of life painful to me  turns weeping from adelinda   adelinda falling at the marchionesss feet o my mother    marchioness  leaning over her can you then feel for me o rouse all your affection all your reason all your duty can you not resolve my dear child will you not promise   raising her   adelinda  with great agitation i can at this moment resolve if you speak the word  to die  but o my dear mother  i cannot  indeed  i cannot promise what you wish    marchioness alas adelinda can you thus partake the anguish of my soul and have the power yet want the will to give me peace    adelinda i cannot speak the agonizing grief that tears my heart  to think what sorrow i give to yours i disdain a falsehood  i cannot promise  because i know too certainly know the fatal impossibility of keeping my word cease to love me mother i am unworthy your affection alas i know i am    marchioness yonder your father comes the count is with him dear adelinda  takes her hand at least in your fathers presence for my sake constrain your temper do not speak if you cannot speak respectfully i have passed my word that you will alter your conduct else your father will break off this treaty of marriage and send you back to a cloister for life think of what i suffered last night for your sake and let not such deep humiliation have been in vain you are silent my child i will yet hope what you dare not promise   scene fifth the marquis the marchioness the count adelinda marquis did the distance deceive me or did i see adelinda on her knees   adelinda you did my lord   marquis why what thunderbolt was strong enough to bow your stubborn pride   adelinda my lord when gentle angels warn us of impending dangers there needs no thunderbolt to bow the stubborn will their kindness melts the heart trembling we own their mercy and kneel with gratitude and humbleness to thank that goodness which we cannot merit   count my charming cousin  takes her hand which she withdraws   marquis how came you adelinda to say so gracious and so proper a thing why are you not always thus   adelinda because my lord i am not like an italian greyhound fawning without friendship and licking the hand of every stranger as cordially as that of his master i prefer the disposition of the honest english mastiff who is submissive only to the kind master whom he loves and who will fight till he dies for those to whom he is attached   marquis i presume madam that you have told adelinda what you have promised for her  and that it was only at your entreaty that i have forgiven her behavior to me last night   marchioness i have my lord and adelinda will i hope fulfill the promise which i have ventured to make for her and by becoming as amiable and as complacent in her manners as you can wish she will not only rejoice my anxious heart but reward all my care   adelinda  aside impossible   marquis this day then my dear count we will sign the settlements and tomorrow shall be the day of the celebration of your nuptials    adelinda tomorrow my lord no no no not  not tomorrow for heavens sake    count shall it be thursday adelinda   adelinda oh no no   count let it be saturday then   adelinda no i beg not   marquis adelinda there is no obliging you  i will name the day tomorrow you give your hand to the count   aside to adelinda or you return to your convent for life whichsoever you please    marchioness my dear lord    marquis madam i will not recede  therefore do not request what i must have the pain of refusing even to you  taking adelindas and the counts hand

adelinda that your own happiness and the felicity of your parents depend upon your conduct   taking adelindas hand heaven bless you my dear girl and may no child of yours ever make you know the anxious care which at this moment rends my heart   adelinda kisses her hand    exit marchioness scene seventh the count adelinda  who stands looking after the marchioness and drying her eyes count  taking her hand my fair adelinda are my wishes indeed accomplished your heart sympathizes with your mothers feelings is it then subdued are you changed   adelinda  recovering her spirits and withdrawing her hand o lord yes changed yes    count but seriously   adelinda in downright earnest to be sure   smiling count i know that you are sincere  therefore tell me  are you now serious   adelinda oh i am much too sincere at times and so as to displease you most mightily   count t is true for often your sincerity arises from the peculiarly uncouth ruggedness of your temper rather than from a scrupulous love of truth your sincerity is the squib of peevish petulance and and not the conscientious award of just judgment   adelinda what a pointed precise witty waspish wiredrawn distinction you have made and your domineering decision amblingly alliterates as agreeably as the clinking cadence of the church clocks chimes   count it is but too just a decision  however let it pass my fair cousin  at this most awful period of our lives let us rather resolve against all future disputes than now enter upon new ones you are my destined bride   he offers to take her hand she puts it behind her   adelinda yes  so it seems   count seems why are you not what do you think of it   adelinda what do i think of it  nothing at all    count a clear explication truly    adelinda rightly observed cousin t is a most accurate admirable excellent explication indeed  for when despotic authority says daughter you shall marry that man  and that very man says mademoiselle you are destined to make my fortune and therefore i reject you not  the girl has nothing to think about for she is precluded from the privilege of thinking to any purpose  and i assure you that i think nothing about marrying you my lord   count still haughty still intractable   adelinda  laughing hola cousin have a care that your sincerity be not the squib of peevish petulance  it was but this moment that you resolved against all disputes and you begin already so to war we go jangling like hammer and tongs as usual   count  laughing that phrase is superlatively elegant   adelinda pettishly then if you dont like it mend it    count how ill does that rustic speech and manner agree with eyes that seem to sparkle with intelligence as well as beauty your countenance and disposition are by no means assorted they correspond so little together that they would disappoint and disgust good company   adelinda sarcastically good company what is good company   count ridiculous question do you not know what good company is   adelinda no nor you neither cousin by your not answering my question but i suppose that your good company like the monster that i saw the other day is a nondescript and so are your people of fashion and polite circles and the great world with all the immense farrago of fashionable phrases that pretend to class folks into tribes which i hold to be as nondescript as my monster from the moon mountains in africa   count you mistake fair lady good company is as easily defined as wit sense taste or judgment good company adelinda is the select part of people of rank and education of people of great talents and amiable manners who having from superior understandings a stronger claim to distinction and respect than the generality of the world possess seek out each other and being assimilated by the attractive chain of real merit enter into friendship assort together and form that elect part of society which i distinguish by the name of good company   adelinda and do you make one in good company   count i have that flattering distinction   adelinda well if you be good company then is good company the most wearisome thing upon the face of god almightys earth  yawns and rubs her eyes have you any snuff my lord for your good company has vapoured me to death   count  bowing i expected not so very enchanting a compliment   adelinda i have told you a hundred times that it is the way of me to speak what i think if it offend you you can revenge yourself the catalogue of my manifold imperfections is so very extensive that you can find more ample faults of mine to descant upon than i have picked out of yours of your being tiresome teasing and thwarting  i do not beg for quarter    count indeed you do not deserve it but your sacred sex protects you i am bound to respect it even though you set at defiance good breeding politeness and even the common regards of decent civility   adelinda and where is the real merit of your good breeding your politeness and your regards flummery and nonsense you flatter because you want to be flattered in return flattery i suppose is the current coin which buys a place in good company  let people speak as they think and seem only what they are just as god made them and nature formed them as for me i cannot stem the impulse of my disposition it carries me away the current is too strong for my resistance   count but you should endeavor to exterminate so ungracious a disposition   adelinda yes and make myself just as artificial and ridiculous a figure as the yew trees in the kitchen garden tortured into every possible form that can make them appear outlandish and disagreeable    count  to himself what an unbending mind what a stubborn spirit what hope is there of softening it   adelinda he is dreaming with his eyes open and talking gibberish in his sleep  i will escape    going count adelinda stay  i was lost in thought  can i by any entreaty win you to render your humor complacent  beautiful adelinda you might if you pleased inspire me with the most ardent passion for you your heart i am sure is good though so rugged and discourteous to all around you and though i lament its constant misapplication yet i cannot help admiring the strong powers of your understanding why then will you call forth dislike where you might excite love why brave censure when you might create esteem make but a just use of the invaluable gifts with which nature has endowed you and you will enslave my very soul   adelinda softened cousin you plead so well that methinks i am half sorry that t is impossible for you to gain your suit    count say not so adelinda reflect that in a few hours you will be my wife consider that the happiness of my future life is in your hands and if you cannot gain a proper ascendancy over your disposition that i am doomed to be miserable and every moment of my existence i shall have to blush with shame and grief at my wifes misconduct    adelinda  haughtily no my lord i will save you from so sad a fate from this alldreaded shame never i promise you shall my husband have to blush at my misconduct    count how you delight me by this promise then my amiable adelinda you will correct your failings and kindly condescend to be guided by the tender advice of the man who wishes to adore you   adelinda i most devoutly make you a second promise  and i call heaven to witness the sincerity of my intentions  that in no one circumstance of my future life shall the advice of you my cousin the count dolstain  ever govern me    count no  you speak riddles you promise that i shall never have to blush at your misconduct and yet you threateningly promise defiance against me either as your friend or counselor  for heavens sake condescend to explain this mystery   adelinda no i shall give no explanation i intend to surprise every body    count how can you take a pride in torturing me you suffer your strange temper to drown every benevolent feeling of your heart have you no kindness for others no sympathy for their distress why should you rejoice in creating misery when you might    adelinda stop stop for the love of charity do not stun my ears with any more of your tedious preachments  know my lord that such as my manners and disposition are such i would have them to be and such they shall remain if i were to live to the age of methuselah  therefore if you can work no surer miracle than my reformation you will never be canonized for a saint  but to show you that i can occasionally do a civil and polite thing i rid you of my vulgarity and leave you to the full enjoyment of your own good company    exit adelinda scene eighth the count alone count what a strange what a perverse girl if i marry her i sacrifice all my future happiness

no other nobleman in all europe can afford to retain me in his service   marquis how so strasbourg   strasbourg because your lordship is the only one possessed of such princely manners as to afford

at what rent my lord all your other tenants have had their rents raised but dorcas tells me that she hopes as she nursed my young lady that you will favor her    marquis yes on that consideration and as she is a widow i will renew the lease for the term of her life at the same rent  i suppose the report of adelindas marriage brought her hither just at this time that she might be present at the wedding has she brought her pretty daughter with her   strasbourg i do not know my lord  it is not certain  perhaps so  i believe she has  i i rather think she may  but i cannot be positive    marquis i begin to think strasbourg that you are in love with that girl you are always so embarrassed so shy and look so very silly whenever i question you about your visits to that part of the country your confused mysterious answers have made me suspect that some love affair was your business at olstain and not the barnbuilding or seeing after the workmen  i want to see this girl this zella i have heard so much of her beauty  but are you seriously in love with her strasbourg   strasbourg my lord zella to be sure is a sweet pretty creature a sweet pretty creature indeed my lord to be sure so genteel so delicate so blooming one must be a statue not to be struck with her every body is in love with her but she rejects every body and wants her mother to let her be a nun but it is pity that she should as dorcas can give her a good deal of money whenever she marries   marquis are your high notions then so far humbled as to marry a farmers daughter what is become of your taste and your pride but do you really intend to make her your wife   strasbourg ye  ye  ye  yes and please your lo  lordship   marquis ha ha ha you may well hesitate stasbourg  you who used to pique yourself upon

in spite of every the most powerful reasons for overcoming it  i love so fervently that i would rather die than not win the woman whom i adore   with much emotion believe me my honored lord that the idea of offending you afflicts me much though even that fear has not been able to subdue my passion    marquis you speak as one deeply smitten indeed strasbourg but one thing it behooves me to tell you zella being the daughter of my tenant and very young as she has lost her father whom i very much respected i think her entitled to my protection therefore know certainly your own mind about this girl before you lay siege to her heart your pride may step in now but i tell you that it shall not afterward you have had several attachments so i suspect your constancy in this and i will allow of no foolery in this affair you have my consent to court her for your wife but not to dangle after her for your amusement and then leave her to wear the willow   strasbourg no to be sure my lord your lordship is very right very good    marquis i own that i did not suppose that the daughter of dorcas would have been your choice i imagined from your spirit and taste that you would have chosen a fine dashing wife whom all my tenants would have looked upon as fine lady enough to be the wife of a lord   strasbourg you think my heart lowly but alas my lord i fear that it is only too high and too ambitious   scene fourth the marquis strasbourg servant marquis whom do you seek   servant my lord i came to tell monsieur strasbourg that dorcas the widow farmer from olstain asks for him   marquis

that you war so cruel as to sand back to har convent for a whole long yare against har will  she cried and took on sorely at my house  and i was mainly sorry at yar barbarousness in sanding har back   marquis why dorcas i sent her back for improvement  and by what i perceive i sent back an obstinate ungracious awkward unpolite girl the same day that you fetched home an amiable elegant young woman   dorcas o yas zalla is as alagant as any laady thof she is so plane drassed  but a when she camed home she would not go fine  she fade that te did not become har lowly stachion to be so drassed and my

plase you no i could sooner thrash your worships lordship  no no at fair blows he was twice my match t was not so why you must know that we had a great davvil of a rumpus just arter i fached this here cratur home and he was woundily purvoking and contradicted me a little too much for my liking  so i farly swore that if i had not my own way i would drowned myself and have him hanged for muddering me  he was fule enough to dar me to it so egad my lord i was in such a raging passion that i raanned right out of the house and he arter me cross the orchard cross the homestall into the parkpiece and jumps me out of brathe as i was before his face right plump into the pond where the grate carp are  he got me out but i did not spoke for a whole day i was so drownded  and so my lord whanaver i

condescension in marrying the daughter of dorcas    count no but i shall be surprised if she condescend to bestow a thought upon you   strasbourg now your lordship appears if you declare yourself my rival i stand less chance for zellas favor  your rank fortune and accomplishments are to be sure almost irresistible attractions and though perhaps i ought to despair yet my vanity will not suffer me to desist for it would be a glory that would flatter the ambition of an alexanders heart if a poor steward like me should win the affections of a beautiful angel at whose feet the count dolstain had knelt in vain now zella tell us who has the best chance for your favor  my lord here  or poor strasbourg are you not in love with him come tell us the choice of your heart   count strasbourg this liberty    zella  to strasbourg my heart has made no choice and give me leave to tell you that in the present conversation you have treated me with less consideration and respect than even the lowly

contempt   count ah heavens to find again at such a moment this divine assemblage of beauty sense judgment  o too charming zella    strasbourg hold my lord you seem at present to forget that you are in love with my young lady adelinda   count peace sir whether i forget or remember it is not your concern but mine    strasbourg agreed my lord but seeing you so deeply smitten with zellas charms i as

you shant have her   strasbourg we shall see that dorcas my lord here who is so successful a lover with lady adelinda will stand my friend i hope and court zellas favor for me and his rhetoric i dare say will be irresistible especially as zella has declared that her heart has made no choice therefore i hope to gain her favor if my lord the count will intercede for me   count will you be pleased to hold your tongue sir or quit the room had you been my equal your insolent impertinence should have met with its proper chatisement   strasbourg here comes your future wife my lord  and if this

who sent me hither i vented my illnature where i dared without reflecting that it was not deserved  zella i have behaved very unhandsomely to you be friends with me  takes her hand cousin you are a casuist in these matters have i said enough for the offense which i gave this gentlelooking spirit for in good truth i feel sorry and ashamed at my own littleness  zella forgive me but i have offended myself more than i have offended you   zella o mademoiselle   count adelinda a moment of forgetfulness when so gracefully acknowledged is fully atoned and never did you look so charming in my eyes as at this moment  i am going into your fathers study shall i have the honor to conduct you thither   adelinda no not now go without me   count zella the marquis expects you and your mother i am going to his apartment   scene ninth adelinda zella dorcas strasbourg dorcas well i spose i have affronted you but you should not behave so   adelinda oh no dorcas i am as good friends with you as ever i know

crabbed to you and so i have told him but yar sarvant my dear young laady i on it make you mischief i am sure so yar sarvant    scene tenth adelinda strasbourg adelinda strasbourg this zella is very handsome  i am half afraid that you repent   strasbourg repent my charming adelinda had zella the beauty of ten thousand angels though my eyes might see it yet my heart could be inspired with love and adoration only by your charms which are so far surpassing hers   adelinda well i believe you   strasbourg indeed you may  and have you not known from first to last why i let the family suppose that zella had made an impression on my heart i could not otherwise have seen you without suspicion from my absences for though my pilgrims weeds and your great charity cheated my lady abbess so that she suspected nothing good soul yet the barn building was too slight an excuse for your father so i was glad you know to avail myself of his suspicions about zella but by great good luck he has forbidden me to think of her   adelinda indeed   strasbourg yes and from his breaking off the match i have a scheme which i trust will put the house in a confusion for a week to come therefore impute all that you hear of my passion for zella to contrivance and never entertain a thought of my being attached to her but what can my charming adelinda have to fear is she not my wedded wife my this days bride   adelinda peace peace lest we be overheard  we shall need all your schemes and contrivance for we are in more danger than i feared or you either   strasbourg are we suspected   adelinda no no  but my marriage with the count which you know was to be this week  is fixed for tomorrow    strasbourg but you can beg for time   adelinda that i tried for in vain my father was peremptory  he gave me my choice either to marry the count tomorrow or return for life to my convent and an escape from thence you know would be impossible   strasbourg heaven help us what must we do   adelinda fly this very evening   strasbourg that is well said but whither my charmer can we fly so as to avoid pursuit by the latter end of the week all would have been safely ready  my plans were laid my brother is preparing for our flight and to fly with us  but this night  we cannot fly this night  no precautions taken  my brother absent  for as soon as he had joined our hands he sat off for the coast in order to secure a ship   adelinda follow him    strasbourg but whither  for when he left me he had not determined what port he would go to adelinda we can never escape this night if we attempt it we shall be discovered and ruined past redemption   adelinda but i tell you that we must escape and this very night too  for if we stay all must be confessed to morrow  and think of the dreadful consequences   strasbourg distraction  what can we do   adelinda i must i think tell nurse dorcas the secret and persuade her to let us be concealed at her house till we can get clear off   strasbourg if she should betray us   adelinda she loves me too well to do that especially as she knows that your life would be forfeited to the law or fall a sacrifice to my fathers first fury and that i should be a prisoner in some gloomy dungeon of a convent for the rest of my miserable days with her assistance and your contrivance i think that we shall get off undiscovered   strasbourg on what a tottering precipice do we stand   adelinda do not make me begin to think  if we cannot escape horror ensues  if we do alas my gentle mothers heart will break  i am afraid to think  i dare not reflect  ah and does your courage fail you strasbourg   strasbourg adelinda if you saw my heart though it beats with fear yet it is not for myself but for you a moment of distraction in spite of all my duty to my master and all my respect for you made me discover my hopeless passion you pardoned this act of presumption and despair  you like an angel heard and pitied my sufferings  fatally heard and pitied them till you shared them o adelinda do you not hate me do you not despise the selfishness that had not the courage to be wretched by itself i see with deep repentance for your sake the dreadful abyss into which you are going to be plunged into what peril have i betrayed you   adelinda the peril is equal for both  our regard for each other has been highly blameable  but it is too late now for repentance the hazard of our enterprise is not so great as you imagine   strasbourg o adelinda my eternal gratitude and love will make it the study of my future days    adelinda peace peace i believe you for when a man is disinterested enough to resign all hopes of fortune and runs the hazard of his life for marrying his masters daughter  he certainly loves her to desperation we must part now for sear we be surprised meet me in an hour in the alcove when i see which way the land lies i can give you more directions prepare me a disguise and make what arrangements you can for our departure adieu   strasbourg as love conducts may it protect us both    exeunt severally end of the second act act third scene first  a dressing room the marchioness flora marchioness i am astonished that strasbourg who thinks himself so adorable and a match for a princess should condescend to think of the daughter of dorcas for a wife my lords interfering and breaking off the match is to be sure a very extraordinary step yet i cannot think it a sufficient reason for your suspicions   flora my suspicions as you well know madam have been but too often right and my lord marquis has had too many intrigues for me not to suspect him very much of entering into a new one when he prevents a pretty girls marriage and takes away her mothers authority by declaring himself her guardian   marchioness has he done that too as well as prevent the marriage   flora yes madam and strasbourg is quite jealous about it  i heard but little for it was lucy whom he charged with the embassy to you but she begged me to tell it to you i believe that she thinks as i do for she seemed half frighted out of her wits she says that strasbourg has puzzled and confounded her by telling her of his jealousy i questioned her but she said she dared not speak what she thought and ran away from me i knew not what to think of her flutterings perhaps she is in love with him herself   marchioness well do not tell me of such shadows of suspicions i have enough for serious uneasiness without anticipating vexations   flora but madam strasbourg says that he will lay his life that the marquis has designs upon the girl and that he will find her a very easy conquest unless you interpose yet he charged lucy not to tell you that my lord was in love with her for fear of making you uneasy but he is sure that he is and that the girl perceives it and that as she is quite a village coquette an artful little monkey she will know how to secure her conquest   marchioness i hope that my lord is more honorable than to seduce her   flora you may hope it madam but you will be disappointed if i were you i would order the little baggage into my presence box her ears and command her to be turned out of doors she should not stay a minute under my roof   marchioness such conduct would ill become any woman and though my lord appears to be relapsing into his former errors yet who knows but what he may have some praiseworthy motive for his conduct   flora thus you always excuse him madam and i could bite my fingers for madness to see how you appear to study to deceive yourself when i am sure madam that in your heart you must be as unhappy as jealousy that worst of demons can make you if i were you i would make a fine bustle and havoc about it all the world should know how vilely i was treated   marchioness that would be the sure way to make my husband regard me as an enemy and he would soon hate me however unjustly for having the temerity to proclaim his failings   flora o heavens i lose all patience faith i shall swear presently as the men do to vent their rage   marchioness here comes the marquis   flora now for it then now we shall hear what excuse he will make for breaking off the match   scene second the marquis the marchioness flora marquis do you know madam what is going forward   flora  aside oh yes but too well   marquis i am charmed and so will you   marchioness and with what my lord   marquis with a young person who at first sight captivates the heart and on conversing with her astonishes the mind the more you look at her and listen to her the more the strikes you and you are attached to her by an irresistible impulse her gracefulness her understanding her beauty are enchanting and the delicate modesty of her deportment adds a thousand winning graces to the bloom of youth in the most lovely animated countenance that i ever beheld   flora  aside if this be a true likeness the girl is either angel or demon  or a witch at least   marchioness and pray my lord who is this young person   marquis zella the daughter of dorcas and of poor orland   marchioness you describe her to be charming indeed my lord   marquis i describe her as she is with beauty that inspires love and a mind that creates esteem she strikes at once as an accomplished and attracts as an amiable elegant young woman   marchioness truly this girl must be bewitching else you exaggerate her attractions very much   marquis believe me madam i do not exaggerate what i tell you is the simple truth i have been conversing with her this hour in my study dorcas through foolish vanity has given her an excellent education and for her years i am astonished at her knowledge i most sincerely pity the suffering which the elegant mind of this gentle girl must endure in being subjugated to the authority of so rough and turbulent a woman as dorcas is and i feel the tenderest friendship for this poor child   flora  aside to the marchioness a tender friendship what a tender phrase   marchioness  to flora hush   flora  aside making a confident of his own wife well there is something new under the sun witness this confabulation   marquis the poor girl applied to me to set aside her mothers project of marrying her to strasbourg   marchioness it seems to me my lord that strasbourgs proposal does her much honor even with all the beauty which you describe her to have she could scarcely expect so advantageous an offer   marquis but she testified so strong an aversion for him that through pity for her i absolutely forbad the marriage   flora  aside to the marchioness in order to reserve zella for himself keep a sharp look out madam   marchioness strasbourg has sent to me through lucy and flora to beg that i will speak to you in his behalf therefore permit me to become his advocate i shall esteem it as the highest favor done to me if you will put him again upon good terms with dorcas and her daughter and persuade the girl to accept of so good an offer of marriage   marquis that is impossible   marchioness how impossible my lord dorcas it seems had consented very wisely to the marriage and why my lord should you protect a rebellious vain girl in her opposition to her mothers authority and judgment you should rather enforce her obedience than encourage her in her undutiful obstinacy   marquis zella madam did not want to have her obedience to her mother enforced upon her the sweet girl was ready to obey her unfeeling mandate with all the respectful submission of a daughter and all the resignation of a martyr i declare to you madam that but for her tears i should have thought an angel stood before me when after pleading for pity in vain she spoke the strong sense which she had of her duty to her mother and of her resolution to obey her though at the price of all her future happiness then and not till then i interposed my authority in her favor the thoughts of her being devoted to misery pierced my heart with grief whilst the fortitude of her resignation almost awed me i cannot consent that she shall be driven to despair it would be a deep suffering to myself   marchioness i am astonished my lord at the impression which this girl has made upon you   marquis indeed she has charmed my very soul   flora  aside i must go where i may storm and swear at my ease for my very blood boils in my veins   marquis you are silent madam    flora  aside silent why what should she say to this confidence   marquis what does flora say   flora who i my lord i say nothing i only meditate to myself   marquis oh meditate aloud else we cannot profit from your wisdom   flora no my meditations would not please your lordship   marquis  angrily then keep them wholly to yourself i will not suffer muttering meditations   marchioness laugh as i do my lord at her officiousness and let us confine the conversation to your steward what is to be said to him as the result of my intercession to your lordship pronounce his fate my lord   marquis well then i pronounce his fate and though i set going the perpetual motion of floras tongue yet i forbid strasbourg ever to think of zella   marchioness enough my lord i will urge my suit no further   marquis i am come to beg a favor of you madam   marchioness command me my lord what can i do to oblige you   marquis honor zella with your protection and take her into your service as one of your waitingwomen  the marchioness testifies uneasiness and flora surprise i have promised to become her guardian for dorcas is so tyrannical absurd and wrongheaded that i am sure so sensible and so gentle a girl cannot be happy with her and when you see zella you will think of het as i do   marchioness  agitated as i do not know her i may be permitted without offense to doubt whether she will make the same impression upon me as she has done upon your lordship but my lord as you desire it if i approve of her she shall be received amongst the number of my attendants   marquis o madam do not think of refusing this favor to one so every way amiable i will send this charming girl to you but for decencys sake order her to be dressed properly her peasants habit is too ordinary and too particular to be worn here condescend madam to honor her with a gracious reception receive her with that benignant kindness which you have ever uniformly extended to modest merit    exit marquis scene third the marchioness flora flora you see madam what credit is due to my suspicions you are i hope convinced by this time that my lord is in love with this girl but his asking you to take her into your service is beyond all bearing   marchioness heaven grant me patience   flora well when i have done being in a passion i will pray for patience too and i am sure that we shall stand in need of a double dose for you will find that my suspicions are realities and not visions   marchioness alas flora so i begin to fear   flora i am glad that you are convinced of it madam for it is very mortifying to have ones penetration called in question when one is so certain of being in the right   marchioness and yet there is something very extraordinary and very cruel in my lords conduct if he have any bad intentions toward this girl have you seen her is she so very charming   flora no i have not set eyes upon her but lucy and the servants who saw her speak of her as the marquis does and strasbourg said that every body at olstain was in love with her for her pretty face   scene fourth the marchioness flora a servant conducting zella zella is it here   servant yes and that is my lady  exit servant   flora i believe   zella oh how my heart trembles   flora i believe madam that this must be our beauty come to pay her respects   marchioness let her come forward   flora come come in come in sight   zella fear and respect    flora you are bid to come forward  why do you not move   zella you frighten me what have i done amiss that you are so angry with me  my lord sent me hither  i should not have dared to come without being ordered   flora we know it walk toward my lady   marchioness  looking at zella heavens what an amiable countenance    zella i fear that i have unknowingly done wrong in coming i feel that you are displeased madam i am very sorry  yet indeed  i was told by my lord himself to come  pardon me that i did so i most respectfully retire   marchioness no zella stay  so i find that you have insinuated yourself into my lords favor   zella alas madam does the pity which my lord has shown to a poor fatherless girl like me offend you   marchioness zella pity is not always restrained within proper bounds  i am neither unkind nor unjust nor willingly suspicious but strasbourg is jealous and you know very well his reasons for being so   zella no madam i know of no reasons for strasbourgs jealousy i only know that he asserted pretensions to my hand but i cannot love him this in the honest sincerity of my heart i declared before the marquis orphaned as i am he had the goodness to promise that he would supply my fathers place and like an indulgent father he set aside the engagement which my mother had entered into so very contrary to my inclinations indeed madam had i been forced to fulfill it my future life short as i hope it would have been would have run in one continued stream of grief disgust and wretchedness   marchioness zella a girl like you should fear to excite the partiality of a man of high station your beauty might awaken love in a colder heart than that of my lord and i am told that the loves you and that you know that he loves you and therefore you refuse strasbourg    zella o madam  think not thus i beseech you    marchioness what else can i think when you refuse so very advantageous an offer as that which strasbourg makes you your beauty has seduced    zella gracious lady say it not again  trust me and i speak as truly to you as i should were you a messenger from heaven trust me that if the little beauty which i am mistress of had seduced the affections of your lord honor would instantly have made me a voluntary exile from this house nor should i have even dared to come into your presence a thought of such love as you mean never entered into my mind till you yourself cruelly  pardon me the expression  suggested from your own suspicions this detestable idea the very existence of which i had not even feared   flora  aside well if she dont speak truth  i must own that she can tell lies with the most innocent grace i ever saw   zella had you had a son madam who had distinguished me by his pity i should have shrunk back from it fearing to find beneath so specious a garb a licentious lover but in your lord i saw only the father whose protection i wanted and whose goodness emboldened me to forget his rank to fly to him with open arms and hang weeping on his neck   flora  aside has she wings at her back or has she a cloven foot in her shoe is she angel or demon    zella and shall my lords generous compassion for me be interpreted into a crime or my gratitude for his goodness into unhallowed affection can it be  and can you madam thus wrongfully interpret his pity or thus wrest my actions from their true motives  you whom my gracious lord bade me come and see and revere and love as i did the saints in heaven for that you were good and kind like them   marchioness this girl flora melts my heart   flora o the little sorceress she has the art of taking one by surprise   zella alas i know not art perhaps i should be silent wanting the judgment to speak as i ought but i have spoken from my heart and without guile your suspicions madam have wounded my very soul and have so astonished and overwhelmed my mind that what to speak or what to think i am altogether ignorant   marchioness do you wish zella to give me a proof that my suspicions are groundless   zella i have no dearer wish   marchioness marry strasbourg   zella o madam what have you asked    flora  aside if she consent to that i shall think her a jew turk or infidel if she do i give her up directly   zella can you have the cruelty madam to bring me to such a test as that only to eradicate your unjust suspicions can you think that i had so slight a sense of filial duty as to plead against my own mothers authority if i could have made such a sacrifice at any ones request   flora o madam let me plead for her indeed she may be a very good girl without marrying strasbourg   zella madam you hold the power to put an end to all your fears   marchioness how zella tell me but how   zella overcome my mothers objections to my being a nun condescend to be present madam when i take my vows and bid the world everlastingly farewell then judge by the serenity with which i dedicate myself to heaven how free my soul is from guilt or impurity  and dear lady notwithstanding your injustice yet from henceforth will i never offer up a prayer to the throne of mercy for myself without mingling a petition with it for your felicity  may all the saints and angels have you in their charge  going   marchioness yet stay zella  did you wish to remain here did you wish to live with me   zella though my reception freezes nay terrifies me though your suspicions hurt and grieve me yet never before stood i in a presence that inspired my heart with such tender affection with such respectful awe but after what you have said madam i ought not to wish to remain here  yet it would make me happy  but i relinquish even the wish  for i had rather die a thousand deaths than give you even a shadow for the slightest uneasiness   flora dear madam let her stay i will be surety for her    marchioness she is her own security too charming too amiable girl you have in spite of my reason conquered my fears and subdued every objection you shall remain here you shall live with me as it is your own wish as well as my lords particular request   zella and do you indeed consent that i should stay   marchioness with perfect satisfaction and as a pledge of your duty and attachment to me let what has now passed be kept within your own bosom   zella most sacredly gracious lady living in the constant presence of you and of my lord marquis will make me happy beyond what i had ever thought of being in this world   flora let us remember the marquiss orders to have zella properly dressed lady adelindas wardrobe will on her marriage with the count be given away amongst us servants tomorrow and therefore may i not dress zella from it now   marchioness yes and without consulting me   flora then she shall for once be dressed indeed i want to see how this diamond will look when it is richly set then madam i will show zella to my lord and this compliance with his orders will make my peace with him for my saucy meditations   marchioness be it so but leave me now my heart is overpowered and solitude will best relieve it   flora  to zella mind that you continue to hate our fop of a steward when i have dressed you i shall find him out and fight a good battle with him about you for he has finely belied you that i have the honor to tell you    exit with zella end of the third act act fourth scene first strasbourg alone strasbourg well thank heaven if dorcas will be our hostess  i have managed for our escaping this night i might safely have loved her pretty daughter who disdains me but every one to his fate it is mine to run away with my lords daughter and  perhaps to run my neck into a halter  two nooses instead of one i hope that the marchioness is very uneasy and that her jealousy will flame out and then whilst every one is occupied with thoughts of their own in the midst of their troubles we shall be less observed and escape unsuspectedly and tomorrow morning  let them miss us as soon as they please   scene second adelinda strasbourg adelinda  entering with precipitation hist hist a word   strasbourg i did not expect to see you my charmer i am waiting here by appointment to see your

my own business love by my hands presents you with these jewels they never gave me a moments pleasure till now for i detest the fatiguing pomp which obliged me to wear them but at this moment i rejoice in having them to give to you as some compensation for the lucrative post which you quit for my sake   strasbourg my dear adelinda you may rely upon my love and my industry for our support and besides all my own property which in case of accidents is all secured to you here is your own fortune in good bills of exchange shows a pocket book   adelinda i conjure you strasbourg take only what

inheritance through regard for you but whilst my father lives no part of his wealth by any right can be mine unless by his own free gift and of that all hopes must be resigned  for you cannot even think that he will ever be won to forgive me   strasbourg forgive you my sweet adelinda oh no he is too much of a lord for that unless you can support and prop the grandeur of his illustrious house you have no father in my master i promise you therefore i have taken these bills because we shall never have but this only opportunity of helping ourselves this is the ready money which my lord intended for the count your cousin on his marriage with you besides two very fine estates   adelinda for heavens sake strasbourg do not take the bills i have pride and your honor is dear to me let my father have nothing to reproach you with but the temerity of your love in carrying off his daughter  let him have no one thing i beseech you against your honor and integrity as his confidential

are too nice for the courage which you have shown till now   adelinda  with indignant grief and you for whom i have shown it are to become the punisher of my transgression against my parents by

the furious transports of his rage  my dear marquis i have an affair to divulge to you which it imports you to be informed of but before i will consent to speak you must promise  nay take a solemn oath  that you will stifle and triumph over the first impulses of painful feelings which i am unfortunately obliged to excite   marquis why this preamble   count alas it is but too requisite  for i have a most cruel heartwounding affair to break to you   marquis heavens what can have happened that requires such preparation   count what half distracts me  and you have not the least suspicion of

would be a prodigy to hear with temper or even patience what i have to relate therefore my dear marquis on your honor swear that you will not listen to the first violent emotions of your soul indeed my lord you must make a noble effort to conquer yourself in order to assist in searching to the bottom of a mysterious affair the completion of which  if it be not now too late to prevent it  can only be prevented without public dishonor by the calmest prudence  and alas one of the unhappy accomplices demands your tenderest humanity   marquis who who is it  torture me not with suspense   count the

dared not speak her suspicions she determined to watch both my cousin and strasbourg she saw them this day before dinner in deep conference near the alcove they entered it she drew near behind it  she overheard enough of their conversation to find that they intend to escape this night    marquis the villain  you have prevented my taking justice on him myself  but thank heaven the laws of france shall give me ample vengeance a public ignominious death is the awarded punishment for a crime like his ungrateful wretch he whom i trusted as my confidential servant who was in duty bound to guard me from injury yet he whilst i sleep turns robber steals my child and murders the peace and honor of my whole family by this vilely disgraceful seduction   count my lord you must forego even that justice which the laws would give you strasbourg must not be put to death   marquis who shall prevent it  though i have sworn my lord not to be his executioner i have taken no oath to screen him from the laws justice shall take place   count my dear lord think only of what it will be best to do in this dark affair and do not aggravate the disgrace by proclaiming it through the world arm yourself with the requisite patience if they be not yet married  though i fear that they are my cousin may yet be saved   marquis count i feel your friendship and attachment in your conduct at this crisis but for your prudence my rage would even now flame out too impetuously for my judgment and i should at this moment heed only my indignation and my vengeance prescribe my conduct your reason can best guide in this deplorable affair what can you advise what must i do   count see lucy my lord and judge from her account which though certain as to their correspondence and their intended flight is not such as i could make out from  whether they be actually married when you be certified as to that command your anger sufficiently to see strasbourg  insist upon his quitting the kingdom for ever as the sole means of exemption he can hope from forfeiting his life in an ignominious manner to the offended laws of his country conceal this terrible affair from the marchioness till every remedy is applied that can soften it to a mothers too tender heart   marquis i will endeavor to do this and to suppress my rage  the marquis turns away from the count and after a struggle with himself goes to him and takes his hand with much emotion my cousin my friend the son of my choice  i  stops short  i release you fully from every engagement with me upon this unhappy girls account after this degeneracy a marriage with her would dishonor you without removing the stain from our house let your heart select a worthier partner my titles must be yours and you can now no longer object to my settling my whole fortune upon you adelinda shall end her days in a convent  dishonored by herself she is but too justly disinherited by me   count marquis if you have any friendship for me let it be shown by your pity for my unfortunate cousin  mitigate i conjure you her sentence let strasbourgs exile be the sole forfeiture to save his life do not make poor adelinda purchase it by forcing her to take the veil think of her youth do not cancel the strong the sacred bond of parental love  let nature  pity  common humanity plead for her  and do not irrevocably fix her fate in the first effusion of your grief and indignation however wayward adelinda has a high strung mind a noble soul and a good heart let her not be lost drive her not to utter desperation   marquis if i restrain the transports of my rage t is all that i can do  the very name of father i disclaim i am henceforth her judge my soul is so stung by her infamous conduct that if she were now before me i fear it would be impossible for me to refrain from even a roman justice on her guilty head my reason would forsake me and some rash act would be the fatal consequence i leave you count i will strive to compose myself and then i will see this villain   count i feel your distress would i could alleviate it  exit marquis   scene eleventh the count zella just coming in sight count i dread the transports of his rage heaven grant that he

order all ashamed as i am to present myself this figure before him   count  aside oh why is she a cottager cruel custom imperious honor   zella how grieved he seems   count  aside the world will not censure me if i win her heart and then seduce her  but if i marry her the taunting finger of the hand of scorn will be for ever pointed at me as one degraded and dishonored by marrying a peasant   zella perhaps he is angry that i stay   as she is going he turns round   count zella stay    zella my lord i am going to seek for flora whom i expected to find here with the marquis   count then she

your heart   zella my lord this language hurts as much as it astonishes me   count why zella   zella because my lord does not maintain the honor of his own rank thus infringing upon the decorum which my humble fortune has a right to expect even from him  going   count stay zella ah wherefore so much pride why shun me   zella pardon me my lord it is not pride i am only grieved that you have made it requisite for me to leave you now and shun you hereafter   count ah cruel shun me because i love you for i must confess that my heart burns with the most ardent passion for you  zella attempts to go the count taking her hand detains her   zella i beg my lord that you will permit me to go away i can bear no part in such a conversation as this is  i cannot listen to it   count o zella you must hear

purchase or my interest command shall wait upon your will and every wish of your heart shall be indulged my charming girl will you not in pity love me   zella no my lord nor even hear you if i were at liberty to retire assure yourself that i shall never love or even pity you   count cruel girl not pity that misery which you yourself cause ah give me at least a ray of hope that i may win your heart by my faithful attachment my constant adoration look kindly on me save me from despair   zella my dear lord  count you terrify me awake from this dream recover your senses  i would fain esteem you it would give me great pleasure to have reason to respect you but if you speak thus to me it will not be in my power   count zella it is impossible to obey you i have long loved you and to adoration admired your beauty and accomplishments but i fled from your charms i begged of my sister to bring you no more to the grate with her  i hoped that i had overcome my passion for you but it was only stifled not subdued the seeing you thus unexpectedly has thrown my soul into tumults which i can scarcely support but your coldness your cruelty  are you then insensible to love and admiration   zella i have heard too much of both release my hand i beg of you my lord   count zella i dare not if i release your hand you will fly from me what would i not give to subdue your cruelty and to win your heart  ah help me to restore my peace surely my love may hope for your pity if you will not reward it by a richer gift  your heart say then in kind commiseration for my suffering love that you will pity me whence this fullen silence this soulpiercing scorn   zella from the most poignant sensations from grief from shame from indignation from hatred at your selfishness from contempt at your meanness how insidious are you my lord thus pretending to admire my beauty whilst you are seeking to destroy it for by invading the innocent serenity of my bosom you would cover my face with the pale hue of discontent and drown my eyes with tears how selfish and artful it is to plead your passion for me which seeks only my destruction how mean and contemptible to ask my love or implore my pity why should i love you what pity or what tenderness can my mind feel for you you yourself my lord now teach me what regard i ought to have for the repose of your heart when you seek to plant endless torments in mine   count o zella think not thus hardly of me does not my love deserve some regard   zella oh no it makes you an object of detestation not of affection pardon my lord the disrespectful language which you force from me let me beg of you to retain that respect which i wish to pay to you by neither prolonging now nor ever renewing this conversation  permit me to depart  lowly as i am i have a right to be much offended at this insolent detension the count dolstain should be too noble to exert his privileges unjustly against the weak and defenseless unhand me my lord    the count very respectfully releases her hand she instantly goes count zella i beseech you hear me  kneels kneeling i beg it i ask no love hear me i conjure you she returns   zella why will you thus artfully distress me rise my lord if kneeling would have prevented this conversation most willingly would i have knelt to save my mind from the pain which the remembrance of it will for ever give me   count zella i knew not that i should see you here  therefore i could have formed no fixed plan of villainy and when i declared my love i had no settled intentions i doted on you to distraction i would have given the empire of the world to gain your heart and if you would have listened to my love or had you condescended to parley with me i own that i should have hoped to gain your affections and such is the difference of our rank i should have expected to win a mistress where the prejudices of the world did not permit me to choose a wife    zella my lord i feared that i was to understand all this the repetition only wounds me further there needs no explanation i am enough hurt enough distressed   going   count oh stay i will no further distress you i have no libertine hopes these initiatory advances thus properly thus indignantly repulsed i can have none that virtue which will not parley is not to be overcome accept of me charming zella as an honorable lover and if i can make myself an interest in your heart i will take you to my arms raise you to my rank make you my wife   zella my lord  i cannot love you as you wish our hearts are not formed for each other  your own honor forbids

engagements with my cousin   zella  with emotion ah my lord what do you tell me   count some family reasons have put an end to the projected marriage therefore my love as it is pure and honorable cannot offend you now   zella your being at liberty my lord cannot raise the lowliness of my birth the abjectness of my situation   count and if it did could you then love me answer me zella let me flatter myself that you could speak my angel    zella pauses much distressed zella my lord as the thing itself is impossible no answer can be made   count are you then insensible even to a laudable ambition do you not wish to shine in a more elevated rank where a soul like yours would find equal fellowship with cultivated spirits could you not take a generous pleasure in making the man who adores you happy   zella alas i find that birth and fortune would now indeed have charms for me   count i understand you and i am delighted to believe    zella o my lord believe nothing do not deceive yourself my heart must retain its indifference it may be ambitious in its wishes but it is rational in its expectations i must converse with you no more the world calls you the most amiable of men  o my lord respect my peace of mind and do not strive to make me think you so    count yes zella to make you think so shall be the business of my life   zella my lord the prejudices of the world will not permit you to think of me  who am only a peasants daughter  without degradation to yourself    count my love charming zella shall defy the unjust prejudices of the world   zella never for me my lord  for were i even so unhappy as to esteem you as you wish my mind is too high strung to bear the idea of dishonouring your rank and consequence in society by a disgraceful alliance every way unworthy of you  forget me my lord i never will be your wife  i must as bound in honor and duty communicate this conversation to my lord marquis and he will fix my future residence where you the heir of all his titles and the representative of his illustrious house shall never see me more  let your heart make a worthier choice i will consecrate mine to my maker and dedicate my future days to his service i

who so often have been the slave of many a miser dastard fool and knave for once be just  endow one generous mind whod use thy gifts to bless as heaven designed from thy huge wreath one little chaplet twine to grace my sister friend and valentine the monk of la trappe a tale introduction henry de s  baron of d  was betrothed to eulalia de l  e a daughter of the marquis de l  e an offer more suitable to the ambitious views of the marquis being made to him for his daughter he compelled her to write a refusal to her first lover which was accompanied by a peremptory one from himself the young lord unable to bear the thoughts of seeing the amiable woman he doated on given in marriage to another secretly quitted his house leaving a letter behind him written in a style which indicated a mind bordering on despair and madness declaring that all search after him would be in vain desiring in a formal manner that his kinsman might as his heir take possession of his titles and estate giving to eulalia de l  e all the fortune of which he had a right to dispose let her be told adds the unhappy de s  that this must be looked on as a brothers not a lovers gift that duty and virtue forbid the wife of the duke of  to shed one tear of love to the memory of the baron de s  let one wretched victim to affection suffice  let him be forgotten  may heaven bless her  give her great god the happiness which might have fallen to my share  add my date of days to hers   when this young nobleman disappeared it was imagined from the whole tenor of his incoherent letter addressed to several friends in different parts but directed to no one from his taking nothing of value with him and leaving even his purse in his inkstand that he left his house with an intention of putting an end to his life and though after the most careful search his body was not found yet it was still believed that he had completed his shocking purpose  disguised in the habit of a pilgrim henry de s  went to the abbey of la trappe in the province of perch in the diocese of seez he gained admission and the father abbot immediately received him into the fraternity the rules of this order are more austere than those of any other of the romish church perpetual silence is enjoined to the monks they are allowed neither to receive nor write letters none of their friends may see them so that they are totally ignorant of what passes in the world their only food is bread and pulse their drink water meat fish eggs milk butter wine and oil are forbidden to them  they are not allowed to study the bible and a very few books of severe morality and selfdenial compose the whole library of a monk of la trappe they live a very laborious life cultivating the earth or following some manual employment such as they are found most fitted for the father abbot only is allowed to speak when they are in the last agonies of life they are placed on a bier covered with straw and ashes and carried into the church they lie on this bier till they expire and if they retain the power of speech in this last strife of nature their vow of silence is dispensed with in order that they may exhort their brethren this permission has sometimes given rise to very affecting scenes and discoveries  the uncommon severities which the young baron de s  was obliged by the rules to practice in the monastery of la trappe injured his health he had sound retirement but not peace the continual agitations of his mind which converse with the friendly part of the world might have relieved disturbed his reason after he had been in this gloomy solitude two years the monks of la trappe dig a part of their grave at certain stated hours whilst employed in this occupation henrys now weakened mind pictured the form of his onceloved mistress sinking into it this impression once made upon his imagination constantly returned at the same place and time his reason was not enough extinguished to make him suppose eulalia really present but the picture once formed by his disordered imagination was so strong that he thought it a vision impressed from this idea the coinage of his weakened reason he determined difficult and dangerous as the execution of such a design was to escape from la trappe as he thought that eulalias appearance to him indicated a want of some assistance which it might be in his power to give to her forbidden by the rules of his order to speak but in prayer and all the brethren avoiding one another except at church as much as possible the state of henrys mind balancing between reason and madness of which he himself at times was sensible escaped observation he got away amongst a number of pilgrims who came to la trappe to perform some acts of devotion disguised in the very dress which he had on two years before when he entered the monastery  how or where he parted from the other pilgrims is not known  after the second days traveling in the depth of a severe winter he was benighted on a heath he wandered there for some hours till his strength and vital heat spite of the hardships to which he was accustomed were nearly exhausted when his undirected steps brought him to the convent of meudon father hubert found him kneeling in the portico of the church as he came out from celebrating midnight mass the benevolent priest seeing a wayworn pilgrim at that time of the night in such an unprotected situation invited him to his cell after he had been refreshed there confidence in the fameknown character of father hubert despair and the workings of a disordered imagination joined to make him discover his wildly conceived design father hubert attempted to win him from his purpose of pursuing his journey he could not find which way he was bending his course and he feared to ask him too many questions finding common persuafion and what force he could oppose to him ineffectual to deter him from continuing his journey he feigned to suspect the real motive of it but as the test of the purity of his intentions father hubert offered himself to be his conductor if he would stay till the noon of the coming day as in the morning he was obliged by his office being almorer and priest to the convent to attend and officiate in an extraordinary solemnity which was to be performed henry accepted of his offer and somewhat calmed spent the remaining part of the night in prayer  the monk of la trappe a tale how much is man to pride a slave to compass an ambitious end though he have godlike power to bless he acts the persecuting fiend for sounding titles pompous names that never gave one real joy his life is past in constant cares which all his happiness annoy not only to himself severe when fierce ambition cruel reigns he heeds no touch from natures ties nor dovelike pitys melting strains he harms the friend whom he esteems he seeks the wretch his soul disproves he does the deed his heart arraigns even immolates the child he loves and shall no warning voice prevail will man but by experience learn experience dearbought by himself his real interest to discern no  from himself alone he learns  the ills which from ambition flow that all but virtues heavenly charms is folly vanity and woe till he has tried the tortuous path which blindfold he is doomed to tread he thinks unhurt the ordeal to pass and tempts the danger he should dread when passion blows the treacherous gale reason and prudence quit their post the mind obeys the boisterous storm unshippd its helm its compass lost in vain the muse  even heaven in vain  point out the course it ought to steer their warnings are unheeded all till fate allows no time to veer yet once again the muse essays oh may her warning voice prevail to show ambitions fatal ills her moral pointing from a tale the sun appeared to set in blood dark gathering clouds deformed the east over the lone wild a pilgrim roved nor saw nor hoped a place of rest twas bleak decembers dreary night frore snow and

ends divine o heal the soul thy wrath has pierced and be the praise and glory thine  yet awful power thy will be done meek let me bow before thy rod if i must bear this worst of ills nor dare to murmur at my god o if my voice can reach the height where mercys beams surround thy throne another prayer i would prefer for a soul dearer than my own lend still a moment to my mind the strength to guide my voice aright avert the horror of my soul  o take this phantom from my sight but if some secret unknown sin against my soul thy wrath does move still let me suffer in myself and not in her i

be it mine watch over her with a parents care still let thy grace around her shine mild as her virtues be her fate let peace and glory crown her head let grief never find her heart its home and but for me one tear be shed let that be pitys gentle tear which sadlypleasing moves the heart not that which harrowing the foul is seen from passions eye to start refine her mind from earthly love late may she learn my hapless doom let not my purpose teem with woe grant us  vain wish  one common tomb god of my soul dread being hear awful omnipotent yet just bruise not the shaken broken reed nor the worm humbled to the dust if aught that is impious i have asked not to my errors be it joined pardon the wanderings of my heart and the frail weakness of my mind yet save thy first of works below  a virtuous mind in beautys form  keep her dread god from every ill and on my head direct the storm thanks for this gleam of reasons light yet fearful is the scene it shows i view the horrors i have felt o add not madness to my woes avert that tempest from my mind the wreck of mans preeminence chain this wild demon of my soul god show thy blessed omnipotence with frantic and disordered haste the pilgrim said his wonted prayers the midnight office of la trappe with agonizing sighs and tears the pious hubert watched his guest and viewed the workings of his soul wished to relieve his anguishd mind yet feared the storm he would control in meditation and in prayer the young monk spent nights livelong hours his ruffled harrassd mind seemed soothed and showed religions healing powers the morning breaks dark gloomy sad and in the east no sun appears hail rain and snow deform the sky each leafless tree is dropping tears a tolling bell to early mass now called the pious hallowed priest prostrate he kissed the altars base attended by his sorrowing guest each said his mass and then retired fasting to meditate and pray composed the stranger guest appeared yet could not prayer his gloom allay as in the sacristy they kneeled hubert sad anselm in the roman church when either a man or woman enters into a monastic order they are called by the name of some saint not by their christian or family name  thus addressed can thou assist in the next mass or is thy soul too much distressed cuthbertha then those vows will make which naught on earth can ever erase will thou her written vows receive and place them on the altars base whilst i the benediction give and join the sainted virgin choir to celebrate the sacrifice which zeal and piety inspire the stranger willing bowed assent the deeptond bell proclaimed the hour in priestly vestments at the shrine again their orisons they pour the curtain drawn before the grate concealed the sainted vestal band now drawn aside the virgin choir in order round the novice stand covered with cloth of blackest hue an altar in the midst was reared the intended victim kneeling there in sable flowing robes appeared a veil of lawn of purest white which swept with graceful folds the ground around her face and shoulders spread a crown of thorns her temples bound emblem of all that is fair and good shone modesty upon her brow and with a blush her cheek suffusd more deep than beautys transient glow yet hers was beautys choicest form approaching almost to divine that but for some slowfalling tears she seemed an angel at the shrine trembling with tears her soft blue eyes shone like the moon before the storm now bright now darkened by the mist as gathering clouds the sky deform the organs solemn descant flowed with eager gaze she seeks the skies then kissed with pious awe the cross whilst heavenly rapture filled her eyes the expecting crowd gazed on the maid a sigh was heaved from every breast at sight of the sweet victims charms for whom the sacred shrine was dressed for beauty melts the fiercest heart subdues the sternest firmest mind but victim beauty claims the sigh of love and tender sorrow joined she rose her gentle bosom heaved the lilly often usurped her cheek as to the curtaind grate she walked with downcast eyes mild modest meek her folded hands her downcast eyes the sigh by piety repressed spoke resignation to her fate but comfort alien to her breast close to the altars foot she kneeled with tremlous voice her vows she made vows  which engaged to quit the world  for ever for the cloisters shade anselm approached to take the scroll and place it on the altars base  his gloomy groundfixd eye now viewed for the first time cuthberthas face forgetful of the place the time cuthbertha henrys name exclaimed  the parchment escaped his trembling hand  anselm the loved eulalia named o faithful found what joy in grief  lift up again thy dovelike eyes o god of wrath eternal bars against our once guiltless union rise the affrighted hubert seized his arm  o know my son he whispering said thy words are doubly impious here gods on the shrine his vengeance dread go seek my cell and hide thee there   no cried the awestruck wretched youth the winged shaft of death is sped let my last look behold her truth approach and bless the trembling saint thy sacred office now pursue  grant this my last request in life  let my dimmed eyes loves victim view an awful silence now ensued  pale terror in each face appears it reigned a moment  and was chased by one loud burst of groans and tears  grief found a universal voice for woes beyond the reach of cure all pitied loved and mourned the pair called such stern trial to endure hubert drew near the beauteous nun the holy benediction gave her halfclosd eyes to heaven were raised she seemed some earnest wish to crave with trembling haste cuthbertha rose her charming eyes had lost their fire dreadfully calm she gazed around as slow she tottered down the choir there on her knees her requiem sung then prostrate kissed the hallowed ground a pall secluded her from view whilst all the sisters chaunted round thrice round the emblematic pall the abbess shook the holy dew and thrice with graceful welltaught hand the smoking incense circling threw the vestal band the office sung whilst neath the pall cuthbertha lies the ritual done the pall romovd  sester the abbess said  arise cuthbertha heeded not the voice  the trembling nuns around her drew they raise her languid charming form and death in every feature view each art which stackning life recalls with eager wellmeant haste they try she strives for speech but t is in vain her quivering lips their aid deny again she strove and raised her eyes her outstretchd hands together pressed then like a tempestbeaten flower sunk  never to rise  on helens breast despair and horror in his look anselm on his cuthbertha gazed distracted saw that deaths stern hand the beauteous edifice had razed and as they bore her corpse away his fixed eye spoke that poignant woe which words or tears can never express souls pierced like his can only know falling at huberts feet he said  let the grave join  our vows are past   this effort his affection made but it was dying natures last  the boon the hapless henry asked to the sad pair the sisters gave in death they had fulfilled their vows which reached no further than the grave ye fair ye young ye gay ye vain this tale o not unsoftend hear these hapless lovers claim one sigh their woes but not their death a tear one tear of sorrow even from hearts adversity has never taught and softened in her rugged school and bade to taste her wholesome draught  within that heart which views unmoved all other griefs except its own friendship shall never find a place nor virtue ever erect her throne what though no woes assail ye now no anguish no corroding care was not eulalia happy once the fairest too where all were fair till henry was denied her love and secret left his lordly seat she never had tasted sorrows pang but then her misery rose complete her gentle bosom knew no peace naught now could ease its throbbing pain the faithful muchloved henry lost her sire relented now in vain a burning fever fired her blood insatiate death watched for his prey though youth repelled his eager grasp t was only for a short delay the ambitious sire his folly cursed his daughter fading in her bloom the duteous victim to his pride slow sinking to an early tomb  him moping melancholy seized with mind distraught that knows no rest the thought that he had killed his child for ever haunts his cruel breast hopeless a cloistered life she chose far from those scenes which love had known where hours now passed with leaden pace which once with swiftest wing had flown she feared that henrys frantic mind had raised his hand against his life and rashly plunged in endless woe from passions fell conflicting strife to weep and pray for him she loved to god she dedicates her hours her sighs her unseen tears were his and his the orisons she pours the nuns of meudon at her death first learned the reason of her grief  unseen the mourner loved
