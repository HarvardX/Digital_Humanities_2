a vindication of sir isaac newtons principles of fluxions against the objections contained in the analyst  by j walton   si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti si non his utere mecum hor in the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon him job dublin printed by s powell for william smith at the hercules bookseller in damestreet       a vindication etc under pretense of some abuses committed by mathematicians in virtue of the authority they derive from their profession the author of the minute philosopher in a libel called the analyst has declared em infidels makers of infidels and seducers of mankind in matters of the highest concernment this he professes to have done not from any real knowledge of his own but from the credible information of others but he has neither produced his informers nor proved the accusation in any one instance and therefore it is defamatory  but they assume an authority it seems in things foreign to their profession and undertake to decide in matters whereof their knowledge can by no means qualify them to be competent judges and as this practice if not prevented may be of dangerous consequence he has undertaken to enquire into the object principles and method of demonstration admitted by the mathematicians of the present age with the same freedom he says they presume to treat the principles and mysteries of religion to the end that all men may see what right they have to lead or what encouragement others have to follow them  and whereas sir isaac newton has presumed to interpose in prophecies and revelations and to decide in religious affairs it has been thought proper to begin with his method of fluxions and to try what could be done with that method with the inventor himself and with his followers and what has been done with em every intelligent reader is able to judge  if this writer may be credited the objects about which the method of fluxions is conversant are difficult to conceive or imagine distinctly the notions are most abstracted incomprehensible metaphysics not to be admitted for the foundations of clear and accurate science the principles are obscure repugnant precarious the arguments admitted in proofs are fallacious indirect illogical and the inferences and conclusions not more just than the conceptions of the principles are clear  how far the credulous and injudicious may become infected by this uncommon way of treating mathematics and mathematicians is not easy to foresee and therefore it will be necessary to give a short account of the nature of fluxions and of the objects about which the method is conversant and when it shall be made apparent that this author has not understood the metaphysics he would refute it will not be difficult to defend the principles and their demonstrations from any imputations of fallacy or repugnancy which have yet been pointed at by him or any other writer  in the method of fluxions sir isaac newton considers mathematical quantities not as composed of the smallest parts but as described or generated by continual motion lines are described and by being described are generated not by an apposition of parts but by the motion of points surfaces by the motion of lines solids by the motion of surfaces angles by the rotation of their sides times by a continual flux and so of the rest and by considering that quantities increasing in equal times and generated by increasing become greater or less according as the velocity with which they increase and are generated is greater or less he found a method of determining the quantities themselves from the velocities of the motions or of the increments with which they are generated calling the velocities of the motions or of the increments fluxions and the quantities generated fluents  the momentaneous increments or decrements of flowing quantities he elsewhere calls by the name of moments and considers the increments as added or affirmative moments and the decrements as subducted or negative ones by moments we may understand the nascent or evanescent elements or principles of finite magnitudes but not particles of any determinate size or increments actually generated for all such are quantities themselves generated of moments  the magnitudes of the momentaneous increments or decrements of quantities are not regarded in the method of fluxions but their first or last proportions only that is the proportions with which they begin or cease to exist these are not their proportions immediately before or after they begin or cease to exist but the proportions with which they begin to exist or with which they vanish if the lines ac and be are supposed to be generated in the same time by the motions of the points a and b to c and e and if by continuing the motions of those points to d and f they generate dc and of synchronal increments of ac and be it is evident that the points d and f may flow back in the same time to c and e and by flowing back perpetually lessen the magnitudes of those increments till at last they vanish together when the points d and f come to coincide with c and e now the ultimate ratio of those increments is that ratio with which they vanish and become nothing or the ratio with which they cease to be and the first ratio of them is the ratio with which they begin to exist at the very first setting out of the points from c and e toward d and f  hence if the describing points move back to c and e in the same time wherein by moving forward they generated the increments dc and of and in returning have every where the same velocities at certain distances from c and e which they had at those distances in going forward the last and first ratios of the increments will be equal or they will vanish and become nothing with the very same ratio with which they began to exist  hence likewise it appears that to obtain the last ratio of synchronal increments the magnitudes of those increcrements must be infinitely diminished for their last ratio is the ratio with which they vanish or become nothing but they cannot vanish or become nothing by a constant diminution till they are infinitely diminished for without an infinite diminution they must have finite or assignable magnitudes and while they have finite or assignable magnitudes they cannot vanish  the ultimate ratios with which synchronal increments of quantities vanish are not the ratios of finite increments but limits which the ratios of those increments attain by having their magnitudes infinitely diminished the proportions of quantities which grow less and less by motion and at last cease to be will continually change and become different in every successive diminution of the quantities themselves and there are certain determinate limits to which all such proportions perpetually tend and approach nearer than by any assignable difference but never attain before the quantities themselves are infinitely diminished or till the instant they evanesce and become nothing these limits are the last ratios with which such quantities or their increments vanish or cease to exist and they are the first ratios with which quantities or the increments of quantities begin to arise or come into being  quantities and the ratios of quantities which constantly tend to an equality by a diminution of their difference and before the end of some finite time approach nearer to an equality than by any assignable difference at last become equal for they become equal when the difference between them vanishes or becomes nothing and it will vanish or become nothing by being infinitely diminished if the quantities ac and ad perpetually tend to an equality either by the motion of the point d to c or by that of c to d they will become equal and their ratio a ratio of equality when their difference cd by a constant diminution vanishes and becomes nothing which it will do under a coincidence of the two points in c or d and then either ad becomes ac and so ad  ac or ac  ac is a ratio of equality or else ac becomes ad and ad  ac becomes ad  ad which is also a ratio of equality  the fluxions of quantities are very nearly as the increments of their fluents generated in the least equal particles of time if cd and of be increments of the fluents ac and be described in the least equal particles of time the fluxions in the points c and e will be nearly as the increments dc and of for from the exceeding smallness of the times it is evident that the points d and f must be extremely near to c and e and by consequence however the velocities are accelerated or retarded through the spaces cd and of they will be very nearly the same in d and f as they were in c and e but velocities which are very nearly uniform will be very nearly proportional to the spaces described by them in equal times and therefore the velocities in the points c and e which are the fluxions of ac and be in those points will be very nearly as the increments dc and of described in the least equal particles of time  the fluxions of quantities are accurately in the first or last proportions of their nascent or evanescent increments thus the fluxions of ac and be in the points c and e are in the first or last ratio of the increments cd and of for the first or last ratio of the increments cd and of is the ratio with which they begin or cease to exist but the ratio with which they begin or cease to exist is the same with the ratio of the velocities in c and e which are the fluxions in those points and consequently the fluxions in c and e are in the first or last ratio of the increments cd and of  the fluxions of quantities are only the velocities with which those quantities begin to be generated or increased or the velocities with which the generating quantities begin to set out not the velocities they have after moving through spaces of any finite or assignable magnitudes and therefore if two mathematical quantities set out together and begin to move with velocities which are as a and b they must begin to describe spaces in the same proportion with a and b or the proportion with which the spaces begin to exist or to be described must be the same with that which the velocities have at the very beginning of the motion for in the very beginning of the motion there is neither any change of velocity from acceleration or retardation nor difference of time  hence it appears that to obtain the ratios of fluxions the corresponding synchronal or isochronal increments must be lessened in infinitum for the magnitudes of synchronal or isochronal increments must be infinitely diminished and become evanescent in order to obtain their first or last ratios to which ratios the ratios of their corresponding fluxions are equal  hence likewise it appears that the moments of like quantities compared with each other are in ratios compounded of the ratios of the generating quantities taken when first they begin to move and of the velocities with which they set out or in ratios compounded of the ratios of the generating quantities when first they begin to move and of the first ratios of their synchronal nascent increments the moments of lines therefore are as the generating points and as the velocities with which they begin to move taken together the moments of surfaces which become greater or less by carrying of moveable lines along immovable ones are in ratios compounded of the ratios of the moving lines and of their first velocities or first ratios of the increments which begin to rise with those velocities and the whole motion by which squares or rectangles begin to alter either from an augmentation or diminution of their sides is the sum of the nascent motions of those sides or the sum of the nascent increments arising with the first motions of the sides for the proportion of nascent increments is the same with that of the motions with which they begin to be generated  from this short account of the nature of fluxions compared with the analyst it appears that the author of that paper is greatly mistaken in the object of em and he is also mistaken in the principles for he thinks the moment or fluxion of a rectangle contained under two indeterminate quantities a and b from whence are deduced rules for obtaining the moments or fluxions of all other products or powers whatever is no where truly determined by sir isaac newton but he ought to have read sir isaac with more care and attention than he seems to have done before he set up to decide and dictate in matters of this nature and he would do well yet to read him with attention  if any rectangle ck be increased from an augmentation of its sides by motion so as that dk becomes lg in the same time that dc becomes eg the moment of that rectangle is the sum of the rectangles of dk into the moment of dc and of dc into the moment of dk that is putting a and b for the sides dk and dc and a and b for their respective moments the moment of the rectangle ab will be a b  b a  for the gnomon cgk in the instant it begins or ceases to exist is the moment of the rectangle ck but the first or last ratio of that gnomon to the sum of the rectangles ld and fc is a ratio of equality for the difference between the gnomon and the sum of those rectangles perpetually lessens by a constant diminution of the increments fd and dh or by an approach of the points f and h toward d as will be manifest on taking the ratio between the said gnomon and the sum of the rectangles at several distances of the points f and h from d for whatever be the magnitudes of a and b when f and h first begin to move back toward d the gnomon cgk and sum of the rectangles ld and fc will be as a b  b a  ba and a b  b a when those points by moving toward d have lessened the increments of dk and dc to a and b the gnomon and sum of the rectangles will be as a b  b a  ba and a b  b a when they have lessened the increments to a and b the gnomon and sum of the rectangles will be as a b  b a  ab and a b  b a and as a b  b a   ab and a b  b a when they have lessened those increments to  a and  b hence it appears that under a constant diminution of the increments a and b by the motion of the points f and h toward d the gnomon cgk and the sum of the rectangles cf and dl constantly tend to an equality by a continual diminution of their difference fh and that they become equal and their ratio becomes a ratio of equality in the instant that difference vanishes and the points f and h coincide with d or in other words the gnomon and sum of the rectangles ld and fc begin or cease to be under a ratio of equality and therefore the sum of those rectangles or a b  b a is the moment of ab  hence the gnomon cgk or a b  b a  ab found by taking the difference between the rectangles el and ck or by deducting the rectangle ab from a rectangle contained under the sides a and b increased by their whole increments is not the moment or fluxion of the rectangle ab except in the very instant when it begins or ceases to exist and this will also appear by considering it in another light for the moment of the rectangle ck or the motion with which it first begins to alter either by increasing or decreasing is the sum of the nascent motions of its sides and the nascent motions of its sides are measured by their respective magnitudes in the very instant they first begin to change and by the velocities with which they begin to move taken together and the velocities with which the sides begin to move being in the first ratio of the momentaneous spaces which arise with em it follows that the sum of the nascent motions of the sides is the sum of dk multiplied into dh in its nascent state and of cd multiplied into df in its nascent state but dh and df in their nascent states are the moments of dc and dk and therefore the whole moment of the rectangle ab is a b  b a  in determining the moments of quantities sir isaac newton expressly tells us that we are only to consider the ratios with which they begin or cease to exist and to obtain those ratios it is not necessary that the insochronal increments should have finite magnitudes cave tamen intellexeris particulas finitas says he particulae finitae non sunt momenta sed quantitates ipsae ex momentis genitae intelligenda sunt principia jamjam nascentia finitarum magnitudinum neque enim spectatur in hoc lemmate magnitudo momentorum sed prima nascentium proportio and in another place fluxiones sunt quam proxime ut fluentium augmenta aequalibus temporis particulis quam minimis genita et ut accurate loquar sunt in prima ratione augmentorum nascentium exponi autem possunt per lineas quascunque quae sunt ipsis proportionales and again siquando facili rerum conceptui consulens dixero quantitates quam minimas vel evanescentes vel ultimas cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas sed cogita semper diminuendas sine limite  from these passages it appears that the gnomon cgk in its nascent or evanescent state only or in the instant it begins or ceases to exist is the moment or fluxion of the rectangle ck and in a nascent or evanescent state when only the increments of quantities become their moments its ratio to a b  b a which is the sum of the rectangles ld and fc is a ratio of equality by diminishing the magnitudes of a and b which are increments of dk and dc it is obvious that the gnomon cgk diminishes faster in proportion than the sum of the rectangles fc and dl does and by diminishing faster it continually approaches to an equality with that sum and attains the equality only when their difference fh becomes evanescent that is when the points f and h come to coincide with d so that here is no artifice or false reasoning used to get rid of hf or ab that term having no existence at the very beginning of the motion or in the nascent state of the augments  after sir isaac had so expressly told us what he meant by moments and fluxions and by nascent or evanescent quantities one would imagine it impossible to have mistaken and misrepresented him in the manner this author has done he seems indeed to have been lead or rather to have been deceived by an opinion that there can be no first or last ratios of mathematical quantities or of their isochronal increments generated or destroyed by motion imagining that no such quantities by any division or diminution whatever can be exhausted or reduced to nothing but if lines surfaces and solids can be generated or augmented by the motion of points lines and surfaces they may likewise be destroyed or diminished by the motion of the same points lines and surfaces in returning to the places from whence they first set out while a generating quantity moves back through the same space it before described in moving forward the quantity generated or its augment continually lessens and by persevering in a state of decreasing it must in some finite time vanish and become nothing and therefore mathematical quantities by a constant diminution may be reduced to nothing and such as are thus generated or destroyed in equal times by motion or which arise and vanish together will arise or vanish under certain ratios which are their first or last ratios or the ratios with which they begin or cease to be but it may be necessary to pursue this case a little farther and see whether sir isaac newtons demonstration of it cannot be defended and proved to be geometrical  suppose any rectangle ab augmented by continual motion and the momentaneous increments of its sides a and b to be denoted by a and b the moment of the generated rectangle will be measured by a b  b a  for when the sides a and b wanted half of their moments the rectangle was  or ab  a b  b a  ab and as soon as the sides a and b are augmented by the other halves of their moments it becomes  or ab  a b  b a  ab from this rectangle deduct the former and there will remain a b  b a therefore the increment of the rectangle ab generated with a and b the whole increments of the sides is a b  b a  now in determining the moment of a rectangle there is nothing to be considered when it first begins to be augmented by the motions of its sides but the sides themselves and the velocities with which they begin to move or the sides and the first ratio of the spaces described by them and therefore the true moment of the rectangle ab or the law according to which it begins to be augmented on the principles of sir isaac newton will only be the sum of the rectangles a b and b a for the sides a and b begin to move with velocities which are as b and a but this moment a b  b a is manifestly equal to the difference between the rectangles  and  and therefore sir isaacs determination of it is geometrical  from the foregoing principle so demonstrated the general rule for finding the moment or fluxion of any power of a flowing quantity is easily deduced it is easy from hence to infer that the moment or fluxion of a n is as na n  or that the fluxion of xn is as nxn  but because this is also determined in a manner seemingly different by sir isaac in his introduction to the quadrature of curves the author of the analyst observes that there seems to have been some inward scruple or consciousness of defect in the foregoing demonstration and he repeats the same reflection in another place adding withal that sir isaac was not enough pleased with any one notion steadily to adhere to it but reflections of this nature deserve no regard unless it be allowable by way of return to observe that the person who makes em has very often been guilty of like practices himself see his new theory of vision his treatise on the principles of human knowledge and some later undertakings of equal importance   the proof given in the introduction to the quadratures is said to be a most inconsistent way of arguing as proceeding to a certain point of the demonstration upon supposition of an increment and then in a fallacious manner shifting the supposition to that of no increment and to show the inconsisteny with greater force a lemma is premised by way of axiom as if some very obvious and natural application of an apparent truth would at once overturn the whole of sir isaacs demonstration but that lemma however true in it self is no way pertinent to the case for which it was intended and therefore such inferences as are made in virtue of it with relation to the point in dispute are illegitimate and inconsistent with the rules of true reasoning  nothing is more plain and obvious than that quantities which begin to exist together under certain proportions and with certain velocities may become evanescent and cease to exist under the same proportions and with the same velocities and this is all sir isaac supposes in that determination of the fluxion of xn and it is not very obvious that the lemma which this author has hit upon is applicable to cases of such a nature  that the reader may see how strictly sir isaac newton has kept to the same principle in this determination how steadily he adheres to the same method and how ill the author of the analyst has proved his imputations it will be necessary to pursue this point and consider the proof it self  let it be required to find the fluxion of xn supposing x to increase uniformly  suppose x in any finite particle of time to become greater than before by a finite increment whose magnitude is expressed by o then in the same time that x by flowing becomes x  o the n power of x will become xn  noxn    o  xn   etc consequently the magnitudes of the synchronal increments of x and of xn are to each other as   and nxn    oxn   etc now let the increments decrease by flowing back in like manner as they increased before by flowing forward and continually grow less and less till they vanish and their ultimate ratio that is the ratio with which they become evanescent will be expressed by   and nxn  but the fluxions of quantities are in the last ratio of their evanescent arguments and by consequence the fluxion of x is to that of xn as   to nxn   in this computation sir isaac endeavors to collect the proportion with which the isochronal increments of x and of xn begin or cease to exist their proportion obtained on supposition that o is something is allowed to be the same with that of   and nxn    oxn   etc and it must be acknowlegd that this ratio has a limite dependent on the magnitude of o which limite it cannot attain before the increments are infinitely diminished and become evanescent and when by an infinite diminution they become evanescent no other terms of their ratio will be affected so as to vanish with em but such as are governed or regulated by them in the instant therefore that o vanishes  oxn   etc and all ensuing terms of the series absolutely vanish together but the terms   and nxn  remain invariable under all possible changes of the increments from any finite degrees of magnitude whatever even till they become evanescent they therefore express the last ratio under which the isochronal increments of x and xn vanish or the proportion of the velocities with which those increments cease to exist sir isaac newton then rightly retained em for the measures of the ratio of the fluxions of x and xn though got in virtue of his first supposition and the fallacy the inconsistency lies on the side of this author who would have them rejected on the authority of a lemma not to the purpose  to make this point still more plain and obvious i shall propose the reasoning in a stronger light it amounts therefore to this or may in other words be thus expressed if x be supposed to flow uniformly the fluxions of x and xn will be as   and nxn  for in the same time that x by flowing becomes x  o xn will become  which by the method of infinite series is equal to xn  noxn   o  xn   etc consequently the increments of x and xn generated in the same time are o and noxn    o  xn   etc but the nascent or evanescent increment of xn is as its fluxion and in either of these states the ratio of noxn    o  xn   etc to noxn  is a ratio of equality for as the magnitude of o becomes less and less the quantities noxn    o  xn   etc and noxn  constantly tend to an equality by a continual diminution of their difference and they become equal and their ratio becomes a ratio of equality when their difference vanishes that is in the instant o becomes evanescent or in the instant that the increment of xn first begins to exist for as they vanish together under a ratio of equality so they begin to exist together under the same ratio and therefore in the nascent or evanescent state of o the fluxions of x and xn are as o and noxn  which are manifestly to each other as   and nxn   hence it appears that this method of finding the fluxion of xn upon a supposition that x flows uniformly is the very same with that of finding the fluxion of a rectangle as it is described in the second book of the mathematical principles for as ab the difference between a b  b a  ab and a b  b a grows less and less perpetually by diminishing the synchronal increments of the sides of the rectangle and at last evanesces and in the instant of its evanescence the gnomon a b  b a  ab becomes equal to the sum of the rectangles a b and b a so  o  xn   etc the difference between noxn    o  xn   etc and noxn  grows less and less perpetually by diminishing the increment o and at last evanesces and in the instant of its evanescence noxn    o  xn   etc becomes equal to noxn  and as the gnomon a b  b a  ab is not the moment or fluxion of the rectangle ab but in the instant of its becoming equal to a b  b a so noxn    o  xn   etc is not the moment or fluxion of xn but in the instant of its becoming equal to noxn   the author of the analyst therefore is greatly mistaken in thinking sir isaac found the fluxion of xn by a method different from that he used in finding the fluxion of a rectangle contained under two flowing quantities he steadily adheres to one and the same method namely that of taking the first or last ratios of quantities or of their isochronal increments for the measures of the ratios of their fluxions and uses no illegitimate artifice to obtain these first or last ratios unless it be accounted illegitimate to suppose that mathematical quantities can be generated and destroyed by motion  it is pretended that the method for finding the fluxion of a rectangle of two flowing quantities as it is set forth in the treatise of quadratures differs from that found in the second book of the principles and is in effect the same with that used in the calculus differentialis for the supposing a quantity infinitely diminished and therefore rejecting it is in effect the rejecting an infinitesimal but if this author deduces the rule from the first proposition in the treatise of quadratures and considers it ever so little he will find it the very same with that set down in the second book of the principles and it is doubtless in effect too the same with that used in the differential calculus so far as different methods can effect the same thing but no farther for quantities are not rejected in the method of fluxions as in the differential calculus on account of their exceeding smallness  but according to the received principles it is evident says he that no geometrical quantity by being infinitely diminished can ever be exhausted or become nothing now on the received principles of fluxions this is a direct absurdity for these principles suppose that mathematical quantities can be generated by motion which he has not yet thought proper to contradict and consequently they may also by motion be destroyed for quantities and the augments of quantities which in some finite time are produced by motion may perpetually grow less and less by reverting that motion and by constantly growing less and less they may come to be infinitely diminished or to be less than any assignable quantities and from being less than any assignable quantities the motion still persevering they must at last vanish and become nothing otherwise it might be contended that a body setting out from any place and in any finite time describing a certain length could never by moving back and returning in the same line arrive at the place from whence it first set out  upon the whole then it appears that the method of fluxions as described by sir isaac newton in his introduction to the quadrature of curves and in the second book of his mathematical principles is not that wretched unscientifical knack set forth in the analyst but a method founded upon obvious rational accurate and demonstrative principles it likewise appears that the conclusions do not arise from illegitimate tentative ways or inductions but follow from such premises and by such arguments as are most conformable to the rules of logic and right reason all the skill and dexterity therefore by this author shown in the investigation of contrary errors correcting each other are vain and impertinent he has mistaken the doctrine of fluxions and by not rightly distinguishing its principles from those of the differential calculus has imposed a false measure of moments upon his readers and arguing from that false measure has unjustly charged sir isaac with errors arising from it and to mend the matter has instituted computations to show how those errors redress one another and how mathematicians by means of errors bring forth truth and science  the dispute between the followers of sir isaac newton and the author of the analyst is not about the principles of the differential calculus but about those of fluxions and it is whether these principles in themselves are clear or obscure and whether the inferences from them are just or unjust true or falsescientific or otherwise we are not concerned about infinitesimals or minute differences but about the ratios with which mathematical quantities begin or cease to exist by motion and to consider the first or last proportions of quantities does not imply that such quantities have any finite magnitudes they are not the proportions of first or last quantities but limits of ratios which limits the ratios of quantities attain only by an infinite diminution of their magnitudes by which infinite diminution of their magnitudes they become evanescent and cease to exist if therefore quantities may cease to exist by motion and if the ratios with which they become evanescent be truly determined it will follow that there are no errors however small admitted in the principles of fluxions and if no errors be admitted in the principles there can be none in the conclusions nor any to be accounted for in the arguments by which those conclusions are deduced from their premises the hints therefore which this author has condescended to give the mathematicians for ascertaining the truth of their conclusions by means of contrary errors destroying each other will probably be left to be further extended and applied by himself to all the good purposes he pleases to extend and apply them as having more leisure and a science more transcendental a philosophia prima a certain transcendental science superior to and more extensive than mathematics which he says it might behove our modern analysts rather to learn than despise  and perhaps a much greater curiosity for such matters than they have  it has been observed before that fluxions may be expounded by any lines which are proportional to them and so the analysis may be instituted by considering the mutual relations or proportions of finite quantities as the proportions of fluxions themselves to this it is objected that if in order to arrive at these finite lines proportional to fluxions there be certain steps made use of which are obscure and inconceivable it must be acknowleged that the proceeding is not clear nor the method scientific but there may be many steps obscure and inconceivable to persons who are unacquainted with sir isaac newtons method of first and last ratios with his doctrine of fluxions and with his principles of motion and yet those steps may appear very different to others who have duly considered em and therefore till it be made apparent from geometrical principles that the fluxional triangle which evanesces upon the returning of the ordinate of any curve to the place from whence it first set out cannot in its last form that is in the form it has at the instant it becomes evanescent be similar to a triangle contained between the tangent the absciss extended and the ordinate of the same curve or till it be proved that no triangle which is capable of becoming evanescent by a diminution of its sides from motion can be similar in its last form to any plain triangle whatsoever we shall continue to expound fluxions by such right lines as are proportional to them and do assert that the proceeding is clear and the method scientific  finis errata page  0 l   r will in most cases
