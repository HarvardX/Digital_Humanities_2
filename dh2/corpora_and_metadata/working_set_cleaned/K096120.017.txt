universal and independent head of the church and invested with sovereignty over all christian communities and every individual member thereof he can prescribe laws to the whole world what he does is as if god himself had done it he being god upon earth all sovereigns must pay homage to him he may depose both disobedient and illgoverning princes and give their dominions to others  celestin iii on the day after easter in the year    0 then in the   th year of his age had no sooner placed the crown on the head of the emperor henry vi at rome than he kicked it off again as a testimony of the power residing in the sovereign pontiff to make and unmake emperors at his pleasure  he has a right to examine any person promoted to a kingdom and may require an oath of allegiance from him on the vacancy of a throne the government devolves to him he has the right in all the states to use both the temporal and spiritual sword if a prince be remiss in government he may appoint him a colleague or substitute him another in his stead he can legitimate children born out of marriage and thereby make them capable of succeeding to a crown etc such is the political system of the court of rome which notwithstanding its absurdity impiety and danger was no less impudently than ambitiously obtruded upon the world and even for some ages tyrannically put in practice it is chiefly owing to the reformation that these corrupt maxims are at present treated by the rational part of christendom with mockery and contempt and that the pope has lost great part of the formidable power he assumed providence in the sixteenth century was pleased to bring about this reformation in the person of luther a man who attempted and performed more than many emperors and kings could have compassed and indeed neither equalled by any from the apostles time to his own nor since  however with respect to those countries immediately subject to the pope his power is still the most absolute of all others the authority of european monarchs besides being limited by the fundamental laws by the ordinances of their predecessors by their coronation oath is balanced by intermediate powers such as the states general the first bodies of the states etc the grand signior himself depends as much on the janissaries as the roman emperors depended on their army and the mufti though appointed by him and removable at pleasure is so far the more formidable as if he contends with his sovereign being always certain of carrying his point  there is no law made either by themselves or their predecessors from which the popes cannot derogate they have only for forms sake to declare the law which they intend to annul the want even of this form would not prevent the operation of a new law it would serve only to open a future pretext or means of pleading against it  the pope remarks puffendorf does not like other sovereigns bind himself to any terms on his entering upon the government and indeed it would be absurd for him who is said to be guided by the holy ghost to be laid under any restrictions  in most other nations it has been thought necessary to make the crown hereditary but this would not suit the papal government for as it will occasionally happen in all governments it would not have a good appearance to see the supreme vicar of christ riding on a hobbyhorse or to see the supreme spiritual director of christendom himself going to school  in the first class of the spiritual forces belonging to his holiness are the cardinals who are acknowledged princes of the church and pretend to be next in dignity to crowned heads they were originally no more than parish priests of rome whose number was more or less till it was fixed to seventytwo in allusion to the disciples of christ in ancient times this name was common to the presbyters and deacons of great churches in cities but in the eleventh century the presbyters and deacons of the church of rome restrained the appellation to themselves and as the dignity of the pope increased so did theirs the first deacon of this affected grandeur appearing under pope nicholas ii innocent iv gave them the red hat at the council of lions in      boniface viii gave them the scarlet robes from urban viii the title of eminentissimus whereas before they were only styled illustrissimus in common with other bishops and prelates the red hat is an emblem of their readiness to shed their blood for the catholic faith though the cardinals make no great figure in the list of martyrs it is certain that upon the whole the scarlet vestment is very becoming even the dead cardinals are painted with this color in order to set off their cadaverous visages  the pope holds a consistory of cardinals on ecclesiastical affairs but they never intermeddle with his civil government the pope is chosen from among the cardinals formerly the bishop of rome was chosen by the clergy and people and afterward confirmed by the emperor by whom also he was sometimes suspended for turbulent and seditious practices sixtus v at the council of basil says busching fixed their number at seventy which is seldom complete they are divided into three classes six cardinal bishops fifty cardinal priests and fourteen cardinal deacons the deans of these three classes are called their chiefs each of the cardinalpriests and deacons bears the title of a church in the city of rome the cardinals insist on the precedence before the electors of the empire and require to be treated on the same footing as crowned heads the title of cardinal has no revenue annexed to it but embassies protections of roman catholic nations governments archbishoprics bishoprics prelacies and other ecclesiastical benefices enable them to live in state though not suitably to the rank they assume more especially when being of mean extraction they have no fortune of their own these cardinals are from all nations but the majority are always italians that the chair may not be removed from rome as it was once to avignon by clement v  the conclave is the theater on which the cardinals chiefly endeavor to give proofs of their genius and address and many are the transactions there which can hardly be thought to proceed from the inspiration of the holy ghost the decease of the pope is made known to the people of rome by tolling the great bell of the capitol firing the cannon of the castle of st angelo and opening the prisons and to foreign cardinals by circular letters from the cardinal cammerlingo who invites them to the approaching cocnlave till such time as the conclave meet the cammerlingo acts as regent is attended with the popes lifeguard and orders all things necessary for the opening of the conclave which is held in the galleries and some of the antichambers of the vatican and consists of a number of small rooms separated by wooden partitions and distributed by lot both among the cardinals then at rome and those that are absent each usually has two one for himself and one for his conclavists or two attendants on the eleventh day after the popes decease all the cardinals in the city meet in the morning in st peters church where the mass sancti spiritus is celebrated and after a sermon on the duties to be observed in the election of a pope they proceed two by two into the conclave which is then shut up by the governor and marshal none being let out unless in case of illness till a new pope is elected and the person so let out is not allowed to return the governor of the conclave is always previously chosen by the cardinals and together with the marshal resides at the entrance of the vatican without their express license no person is suffered to go in or out whilst the cardinals sit in conclave refreshments are brought to them in baskets or boxes which are searched though not with much strictness every conclave is said to stand the apostolic chamber in two thousand or according to some in three thousand crowns each cardinal orders his conclavist to write down on a slip of paper the name of the person to whom he gives his suffrage for being elected pope this is thrown into a chalice on the altar of the chapel of the conclave so called from sixtus iv two cardinals appointed for that purpose successively read aloud the notes marking the number of votes for every cardinal he who has twothirds is declared pope otherwise the scrutiny is repeated till this number is complete if this manner of election does not take place recourse is had to another called accessus whereby the notes of the ormer scrutiny being set aside every cardinal must give in writing his vote to another and if by this way twothirds do not appear there is still another resource called inspiratio in virtue of which such of the cardinals as are unanimous come out of their cells and call aloud to each other such a one shall be pope such a one shall be pope upon which others to avoid incurring the displeasure of the newelected pope join in the cry and thus the election is carried if this also fails the scrutiny begins anew and a conclave in this manner sometimes proves a very tedious business the emperors france and spain are allowed to exclude a person proposed for the popedom but this protest must be made before the complete declaration of the votes for such a person it is required that the pope be an italian and at least fiftyfive years of age though the age most insisted upon is between sixty and seventy when the election is over and the pope has declared what name he will bear for the future the chief of the cardinaldeacons proclaims him to the people of which on these occasions great multitudes stand expecting in st peters place his coronation with a triple crown is generally performed eight days after  the consistory of cardinals is the popes high council its ordinary meeting is once a week in the papal palace but the extraordinary depends on his holinesss pleasure here are discussed all affairs both spiritual and temporal of the papal see such as filling up vacant archbishoprics bishoprics prelacies abbeys etc every nation of the roman church has a cardinal for its protector the inferior colleges are called congregations as the congregation of the sacred office or inquisition the congregation de propaganda fide and those of religious ceremonies and the examination of candidates for ecclesiastical benefices the cardinals preside in these congregations the rota romano is a kind of supreme court of judicature or appeal in civil causes where every roman catholic nation has one or two assessors collations to ecclesiastical benefices dispensations etc are made out in the datary chancery so called from the usual signature datum romoe apud sanctum petrum etc when the pope is at the vatican but if he is at the quirinal palace apud sanctam mariam majorem  the consulta takes cognizance of the complaints of the people against the governors and of appeals from their sentences all cities those excepted which have legates send their malefactors to rome where they are tried in both criminal and civil processes a rehearing may be obtained and after that recourse had to the pope by this punishment falls only on such forlorn wretches as are destitute of all kind of protection and executions are as rare as crimes are frequent besides the greatest malefactors often escape by means of the asylums whose ancient privileges still subsist the corporal punishments are the strapado galleys gibbet and knocking down the last is inflicted in this manner the executioner strikes the culprit on one of his temples with a club so that he drops down senseless he then cuts his throat and quarters his body which is hung up on gibbets at the place of execution this punishment may be less painful to the criminal than the wheel but it is more shocking to the spectators  it may not be amiss to observe that it is now above a century since any person has been put to death by the inquisition every thing here is transacted in private by spiritual and pecuniary penalties none undergo public punishment but blasphemers and those picked out from among the refuse of the people  when a memorial or petition is delivered to the pope and returned with lectum or read written on it this is anill omen and indicates that it has indeed been read but at least for the present will not be granted the softening a denial in this manner has some affinity with the phrase used by henry iv of france nous verrons well see  for preventing all disorders and tumults there is at rome says keysler a corpse of three hundred sbirri commanded by a captain who is called il barigello he is distinguished from the rest by a chain and medal and when he has a mind to be known he wears the chain about his neck the high police says grosley is in the department of rome who with some assessors judges without appeal the apostolic chamber allows him a thousand sbirri according to this writer five hundred fort watchmen and three hundred spies who daily report to him what is doing in rome by these arrangements the police has long since been on a very good footing at rome it has an eye to every thing without showing itself or being felt the sbirri are not in any great esteem they however keep the populace in awe and that suffices people of credit seldom having any thing to do with the police  there is also a police of health to whom report is made of every creature dying at rome men women and beasts down to the very cats the office in consideration of a settled fee has the bodies removed and takes care that they are put under ground the most fleshy parts of dead horses whose distemper is not contagious are left to fachini or porters who distribute them about as a dinner for cats a creature of which the people of rome are very fond but for whom the frugality of their tables does not provide a subsistence this distribution is really something entertaining the fachino attended by two mastiffs has a large knife in his hand and on one of his shoulders a stick from the two ends of which hang the surloins of horses which he keeps in balance by alternately turning the stick from one shoulder to the other the cats on hearing the distributors instantly show themselves at the windows in the gutters and at the doors according as their dinner is near or at some distance i have seen says grosley five or six very fine sleek cats regularly drawn up at the doors of several houses waiting for and successively receiving their allowance without any quarrel disorder or confusion those of the following houses came out into the streets and the more bold ones came about the purveyors legs and those of his dogs who do not seem displeased with these caresses this distribution is made daily and at a settled rate  the pope at certain times performs mass himself at st peters and in the most solemn manner i happened lately says moore to be at st peters when there was scarcely any body there while i lounged from chapel to chapel looking at the sculpture and paintings the pope entered with a very few attendants when he came to the statue of st peter he was not satisfied with bowing the usual mark of respect shown to that image or with kneeling which is performed by more zealous persons or with kissing the foot which generally concludes the climax of devotion he bowed he knelt he kissed the foot and then he rubbed the forehead and temples with every mark of humility fervor and adoration upon the sacred stump for it is no more one half of the foot having been long since worn away by the lips of the pious and if the example of his holiness is universally imitated nothing but a miracle can prevent the leg thigh and other parts from meeting the same fate  the manner in which the generality of sovereign princes pass their time is far from being amusing or agreeable slaves to the tiresome routine of etiquette and martyrs to the oppressive fatigue of pomp they are constrained to walk every levee day around the same dull circle to gratify the vanity of fifty or a hundred people by whispering a something or a nothing into the ears of each they are obliged to wear a smiling countenance even when their hearts are oppressed with sadness besieged by the craving faces of those who are more displeased at what is withheld than grateful for the favors that have been granted and surrounded by adepts in the art of simulation how can they be free from assumed attachments and what risk do they run of placing their confidence where they ought to have directed their indignation if we add to all these inconveniences that they are precluded from those delightful sensations arising from disinterested friendship sweet equality and the gay careless enjoyments of social life we must acknowledge that all that is brilliant in their exalted stations is not sufficient to compensate for such restraints and such deprivations  so far are we indeed from considering that condition as enviable great part of mankind are more apt to think it insupportable and are surprised to find that those unhappy men whom fate has condemned to suffer the pains of royalty for life are able to wait with patience for the natural period of their days but strange as it may appear history does not furnish us with one instance not even in great britain of a king who hanged or drowned or put himself to death in any violent manner the storms to which people in their exalted situation are exposed occasion such agitations as prevent the stagnating slime of taedium from gathering on their minds that kings do not commit suicide therefore is but a very slender presumption of the happiness of their condition although it is a strong proof that all the hurricanes of life are not so unsupportable to the human mind as that insipid fearless hopeless calm which envelops men who are devoid of mental enjoyments and whose senses are palled with satiety  there are passions whose indulgence is so flattering to the vanity of men that they will gratify them though persuaded that their gratification will be attended with disappointment and misery the love of power and sovereignty is of this class it has been a general belief ever since the kingly office was established among men that cares and anxiety were the constant attendants on royalty yet this general conviction never made a single person decline an opportunity of embarking on this sea of troubles every new adventurer flatters himself that he shall be guided by some happy star undiscovered by former navigators and those who after trial have relinquished the voyage like charles v christina queen of sweden amadoeus and others when they had quitted the helm and were safely arrived in port are said to have languished all the rest of their lives for that situation which their own experience taught them was fraught with misery  but of all the diadems the tiara seems to have the fewest charms and nothing can afford a stronger proof of mans passion for sovereign power than that this ecclesiastical crown is sought after with as much eagerness perhaps with more than any other crown in the world although the candidates are generally in the decline of life and all of a profession which avows the most perfect contempt of all worldly grandeur this appears the more wonderful when we reflect that over and above those sources of weariness and vexation which the pope has in common with other sovereigns he has some which are peculiar to himself such as the tiresome religious functions he must perform the congenial solitude of his meals exclusive of the conversation and company of women restriction from the tenderest and most delightful connexions in life from the endearments of a parent and the open acknwledgment of his own children his mind oppressed with the gloomy reflection that the man for whom he has the least regard perhaps his greatest enemy may be his immediate successor to which is added the pain of seeing his influence both spiritual and temporal declining every day and the mortification of knowing that all his ancient lofty pretensions are laughed at by one half of the roman catholics all the protestants and totally disregarded by the rest of mankind  all popes however remarks grosley have not been slaves to the troublesome ceremonials of their station leo x and sixtus v found means to shake these off innocent xi though ranked by the romans among the saints during the greater part of his pontificate smuggled himself from the ecclesiastical solemnities a cold or a defluxion often stood him in good stead on the most indispensible occasions ever invisible he governed his dominions as god governs the world his melancholy cast and the austerity of his temper infecting all about him spread a gloom in which rome was involved during his pontificate  benedict xiv had excluded the ceremonials of office from a little apartment he erected in the gardens of monte cavallo here he generally retired after dinner to drink his coffee and with his most intimate friends and some select foreigners would sacrito mirth and humor as if he had been only a private individual his excursions into rome were generally on foot with a large cane in his hand and so far from confining himself to those streets where sand is strewed every day through which the pope is supposed to pass he would go into little bye streets where pope was never before seen he has even more than once stopped at the door of a publichouse where people were making merry and would say to his usual attendant i warrant you monsignor there is rare wine here  of all the popes the most liberal in this way of thinking was the famous ganganelli he restrained the malevolence of bigots removed absurd prejudices and promoted sentiments of charity and good will to mankind without excepting even heretics his enemies the jesuits with an intention to render him odious gave him the name of the protestant pope if they supposed this calumny would be credited on account of that conduct of his which they condemned they at once paid the highest compliment to the pope and the protestant religion  among many anecdotes of ganganellis goodness of heart the following is one a scotch presbyterian having heated his brain by reading foxs book of martyrs and the history of the persecutions that were raised against the protestants was seized with a dread that the same horrors were going to be renewed this terrible idea disturbed his imagination day and night he thought of nothing but racks and scaffolds and on one occasion dreamt there was a continued train of bonfires all the way from smithfield to st andrews with a tarbarrel and a protestant in each he communicated his anxiety and distress of mind to a worthy clergyman who lived in the neighborhood this gentleman took great pains to quiet him by proving that there was no danger of such an event as he dreaded these reasonings had a powerful effect for a while but were always effaced by a fresh perusal of the book of martyrs as soon as the clergyman remarked this he advised his relations to remove that and every other book which treated of persecution and martyrdom out of the poor mans reach they did so and books of a less gloomy complexion were substituted in their place but as they all formed a strong contrast to the color of his mind he could not bear the perusal of them but betook himself entirely to the study of the bible which was the only book of his ancient library that had been left him and so strong a hold had his former studies taken of his imagination that he could bear perusing no part of the bible except the revelations of st john a great part of which he thought referred to the pope of rome under the denomination of the whore of babylon this part of the scripture he perused continually with unabated ardour and delight his friend the clergyman observing this took occasion to tell him that every part of the bible was no doubt most sublime and instructive but he wondered to see that he limited his studies entirely to the last book and neglected all the rest to which the other replied that he who was a divine and a man of learning might with propriety read the whole of the bible from beginning to end but that for his part he thought proper to confine himself to those passages he could understand and therefore though he entertained a great veneration for the whole of the sacred scriptures he gave a preference to the revelations this reply satisfied the clergyman he did not think it expedient to question him any farther but took his leave after having recommended his relations to have a watchful eye over him in the mean time this poor mans terrors daily augmented and his shattered frame would in all probability have sunk under the accumulated weight of so much anxiety had not a thought occurred to him which relieved his mind in an instant this was no other than to go immediately to rome and convert the pope the moment he hit on this expedient he felt the strongest impulse to undertake the task and the fullest conviction that his labors would be crowned with success it is no wonder therefore that his countenance threw off its former gloom and his features brightened with the heartfelt thrillings of happiness and selfapplause while his relations were congratulating each other on this agreeable change the exulting visionary without communicating his design to any one set out for london took his passage for leghorn and in a short time after arrived at rome  he directly applied to an ecclesiastic of his own country of whose obliging disposition he had been previously informed he told this gentleman he earnestly wished to have a conference with the pope on a business of importance and which admitted no delay it was not difficult to perceive the state of this poor mans mind and the good natured ecclesiastic endeavored to soothe and amuse him by putting off the conference to a distant day in hopes that means might be fallen upon during the interval to prevail on him to return to his own country a few days after however he happened to go to st peters church at the time his holiness was performing some religious ceremony at this sight our impetuous missionary felt all his passions inflamed with irresistible ardour he could no longer wait the expected conference but bursting out with fiery indignation he exclaimed o thou beast of nature with seven heads and ten horns thou mother of harlots arrayed in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones throw away thy golden cup of abomination and the filth of thy fornication it may easily be imagined the astonishment and hubbub that such an apostrophe from such a pious person must have occasioned he was immediately laid hold of by the swiss halberdiers and conveyed to prison  when it was known he was a british subject some who understood english were ordered to attend his examination the first question asked of him was what had brought him to rome he answered to anoint the eyes of the scarlet whore with eye salve that she might see her wickedness they asked him who he meant by the scarlet whore he answered who else could he mean but her who sits upon seven mountains who has seduced the kings of the earth to commit fornication and who has gotten drunk with the blood of the saints and martyrs many more questions were asked and such provoking answers returned that some thought he affected madness to give vent to his rancour and petulance with impunity and they were for having him condemned to the galleys to be taught more sense and better manners but when they communicated their sentiments to ganganelli he said with great good humor that he had never heard of any person whose understanding or whose morals had been much improved in that school that although the poor mans first address had been a little abrupt and rough yet he could not but consider himself as obliged to him for his good intentions and for undertaking so long a journey with a view of doing good he afterward gave orders that the man should be treated with gentleness while he remained in confinement and to put him on board the first ship bound from civita vecchia to england defraying the expense of his passage  however humane and reasonable this conduct may be thought by many there were people who condemned it as injudicious lenity which might have a tendency to lessen the dignity of the sacred office and expose it to future insults if such behavior as this did not pass without blame it may easily be supposed that few of ganganellis actions escaped uncensured and many who loved the easy amiable disposition of the man were of opinion that the spirit of the times required a different character in the papal throne this idea prevailed among the cardinals at the next election and the conclave is supposed to have fixed on his successor from the same motive that the roman senate sometimes chose a dictator to enforce the ancient discipline  chap xi crimes punishments and executions travelers remarks moore are too apt to form hasty and for the most part unfavourable opinions of national characters finding the customs and sentiments of the inhabitants of foreign countries through which they pass very different from their own they are ready to consider them as erroneous and conclude that those who act and think in a manner so opposite to themselves must be either knaves fools or both in such hasty decisions they are often confirmed by the partial representations of a few of their own countrymen or of other foreigners who are established in some professions in those countries and who have an interest in giving bad impressions of the people among whom they reside  that the italians have a great share of natural sagacity and acuteness is pretty generally allowed but they are accused of being deceitful perfidious and revengeful and the frequent assassinations and murders which happen in the great towns of italy are brought as proofs of this charge i have not says the above writer remained a sufficient length of time in this country supposing i were in all other respects qualified to decide on the character of the inhabitants but from the opportunities i have had my idea of the italians is that they are an ingenious sober people with quick feelings and therefore irritable but when unprovoked of a mild and obliging disposition and less subject to avarice envy or repining at the narrowness of their own circumstances and the comparative wealth of others than most nations the murders which occasionally happen proceed from a deplorable want of police and some very impolitic customs which have from various causes crept among them and would produce more frequent examples of the same kind if they prevailed to the same degree in some other countries but however the assassinations which disgrace italy whatever may have been the case formerly are now entirely confined to the accidental squabbles which occur among the rabble no such thing has been known for many years past among people of condition or the middle rank of citizens and with regard to the stabbings which happen among the vulgar they almost always proceed from an immediate impulse of wrath and are seldom the effect of previous malice or a premeditated plan of revenge whether the stories we have of mercenary bravos men who formerly are supposed to have made it their profession to assassinate and live by the murders they committed be founded in truth is mere conjecture but this is certain that at present there is no such traffic going forward that the horrid practice of drawing the knife and stabbing each other still subsists among the italian vulgar is owing to the scandalous impunity with which it is treated the asylum which churches and convents offer to crimiminals operates against the peace of society and tends to the encouragement of this shocking custom in two different manners first by increasing the criminals hope of escaping and secondly by diminishing in vulgar minds the atrocity of the crime when the populace see a murderer lodged within the sacred walls of a church protected and fed by men who are revered on account of their profession and the supposed sanctity of their lives must not this weaken the horror which mankind naturally have for such a crime and which it ought to be the aim of every government to augment  those who are willing to admit that this last consideration may have the effect ascribed to it on the minds of the vulgar still contend that the hopes of impunity can have little influence in keeping up the practice of stabbing because as has been already observed these stabbings are always in consequence of accidental quarrels and sudden bursts of passion in which men have no consideration about their future safety in answer to this it may be observed there are certain considerations which never entirely leave their influence on the minds of men even when they are in the height of passion we every day see men who have the character of being of the most ungovernable tempers who are apt to fly into violent fits of passion upon the most trivial occasions yet in the midst of all their rage and when they seem to be entirely blinded by fury are still capable of making distinctions which plainly evince they are not so much blindfolded by anger as they would seem to be when people are subject to violent fits of choler and to an unrestrained license of words and actions only in the company of those who from their unfortunate situation in life are obliged to bear such abuse it is a plain proof that considerations which regard their own personal safety have some influence on their minds in the midst of their fury and instruct them to be mad certa ratione modoque this is frequently unknown to those choleric people themselves whilst it is fully evident to every person around them in what violent fits of passion do men indulge themselves against their slaves and servants imputing their rage to the ungovernable nature of their tempers of which however they have the most perfect command on much greater provocations given them by their superiors equals or by any set of people not obliged to bear their illhumours how often do we see men agreeable cheerful polite and good tempered in public yet gloomy peevish and passionate to their wives and children should you happen to be witness to any instance of unprovoked rage they will probably lament their misfortune in having tempers more ungovernable than the rest of mankind but if a man when provoked does not speak and act with the same degree of violence without considering whether it comes from a superior equal or dependent he plainly shows he can govern his temper and that his not doing it on particular occasions proceeds from the basest and most despicable of all motives  i remember says moore when i was on the continent with the english army having seen an officer beat a soldier very unmercifully with his cane i was then standing with some officers all of whom seemed to be filled with indignation at this mean exercise of power when the person who had performed the intrepid exploit came to join the circle he plainly perceived marks of disapprobation in every countenance for which reason he thought it necessary to apologize for what he had done nothing says he provokes me so much as a fellows looking saucily when i speak to him i have told that man so fifty times and yet on my reprimanding him just now for having one of the buttons of his waistcoat broken he looked saucily full in my face which put me in such a passion that i could not help striking him  however i am sorry for it because he has the character of being an honest man and has always done his duty as a soldier very well how much continued he are those people to be envied who have full command of their temper  no man can command it better than yourself said a gentleman who was there in the footguards and has since been made a general officer  i often endeavor to do it replied the choleric man but always find it out of my power i have not philosophy enough to check the violence of my temper when once i am provoked  you certainly do yourself injustice sir said the officer no person seeming to have his passions under better discipline with your brother officers i never saw you in a single instance break through the rules of decorum or allow your anger to overcome your politeness to them  they never provoked me said the passionate man  never provoked you rejoined the other yes sir frequently and in a much greater degree than the poor soldier has done do not i at this moment give you ten thousand times more provocations than he or any of the unfortunate men under your command whom you are so apt to beat and abuse and yet you seem perfectly master of your temper  there was no way left by which the choleric man could prove the contrary except by knocking the other down but this was a method of convincing his antagonist which he did not think proper to use a more intrepid man in the same predicament would very probably have had recourse to that expedient but in general mankind are able even in the violence of passion to estimate in some measure the risk they run and the populace of every country are more readily kindled to that inferior degree of rage which makes them lose their horror for the crime of murder than to that higher pitch which deprives them of all consideration for their personal safety  in england and germany a man knows that if he commits a murder every person around him will from that instant become his enemy and use every means to lay hold of him and bring him to justice he knows he will be immediately carried to prison and put to an ignominious death amidst the execrations of his countrymen impressed with these sentiments the populace of these countries hardly ever have recourse to stabbing in their quarrels however they may be inflamed with anger and rage the lowest blackguard in the streets of london will not draw a knife against an antagonist far superior to to himself in strength he will fight him fairly with his fists as long as he can and bear the severest drubbing rather than use a means of defense held in detestation by his countrymen and which would infallibly bring him to the gallows  the murders committed in germany or england are therefore comparatively few in number and happen generally in consequence of a preconcerted plan in which the murderers have taken measures for their escape or concealment in italy remarks moore the case is different an italian is not under the influence of so strong an impression he is not certain that execution must be the consequence of his committing a murder he is therefore at less pains to restrain the wrath he feels kindling within his breast and if hard pressed by the superior strength of an enemy he does not scruple to extricate himself by the thrust of a knife he knows if some of the sbirri are not present no other person will seize him the murderer therefore is pretty certain of getting to some church or convent where he will be protected till he can compound the matter with the relations of the deceased or escape to some other italian state besides when any of these assassins have not had the good fortune to get within the portico of a church before he is seized by the sbirri and when he is actually carried to prison it is not a very difficult matter for his friends or relations to prevail by their entreaties and tears on some of the cardinals or princes to interfere in his favor and endeavor to obtain his pardon  thefts and crimes which are not capital are punished at rome and some other countries in italy by imprisonment or what is called the cord this last is performed in the street the culprits hands are bound behind by a cord which runs on a pulley he is then drawn up twenty or thirty feet from the ground and if lenity is intended he is let down smoothly in the same manner he was drawn up in this operation the whole weight of the criminals body is sustained by his hands and a strong man can bear the punishment inflicted in this manner without future inconvenience for the strength of the muscles of his arms enables him to keep his hands pressed on the middle of his back and his body hangs in a kind of horizontal position but when they intend to be severe the criminal is allowed to fall from the greatest height to which he had been raised and the fall is abruptly checked in the middle by which means the hands and arms are immediately pulled above the head both shoulders are dislocated and the body swings powerless in a perpendicular line  breaking on the wheel is never used in rome for any crime but they sometimes put in practice another mode of execution which is much more shocking in appearance than cruel in reality and what i have slightly mentioned before the criminal being seated on a scaffold the executioner who stands behind strikes him on the head with a hammer of a particular construction which deprives him at once of all sensation when it is certain that he is completely dead the executioner with a large knife cuts his throat from ear to ear this last part of the ceremony is thought to make a stronger impression on the minds of the spectators than the bloodless blow which deprives the criminal of life  executions are not frequent at rome there has been only one says moore during our residence in this city and those who are of the most forgiving disposition will acknowledge that this criminal was not put to death till the measure of his iniquity was sufficiently full he was condemned to be hanged for his fifth murder an account of his execution and the ceremonies which accompanied it may serve to throw some light on the sentiments and character of the people  first there was a procession of priests one of whom carried a crucifix on a pole hung with black they were followed by a number of people in long gowns which covered them from head to foot with holes immediately before the face through which those in disguise could see every thing perfectly while they could not be recognized by the spectators they are of the company della misericordia which is a society of persons who from motives of piety think it a duty to visit criminals under sentence of death endeavor to bring them to a proper sense of their guilt assist them in making the best use of the short time they have to live and who never forsake them till the moment of their execution people of the first rank are of this society and devoutly perform the most laborious functions of it all of them carried lighted torches and a few shook tin boxes into which the multitude put money to defray the expense of masses for the soul of the criminal this is considered by many as the most meritorious kind of charity and some whose circumstances do not permit them to bestow much confine all the expense they can afford in charity to the single article of purchasing masses to be said in behalf of those who have died without leaving a farthing to save their souls people are reminded of this essential kind of charity not only by the preachers but also by inscriptions upon the walls of particular churches and convents and sometimes the aid of the pencil is called in to awaken the compunction of the unfeeling and hardhearted on the external walls of some convents immediately above the box into which you are directed to put your money views of purgatory are painted in the most flaming colors where people are seen in all the agonies of burning and raising their indignant eyes to those unmindful relations and acquaintances who rather than part with a little money allow them to remain in those abodes of torment as the italians in general seem to have more sensibility than any other people to be met with and as there are some who cannot be supposed totally in want of money pass by those pictures every day without putting a farthing into the box this stinginess must be imputed to a lack of faith rather than sensibility such unmindful passengers are probably of the number of those who begin to suspect that the money of the living can be of little use to the dead being absolutely certain that it gives themselves much pain to part with it in this world and doubtful whether it will have any efficacy in abridging the pains of their friends in the other they hesitate for some time between the two risks that of losing their own money and that of allowing their neighbors soul to continue in torture and it would appear that those skeptics generally decide the dispute in favor of the money  but in such a case as that we have been describing where a poor wretch is going to be thrust by violence out of this world and solicits a little money to procure him a tolerable reception in the other the passions of the spectators are too much agitated for cold reasoning and the most niggardly skeptic throws his mite into the boxes of the compagnia della misericordia immediately after them came the malefactor himself seated in a cart with a capuchin friar on each side of him the hangman with two assistants dressed in scarlet jackets walked by the cart this procession having moved slowly round the gallows which was erected in the piazza del popolo the culprit descended from the cart and was led to a house in the neigbourhood attended by the two capuchins he remained there above half an hour was confessed and received absolution after which he came out exclaiming to the populace to join in prayer for his soul and walked with a hurried pace to the gallows the hangman and his assistants having hold of his arms they supported him up a ladder the unhappy man repeating prayers as fast as he could utter till he was turned off he was not left a moment to himself the executioner stepped from the ladder and stood with a foot on each of his shoulders supporting himself in that situation with his hands on the top of the gallows the assistants at the same time pulling down the malefactors legs so that he must have died in an instant the executioner in a short time slid to the ground along the dead body as a sailor slides down a rope they then removed the cloth which covered his face and twirled the body round with great rapidity as if their intention had been to divert the mob who did not however show any disposition to be amused in that manner during the time appointed by law for the body to hang all the members of the procession with the whole apparatus of torches crucifixes and capuchins went into a neighboring church and remained there till a mass was said for the soul of the deceased and when that was concluded they returned in procession to the gallows with a coffin covered with black cloth on their approach the executioner with his assistants hastily retired among the crowd and were no more allowed to come near the body the condemned person having now paid the forfeit due to his crimes was no longer considered as an object of hatred his dead body was therefore rescued from the contaminating touch of those who are held by the populace in the greatest abhorrence two persons in masks with long black gowns mounted the ladder and cut the rop while others below of the same fraternity received the body and put it carefully into the coffin an old woman with an exalted voice then said in italian now i hope that his soul is in heaven and the multitude around seemed all inclined to hope the same  the serious and compassionate manner in which the roman populace beheld this execution forms a presumption of the gentleness of their dispositions the crimes of which this man had been guilty must naturally have raised their indignation and his profession had a tendency to keep it up for he was one of the sbirri all of whom are held in the most perfect detestation by the common people yet the moment they saw the object of their hatred in the character of a poor condemned man all their animosity ceased no rancour was displayed nor the least insult offered which could disturb him in his last moments they viewed him with the eyes of pity and forgiveness and joined with earnestness in prayers for his future welfare  the day of execution of any criminal at rome many of the nobility in the dress of a friar and masked stand at the corners of the streets singly with with a wooden plate to receive the benevolence of passengers to pay for masses for the soul of the person executed the money so collected will sometimes amount to l 0 this is deposited in the hands of the citytreasurer and is given away by will by the person who next forfeits his life to the state to whom he pleases so that the criminal executed that day has the disposal of the money collected on the day of execution preceding him  chap xii manufactures revenue forces rome has some manufactures of silk but the raw materials are not good and when worked up they neither wear nor look well and yet are as dear as the best silks of foreign manufacture this exorbitant price is chiefly owing to the long credit which the roman tradesmen are obliged to give the buona mancia and the presents required of them by the servants of the families who trade with them  the only articles which rome exports are artificial flowers pomatums gloves etc but these constitute a commerce attended with considerable profit holland ireland and switzerland supply the city with linen and england with linen and cotton goods there is very little cash in rome so that payments are mostly made in paper and here are several considerable banking houses which keep the course of exchange very high  the popes revenue must be deemed very large that even of the countries of which he is sovereign as a temporal prince being very considerable no person in rome says busching is to sell any wine or fruit till the pope and his nephews with their dependents have disposed of what is consigned to them from their demesnes and estates the annual income of the pope is computed at nearly one million sterling this revenue is under the management of the apostolic chamber where the offices are so lucrative that some of the principal are sold for eighty or one hundred thousand dollars  the revenues consist in the produce of the unalienated demesnes of customs duties and taxes on provisions grain is the most considerable article and apparently the most beneficial to the state but in reality the most hurtful formerly rome supplied the city and territories of genoa and some parts of tuscany with grain but since the apostolic chamber by virtue of an exclusive privilege has assumed to itself the purchase and sale of grain the demands of the genoese have ceased and both cultivation and population have been continually decreasing  the datary where all collations for benefices are made out is another great source of wealth and possibly would be the most considerable were not great part of its produce swallowed up under the appellation of drinkmoney by a multitude of posts and employments belonging to it  to the revenues of the pope must likewise be added the produce of the salt pits at cervia which are very considerable and that of the lottery which is drawn eight times a year this lottery is on the same plan as those of genoa and the military school in france and the people of rome give into it with all the precipitation of hope incited by present necessities and the spirit of calculation in short the lottery is to this people the locust which consumes what the catterpillar has left  by these revenues it was that sixtus v besides the ordinary expense of court and government and even doubling those expenses by undertakings worthy of ancient rome found means to accumulate during the three first years only of his pontificate the three millions of gold which he laid up in the castle of st angelo which deposit is said to have remained hitherto untouched  the military forces of the pope make no great figure either by land or sea the places where any of the soldiers are to be seen are the castle of st angelo civita vecchia urbino ferrara and some small forts on the frontiers his swiss guards are well clothed and paid yet their chief employment is to keep off the crowd at public solemnities foreigners on all occasions find them very civil especially if addressed in german by the title of landsman but i remember says keysler an austrian nobleman of great rank being pressed by the crowd in return for his condescending compliment of landsman received this answer aye to day every bearleader calls us countryman  the popes galleys which lie at civita vecchia are of little consequence  chap i loretto is a small town containing about six thousand inhabitants very pleasantly situated on a hill three miles from the sea on the adriatic gulf and one hundred and fortyfive east of rome the walls of loretto are about half an italian mile in circumference and yield a delightful prospect on one side of the sea and a beautiful vale highly cultivated and on the other side of it elegant suburbs which extend to monte real along a strait broad road about sunset in clear weather the mountains of croatia may be discerned though they are a hundred and fifty miles distant from loretto  the town is but indifferently built the principal street consists chiefly of small shops in which are sold little else than beads for rosaries gold and silver ornaments for the same worked in fillagree small brass bells much bought by the country people as preservatives against thunder and lightening brownpaper caps to cure the headache and broad ribbons with the effigies of nostra dama di loretto painted on them to be worn by women in childbirth  the holy chapel of loretto which has rendered this town so famous through all the catholic part of chistendom was originally a small house in nazareth inhabited by the virgin mary in which she was saluted by the angel and where she bred our savior according to the history of its adventures it was in the month of may      transported by angels through the air from gallilee to torsato in dalmatia and three years and a half after into italy and on the  0th of december in      about midnight it was set down in a wood in the district of recanati about a thousand paces from the sea if turselini may be credited on the alighting of this sacred house from its aerial journey all the trees and shrubs in the wood bowed with the greatest reverence and continued in that respectful posture as long as the sacred chapel remained among them eight months after it was again removed one thousand paces nearer to recanati and at last as it were with more mature deliberation deposited in its present place one cannot but be amazed at the credit given to so absurd and ridiculous a fable and the more so as all catholic countries have been thereby voluntarily drawn into such onerose contributions it being notorious that owing to the received chronology of this miraculous transmigration the sacred house had been placed in italy and its fame much celebrated even long before some papistical writers gave out they had sought for it and found it at nazareth  the sacred chapel stands due east and west at the farther end of a large church of the most durable stone of istria which has been built round it this may be considered as the external covering or a kind of great coat to the casa sancta which has a smaller coat of more precious materials and workmanship nearer its body this internal covering or case is of of the choicest marble and ornamented with bas reliefs the subjects of which are the history of the blessed virgin and other parts of the bible the whole case is about fifty feet long thirty in breadth and the same in height but the real house itself is no more than thirtytwo feet in length fourteen in breadth and at the sides about eighteen feet in height the center of the roof is four or five feet higher the walls of this little holy chapel are composed of pieces of a reddish substance of an oblong square shape laid one upon another in the manner of brick at first sight on a superficial view these redcoloured oblong substances appear to be nothing more than common italian bricks and which is still more extraordinary on a second and third view with all possible attention they still have the same appearance there is not however it is assured a single particle of brick in their whole composition being entirely of a stone which though it cannot now be found in palestine was formerly very common particularly in the neighborhood of nazareth there is a small interval between the walls of the ancient house and the marble case the workmen at first intended them to be in contact from an opinion founded either upon gross ignorance or infidelity that the former stood in need of support from the latter the marble say they started back of itself from such impious familiarity or else was thrust back by the coyness of the virgin brick  above the door there is an inscription by which it appears that any person who enters with arms is ipso facto excommunicated there are also the severest denunciations against those who carry away the smallest particle of the stone and mortar belonging to this chapel the person who attended us says moore took us aside and told us in a very serious manner that strangers were apt secretly to break little pieces of stone belonging to the sancta casa in hopes that such precious relics might bring them good fortune but he earnestly entreated us not to do any such thing for he knew a person at venice who had broken off a small corner of one of the stones and slipped it into his breeches pocket unobserved but so far from bringing him good fortune it had burnt its way like aquafortis before he left the chapel and scorched his thighs in such a terrible manner that he was not able to sit on horseback for a month had it not been for the impressions such stories as these make so great was the eagerness of the multitude to be possessed of any portion of this little edifice that the whole was in danger of being carried away not by angels but by piecemeal in the pockets of the pilgrims  the holy house is divided within into two equal portions by a kind of gratework of silver in the larger division which may be considered as the main body of the house the walls are left bare to show the true original fabric of nazareth stone these stones which bear such a strong resemblance to bricks are loose in many places i took notice of this says moore to a pilgrim he smiled saying be not afraid my good sir these walls are more firm than the apennines at the lower or entrance wall there is a window the same they say through which the angel gabriel entered at the annunciation the architraves of this window are covered with silver there are a great number of gold and silver lamps in this chapel one of them is a present from the republic of venice it is of gold and weighs thirtyseven pounds some of the silver lamps weigh from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty pounds at the upper end of the largest room is an altar but so low that from it may be seen the famous image which stands over the chimney in the smaller of the two divisions which is called the sanctuary gold and silver angels of considerable size kneel around her some offering hearts of gold enriched with diamonds and one an infant of pure gold the figure of the virgin herself by no means corresponds with the fine furniture of her house she is a little woman about four feet in height with the features and complexion of a negro of all the sculptors that ever exhibited assuredly st luke by whom the friar is said to have been made is the least of a flatterer and nothing can be a stronger proof of the blessed virgins contempt for external beauty than her being satisfied with this representation of her especially if her face and person really resembled those beautiful ideas of her conveyed by the pencils of raphael corregio and guido the figure of the infant jesus by st luke is of a piece with that of the virgin he holds a large globe in one hand and the other is extended in the act of blessing both figures have crowns on their heads enriched with diamonds these were presents from anne of austria queen of france both arms of the virgin are enclosed within her robes and no part but her face is to be seen her dress is most magnificent but in a wretched bad taste she has particular clothes for the different festivals held in honor of her and what does not appear so very decent is dressed and undressed by the priests  there is a small place behind the sanctuary into which strangers of decent appearance are seldom refused admittance in this they show the chimney and some other furniture which they pretend belonged to the virgin when she lived at nazareth particularly a little earthen porringer out of which the infant used to eat the pilgrims bring rosaries little crucifixes and agnus deis which the obliging priest shakes for half a minute in this dish after which it is believed they acquire the virtue of curing various diseases and prove an excellent preventative against all the temptations of satan the gown which the image had on when the chapel arrived from nazareth is of red camblet and carefully kept in a glass shrine  above a hundred masses are daily said in this chapel and in the church in which it stands the music is remarkably fine a certain number of the chaplains are eunuchs  the jewels and riches to be seen at any one time in the holy chapel are of small value in comparison of those in the treasury which is a large room adjoining the vestry of the great church in the presses of this room are kept those presents which royal noble and rich bigots of all ranks have by oppressing their subjects and injuring their families sent to this place to enumerate every particular would fill volumes they consist of various utensils and other things in silver and gold as lamps candlesticks goblets crowns and crucifixes lambs eagles saints apostles angels virgins and infants then there are cameos pearls gems and precious stones of all kinds and in great numbers what is valued above all the other jewels is the miraculous pearl wherein they assert that nature has given a faithful delineation of the virgin sitting on a cloud with the infant jesus in her arms  it is said that these pieces are occasionally melted down by his holiness for the use of the state and also that the most precious of the jewels are picked out and sold for the same purpose false stones being substituted in their room this is an affair however entirely between the virgin and the pope if she does not complain there is no other person who has a right to do it  pilgrimages to loretto are not so frequent with foreigners or with persons of fortune and distinction as formerly nineteen out of twenty of those who make this journey now are poor people who depend for their maintenance on the charity they receive on the road to those who are of such a rank in life as precludes them from availing themselves of the charitable institutions for the maintenance of pilgrims such journies are attended with expense and inconvenience and fathers and husbands in moderate circumstances are frequently brought into disagreeable dilemmas by the rash vow of going to loretto which their wives and daughters are apt to make on any supposed deliverance from danger to refuse is considered by the whole neighborhood as cruel and even impious and to grant is often highly distressing and particularly to such husbands as from affection or any other motive do not choose that their wives should be long out of their fight but to the poor who are maintained during their whole journey and have nothing more than a scanty subsistence to expect from their labor at home loretto is a party of pleasure as well as devotion and by much the most agreeable road they can take to heaven it being a year of jubilee says moore when we visited this place there was a far greater concourse of pilgrims of all ranks than is usual we saw a few in their carriages a greater number on horseback or on mules or what is still more common on asses great numbers of females come in this manner with a male friend walking by them as their guide and protector but the greatest number of both sexes are on foot as we approached near loretto the road was crowded with them they generally set out before sun rise and having reposed themselves during the heat of the day continue their journey again in the evening they sing their matins and their evening hymns aloud as many have fine voices and delicate ears their vocal concerts have a charming effect at a little distance during the stillness of the morning and the evening we were serenaded with this solemn religious music for a considerable part of the road the pilgrims on foot as soon as they enter the suburbs begin a hymn in honor of the virgin which they continue till they reach the church the poorer sort are received into an hospital where they have bed and board for three days  in the great church which contains the holy chapel are confessionals where the penitents from every country of europe may be confessed in their own language priests being always in waiting for that purpose each of them has a long white rod in his hand with which he touches those to whom he thinks proper to give absolution they place themselves on their knees in groupes around the confessional chair and when the holy father has touched their heads with the expiatory rod they retire freed from the burden of their sins and with renewed courage to begin a fresh account  in the spacious area before the church there is an elegant marble fountain supplied with water from an adjoining hill by an aqueduct few even of the most inconsiderable towns of italy are without the useful ornament of a public fountain the embellishments of architecture and sculpture are employed with great propriety on such works as are continually in the peoples view the air is refreshed and the eye delighted by the streams of water they pour forth a fight peculiarly agreeable in a warm climate in this area there is also a statue of sixtus v in bronze over the portal of the church is a statue of the virgin and above the middle gate is a latin inscription importing that within is the house of the mother of god in which the word was made flesh the gates of the church are likewise of bronze embellished with bas reliefs of admirable workmanship the subjects taken partly from the old and partly from the new testament and divided into different compartments  as the gates of this church are shut at noon the pilgrims who arrive after that hour can get no nearer to the sancta casa than these gates which are by this means exposed to the first violence of the holy ardour which was designed for the chapel itself and all the sculpture on the gates within reach of the mouths of these holy zealots is in some degree effaced by their kisses the murder of abel happens to be in that part of the sculpture which is on a level with the lips of a person of ordinary size when kneeling poor abel had he been placed a foot higher or a foot lower he might have remained in security for ages but in the unlucky part that the sculptor has put him his whole body has been almost entirely kissed away by the pilgrims whilst his brother cain stands untouched in his original attitude frowning and as fierce as ever  of the paintings to be seen here there are two in the treasury very highly esteemed the subject of one of these is the virgins nativity by annibal caracci and of the other the holy family by raphael there are likewise some others which ornament the altars of the great church these altars or little chapels of which this fabric contains a great number are lined with marble and embellished by sculpture but nothing within this church is so interesting as the iron grates before the chapels which are made of the fetters and chains of the christian slaves freed from bondage by the glorious victory of lepanto  the ideas that rush into ones mind on hearing a a circumstance of this kind are affecting beyond expression to think of four thousand of our fellow creatures torn from the service of their country and the arms of friendship chained to oars subjected continually to the revilings of enemies and every kind of ignominious treatment and when their souls were sinking under the weight of such accumulated calamity and brought to the very verge of despair  at once in one blessed moment to be freed from slavery restored to the embraces of their friends and enjoy with them all the raptures of victory  god what a scene what a number of scenes for the imagination after glancing upon the whole distinguishes and separates objects and forms a thousand groupes of the most pathetic kind the fond recognition of old companions brothers flying into each others arms and the extacy of fathers on the recovery of their lost sons  such are the pictures that fancy represents when contemplating those grates so truly ornamental of a christian church and so perfectly congenial with a religion requiring men to relieve the oppressed and set the captive free  about ten pilgrims arrive every year on an average from england at loretto where the people believe those of the roman catholic religion keep up more strictly to the principles of their faith than those of france or italy  the people of loretto whatever reason they may have to depend on the invisible protection of the virgin especially as to what concerns the treasury consecrated to her do not think it advisable to put her to the trial for the window of the treasury is not only strongly barred up but the city is also fortified  these fortifications are indeed a sufficient security against any sudden attack of pirates but else of little importance for in many places the houses supply the place of walls  loretto is generally without a garrison so that it seems strange the turks have not made greater efforts for getting into their hands the precious booty it contains than they have hitherto done the roman catholics indeed affirm that in all the attempts which the turks have made against loretto they have either been repelled by some extraordinary miracle or miscarried by a supernatural panic but all these miracles have not prevented the inhabitants upon the least appearance of danger from sending away the treasure to ancona or some other place of security another reason why the turks do not make any formal attempt upon this place may probably be owing to the shallowness of the adriatic which has not a depth of water sufficient for large ships to approach the shore besides loretto being three italian miles from the sea and in an open country no descent can be made with such secrecy as not to alarm the whole neighborhood who are ready to sacrifice their lives in defense of the virgin and would soon be under arms the burghers amount to above three hundred and the inhabitants in the town and suburbs are reckoned to exceed seven thousand and besides a turkish squadron is no sooner known to be at sea than a strong garrison is immediately sent here  the only trade of loretto consists of rosaries crucifixes little madonas and medals which are manufactured here and sold to pilgrims there are great numbers of shops full of these commodities some of them at a high price but infinitely the greater part adapted to the purses of the buyers and sold for a mere trifle the evident poverty of these manufacturers and traders and of the inhabitants of this town in general is a sufficient proof that the reputation of our lady of loretto is greatly on the decline  chap ii ancona the distance from loretto to ancona is fifteen italian miles and the road lies through a charming plain intersected by the rivers musone and arpido here we cannot but observe that in no other chain of mountains are so many sources of brooks and rivers to be found as on the east side of the apennines  ancona at a distance is one of the most striking prospects in italy it stands both on the summit and the brow of a hill it has a mole a fine citadel and in short is a flourishing town it is hardly to be expressed says sharp how beautiful the environs of ancona are the road is hilly but the gradual wavings of the vineyards and arable grounds afford the most pleasing images of peace and plenty the adriatic near the road on one hand and the apennines at the distance perhaps of thirty miles on the other seem to beautify the prospect  this town is said to have been founded by the syracusians who fled from the tyranny of dionysius the town originally was built on a hill but the houses have been gradually extended down the face of the eminence toward the sea the cathedral stands on the highest part from whence there is a most advantageous view of the town the country and the sea this church is supposed to be placed on the spot where a temple dedicated to venus formerly stood the same mentioned by juvenal when he speaks of a large turbot caught on this coast and presented to the emperor domitian  the ascents and descents and great inequality of ground will prevent this from being a beautiful town but it has much the appearance of becoming a rich one some of the nobility have the firmness and good sense to despise an ancient prejudice and avowedly prosecute commmerce new houses are daily building and the streets are animated with the daily bustle of trade i met says moore with several english traders on the change which seemed crowded with seafaring men and merchants from dalmatia greece and many parts of europe there are great numbers of jews established in this city and it is generally remarked that those places are in a thriving condition to which they resort they have a synagogue here and although all religions are tolerated theirs is the only foreign worship allowed to be publicly exercised the commerce of ancona has increased very rapidly of late years and it is evident that the popes who first thought of making it a freeport of encouraging manufactures and building a mole to render the harbor more safe have injured venice in a more sensible manner than those who thundered bulls against that republic but it is much to be questioned whether the former by their encouragements to commerce have augmented their own spiritual importance in the same proportion they have the temporal riches of their subjects  men who have received a liberal education and have adopted liberal sentiments previous to their engaging in any particular profession will carry those sentiments along with them through life and perhaps there is no profession in which they can be exercised with more advantage and utility than in that of a merchant in this profession a man of the character above described while he is augmenting his own private fortune will enjoy the agreeable reflection that he is likewise increasing the riches and power of his country and giving bread to thousands of his industrious countrymen of all professions his is in its nature the most independent the merchant does not like the soldier receive wages from his sovereign nor like the lawyer and physician from his fellow subjects his wealth often flows from foreign sources and he is is under no obligation to those from whom it is derived the habit which he is in of circulating millions makes him lay less stress on a few guineas than the proprietors of the largest estates and we daily see in countries where this prosession is not considered as degrading the commercial parts of the inhabitants giving the most exalted proofs of generosity and public spirit  but in countries where no one who has the smallest claim to the title of gentleman can engage in commerce without being thought to have demeaned himself fewer examples of this nature will be found and in every country it must be acknowledged that those who have not had the advantage of a liberal education who have been taught to consider money as the most valuable of all things and who are continually revolving in their minds the various means of increasing their stock it swells in their imagination beyond its real worth and at length by an inversion of the christian precept is considered as the one thing needful to be sought with the most unremitting ardour that all things may be added thereto  in commercial towns where all find employment and are agitated by the bustle of business the minds of the inhabitants are apt to be so much engrossed with the affairs of this world as almost to forget that there is another and neither the true religion nor false ones have such fast hold of their minds as in places where there is more poverty and less worldly occupation in the first they consider the remonstrances of priests and confessors as interruptions to business and without daring to despise the ceremonies of religion the hurried trader huddles them over as fast as possible that he may return to occupations more congenial with the habit of his mind the preachers may cry aloud and proclaim the vanity of this world and all it contains but men who have been trained to the pursuit of money from their childhood who have bestowed infinite pains to acquire it and who derive all their importance from it must naturally have a partiality for this world where riches procure so many flattering distinctions and a prejudice against that in which they procure none but in towns where there is little trade and great numbers of poor people where they have much spare time and small comfort in this world the clergy have an easier task if they are tolerably assiduous in turning the attention of the inhabitants to the other in roman catholic towns of this description we see the people continually pacing up and down the streets with wax tapers in their hands they listen with fond attention to all the priest relates concerning that invisible country that land of promise where their hopes are centered they ruminate with complacency on the happy period when they also shall have their good things they bear their present rage with patience in expectation of the white raiment and crowns of gold which they are told await them they languish for the happiness of being promoted to that lofty situation from whence they may look down with scorn on those to whom they now look up with envy and where they shall retaliate on their wealthy neighbors whose riches at present they imagine insult their poverty  this town being exposed by the nature of its commerce with turkey to the contagious diseases which prevail in that country clement xii as soon as he determined to make it a freeport erected a lazaretto it advances a little way into the sea and is a very noble as well as useful edifice he afterward began a work as necessary and still more expensive and that is the mole built in the sea to screen the vessels in the harbor from the winds which frequently blow from the opposite shore of the adriatic with great violence this was carried on with redoubled spirit by benedict xiv after his quarrel with venice has been continued by the succeeding popes and is now almost finished this building was founded in the ruins of the ancient mole raised by the emperor trajan the stone of istria was used at first till the exportation of it was prohibited by the republic of venice who had no reason to wish well to this work but a quarry of excellent stone was afterward found near ancona as fit for the purpose and a kind of sand which when mixed with lime forms a composition as hard as any stone is brought from the neighborhood of rome and no other is used for this building which is above two thousand feet in length one hundred in breadth and about sixty in depth from the surface of the sea a stupendous work more analogous to the power and revenues of ancient than modern rome  near to this stands the triumphal arch as it is called of trajan this is an honorary monument erected in gratitude to the emperor for the improvements he made in the harbor at his own expense next to the maison quarree at nimus it is the most beautiful and most entire monument extant of roman taste and magnificence the fluted corinthian pillars on the two sides are of the finest proportions and the parian marble of which they are composed instead of having acquired a black color like the ducal palace of venice and other buildings of marble is preserved by the seavapour as white and shining as if it were fresh polished from the rock  the inhabitants of ancona especially the female sex so far excel those of the other parts of italy in shape and complexion that they seem to be quite a different race of men the same may be observed of the inhabitants beyond senegallia fano and pesaro as far as rincini if it be true that the resort of young gentlemen to the universities and the numerous retinue of a court greatly contribute to render leipsick hall and dresden as it were the nurseries of fine women the superior beauty of the female sex at fano ancona etc may likewise be attributed to the great number of strangers and pilgrims continually traveling through those cities  the dress of the people of ancona according to misson is very singular he observed on their festivals that the principal inhabitants wore black clothes lined with green blue stockings shoes whitened with chalk and tied with colored ribbons their waistcoats unbuttoned and the cuffs of their sleeves embroidered their shirts fall and hang over their fingers ends the wives and daughters of the ordinary class of citizens wore headdresses with long fringes hanging over their faces the body of their gowns were of red and yellow silk laced all over with broad seams of gold or silver lace like a livery their petticoats very short and of a hundred different colors the ladies of quality were dressed after the french fashions but looked so very awkward that they even made a more fantastical and ridiculous appearance than the citizens  about fifteen miles from ancona lies senegallia another seaport upon this coast there is nothing remarkable in this town except during the time of the great fair which is held once a year to which a great concourse of merchants resort from venice and all towns on both sides of the adriatic also from sicily and the archipelago england carries on a very profitable trade with this and all the other towns of romagnia from which our merchants purchase great quantities of raw silk and afterward sell it when manufactured to the inhabitants they provide them also with english cotton and linen cloths of every kind  a few miles on this side fano in the road to bologna near the river metro is the spot where claudius nero the roman consul defeated asdrubal the brother of hannibal this was perhaps the most important victory the romans ever gained for had asdrubal been victorious or been able to effect a junction with his brother the troops he brought from spain would have become of triple value as soon as they were under the direction of hannibal and it is not improbable that with such a reinforcement that most consummate general would have put an end to the roman state and the glory of carthage would have begun where that of rome ended  the distance from senegallia to fano is sixteen miles this town derives its name from a temple of fortune which stood here in the time of the romans all the towns of italy however religious they may be are proud of their connexions with these celebrated heathens an image of the goddess fortune is erected on the fountain in the marketplace and the inhabitants show some ruins which they pretend belong to the ancient temple of fortune but what cannot be disputed are the ruins of a triumphal arch in white marble erected in honor of augustus and which was greatly damaged by the artillery of pope paul the second when he besieged this town in the year      the churches of this town are adorned with some excellent pictures there is one particularly in the cathedral church by guercino which is much admired the subject is the marriage of joseph it consists of three principal figures the high priest joseph and the virgin  the other towns which we shall just slightly touch upon before we treat of bologna and its territories are pesaro rimini and ravenna which all lie on the coast of the adriatic pesaro lies about eighteen italian miles from fano it is a very agreeable town better built and paved than many on this coast in the marketplace there is a handsome fountain and a statue of pope urban the eighth in a sitting posture in the churches of this town are some pictures by baroccio a painter whose works some esteem very highly and who is thought to have imitated the manner of raphael and the tints of corregio not without success he lived about the middle of the sixteenth century and his colors seem to have improved by time but the operation of sun and air on pictures bringing all the colors to a kind of unison occasions what is called harmony and is thought an improvement on some pictures this road along the adriatic coast is extremely pleasant  the pesaro figs are accounted the best in all italy and even preferred to those of sclavonia  rimini the next stage on the road to bologna was famous in antiquity and still contains some monuments worthy the attention of the curious traveller it is the ancient ariminum the first town of which coesar took possession after passing the rubicon in the marketplace there is a kind of stone pedestal with an inscription declaring that on it coesar had stood and harrangued his army rimini had formerly a good harbor but it is now so choked with sand as scarce to afford depth of water for passageboats  between this town and ravenna is the river of piscatello the famous rubicon which was the ancient boundary between italy and cisalpine gaul no roman returning to rome could pass in arms beyond this without being deemed an enemy to his country the small town of cesenate is situated near the brook and the inhabitants value themselves not a little upon their vicinity to so celebrated a neighbor  ravenna absurdly supposed by some learned men to be founded by esau was not only during the grandeur of ancient rome but a considerable time after famous for the exarchs of which it was the seat at one period it was the seat of empire for after attila had left italy valentinian chose ravenna in preference to rome for his residence that he might always be ready to repel the huns and other barbarians who poured from the banks of the danube and prevent their penetrating into italy the same reason afterward induced theodoric king of the ostrogoths to keep his court at this city of ravenna after he had defeated and killed odoacer and assumed the title of king of rome the ruins of his palace and his tomb now form part of the antiquities of this town which is situated three miles from the adriatic sea a hundred miles northwest from ancona and eighty south of venice being surrounded by two small rivers its ancient situation is said to have been like that of venice upon certain islands when it was one of the best harbors the romans had on that coast  the buildings are in general very indifferent the magnificent churches and palaces it formerly contained are verging fast to ruin the trade is gone and the town very thinly inhabited  how scarce good spring water fit for drinking was anciently at ravenna appears from martial who says in his fifth book sit cisterna mihi quam vinea malo ravennoe cum possim multo vendere pluris aquam lodged at ravenna water sells so dear a cistern to a vineyard i prefer   and again callidus imposuit nuper mihi caupo ravennoe cum peterem mixtum vendidit ille merum by a ravenna vintner once betrayed so much for wine and water mixed i paid but when i thought the purchased liquor mine the rascal only fobbd me off with wine   in passing through ravenna says lady millar we experienced the truth of what is said concerning the badness as well as scarcity of water it is boiled in order to be rendered wholesome and is so thick from the number of animalculoe contained in it as to require to be strained and after all it stinks abominably the wine is excellent richer than cyprus when we changed horses we observed that the postboys had brought water with them to exchange for an equal quantity of wine which was done in our presence  ravenna is now only a vast solitude considering its size though the streets are large strait and regular with squares and fountains and most of its sacred edifices are stately remains of its ancient splendour there are two hospitals in this town the cleanliness of which would be admired even in holland so that citizens of all ranks make them their refuge in time of sickness as being every way better attended and provided for than they can expect to be at their own houses  amidst all these remains of its ancient splendour ravenna is now only magni nominis umbra the shadow of a great name it has neither commerce or manufactures the bulk of its inhabitants are idle nobles who make the interest of the different princes of europe the only object of their studies the great square where they meet every evening is geometrically divided between the two contending parties one of which is careful never to set its foot on the others ground on only crossing this square it may be seen in time of any continental war which side has the better this is manifest in the exultation of the victors and the dejection of the losing party news is expected there with more impatience than in the cabinet of any one sovereign of europe  in a convent belonging to the benedictines is a complete collection of medicaments for treating diseases of all kinds and every imaginable expedient for the convenience of the sick besides a wellfurnished laboratory and an excellent physic garden here are six large rooms on a floor in the first is a complete set of pieces of anatomy then all the instruments contrived for chirurgical operations together with thread needles tents bandages suitable to every operation lastly a storehouse of beds sheets bed clothes couches pillows cut out and prepared for the ready use of every kind of disease with all possible convenience to those who attend the patients these stores are distributed in large presses which line the six rooms and are of very neat workmanship for those disorders which require riding there is a most ingenious invention it is a large dragon suspended in the middle of one of these rooms which by means of clockwork has all the motions of a horse  chap iii bologna bologna on account of its extent the number of its nobility and other inhabitants and the importance of its trade is next to rome the finest and most wealthy city in the ecclesiastical state its circuit is between five and six italian miles but the length of it greatly exceeds the breadth and is supposed to resemble a ship the tower of asinelli being the mast the number of inhabitants in this city is said to be ninety thousand but the whole district which includes three hundred and eight cities towns and villages contains three hundred and eighty thousand inhabitants the ancient name of this city was falsina from falsinus a tuscan king who is supposed to have built it five and twenty years before the foundation of rome the name of bononia is by some derived from a successor of falsinus named bonus but others derive it from the boji this city had for a long succession of years retained a kind of liberty under the emperor of germany till the year      when it was resigned with reserve of some privileges to pope nicholas iii but from intestine commotions and wars with the neighboring states it continued in a fluctuating state till the pontificate of pope julius ii who taking the advantage of the venetian war made himself absolute master of it and annexed it to the papal dominions by expelling the family of bentivoglios however some of that family are the leading men of the city even at present on account of their voluntary submission it was at first stipulated that the bolognese should have the privilege of keeping a nuncio at the court of rome that no citadel should be built and that the effects of citizens should not be liable to confiscation on any pretense whatever these conditions have been observed with a degree of punctuality and good faith which many zealous protestants would not expect in the church of rome  bologna says moore retains the name of a republic sends an ambassador to the popes court and the word libertas is inscribed on the arms and coin of the state with the flattering capitals s p q r the civil government and police of the town is allowed to remain in the hands of the magistrates who are chosen by the senate which formerly consisted of forty members but since the republic came under the protection as it is called of the pope he thought proper to add ten more but the whole fifty still retain the name of the quaranta mankind in general are more alarmed by a change of name in things which they have long regarded with veneration than by a real change in the nature of the things themselves the pope may have had some good political reason for augmenting the number of the council to fifty but he could have none for calling them the council of fifty if the people chose rather to call fifty men assembled together the council of forty one of the senators presides in the senate and is called the gonfalonier from his carrying the standard gonfalone of the republic he is chief magistrate is attended by guards and is constantly at the palace or near it to be ready on any emergency but he remains only two months in office and the senators take it by turns  in the midst of all this appearance of independence a cardinal legate from rome governs this republic he is appointed by the pope with a vicelegate and other assistants the orders which the legate issues are supposed to be with the approbation of the senate the office which is of higher dignity than any other in the gift of the court of rome continues for three years at the expiration of that time his holiness either appoints a new legate or continues the old one in office for three years longer  this ecclesiastical viceroy lives in great magnificence and has a numerous suit of pages equeries and halberdiers who attend him in the city when he goes into the country he is accompanied by guards on horseback  the gonfalonier and magistrates regulate all the usual matters which regard the police and decide in common causes according to the laws and ancient forms of the republic but in affairs of great importance there is no doubt but the cardinal legate influences decisions this must be mortifying to the senators and noble families but is less felt by the people in general who have every appearance of living under a mild and beneficent government  the inhabitants of bologna carry on a very considerable trade in silks and velvets which are manufactured here in great perfection the country produces immense quantities of oil wine flax and hemp and furnishes all europe with sausages macaroni liqueur and essences the people seem to be industrious and to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their labor the markets are most plentifully supplied with provisions fruit is to be had in great variety and all excellent in its kind the common white wine of the country is a light white wine of an agreeable taste those who are not pleased with the entertainment they meet with at the inns in this city it will be a difficult matter to please they must be possessed of a degree of such nicety both in their palates and tempers as will render them exceedingly troublesome to themselves and others not only in their travels through italy but in their journey through life  on his arrival at this town the first object which strikes the eye of a stranger is a noble marble fountain in the area before the palazzo publico the principal figure is a statue of neptune eleven feet in height one of his hands is stretched out before him in the other he holds a trident the body and limbs are finely proportioned the anatomy perfect the character of the countenance severe and majestic this figure of neptune as well as all the others of boys dolphins and sirens which surround it are in bronze the whole is the workmanship of giovanni di bologna and is highly esteemed yet there seems to be an impropriety in making water flow in streams from the breasts of seanymphs or sirens  there are a great number of palaces in this city what is called the public palace is by far the most spacious but not the most elegant in this the cardinal legate is lodged there are also apartments for the gonfalonier and halls or chambers for some of the courts of justice this building though of a gloomy and irregular form without contains some very magnificent apartments and a few good pictures  over the entrance of this palace is a bronze statue of a pope the tiara and other parts of the papal uniform are not so favorable to the sculptors genius as the naked simplicity in which neptune appears a female traveller however not extravagantly fond of the fine arts would rather be observed admiring the sculptors skill in imitating the folds of the sacerdotal robes than the anatomical accuracy in forming the majestic proportions of the sea divinity  though the nobility of bologna are not now very rich many of their palaces are furnished in a magnificent taste and contain pictures of great value the palaces were built and ornamented when the proprietors were richer and when the finest works of architecture and painting could be procured on easier terms than at present the galleries and apartments are spacious and magnificent yet there are circumstances in the most splendid that must hurt the eye of those who are accustomed to that perfect exactness in finishing which prevails in english houses the glass of the windows of some palaces is divided into little square panes which are joined together by lead and the floors of all are very indifferently laid  the most precious ornaments of the palaces are the paintings and particularly those of the great masters in the art which this city has had the honor to produce raphael is generally allowed to have excelled all painters in the sublimity of his ideas the grouping of his figures the beauty of his heads the elegance of his forms and the correctness of his outlines yet in the opinion of some he has oftener imitated those noble ideas of beauty transmitted to us by the greek sculptors than what he saw or could see in nature those who hold this opinion assert that the best masters of the lombard school studied with equal assiduity the elegance of the antique statues and the simplicity of nature and from this combined attention to both with geniuses less sublime and not so universal as that of the roman painters they have produced works equal if not superior in some respects to his  next to rome itself there is perhaps no town in the world so rich in paintings as bologna the churches and palaces besides many admired pieces by other masters are full of the works of the great masters who were natives of this city the palazzo de monti in particular shows the genius of the italian nobility for decorating their palaces with collections of painting and other curiosities who often abridge themselves of a great many of the conveniences of life in order to be possessed of something which attracts the admiration of other people and especially of foreigners the first floor of this grand edifice consisting of above thirty apartments which are by far the best is never or at least very seldom inhabited and then only for the reception of some person of distinction the general use of them being to display an amazing collection of paintings and other curiosities  the profusion of paintings in this city says grosley made me curious to know what price the caracci and their pupils used to put upon their works which was nothing when compared to what they bear at present all these great painters working from inclination placed their whole ambition in the perfection of their art and the judgment of posterity guido was the only one whose happiness it was to enjoy the reputation on which he raised without scarce knowing it a fortune that he did not keep he had made great progress in his career by having early entered on it he had an astonishing ease and readiness which in his latter days he unfortunately abused and the fortune he accumulated he owed to the homage paid him on account of his admired talents by foreigners and sovereigns the vexations enmities and crosses which embittered the lives of these famous men and actually shortened the days of most of them are facts corroborating the many instances that eminent genius and reputation so far from being productive of happiness very often proves a misfortune the caracci might have lived very happy as tailors but then their names would never have been heard of  in the last century there was at bologna a man of that calling who was very famous for his knowledge of pictures and his skill in discerning their respective merits and the styles of the different schools and masters this tailor was a very great politician and his shop was the office of intelligence for all the news which the court of versailles wished to have spread in italy as a connoisseur in pictures and a politician lewis xiv allowed him a pension and such was his zeal for that monarch that he actually died of the shock he received on the news of the battle of ramilies  the university of bologna is one of the most ancient and most celebrated seats of literature in europe and the academy for the arts and sciences founded by count marsigli at the beginning of the present century is sufficient of itself to engage strangers to visit this city if there were nothing more worthy of their curiosity here is a most valuable library in three spacious rooms where any person may study and have the use of the books four hours every day also apartments for the students of sculpture painting architecture chemistry anatomy astronomy and every branch of natural philosophy they are all ornamented with designs models instruments and every kind of apparatus requisite for illustrating those sciences there are also professors who regularly read lectures and instruct the students in those various parts of knowledge there is a hall full of models in architecture and fortification a valuable collection of medals and another of natural curiosities and a complete collection of specimens to assist the study of materia medica and every part of natural history a gallery of statues consisting of a few originals and very fine casts of the best statues in italy  honorary premiums are distributed every year among the artists for the best designs in painting sculpture and architecture  the anatomical theater is adorned with statues of celebrated physicians and in the museum which belongs to it are abundance of anatomical preparations also a complete suite of anatomical figures in wax there are also models in wax of particular parts and of several of the viscera of the human body separately yet those waxen models could not stand in competition with the preparations of the real parts in dr hunters museum if brought to that test the bologna waxworks though admirable in their kind would appear as the best casts of the vatican apollo and laocoon would if placed beside the originals indeed the real preparations to be seen here are far inferior to those of that great anatomist whose museum possesses the most complete and most accurate collection of anatomical preparations that ever was made by human skill and industry  the principal church is that of st petronius forming part of the large irregular square in which the fountain formerly mentioned stands it is the largest in bologna in the pavement of this church cassini drew his meridian line and within the walls of this same edifice the emperor charles v was crowned those circumstances may interest the astronomer and the historian but the statue of a soldier which stands in one of the chapels engages the attention of the pious catholic this man being at play and in danger of losing all his money offered up a very fervent prayer to the virgin mary for a little better luck to which she who never showed any favor to gamesters turned a deaf ear when he found that his bad fortune continued this furious wretch drew his sword and wounded both the virgin and the infant in her arms he instantly as it may be supposed fell to the ground deprived of motion he was carried to prison and condemned to a painful and ignominious death while he remained under confinement he came to a proper sense of his wickedness and the blessed virgin was so much softened by his repentance that she restored him the use of his limbs and the judges taking the hint gave him a full pardon as a satisfactory proof of this memorable event they show the identical sword with which the assault was made  in a dominican convent situated on the top of a hill about three miles from bologna is a portrait of the virgin by st luke according to sigoni it was brought by a hermit from the church of sancta sophia at constantinople in the year    0 and since that time its power has several times been manifested say the inhabitants to the great benefit of the country on which account it is every year in the month of may brought into the city of bologna in a solemn procession and carried through the principal streets attended by every inhabitant who can afford to purchase a wax taper during the procession the bells continue ringing the cannon are fired and the troops under arms observe the same ceremonies when the picture passes as if it were the commander in chief the common people imagine the picture is extremely fond of this annual visit to the town of bologna they are convinced that if it were not carried it would descend from the frame and walk the whole way on foot but they do not desire to see the experiment made because it might disoblige the virgin and should the picture once set out to walk there is no knowing where it would stop  for the greater convenience of the pilgrims an arched colonade has been built from the city to the top of the mountain which on account of its great length maybe accounted the most remarkable building of that kind in italy in the contributions of the necessary sums for this colonade all the tradesmen seemed to vie with each other in the erection of a perpetual monument of their zeal for the blessed virgin even the very lacqueys of the city were at the expense of building fifteen of the arches every arch is about twelve feet wide which is the breadth of the walk the height is above sixteen feet this arcade does not run in a strait line but is now and then interrupted with small windings however in many parts of it there are very long vistas particularly at the grand portico near the city from which one has a view of ninetythree arches in a direct line there are thirtythree flights of steps to ascend the acclivity of the mountain three flights consist of a few steps and the space between is level and paved with flat stones  the houses in most of the principal streets have before them a kind of portico which supports the second story these must be allowed to be very convenient in windy or rainy weather and in shading the houses from the sun but they deprive them of that ornament which they would receive from a fine front or an elegant entrance as the pillars of these porticos are very irregular some being very high others very low some round some square others octangular some of stone and others again of wood they are no very great ornaments to the city these porticos or galleries serve only for walking and that part of the streets where the carriages pass is considerably lower the roofs of the houses are of tiles but flat with a kind of parapet toward the streets  the tower degli asinelli is by some but erroneously said to be the highest in all italy for the cupola of st peters at rome far exceeds it the report of a hamper of gilt iron hanging out of this tower in terrorem to confessors is also without foundation a monk for divulging some particulars confessed to him having as the story goes been put into this hamper and left to perish this tower is square and the steps by which it is ascended are of wood it derives its name from gerardo asinelli who built it at his own expense in   0  it is a common saying here that from the tower of asinelli one has a view of cento e cinque citta i e a hundred and five cities but this is no more than a pun upon the word cento the name of a small town near bologna a similar pun we hear in france concerning the prospect from a mountain near the village of trente between beziers and narbonne viz jai vu dune montagne trente et deux villes i e i have seen from the top of a mountain two and thirty cities but it means no more than that i have seen the village trente and two cities trente being the french word for thirty  near the asinelli tower is another the inclination of which on one side is such that a plumb line let down from the top falls seven feet from the wall at the bottom this however is not the only leaning tower in italy as we have already remarked  the bolognese ladies dress entirely in the french fashion the women of the middle class generally appear in a black gown with a black silk veil over their heads but the female sex here in general enjoy greater freedom than in most cities of italy we meet not a few persons walking the streets with spectacles on who are yet so far from laboring under any weakness of sight that they roll their eyes about on all sides without once looking through their glasses this fashion is of spanish origin and is supposed to be a sign of greater gravity than ordinary which has recommended it to the generality of the monks and clergy  the bolognese are famous for their vivacity and wit and particularly for the satirical poignance of their jests however a stranger no where meets with more civility than in this town they are very assiduous also in their application to their several trades and manufactures the nuns of this city are very ingenious in making most beautiful artificial flowers of silver silk muslin enamel isinglass etc and though the best sort of flowers are made only for presents yet abundance of them are to be met with in the shops where travelers may buy them at a moderate price fruits of all kinds are also imitated in wax so as scarcely to be discerned at first sight from the products of nature  formerly little dogs of the bologna breed brought no inconsiderable sums to this city but at present the ridiculous passion for those animals is so far exploded that even in bologna itself by the decrease of the breed they are become so scarce that one of any tolerable beauty is valued at four or five guineas it is said the means used for checking the growth of these creatures is to rub their legs and backs as soon as they are brought forth with spirits of wine and afterward frequently to repeat the operation if this be true the effect must arise from the heat of the liquor which dries up the vital juices and possibly this recipe may be better grounded than the one published at liepsick in    0 among the miscellanea curiosa medico physica viz that if you anoint the back bone of a newborn infant with the fat of rats moles and bats it will never exceed the stature of a small dwarf  many ingenious articles are here made of walnuttree for the country abounds with these trees the quinces which grow here are also very large and of an exquisite flavor bologna is likewise celebrated for its theriaca which is openly and with no small solemnity prepared in the public laboratory and another alexipharmic highly esteemed which is called electuario di martino  chap iv republic of lucca the republic of lucca is not above thirty italian miles in circumference but the fertility of the soil and the mildness of the government have been such attractive inducements for settling here that the inhabitants of the city and the hundred and fifty villages belonging to it are computed to be in number one hundred and twenty thousand of which thirty thousand are able to carry arms nothing however but foreign support can prevent lucca from coming under the subjection of the great duke of tuscany who has already found means to surround it on all sides with his territories plausible pretenses for a quarrel will frequently arise not only from disputes about limits but from the obstinate refusal of the lucquese to acknowledge the family of the medicis great dukes of tuscany allowing them only the title of dukes of tuscany in such a situation a universal concord and harmony is necessary for transmitting to posterity the blessings of their darling goddess liberty whose name they bear on their arms and whose image is not only impressed on their coins but also on the city gates and on all the public buildings  the city is three italian miles in circumference and is fortified with eleven bastions which with the other works are planted with two hundred and eighty pieces of cannon the ramparts are very pleasant being planted all round with four rows of trees and in some parts with more the country in which this city stands is a delicious plain terminated on all sides by a chain of mountains the skill and indusof the inhabitants in their silk and other manufactures have gained this city the honorable epithet of indusdustriosa or the industrious the small kind of olives which grow here are excellent and the oil they produce accounted the best in all italy the city according to keysler contains about fortyfour thousand inhabitants others however reckon not not more than half that number they are much to be commended for their candor politeness and cheerfulness here are seen more young women in the streets shops churches and schools than in any other part of italy their police is very commendable and great attention is shown to suppress luxury superfluous magnificence and such dissipations as often prove so destructive to families where no such restraint takes place on entering the city travelers must deliver up their firearms but it is only informing the guard at what gate they intend to go out when they leave the city and they are sure to find them there they are likewise allowed to wear their swords for three days but afterward must have a particular license which generally is granted only to persons of high rank no commoner though he be one of the council must appear with a sword and no soldier  strangers never fail to be welcomed here with an evening serenade which is accompanied with an humble intimation that they would be pleased to make some returns for such an honor the houses are generally well built and the streets well paved and broad but most of them irregular  the palace of the republic is large and spacious without any thing curious unless it be an arsenal which makes a part of it and has always arms in readiness for twenty thousand men  on a monument in one of the churches is the following inscription  hic jacet corpus s ricardi regis anglioe here lies the body of s richard king of england but how the body of any of the kings of england came here is what the history of the country does not mention  their council of state is composed of a doge and nine senators who are all members of the great council and are changed every two months these counselors who are called elders bear the title of most excellent and whilst in office live in the republic palace and their expenses are defrayed at the charge of the state but when they go abroad on their own private concerns it must be incognito and in a close sedan with the curtains drawn a doge is not capable of being reelected till the expiration of seven years the great council abovementioned consists of one hundred and thirty of the nobility and one hundred and ten commoners who are changed every two years the palaceguard is a corpse of seventyfive swiss and the rest of the republics forces may consist of about five hundred men its ordinary revenue is computed at about eighty thousand pounds sterling  chap v grand duchy of tuscany this duchy borders on the mediterranean which in these parts receives its name from this duchy also on the ecclesiastical state the duchy of modena and the republic of lucca some small detached parts belonging to it lie among the territories of modena lucca and genoa these parcels excepted its extent from north to south is one hundred and sixteen english miles and from east to west about eighty miles the population is estimated at a million of inhabitants  the great variety of hills and valleys rising grounds and plains renders the country very pleasant the soil is kind and fertile abounding in grain lemons oranges and all other sorts of fruits besides oil and excellent wine the pastures also are very rich the oil however bears little proportion to the multitude of olive trees which are subject to a distemper map of the grand duchy of tuscany map of the grand duchy of tuscany showing itself in knots and tubercles occasioned by worms besides that wine known in england by the name of florence and which is the ordinary drink of the inhabitants they have a white fort much better extremely light and delicate to the taste the trees most common here are the cypress and the pine the latter produces a kind of almond or kernel very good to eat when pounded in a mortar and mixed with the pulp of the white codlin it forms a paste exceedingly good to wash the hands with the wood is very resinous and if chipped whilst green and boiled till one half of the water is consumed when used as a bath or fomentation hot as it can be borne proves excellent for sprains wrenches or any common rheumatic pains in the limbs  the vines in this country says smollet are not planted in rows and proped with sticks as in france but twine around the hedgerow trees nearly covering them with their foliage and fruit the branches of the vine are extended from tree to tree exhibiting beautiful festoons of real leaves tendrils and swelling clusters a foot long by this economy the ground of the enclosure is spared for corn grass or any other production might not the same method be adapted in this country with equal success in regard to hops the trees commonly planted for the purpose of sustaining the vines are maple elm and elder with which last the banks of the arno abound this river which is very considerable with respect to the quantity of water would be a charming pastoral stream if it was transparent but it is always muddy and discolored  this duchy abounds in minerals but the mines are not much worked except in the island of elba remarkable for its fine iron ore the air of several places as of pisa volterra chiusa and massa is unhealthy on account of the many fens and wild desert places in some parts manna is gathered from the ash and elm it oozes out on taking off the rind and and consequently is not a production of the air but of the tree the bees carry off a great deal of it the remainder is applied in tuscany to medicinal uses and in france for giving a gloss to cloth  on the borders of the territory of lucca near pisa are some hot springs which are in great vogue there are others in different parts of this duchy the heat of which much exceeds that of boiling water the famous tetruchio water is properly a brine and celebrated for its virtues in a diarrhaea  the principal river in this country is the arno which rises in the apennine mountains in the territory of florence and falls into the sea below pisa  the whole face of tuscany says sharp is covered with farmhouses and cottages an object very rare in the dominions of the pope and the king of naples but the cottages here and indeed through all italy are not as in france and england thatched huts with walls of mud they are built of stone or brick and to outward appearance should contain richer inhabitants than in fact they do  a striking circumstance though a trivial one offers itself on first entering the grand dukes territories and this is the ingenious method of figuring their milestones which might be imitated to good effect in england as time and weather have a tendency to obliterate the figures cut in coarse stone and what is worse as idle boys in all parts of the world are apt to make it an amusement to deface the figures of milestones and destroy by that very practice the use of them the florentines let into the figures a small slip or bar of iron which is fastened with solder in the usual manner plumbers fix iron in stone by this means the figures on the stones remain legible almost for ever or at least would do so if the iron were painted black once in two or three years and the difficulty of breaking them to pieces discourages the attempt  the principal cities in this duchy are florence leghorn sienna and pisa  chap vi of the city of florence the city of florence lies in a fruitful valley on the river arno one hundred and twenty miles north of rome in a most delightful situation encompassed with beautiful hills on three sides full of villages countryseats gardens groves and woods of olives rising gradually till they join the highest mountains of the apennines and toward the west is that rich valley watered by the river arno which extends as far as pisa abounding in corn wine oil and all manner of delicious fruits  the florentines pride themselves so much on the beauty of their city that they imagine nothing can equal it and says moore it unquestionably is a very beautiful city independent of the churches and palaces some of which are very magnificent the architecture of the houses in general is in a good taste the streets are remarkably clean and paved with large broad stones chisselled so as to prevent the horses from sliding this city is divided into two unequal parts by the river arno over which there are no less than four bridges in sight of each other that called the ponte della trinita is uncommonly elegant it is built entirely of white marble and ornamented with four beautiful statues representing the four seasons the quays and buildings on each side and the bridges render that part of florence through which the river passes by far the finest the same is the case at paris and it happens fortunately for these two cities that these parts are almost constantly before the eye on account of the necessity people are under of passing and repassing those bridges whereas in london whose river and bridges are far superior to any in france or italy people may live whole seasons attend all the public amusements and drive every day from one end of the town to the other without ever seeing the thames or the bridges unless they go on purpose for this reason when a foreigner is asked which he thinks the finest city paris or london the moment paris is mentioned the louvre and that striking part which is situated between pontroyal and pontneuf presents itself to his imagination he can recollect no part of london equal in magnificence to this and ten to one if he decides directly it will be in favor of paris but if he takes a little more time and compares the two capitals street by street square by square and bridge by bridge he will probably be of a different opinion the number of inhabitants in florence is calculated at eighty thousand the streets squares and fronts of the palaces are adorned with a great number of statues some of them by the best masters a taste for the arts must be kept alive independent almost of any other encouragement in a city where so many specimens are continually before the the eyes of the inhabitants there are towns in europe where statues exposed night and day within the reach of the common people would run a greater risk of being disfigured and mutilated here they are as safe as if they were shut up in the great dukes gallery  the number of statues which ornament the streets and squares of florence amount in all to above one hundred and fifty many of them of exquisite workmanship and admired by those of the best taste such a number of statues without any drapery continually exposed to the public eye with the far greater number of pictures as well as statues in the same taste to be seen in the palaces have produced in both sexes the most perfect insensibility to nudities  ladies who have remained some time at rome or florence particularly those who affect a taste for virtu acquire an intrepidity and a cool minuteness in examining and criticizing naked figures which is unknown to those who have never passed the alps there is something in the figure of the god of gardens which is apt to alarm the modesty of a novice but there are female dilettanti who think little of it  florence has been equally distinguished by a spirit for commerce and the fine arts two things which are not always united some of the florentine merchants formerly were men of vast wealth and lived in a most magnificent manner one of them about the middle of the fifteenth century built that noble fabric which from the name of its founder is called the palazzo pitti the man was ruined by the prodigious expense of the building which was immediately purchased by the medici family and has continued ever since to be the residence of the sovereigns the gardens belonging to this palace are on the declivity of an eminence on the summit there is a kind of fort called belvidere from this and from some of the higher walks is seen a complete view of the city of florence and the beauteous vale of arno in the middle of which it stands the prospect is bounded on every side by an amphitheatre of fertile hills adorned with country houses and gardens  the furniture of this palace is rich and curious particularly some tables of florentine work which are much admired the most precious ornaments however are the paintings the walls of what is called the imperial chamber are painted in fresco by various painters the subjects are allegorical and in honor of lorenzo de medicis distinguished by the name of the magnificent there is more fancy than taste displayed in the paintings the other principal rooms are distinguished by the names of heathen deities as jupiter apollo mars venus and by paintings in fresco mostly by pietro di cortona in the last mentioned the subjects are different from what is naturally expected from the name of the room being representations of the triumphs of virtue over love or some memorable instance of continence as the medicis family have been more distinguished for the protection they afforded the arts than for the virtues of continence and selfdenial it is probable the subject as well as the execution of these pieces was left entirely to the painter  in no part of italy are there so many villas belonging to private persons as in the neighborhood of this city the country all around is divided into small farms with a neat farm house on each  in respect to curiosities worthy the attention of a traveller florence says keysler exceeds every city in italy rome alone excepted it is generally styled by the italians la bella or the beautiful an epithet it probably owes to the cleanliness of the streets and goodness of the pavement the palaces here being neither so many nor so stately as to put it on a level with rome turin or even genoa the streets are for the most part narrow and winding and the former is too much the fault in the corso which is said to be two italian miles in length so that in several of the streets which are included in that quarter there is not breadth enough for a carriage to pass  there are however some beautiful palaces in florence and as tuscan pillars and rustic work owe their origin to this country the architects always take care to give them a place in the great edifices that are raised in tuscany the palazzo pitti and that we have just noticed is built after this manner which makes it look extremely solid and majestic it is not unlike the luxemburg at paris built by mary of medici and for that reason perhaps the workmen fell into the tuscan humor i found says addison in the court of this palace what i could not meet with any where in rome i mean an antique statue of hercules lifting up antaeus from the earth it was found in rome and brought here under the reign of leo x there are abundance of pictures in this palace by the hands of the greatest masters  but it is in the famous gallery of the old palace that perhaps the noblest collections are to be met with in any part of the world the gallery itself is made in the shape of an l according to lassel but if it must needs be like a letter remarks addison it resembles the greek    most it is adorned with admirable pieces of sculpture as well modern as ancient one of the most instructing parts of it in the eyes of many is the series of roman emperors from julius coesar to gallienus with a considerable number of their empresses ranged opposite to them this series is almost complete but wherever the bust of an emperor is wanting the place is filled up by that of some other distinguished roman such an honor is bestowed with great propriety on seneca cicero or agrippa the soninlaw of augustus but on perceiving a head of antinous the favorite of adrian it was remarked says moore that this bust would not have been admitted into such company any where but in florence it ought however to be remembered that the gallery is not an egyptian court of judicature where princes are tried after death for crimes committed during their life if the vices of originals had excluded their portraits what would have become of the series of roman emperors and particularly of the great julius coesar himself of whose intrigues and debaucheries history has given us so flagrant a description  amidst these noble specimens of ancient art some of the works of michael angelo are not thought undeserving a place his bacchus and faunus of which the wellknown story is told have been by some preferred to the two antique figures representing the same  this story to such of our readers as are unacquainted with it may perhaps not be unacceptable it is related as follows when michael angelos reputation had risen to a great height his adversaries envious of his fame had no other way to lessen it than by comparing his works to the antique and endeavoring to show how far he fell short of the ancients he took the resolution of putting the skill of his judges to the test and made this bacchus when the work was perfected he broke off the right hand which holds a cup and laid it by in his closet the rest of the figure he buried and let it lie some time in the ground at a proper opportunity the workmen were ordered to dig as for other purposes in another part of the ground and to carry on their work so that they must of course come to the place where the statue was hid they did so and found it and by direction mentioned it in such a manner that it might come to the ears of his adversaries who were not long in going to view the new discovery and when they had cleansed the earth from it found a fine group of a bacchus and faunus all entire except one hand which was wanting to the bacchus they instantly judged it to be a fine antique the discovery was soon noised about and among the rest who flocked to see it came michael angelo himself he was not so loud in its praises as the rest were well says one of them you can make as good a one no doubt he laughed with them a little time and at last asked them what will you say if i made this it may easily be imagined how the question was received he then only desired their patience whilst he stepped home which he did and brought back with him the hand he had broken off which upon application was found to tally exactly with the arm  the beautiful head of alexander is also universally admired by all the virtuosi though they differ in opinion in regard to the circumstances in which the sculptor has intended to represent that hero some imagine he is dying mr addison thinks he sighs for new worlds to conquer others that he faints with pain and loss of blood from the wounds he received at oxydrace some think the features express not bodily pain or languor but sorrow and remorse for having murdered his faithful friend clitus  the famous bust of alexander appeared to me says lady millar to express more of the sentiment of indignation and reproach in the countenance than of a sensation proceeding from bodily pain though it is here styled alexander dying the features are extremely handsome and wonderfully interesting and the whole character noble  the unfinished bust of marcus brutus by michael angelo admirably expresses the determined firmness of character which belonged says moore to that virtuous roman  among the busts of the emperors and empresses there are some which are very scarce and almost singular in their kind and i have generally observed at rome remarks addison which is a great magazine of these antiquities that the same heads which are rare in medals are also rare in marble and indeed we may commonly assign the same reason for both which was the shortness of the emperors reigns that did not give the workmen time to make many of their figures and as the shortness of their reigns was generally occasioned by the advancement of a rival it is no wonder that no one worked on the figure of a deceased emperor when his rival was on the throne among other antique figures there is a fine one of morpheus in touchstone this god is represented by the ancient statuaries under the figure of a boy asleep with a bundle of poppy in his hand it is probable they chose to represent the god of sleep under the figure of a boy contrary to all modern designers because it is that age which has its repose the least broken by cares and anxieties statius in his celebrated invocation to sleep addressed himself to him under the same figure  crimine quo merui juvenis placidissime divum sil l   i would most willingly pay the tribute of my praise says moore to that charming figure known by the name of the venus de medicis yet in the midst of all my admiration i confess i do not think her equal to her brother apollo in the vatican in that sublime figure to the most perfect features and proportion is joined an air which seems more than human the medicean venus is unquestionably a perfect model of female beauty but while apollo appears more than a man the venus seems precisely a beautiful woman  this statue says addison seems much less than the life as being perfectly naked and in company with others of a larger make lady millar measured it and found it not more than four feet ten inches in height the softness of the flesh the delicacy of the shape air and posture and the correctness of design in this statue are inexpressible  this chef doeuvre or standard for female beauty was found in the villa adriana amongst more than thirtyeight greek statues of admirable workmanship the inscription on the pedestal importing her to have been formed by cleomenes an athenian son of apollodorus has been evidently inserted at the time her arms were supplied whether she was that venus sculptured by praxiteles and which the inhabitants of gnidos refused to nicodemes king of bithynia although he offered to pay all their debts in exchange for this marble lady or whether she was the workmanship of phidias and the same that in the time of pliny was placed at rome under the portico of octavia or whether she was the venus of alcamenes and placed near athens still remains matter for controversy to anxious antiquarians who have never yet been able to agree on the subject  in the same room says moore are many other excellent statues besides a collection of admirable pictures by the best masters  besides the gallery and tribuna the hundredth part of whose treasures it is impossible to particularife there are other rooms whose contents are indicated by the name they bear as the cabinet of arts of astronomy of natural history of medals of porcelain of antiquities and the saloon of the hermaphrodite so called from a statue which divides the admiration of the amateurs with that in the borghese villa at rome the excellence of the execution is disgraced by the vileness of the subject we are surprised how the greeks and romans could take pleasure in such unnatural figures in this particular their taste seems to have been as depraved as in general it was elegant and refined  the large room called the gallery of portraits is not the least curious in this vast museum it contains the portraits all executed by themselves of the most eminent painters who have flourished in europe during the three last centuries they amount to above two hundred those of rubens vandyke rembrandt and guido were formerly the most esteemed two have been since added which vie with the finest in this collection  those of mengs and sir joshua reynolds the portrait of raphael seems to have been done when he was young it is not equal to any of the above  lady millar mentions having seen in one of the rooms a variety of summer and winter rings worn by the ancient romans some of which were entire with the stones still in their setting the greater part were intaglios but among them were some cameos there were several which opened and the cavity under the gem was sufficiently large to receive as much matter as might be contained in the bowl of a teaspoon probably these cavities were designed to hold poison some of the hoops of these rings were so large adds lady millar to admit with ease four of my fingers  the abbe who was the late guardian of these precious depots and of the gallery stole and disposed of antique idols gems etc and twentyfour pounds weight of pure gold the ornaments of columns etc of near the value of five thousand pounds to jew brokers he was taken tried and condemned to be hanged and embowelled yet after eight months imprisonment humanely pardoned but banished the grand dukes territories and is at this time said to serve as a private soldier in the neapolitan troops  the remarkable diamond that used to be shown here has been removed from the tribuna to the dukes private cabinet but an exact model made of yellowish glass now supplies the place of it the original according to tavernier weighs one hundred and forty carrats and was the largest diamond in europe till mr pit brought from the east indies a diamond which exceeded it which was sold to the regent of france and was the most costly and superb jewel belonging to that crown the sparks which fell from it in cutting produced him six thousand pounds and when cut besides its extraordinary weight of one hundred and fortyfour carrats was of a finer water than any diamond that could be produced whereas the florentine diamond is of a yellowish water the great duke is said to have bought his of a jesuit for   000 crowns but the father had an exorbitant profit having given only a single sixpence for it on the piazza di navona when it was offered to sale as a bit of crystal mr pit might have disposed of his diamond to much greater advantage had he not outstood his market with the king of poland who offered him  00000 dollars and the states of saxony were to give security for the payment of that sum by several payments within a few years mr pit insisted upon a million or    000l sterling and the treaty broke off to his great mortification for when the king of poland heard that the king of france had purchased the diamond he is said to have been dissatisfied with himself that he had not come into mr pitts terms whilst mr pit had this diamond about him he could hardly be said to be in safety and not being able to find a proper purchaser he at length sold it to the regent of france who was desirous of procuring it for the king and this famous diamond to this day goes by the appellation of le regent mr pit however was obliged to take by way of exchange several other jewels at the paris valuation and the bills which he received as ready money being immediately after involved in the fate of the mississippi bonds it is supposed that instead of the many millions of french livres which he thought himself sure of the most he got for his famous diamond was about  00000 dollars or about sixtyseven thousand pounds sterling  in a particular closet in the tribuna is seen a most rich and admirable studiolo or cabinet with fourteen beautiful pillars the shafts of which are of lapis lazuli but the pedestals and capital of solid gold enriched with pearl and turquoise this magnificent cabinet serves for keeping gems and intaglios the whole number of which in their several assortments amount to three thousand the cabinet and its contents are valued at sixty thousand crowns or about one hundred and twentyseven thousand pounds sterling  the assortment of gold coins consists of sixteen hundred medals and sixteen medaillons the largest of the latter weighs a hundred and sixteen louisdors and represents the emperor john paloeologus vii who assisted at the council of florence the whole collection is composed of fourteen thousand antique medals and eight thousand modern  the churches in florence amount to above one hundred and fifty and the convents to eightyseven besides twentytwo hospitals among such a multitude of religious edifices and in a country like this many of them must necessarily contain things worth notice  the cathedral of florence is a great gothic building incrusted on the outside with marble remarkable for nothing but its cupola which is said to have been copied by the architect of st peters at rome and for its size which is much greater than that of any other church in christendom the baptistery which stands by it was an ancient temple said to be dedicated to mars there are some good statues of white marble within and one or two of bronze on the outside of the doors but it is chiefly celebrated for the embossed work of its brass gates which m angelo used to say deserved to be made the gates of paradise it is in this place that all the children born in the city are baptized  near the cathedral is one of the most beautiful towers or steeples in the world it is square and the outside is incrusted with black red and white marble this structure is much admired for its symmetry and strength the ornaments are well imagined and the parts well disposed its height is two hundred and seventysix english feet there are four hundred and eight steps in the ascent and a noble view of the city from the top of the edifice  the chapel of st lorenzo says moore is perhaps the finest and most expensive habitation that ever was raised for the dead it is encrusted with precious stones and adorned by the workmanship of the best modern sculptors some complain that after all it has a gloomy appearance there seems to be no impropriety in that considering what the building was intended for addison has remarked that this chapel advanced so very slowly that it was not impossible but all the family of the medicis might be extinct before their burialplace was finished this has actually happened the medicis family is extinct and the chapel remains unfinished  the mercato nuovo is properly the exchange of florence where about noon the principal merchants meet to do business many of whom are of great families for here as in genoa commerce is not held to be in the least derogatory to nobility it is indeed the means of keeping up affluence and credit in families whereas in other parts and especially in germany many families are ruined or for a whole century or more remain in obscurity it is by commerce that even the ducal family has risen to that greatness in which they have maintained themselves above two hundred years cosmo de medicis who died in the year      had warehouses in the principal trading cities throughout the world and met with such peculiar good fortune that in the course of fiftyfour years he experienced no considerable losses by the failure of other merchants  the city is not fortified but on one side of the river arno there is a good citadel with five bastions and two forts but both in a very ruinous condition it is said to be six miles in circumference the city appears in its greatest brilliancy at the horseraces which are at the end of june  a particular part of the city noted for houses of ill fame was assigned by cosmo i to the jews for their particular quarter and an inscription at the entrance of the street observes that it was thought more advisable to permit the jews to remain in the neighborhood of christians that by their good example they might be brought to the easy yoke of christ than totally to expel them the reason here assigned is so just and commendable that it deserves to be adopted in other parts with regard to all sectaries  the environs of florence are delightful the plain in which the city stands being surrounded by charming hills well cultivated and adorned but though florence be thus in a kind of basin the warmth of the south and southeast winds is so well tempered by cooler ones that people may sleep abroad without danger the autumn here is generally wet and this city is a bad residence in winter on account of the southeast or sirocco and north winds which blow often on the same day and subject the inhabitants to inflammations in the breast and lungs florence therefore is best in summer when the atmosphere about it is esteemed very salubrious  it is said remarks keysler that few persons in florence are known to have the sense of seeing in perfection this some naturalists impute to the foggy moist air of the city but at this rate most of the inhabitants of mantua venice leyden amsterdam etc would have but little use of their eyes it is observable that places near the seacoast only are subject to such damp exhalations whereas florence stands high and on a dry soil and it is to the purity and salubrity of the air that the florentines themselves attribute the vivacity and penetration by which they boast that their countrymen have made such improvements in all the polite arts and sciences  without the city are two very fine palaces called poggio or villa imperiale and pratolino the former is but an italian mile from the city in a direct line from the porta romana with a stately avenue consisting of a double row of cypress and larch trees leading to it with beautiful vineyards convents and villas on each side  pratolino the other ducal palace is six italian miles distant from florence the gardens are beautifully fine with a variety of grand waterworks but the greatest curiosity is a colossal statue fronting the palace which is intended to signify the appennine mountain and is the work of john de bologna who has made the statue appear like a mountain itself the figure sits in an inclining posture as looking into a basin or pond just below it and from its prodigious long beard arms and other parts hang what look like icicles the only representation that stone could give of water falling from it the statue is composed of several great stones which look very coarse near the eye but have a noble effect at a distance the iris of each eye looks like a large glass bottle and one of the feet is nine english feet long to which all the other parts of the figure are equally proportionable  to conclude the city of florence is so beautiful that the emperor charles v said it was fit to be seen and shown only on holidays  view of the lake of nerne   chap vii of the cities of leghorn pisa and sienna leghorn is a neat well built city situated on a plain almost level with the sea forty miles west of florence and one hundred and fifty northwest of rome  the great wealth of tuscany and the true source of her power has been this famous port of leghorn or livorn as the italians call it which was obtained from the genoese in exchange for sarizana an episcopal city near lerici by cosmo i duke of tuscany  the country about it was formerly a morass or bog whose noxious streams infected the air but by the skill of sir robert dudley afterward created duke of northumberland the soil was rendered habitable the air more healthy and the port improved so as to become the best in italy by his advice also it was made a freeport that is the duties inward are very easy and there are no duties on exportation which have rendered it for more than a century the greatest magazine of the levant trade and has drawn thither merchants from all parts particularly jews and armenians of whom many reside there and have great privileges allowed them  the number of jews at leghorn is computed at eighteen thousand and this city is called their paradise for except living by themselves in one particular part of it be reckoned a hardship they enjoy all manner of freedom without any ignominious mark of distinction their trade which is already very great is continually increasing to the no small detriment of the christian merchants there is indeed an inquisition at leghorn but without exercising any power over the jews for it is limited to the spiritual conconcerns of those of its own communion the synagogue is large and well contrived with abundance of brass chandeliers in it for the work which must necessarily be done in their houses on the sabbath days the jews buy young moorish girls one of which according to her age and other circumstances may cost forty or fifty crowns  leghorn is said to contain forty thousand inhabitants including the jews but this calculation seems exaggerated for so small a city most of the streets are broad and strait the grand place larger says mrs piozzi than lincolns end fields makes a fine appearance from which two vistas extend through both the city gates the north part of this city is extremely well built and one quarter of it on account of its many canals for cleanliness and convenience of trade is called venice  pollnitz observes that this city is well built the streets broad strait and lightsome and that several have canals in them after the manner of dutch cities and that the ports are magnificent they have good hospitals for the poor and sick but none for those who are lame or past labor so that they have a multitude of beggars the public prostitutes have particular quarters assigned them and are under very strict regulations it is said they even maintain one of the galleys out of the taxes imposed on their profession the british factors who consist of about forty families constantly maintain a chaplain at leghorn and as the harbor is never without english dutch or danish vessels the protestants have always an opportunity of baptizing their children receiving the sacrament and performing the other rites of their church  on the quay near the galleys is a famous marble of the grand duke ferdinand i with four turkish slaves in bronze chained to the pedestal it is said these slaves were a father and his three sons who attempted to run away with one of the dukes galleys but were overtaken and put to death  the ramparts afford a very agreeable prospect of the sea and of many country seats on the landside the city is also well fortified having two forts toward the sea besides a citadel the number of guns in its several fortifications are at present about three hundred most of them brass and the garrison consists of six hundred men  on the left side of the harbor is a lazaretto insulated on every side and surrounded by wide ditches of running water here curiosity says grosley led me into an accident which might have been attended with bad consequences the general communication with all places of the levant often brings hither vessels actually infected or strongly suspected to be so the crews when only suspected are confined within the outward close of the lazaretto the inward area or close is for those actually infected of all which circumstances i was unacquainted when i went to visit the lazaretto which i did not reach without a great deal of trouble through a labyrinth of ditches and fortifications in the first close i met with people some of whom bowed and drew back making signs entrance to the port of leghorn to me at the same time not to come near them i entered the closeyard of the inner close without meeting with any repulse the wicket which is almost always guarded not happening to be so then as i was going up to the second wicket i saw a sentinel standing there who called out to me to keep off and on seeing me still advancing fell a skipping and making gesticulations like an idiot or one out of his senses on my offering him a buona mancia his gesticulations were still more extravagant than before so that imagining he was really out of his mind i thought it most prudent to retire and being that evening at an assembly in one of the principal familes at leghorn i related my disappointment the whole company shuddered at the relation and i was given to understand that if my clothes had in the least touched the wicket or those of the sentinel i must have been put in one of the cells of the inner ward and performed quarantine along with the infected of which it was the receptacle and that had i broke loose from the sentinel and attempted to run away his orders were to have fired at me and to have hit me where he could this is remarked by way of information against precipitate curiosity  leghorn has accidentally done what the greatest reach of politics would have found difficult to have brought about for it has almost depopulated pisa if we compare it to what it was formerly and it every day lessens the number of inhabitants even of florence it is true strangers pay little or no taxes directly at leghorn but out of every thing they buy there goes a large gabel to government addison says when he was there that the very icemerchant paid above one thousand pounds a year for his privilege and the tobacco merchant ten thousand pounds  this city is in reality the chief port on the mediterranean and many of the inhabitants speak english tolerably well about noon the merchants meet in a street adjoining to the square to negociate their respective concerns at which time many people of all nations are to be seen there as on the royal exchange at london  all degrees of people live here not only well but splendidly well notwithstanding the exactions of the grand duke for none can buy lands or houses here but he must pay eight per cent of their value to the duke none can hire or build a house without paying the tenth penny none can marry or even commence a suit in law without giving a fee to the duke and none can bring so much as an egg or sallad to market but the grand duke has some share in it  barks go daily from leghorn to pisa by a canal sixteen miles long this canal besides the great convenience it is of to trade serves as a drain to several morasses in winter indeed it is sometimes frozen the passage is only six sous but what makes it disagreeable is that the company is not always of the best sort the vessel is drawn along by men and takes up six hours in the passage the way by land is along a continued plain over several stone bridges across the canal which both fertilizes the soil and communicates a salubrity to the air by draining the morasses however leghorn is by no means to be ranked amongst the most healthy cities  pisa divided like florence by the arno over which it has three bridges is situated in a fine open country a magnificent broad quay on each side the river the cathedral baptistery leaning tower convents churches etc give it an air of grandeur in defiance of poverty and desolation  though it is a large city it has only fifteen thousand inhabitants and no commerce or manufactories it is interesting however to a stranger on account of the many learned men and the good society he will there find the markets are well supplied with provisions and fruit at a reasonable rate and house rent is extremely cheap it is to be preferred for a winter residence to most cities in italy for the mildness of its air but almost deserted in summer owing to the constant stagnation of vapors  there are some remarkable buildings in pisa as the duomo the architect of which was buschetto a greek who began it according to some accounts in  0   according to others in  0   it has many fine columns of porphyry granite jasper verd antique etc taken from ancient buildings the bronze gates are extremely curious  the companile or leaning tower was finished in      it is about one hundred and fifty feet high and near fifteen feet out of the perpendicular  the baptistery is said to have been built  00 years it is a large circular building with a high cupola all of white marble its echo is astonishing and in duration surpasses that of the simonetti seat near milan but the sound of the repercussions is not so clear  the university has an observatory furnished with good english instruments a botanic garden once very famous but now much neglected and a small musaeum which is modern and consists of birds fishes shells corals and fossils  the hotbaths are four miles out of the town they are handsome commodious and the price of lodgings and living is regulated at a moderate rate by government  this city was formerly a celebrated republic whose formidable fleets often signalized themselves against the saracens in the levant on the coast of africa and against the genoese but falling under the power of the florentines after the declension of their commerce by the opening of leghorn harbor scarce the shadow of its former grandeur now remains the number of inhabitants in the eleventh century were one hundred and fifty thousand the chief cause of the declension of this city was the loss of the immunities it enjoyed when a republic some business says busching is still carried on in it on account of its being the place where the galleys are built and the residence of the knights of the order of st stephen who have a palace and church of their own opposite a very fine square wherein stands a magnificent marble statue of cosmo i the exchange is a stately building but little business is transacted in it  pisa is remarkable for the imprisonment and death of count ugolino  in the civil wars between the gwelfs and gibbelins that desolated all italy in the fourteenth century there was scarce an ecclesiastic that did not take a decided part the gwelfs were for the pope the gibbelins for the emperor of germany count ugolino who was a violent partizan was through the artifices of the archbishop of pisa thrown into prison with his two sons and there starved to death the archbishop having thrown the keys into the river and fled from the city the punishment of the high priest is recorded by dante in his canto of hell see the plate  between the cathedral and the baptistery is the famous buryingground called campo santo from its being covered with earth brought from jerusalem it is an oblong square surrounded by a very high wall and always kept shut within is a spacious corridore round the space which is a noble walk for a contemplative philosopher the walls are painted in fresco by some eminent painters with subjects taken from the bible here are some deceptions in perspective equally ingenious and pleasing particularly the figures of certain animals which exhibit the same appearance from whatever different points of view they are seen one division of the buryingground consists of a particular compost which in nine days consumes the dead bodies to the bones in count ugolino and his two sons starved in prison all probability it is no other than common earth mixed with quicklime at one corner of the corridore there are pictures of three bodies represented in the three different stages of putrefaction which they undergo when laid in this composition at the end of the first three days the body is bloated and swelled and the features are enlarged and distorted to such a degree as fills the spectator with horror at the sixth day the swelling is subsided and all the muscular flesh hangs loosened from the bones at the ninth nothing but the skeleton remains  sienna a pretty large city lies upon three hills which render the streets very uneven but this is compensated by the beauty of the prospects and the great salubrity of the air it is about five miles in circuit the population amounts to about sixteen or seventeen thousand inhabitants it is thought that at sienna the italian language is spoken in its greatest purity and perfection on which account many foreigners reside in it till they have learnt the language  sienna says martyn in the midst of hills of the most pleasing shapes excellently cultivated is perhaps the most desirable place in italy for a stranger to pass some time in the climate being moderate living reasonable society good and the language spoken in the greatest purity it is also within a moderate distance both of rome and florence the houses are built with brick and the streets are paved with it  the piccolimini and zondadari palaces are by much the best all the others being but meanly built although the many towers erected on private houses on account of the feuds between the gwelfs and gibbelins give the town a grand appearance at a distance  sienna is particularly agreeable in the hot months on account of its lofty situation and fine air it has produced many famous painters architects and poets the nobility are as distinguished as any in italy and have a cassino or assembly of both sexes the women says keysler are beautiful and have more freedom than in many other parts of italy the magistracy consists of a governor and senate of nine persons called excelsi whose president is styled capitaneo de populo they flatter themselves with retaining a kind of liberty in their election but this is only an external show for the senate can take no measure of any consequence without permission of the grand duke  of its curiosities there is nothing in this city so extraordinary says addison as the cathedral which a man may view with pleasure after he has seen st peters at rome though it is quite of another make and can only be looked upon as one of the masterpieces of gothic architecture the materials are rich the workmanship most elaborate and the ornaments exquisitely nice in the gothic way the very spouts are loaded with ornaments the windows are formed like so many scenes of perspective with a multitude of little pillars retiring one behind another the great columns are finely engraven with fruits and foliage from the very top to the bottom and the whole body of the church is chequered with different lays of white and black marble the pavement curiously cut out in designs and scripturestories and the front covered with such a variety of figures and overrun with so many little mazes and labyrinths of sculpture that nothing in the world can make a prettier show to those who prefer false beauties and affected ornaments to a noble and majestic simplicity in this church are the busts of one hundred and seventy popes in plaster of paris six who were natives of this city and the twelve apostles are honored with marble statues  near the cathedral is the archbishops palace and opposite to it a large and wellendowed hospital founded by a shoemaker there is a figure of him superscribed suitor ultra crepidam the shoemaker beyond his last the university which was founded by charles v is in a declining condition the german students enjoy particular privileges granted to them by the same emperor  the franciscan church here abounds in fine painting in the conventgarden is an evergreen oak said to have sprung from st franciss staff which was here stuck in the ground spon in his travels through greece mentions a large wild cherrytree near the old castle at smyrna which is believed by such of the inhabitants as are of the greek church to have been instantaneously produced from the staff of s polycarp in like manner hercules club which was an olive tree is said by the ancients to have taken root and become a flourishing tree  the territory of sienna and that part of tuscany between sienna and florence present the traveller coming from rome with a new heaven and a new earth the towns the villages and the farms besides their number are better peopled than in the ecclesiastical state the lands are better cultivated the men more robust and in their whole carriage show that cheerfulness alacrity and vigor which accompany case and plenty and are not damped and extinguished by distress in the very peasants are to be seen those significant physiognomies which completely answer the pictures of dante boccace machiavel etc to this improvement and extent of cultivation is certainly to be attributed the serenity of the sky which is not clogged here with the fuliginous vapors exhaled from the wastes of the ecclesiastical state  chap viii person character dress customs and manners of the people that sensibility of heart which has long made the tuscans enamoured with poetry says baretti has totally worn out the ferocity for which they were so remarkable in the brutal times of the guelfs and gibbelines and has brought them to be perhaps the most gentle and amiable nation now extant those times may well be called brutal when we recollect what is recorded in the history of pisa of count ugolino and his two sons this character of gentleness is indeed easily to be perceived by any traveller as soon as he reaches the highest tops of the appennines where all strangers are treated with the softest urbanity by those mountaineers who to the simplicity natural to all inhabitants of extensive ridges of hills join the most obliging expressions and the most respectful manners and a traveller must be very peevish and illhumoured who is not satisfied with the rustic benevolence of the tuscans as he goes descending toward florence where even the customhouse officers treat him with the greatest civility asking the usual questions with their hats off visiting his baggage without throwing every thing topsyturvy and modestly thanking him for any small coin slipped into their hands as a reward for their discretion  the people here says howell seem in general to be more courteous and of a higher comportment than elsewhere they are allowed to be inimitable in making repartees or telling stories with a good grace  the peasants are tall and wellmade the women remarkably handsome and very fair they are extremely clean and welldressed and on sundays and holidays their hair is nicely and becomingly adjusted and ornamented with a very small hat elegantly trimmed and worn just above the left ear and on the other side a mat of flowers is often interwoven with strings of pearl they wear earrings of five or seven drops of pearl set in gold and necklaces composed of several rows of the same when at work or when they bring their goods to market their hair is confined by a silk net of crimson scarlet or blue silk and tied by two strings ornamented with tassels which are frequently of gold or silver they do not wear gowns but a kind of jacket without sleeves they have no other covering for the upper part of the arm but their shift sleeves which are tied with ribband their petticoats are generally of a scarlet color and above one ear they fix their little straw hat the whole of which dress gives them a more gay smart coquetish air says moore than any country girls i ever saw  the italians in general are the greatest loungers in the world and while walking in the fields or stretched in the shade seem to enjoy the serenity and genial warmth of their climate with a degree of luxurious indulgence peculiar to themselves without ever running into the daring excesses of the english or displaying the frisky vivacity of the french or the invincible phlegm of the germans they discover a species of sedate sensibility to every source of enjoyment from which perhaps they derive a greater degree of happiness than any of the other the frequent processions and religious ceremonies besides amusing and comforting them serve to fill up their time and prevent that ennui and those immoral practices which are apt to accompany poverty and idleness it is necessary for the quiet and happiness of every community that the populace be employed some politicians imagine that their whole time should be spent in gainful industry others think that though the riches of the state will not be augmented yet the general happiness which is a more important object will be promoted by blending the occupation of industry with a considerable proportion of such superstitious ceremonies as awaken the future hopes without lulling the present benevolence of the multitude  in all the great cities of italy says sharp several shops are shut up from twelve to half after one or longer so sacred is the ceremony of dining even servants insist on this privilege to a degree truly ridiculous an english gentleman not apprized of this custom upon his first arrival in italy possibly calls for his servant when the man is just set down to dine but if he calls twenty times he receives no other answer than that he is at dinner a tavola signore at table sir which every italian servant supposes to be a sufficient reason that his master should wait though the business were ever so pressing  society says moore seems to be on an easy and agreeable footing in florence besides the conversazioni which they have here as in other towns of italy a number of the nobility meet every day at a house called the casino this society is pretty much on the same footing with the clubs in london the members are elected by ballot meet at no particular hour but go when it is convenient they play at billiards cards and other games or continue conversing the whole evening as they think proper they are served with tea coffee lemonade ices or what other refreshments they choose and each person pays for what he calls for there is one material difference between this and the english clubs viz that women as well as men are admitted members  the company of both sexes behave with more frankness and familiarity to strangers as well as to each other than is customary at public assemblies in other parts of italy  the opera of florence is a place where the people of quality pay and receive visits and converse as freely as at the casino this occasions a continual passing and repassing to and from the boxes except in those where there is a party of cards formed it is then looked upon as a piece of illmanners to disturb the players i was never more surprised says the above writer than when it was proposed to me to make one of a whist party in a box which seemed to have been made for the purpose with a little table in the middle i hinted that it would be full as convenient to have the party somewhere else but i was told good music added greatly to the pleasure of a whist party that it increased the joy of good fortune and soothed the affliction of bad as i thought the people of this country better acquainted with the power of music than myself i contested the point no longer but generally played two or three rubbers at whist in the stagebox every opera night  hence it may be perceived that in this city as in some other towns in italy little attention is paid to the music by the company in the boxes except at some new opera or during some favorite air but the dancers command a general attention as soon as they begin conversation ceases even the cardplayers lay down their cards and fix their eyes on the ballet yet the excellence of italian dancing consists in feats of strength and a kind of jerking agility more than in graceful movement there is a continual contest among the performers who shall spring highest none of the sprightly alluring gaiety of the french comicdancers is to be seen here nor of the graceful attitudes and smooth flowing motions of the performers in the serious opera at paris  on the evenings on which there is no opera it is usual for genteel company to drive to a public walk immediately without the city where they remain till it begins to grow duskish some riding in coaches and others walking it is not customary to see married people together in their excursions but the husband in a coach with another lady and the wife with another gentleman when ladies walk their footmen go before and in their coaches they are very polite and often bow first especially to strangers it is not unusual to see a large fellow fanning himself and fine women riding astride as also to see a score of boys coming from school with books under their arms and swords by their sides persons of every profession even to the valet may wear a sword but physicians are obliged to drive their chariots with a single horse  at all the houses of the nobles in florence is an empty cask hanging out to denote they sell wine by retail this custom shocks an englishman as very derogatory to their dignity and he cannot but speak of it with surprise a florentine cooly and sensibly answers sir your duke of  by the interposition of his steward sells a tree for ten shillings a florentine noble by his porter at the door sells ten shillings worth of wine but our noble appears no more in the sale of his wine than your duke in the sale of his tree different countries have their different modes the fact is that great part of the rent of estates in italy is paid in kind which joined with a certain exemption from the duty on wine granted to nobles has led them into this seeming littleness  i was at a most elegant concert says sharp during my stay in florence given by the lucchese envoy the custom on this occasion is to calculate the number of persons the room will hold and to invite accordingly but ladies only are invited it is computed that cards sent to twenty or twentysix ladies will bring near fourscore gentlemen and the number at this assembly answered to that calculation the greatest disproportion between the number of ladies at the italian conversazioni and the london routs is very striking to an englishman but the phenomenon admits of an easy solution no single ladies visit in italy all who are seen in the world are married women if a gentleman here has three sons and three daughters two of the daughters are most probably in a convent whilst all the three sons at least two of them have nothing else to do than frequent the spectacles and the conversazioni  in florence adds sharp the generality of ladies have their cicisbeos the first is the cicisbeo of dignity the second is the cicisbeo who picks up the glove gives the fan and pulls off or puts on the cloak etc the third cicisbeo is by the wags deemed the substantial cicisbeo or lover  but god knows how these matters go says sharp for in public the ladies behave with so much modesty and with so much decorum that one would be tempted to treat some of these reports as mere calumny were not the truth of them so notorious in fact the universality of the vice has in a manner divested it of the appearance of vice in england a woman who is publicly criminal usually becomes profligate and abandoned here almost every woman of however virtuous a disposition falls into the general custom and is equally criminal with the woman of loose principles so that the distinction of good and bad that is of chaste and dissolute is hardly known in italy says sharp in a word it is the mode the etiquette the bon ton of the fine people  baretti is extremely enraged with the above writer for these sarcasms thrown out against his countrywomen moore likewise endeavored to palliate this singular custom of the italian ladies having cicisbeos to attend them every where by observing that the italians finding that the confinement of their wives which was a plan they formerly adopted was universally reprobated and that any appearance of jealousy likewise subjected them to ridicule agreed that their wives should go with company and attend public places but always escorted by a friend whom they could trust and who at the same time should not be disagreeable to the wife this compromise could not fail of being acceptable to the women who plainly perceived they must be gainers by any alteration of the former system and it soon became universal all ovet italy for a woman to appear at public places leaning on the arms of a man who from their frequent whispering together was called her cicisbeo it was stipulated at the same time that the lady while abroad under his care should converse with no other man but in his presence and with his approbation he was to be her guardian her friend and her gentleman usher  the custom at present is that this obsequious gentleman visits the lady every forenoon at her toilet where the plan for passing the evening is agreed upon he disappears before dinner for it is usual all over italy for the husband and wife to dine teteatete except on great occasions as when there is a public feast after dinner the husband retires and the cicisbeo returns and conducts the lady to the public walk the conversazioni or the opera he hands her about wherever she goes presents her coffee sorts her cards and attends with the most pointed assiduity till the amusements of the evening are over he accompanies her home and delivers up his charge to the husband who is then supposed to resume his functions  from the nature of this connection it could not be an easy matter to find a cicisbeo who would be equally agreeable to the husband and wife at the beginning of the institution the husbands it is said preferred the platonic swains who professed only the metaphysics of love and whose lectures they imagined might refine their wives ideas and bring them to the same way of thinking in many instances no doubt it would happen that the platonic admirer acted with less seraphic ends but these instances serve only as proofs that the husbands were mistaken in their men for however absurd it may appear in the eyes of some people to imagine that the husbands believe it is only a platonic connection which subsists between their wives and the cicisbeos it is still more absurd to believe as some strangers who have passed through this country seem to have done that this whole system of cicisbeism was from the beginning and is now an universal system of adultery connived at by every italian husband to get clear of one difficulty those gentlemen fall into another much more inexplicable by supposing that the men who of all the inhabitants of europe were the most scrupulous with regard to their wives chastity should acquiesce in and in a manner become subservient to their prostitution  the cicisbeo in many instances is a poor relation or a humble friend who not being in circumstances to support an equipage is happy to be admitted into all the societies and to be carried about to public diversions as an appendage to the lady there are numbers of these gentlemen whose appearance and bodily infirmities carried the clearest refutation with respect to themselves personally of the scandalous stories of an improper connection between them and their mistresses the humble and timid air which many of them betray in the presence of the ladies and the perseverance with which they continue their services notwithstanding the contemptuous style in which they are often treated is equally unlike the haughtiness natural to favored lovers and the indifference of men satiated with enjoyment  there are it must be confessed cicisbeos of a very different stamp whose figure and manners might be supposed more agreeable to the ladies they serve than to their lords i once expressed my surprise says moore that a particular person permitted one of this description to attend his wife i was told by way of solution of my difficulty that the husband was poor and the cicisbeo rich it is not in italy alone where infamous connections of this kind take place  i have also known instances where the characters of the ladies were so well established as not to be shaken either in the opinion of their acquaintances or husbands although their gallants were in every respect agreeable and accomplished  but whether the connection be supposed innocent or criminal most englishmen will be astonished how men can pass so much of their time with women this will appear less surprising when they recollect that the italian nobility dare not intermeddle with politics can find no employment in the army or navy and that there are no such amusements as hunting or drinking in such a situation if a man of fortune has no turn to gaming what must he do even an englishman in these desperate circumstances might be driven to the company and conversation of women to lighten the burden of time the italians have persevered so long in this expedient that however extraordinary it may seem to those who never tried it there can be no doubt but they find it to succeed they assert that nothing so effectually soothes the cares and beguiles the tediousness of life as the company of an agreeable woman that though the intimacy should never exceed the limits of friendship there is something more flattering and more agreeable in it than in male friendship that they find the female heart more sincere less interested and warmer in its attachments and that women in general have more delicacy than men but it may be replied that a man can enjoy all these advantages to as great perfection by an intimacy and friendship with his own wife as with his neighbors non monsieur point no sir by no means answered a frenchman to whom this question was once addressed et pourquoi done parceque cela nest pas permis and why not  because it is not the fashion this does not seem a very satisfactory answer to so pertinent a question it is however the only answer to be obtained all over italy  this system is however unknown to the middle and lower ranks they pass their time in the exercise of their professions and in the society of their wives and children as in other countries and in that sphere of life jealousy which formed so strong a feature in the italian character is still to be found as strong as ever he who attempts to visit the wife or mistress of any of the tradespeople without their permission is in no small danger of a coltellata is has often been asserted that italian women have remarkable powers of attracting their lovers those powers whatever they are do not seem to depend entirely on personal charms as many of them retain their influence after their beauty is much in the vane and they themselves considerably advanced in years i know says moore an italian nobleman of great fortune who has been lately married to a very beautiful young woman and yet continues his assiduity to his former mistress now an old woman as punctual as ever  whatever satisfaction the italians find in this kind of constancy and in their friendly attachments to one woman my friend the marquis de f  says moore told me when i saw him at paris that he had tried it while he remained at rome and found it quite intolerable a certain obliging ecclesiastic had taken the trouble at the earnest request of a lady of that city to arrange matters between her and the marquis who was put into immediate possession of all the rights that were ever supposed to belong to a cicisbeo the woman detested her husband which had advanced matters considerably and her passion for the marquis was in proportion to her abhorrence of the other in this state things had remained but a very short time when the marquis called one afternoon to drive the abbe out a little way into the country but he happened to have just dined the meals of this ecclesiastic were generally oppressive for two or three hours after they were finished he therefore declined the invitation saying by way of apology je suis dans les horreurs de la digestion i am in all the horrors of digestion he then enquired how the marquiss amor went on with the lady ah pour lamour cela est a peu pres pass replied the marquis and nous sommes actuellement dans les horreurs de lamitie oh as for love that is past says the marquis and we are now in all the horrors of friendship  the lower people in italy who have bread enough spend more than would easily be credited in wine though neither their abilities nor the example of their betters lead them into drunkenness they have a notion that it is wholesome and therefore give it to their children at the breast some of the florentine nobles allow their menservants seven or eight shillings a month for this article only rather than furnish them with it which they always spend  as to their table says grosley i have often heard people with a sneer extol the florentine suppers which say they consist of a few sallad leaves gathered by the guests themselves from pots standing at the window and garnished with a little wild endive i have however dined at some houses in florence where besides plenty and goodness every thing was served up extremely neat the wine excellent and what improved the relish of the whole was that festivity inherent in the florentines i must further add that in the whole course of my travels i never found an inn where we fared so well were so well attended and the bills so reasonable as at florence an evident proof of the plenty and superabundance of provisions  the palaces of the nobles in florence are very large indeed they are of such extent that usually only one floor is occupied at the same time during winter they inhabit the upper apartments and in summer reside entirely on the groundfloor a most agreeable piece of luxury in the northern parts of italy which are of such opposite degrees of heat and cold in the two seasons houserent is very cheap in florence  the lake of nemi the author having been presented with a beautiful drawing of the lake of nemi too late to insert in its place the description of that part of italy having been printed is unwilling to lose the opportunity of giving it to his readers and he trusts they will excuse the insertion of it here the description is from addisons travels  in our excursion to albano we went says he as far as nemi that takes its name from the nemus dianoe or wood of diana the whole country round is still overrun with woods and thickets the lake of nemi lies in a deep bottom so surrounded on all sides with mountains and groves that its surface is never ruffled with the least breath of wind which perhaps with the clearness of its water gave it formerly the name of dianas looking glass  prince coesarini has a palace at jensano very near nemi in a pleasant situation and embellished with many beautiful walks  there is nothing at albano so remarkable as the capuchins garden which for the extent and variety of pleasing incidents is the most delightful i ever saw it takes in the whole campania of rome and terminates in a full view of the mediterranean  this place is in the popes territories  chap ix of their amusements arts literature commerce etc on every twentyfourth of june they have a horse and chariot race in this city in imitation of the ancients and as a festivity in honor of st john the baptist the tutelar saint of florence it is exhibited in the great square which is surrounded by guards to keep off the mob the horses start without riders and run full two miles through the streets from the gate called del prato to that called santa croce the streets are covered with sand on this occasion and the horses have a round machine something like a ball hanging down their sides by strings with small iron pricks in it as sharp as the point of a lancet so that the faster they run the more they spur themselves they start for a piece of velvet of about thirty pounds value and run with incredible speed before these races begin the principal nobility and gentry parade the streets in their finest equipages their coaches are prodigiously grand finely carved and richly gilt with glass all around them they go down on one side of the street and up the other for two hours meeting and saluting one another the ladies make a most brilliant and charming appearance as they are generally beautiful and richly dressed when the horses are ready to start notice is given by sound of trumpet for the coaches to quit the street then the quality go into houses most of which have balconies covered with tapestry some with fine damask and others with velvet which renders the street from one end to the other extremely pleasant and gay  the carnival is also a time of great diversion among the florentines who are then generally masked and assemble in the afternoon in the square of santa croce which is railed in sometimes to the number of ten thousand masks and upwards richly dressed in all kinds of characters but no priest dares to be present at these diversions in mask for fear of the inquisition while these diversions pass within the rails others are going forward on the outside either in coaches or cars some of which are full of musicians who sit on benches as in our orchestra dressed in the most whimsical grotesque manner and play a variety of tunes on different instruments the drivers and even their horses are all in masquerade so that it is impossible to conceive the gaiety of this carnival which continues about three weeks or a month but sundays are the greatest days for these diversions which end when lent begins  corpus christi day is also a grand festival at florence when the clergy go in solemn procession to the cathedral the different orders of monks are then dressed in long sashes and each person carries a lighted torch in his hand through the streets which are strewed with flowers and leaves of evergreen above one thousand of them walk two and two in this procession according to their seniority some of whom have silver candlesticks near five feet high with large wax candles lighted carrying before them the priests follow next in great numbers then the clergy belonging to the cathedral after these come the canons who are chiefly of the nobility some with purple and scarlet cloaks others with fine pieces of camel skins hanging loose on their shoulders these are succeeded by the dignified clergy after whom follows the archbishop of florence under a magnificent canopy with the host in his hand attended by the nobility and gentry all bare headed and each carrying a lighted flambeau with their servants by their side these are followed by the guards bareheaded and they are succeeded by the magistrates in their robes this procession begins about six in the morning and continues passing by till noon through several streets covered on the tops with canvas to make an agreeable shade  it is but little more than three centuries since that part of italy which lies between the tyrrhene sea and the highest mountains of the apennines was divided into eight or nine small republican states each so jealous of the rest that they were continually making war upon each other with as much fury as the paucity of their troops would admit  their dissentions proved fatal to their liberty being all reduced under the the dominion of the grand duke of tuscany except the little territory of lucca the tuscans in that divided and republican state were a most ferocious and brutal people but having lost that which in the common language of politicians has long been honored with the name of liberty thought as they enjoyed it by no means deserving of that respectable appellation the inclinations and manners of the tuscans underwent a happy change arts and literature were the only occupations in which under their new form of government they could find full employment for their busy and restless minds they turned to them on a sudden and with such eagerness that soon forced mankind to look upon them as the only people in europe fit to be their teacher  on seeing literature and arts thus happily revived in tuscany several of the greatest among the sovereigns of europe became sensible of their efficacy toward polishing the human species and were desirous of having them introduced into their respective dominions  to obtain this laudable end several of the french monarchs invited many of the most celebrated artists and men of letters from florence and other parts of tuscany and encouraged them with such liberality that in a little time they were able to produce a very remarkable change in the manners of that nation till then addicted to almost nothing but barbarous gallantry and the destructive art of war thus tuscany was the mistress of politeness to france and this little province may justly boast of having produced and nearly at one time a greater number of extraordinary men than any says baretti of the most extensive european dominions  the good effects produced in tuscany by the cultivation of arts and literature continue to this time it is true the tuscans are inferior to their forefathers in many respects and particularly in the polite arts but where is the modern nation whose artists can claim any equality with michael angelo c lionardo donatello cellini and other ingenious men of that age yet the tuscans are still possessed of as much skill and taste in those arts as any other modern nations as the accounts given by almost all travelers of the elegance of their buildings furniture and general mode of living attest add to this the many tuscan artists to be met with in the different capitals on the continent and particularly in london as to their academical accomplishments those who have taken the trouble to read the writings of gori cocchi lami perelli and other modern tuscan writers must allow that florence is entitled to as much literary fame as any town in europe of equal dimensions  among the general characteristics of the florentines is their love of poetry and their custom of improvisare or singing verse ex tempore to the guitar or any other musical instruments  both these qualities in them are of very ancient date the tuscans were smitten by the charms of poetry to a greater degree than any other people as soon as their language began to be turned toward verse one of our novellists remarks the above writer says that the common people of florence used to sing the poem of dante about the streets during the life of that poet whom we justly consider as our first poetic writer it appears besides that the ancient odes songs etc collected by lasca were chiefly composed by people of the lowest class in tuscany such as shoemakers carpenters cobblers barbers etc  having now spoken of their literature we shall give a striking anecdote of their ignorance and superstition extracted from sharp who avers it to be fact madame minorbetti a woman of distinction at florence gave occasion from her name says this writer to one of the most ridiculous events that ever fell within my knowledge and which would put to the blush some of the curious greek etymologies we are entertained with in the posthumous works of dean swift he asserts for the honor of great britain that many of those names which we call greek are derived from the english language and by corruption have attained the cast of the greek language for example he says  andromache is a corruption of the scotch name andrew mackay archimedes of hark ye maids etc etc it seems a relation of madame minorbetti in the agonies of death was desirous to have a famous relic in florence no less than an arm of our archbishop becket brought to his bedside from a persuasion he should be restored to health by its miraculous influence the monk in whose possession the arm is rejected the petition and pleaded the impossibility of carrying it beyond the precincts of the convent the relations on the other hand urged that they were descended from the family of the beckets and therefore that such usage might be dispensed with the argument was admitted to be good and the monk only demanded a proof of the consanguinity which was demonstrated in the following manner  a bishop said they in england is always called milor my lord which easily in italian is corrupted into minor then becket as easily degenerates into betti so that milorbecket naturally becomes minorbetti this notable argument was deemed so valid that the relic was brought out of the convent to the sick man  among instances of foreign barbarism the florentines make themselves very merry with the behavior of the confessor of don carlos at the door of the medicean library this confessor attended the young prince when he went to take possession of the tuscan dominions being the only person in the suite the cut of whose garment promised any scholarship the librarian concluding he must long to see one of the most spendid monuments which the munificence of princes ever dedicated to literature immediately waited on him with a very respectful invitation he received the compliment tolerably well and a day was fixed the director of the library had collected all the most eminent literati in florence and the confessor after partaking of a very elegant collation moved toward the library followed by this respectable company on coming to the door he stopped and after gazing about him for an instant called out to the director mr librarian have you got the the book of the seven trumpets here the director said he had not and the whole company with some confusion owned they had never heard of such a book well then said the confessor turning back your whole library is not worth a pipe of tobacco no time was lost to get an account of this book which was found to be a collection of pious stories put into spanish for the use of the lowest of the common people in spain  in the most flourishing aeras of the republic commerce banking and industry were the nurture and support of the nobility cosmo de medicis became the principal man in the state because he was the principal merchant and banker of florence if not of all europe peter his son and laurence his grandson continued commerce and banking all the public and private edifices of any celebrity were erected by merchants and the greater part by persons in the woollen trade to this manufacture the republic of florence chiefly owed its grandeur the names of the commercial houses at the head of the paper linen wood tile cheese and coal trades still subsist  commerce at florence is now reduced to a very low ebb in comparison to what it was formerly the woollen manufacture in particular scarce supplies the common people as to all the fine cloth it is imported from england  of silk tuscany produces an immense quantity which though of such superior quality is exported raw the regency however to keep such a valuable commodity in the country and thereby encourage industry have prohibited its exportation accordingly former manufacturers are reviving and new ones setting up all exports of this kind such as sattins damasks velvets are well executed the colors fine and the patterns elegant and drawn with taste  jewelry and porcelain the manufactories of which have continued in tuscany from the ancient etruscans and intagliatas employ a considerable number of hands though they can scarce be accounted branches of commerce  dying was formerly carried on to a very great extent as the territory of tuscany produces a plant said to be a good substitute for indigo and which might easily be fown in such quantities as to make a considerable article of exportation  the wine all round florence is in great request all over italy it is both stomachic and light and thus unites the generosum and lene which was its great recommendation to the ancients  among the many excellent regulations which owe either their origin or improvement to this country we have omitted financing the importance and advantages of which must be estimated by the brilliant and solid fortunes gained by it and not from the calamity of the countries which have been the theater of its speculations  this science with which the more northern countries are little acquainted was for a long time cultivated by the florentines who managed it with all that dexterity and address for which they were distinguished in commerce it was one of the principal resources in the last struggles for liberty in the years    0 and      those who followed the fortunes of catherine de medicis into france finding the country fallow began tilling it with financing which lasted during part of the reign of lewis xiii the chief contractors were florentines either such as had quitted their country or still kept an establishment at florence the very terms in financing bespeak the country from whence they originated most of them being borrowed from the italian  the grand dukes ordinary income is computed at three millions of piasters a year in      it was reresolved that in future the entire military force of this great duchy should consist only of three regiments of foot and one of dragoons of five hundred men in      another regiment of dragoons was added and the militia was formed into regiments but the great duke is said in case of necessity to be able to bring into the field  0000 men and to fit out twenty ships of war twelve galleys and some cutters  of this duchy the chief officer at present is a governor appointed by the great duke he resides at florence where is also a council of regency the military board and other officers of state  chap ix republic of saint marino this small state enclosed by romagna and urbino is under the popes protection it has already lasted near fourteen centuries and is said to have its origin in the following manner marino a dalmatian by birth and a mason by trade betook himself to a lonely mountain here where his austere and solitary life gained him such a character for sanctity that the princess of the country made him a present of the country to dispose of it at his own discretion this reputation quickly peopled it and gave rise to the republic which calls itself after his name so that the common wealth of marino may boast at least of a nobler origin than that of rome the one at first having been an asylum for robbers and murderers and the other the resort of persons eminent for their piety and devotion the best of their churches is dedicated to the saint and holds his ashes his statue stands over the high altar with the figure of a mountain in his hands which is also the arms of the common wealth they attribute to his protection the long duration of their state and look on him as the greatest saint next the blessed virgin in their statutebook they have enacted a law against such as speak disrepectfully of him who are to be punished in the same manner as those convicted of blasphemy  the town and republic of saint marino stands on the top of a very high and craggy mountain it is generally hid among the clouds there is not a spring or fountain in the whole dominions but they are always well provided with large cisterns and reservoirs of rain and snowwater  this mountain and a few neighboring hillocks that lie scattered about the bottom of it is the whole circuit of their dominions they have what they call three castles three convents and five churches and reckon about five thousand inhabitants in their community  the people are divided into three classes nobles citizens and peasants the council of state is formed from all three twenty chosen from each who act for life every six months they elect two chiefs to preside called captains who are invested with such a power as the old roman consuls had but the office is never to be continued to the same persons turn successively the one is taken from the nobles the other from the city or country there is no superiority between them or distinction but in the noblemans taking the right hand the third officer is the commissary who judges in all civil and criminal matters he is allowed the fine which those persons are obliged to pay who are found culpable before him by the council or jury because the many alliances friendships and intermarriages as well as the personal feuds and animosities that happen among so small a people might obstruct the court of justice if one of their own number had the distribution of it they have always a foreigner for this employ whom they choose for three years and maintain out of the public stock he must be a doctor of law and a man of known integrity he is joined in commission with the two captains or chiefs and acts something like the recorder of london under the lord mayor  the physician is the fourth man in the state and is allowed  00 crowns a year he is obliged to keep a horse visit the sick and inspect all the drugs that are imported he must be at least thirtyfive years old a doctor of the faculty and eminent for his religion and honesty that his rashness or ignorance may not unpeople the commonwealth and that they may not long suffer under a bad choice he also is elected only for three years  another person who makes no ordinary figure in the republic is the schoolmaster and scarce any of the inhabitants are to be met with who have not some tincture of learning  no clergy are admitted into their government and once a year three young women are given in marriage with a fortune of thirtythree crowns each  no execution says northall had ever been remembered here by the person who gave me an account of the place though he was one of the nobles and upwards of fifty years of age so that addison justly observes that the people are esteemed very honest and vigorous in the execution of justice and seem to live more happy and contented among their rocks and snows than the rest of the italians in the pleasantest valleys of italy nothing can be a greater instance of the love mankind have for liberty and their aversion to arbitrary government than to see such a savage mountain covered with people and the campagna of rome almost destitute of inhabitants  map of the republic of venice with the surrounding states map of venice  a description of the territories of venice from bushing moore keysler northall millar piozzi martin baretti grosley and others chap i country climate the venetian territories in italy are bounded by the country of the grisons by trent and the province of tyrol toward the north by carniola and the gulf of venice to the east by mantua and ferrara to the south and by the duchy of milan to the west being about   0 miles in extent from east to west an hundred in breadth toward the east end but scarce half that breadth toward the western extremity they are situated in thirteen degrees of east longitude and fortyfive degrees of north latitude  the islands on which the city of venice stands were formerly subject to padua the goths and other northen people invading italy in the fifth century the inhabitants of padua aquileia and other cities on the continent fled thither for shelter and formed a republic  the venetians soon became very rich and powerful having by their industry engrossed most of the levant trade from alexandria and the ports of asia they also brought all the rich merchandise of india and the eastern nations and distributed them all over europe they were then in a manner sovereigns of the mediterranean as well as the adriatic seas they possessed the morea the islands of the archipelago and the levant they subdued great part of italy north of the po and in conjunction with the french reduced the city of constantinople and several other places on the coasts of asia and europe but upon the portuguese discovering the way to india by the cape of good hope their trade and consequently their wealth and power declined they lost most of the grecian islands and likewise their territories on the continent of italy but the latter they recovered the morea was taken from them in      in a single campaign they however still retain istria morlachia the seacoast of dalmatia and the adjacent islands besides the paduan veronese and other territories in italy of all which we shall treat in their proper order beginning with those in italy  some writers have divided the venetian territories exclusive of the islands of corfu and in the mediteranean into five provinces the duchy of venice comprehending the capital and its adjacent little islands venetian lombardy la marca trevigiana one of the richest spots in italy the duchy of friuli and istria on the adriatic the venetians are also in possession of some fiefs in the kingdom of the two sicilies and the general population is estimated at near three million of inhabitants  the principal islands at present in their possession are corfu zant and cephalonia the former of which is calculated to have about fifty thousand inhabitants the other islands in the mediterranean contain about as many more  the venetian territories in italy being part of ancient lombardy there cannot be a finer climate nor better air if we except those parts adjoining to the seacoast the only sea which belongs to the venetians is the adriatic or venetian gulf as it is otherwise termed at the bottom of which lies the capital the tide ebbs and flows regularly twice in four and twenty hours rising about four feet at high water nor if we may credit addison are they in the least apprehensive that the sea will leave their coast which some writers have asserted and that venice would in time become united to the continent there is no part of italy where fish is so abundant as in the gulf of venice  the sea and neighboring rivers says keysler furnish the venetian tables at the proper seasons of the year with no less than seventyseven different kinds of fish several of which are peculiar to these parts  the principal rivers are the po the piava the adige the sila and the brenta all which fall into the adriatic this country is also well watered with lakes the principal of which are the lake de garda being about thirtyfive miles in length and twelve in breadth and the isco fifteen miles in length and three in breadth  the country in general is level and as fertile as any part of italy it abounds in arable and pasture land in vineyards and plantations of mulberries the road between verona and padua is very pleasant being planted with great quantities of white mulberrytrees in squares the leaves of which not only furnish food for their silk worms and the mulberries food for their poultry and hogs but the branches likewise serve to support the vines which hang like garlands from tree to tree and within the enclosures are fields of corn which in these hot countries ripen much better within the shades of the mulberry trees than if they were exposed to the sun  there are also great quantities of cattle of all kinds which travelers remark are in general either gray or white but that their hogs are usually black and their flesh much sweeter and better tasted than in france or england this is supposed to be owing to their food as they are fed chiefly with truffles which are a delicious root they are also fed with the husks of grapes newly pressed chestnuts mulberries etc the padua sheep are said to afford wool little inferior to that of england and there is no country where there is such plenty of fowls and all manner of game as in the territories of venice  the venetian territories says beaufort are in general equally fertile with the most cultivated parts of italy in some parts agriculture is carried to its highest pitch of perfection there are however some marshes and uncultivated land in the districts of verona istria friuli and especially in dalmatia the greatest part of which is little better than a desert it is owing to this circumstance that a scarcity of corn is generally felt every four or five years in ordinary years all kinds of corn grows in great abundance especially maize which is the principal subsistence of the common people wine culinary herbs and fruits are almost always produced in great abundance with respect to corn though the continent scarce furnishes enough for its own consumption istria dalmatia and the venetian levant grow such large quantities that a great deal is exported several of the districts produce very fine hemp and flax the islands of the levant abound with corinthian grapes albania produces tobacco of the very best quality a great deal is likewise brought from sclavonia and from turkey the silk that is produced in lombardy likewise helps to support all the manufactures of the country the mines of bergamo and brescia are also a great source of wealth  chap ii cities venice in latin venetia or venetioe the capital and seat of the republic makes a very grand appearance at a distance as seeming from its being built on a multitude of little islands to float upon the sea or rather with its stately buildings and steeples to seem as it were rising out of it the number of these islands still remains uncertain some reckoning sixty others seventytwo and others again making them amount to one hundred and thirtyeight but the latter enumeration must comprehend all those places which have gradually been raised in the laguna by driving piles in the ground for building on this city stands at least four miles from any part of the terra firma and is perhaps the most impregnable town in europe the laguna or marshy land lying between the city and the continent which is five miles in breadth is too shallow for large ships but by the attention of the republic is prevented from becoming part of the continent and from being ever so frozen as to bear an army the access to venice toward the sea is also difficult but the safe and navigable parts are indicated by piles which at the approach of an enemys fleet can cut away besides as a considerable number of galleys and men of war may be fitted out very expeditiously for sea from the dock which contains such vast quantities of naval stores it is evident that the city being thus secure from any attack either by land or water must be in a manner impregnable though it has no fortifications the fish which are caught even at the very doors of the houses may be reputed a good preservative against famine the several canals leading to the city among the sand banks and marshy shallows are though at a vast expense kept clear of the mud and slime the food brings with it some of these canals however being very narrow the mud is not so effectually carried off as to prevent ill smell in hot weather  the grand canal which may not improperly be called the grand street runs serpentine through the city many noble buildings are on each side of it but wanting a beauty which the towns in holland have a quay or space between the houses and the canals it looks like a town over flowed with water plan of the city of venice references   new arsenal   old arsenal   the verges   seminary ducal   our lady of the arsenal   the sepulcher   the piety   greeks church   commander of the knights of malta  0 the little hospital    st marks

begars    new great arsenal a royal bridge or rialto   map of venice coming close to the sides of the foundations of the buildings  this canal which divides the city into two parts is one thousand three hundred paces long the way of going up and down the city is in gondolas which indeed strike the eye of a stranger at first sight with a very gloomy appearance being all of them lined either with black cloth or serge and painted black they will not carry above four or five persons and as the awning is so low that no one can conveniently stand upright in the gondola when a strangers gets into one of them it seems as if he was creeping into a hearse or tomb hung with black the left side is always accounted the place of honor because he who sits on the right must face the rower who intercepts the view and often unavoidably splashes him  the gondolas glide very swiftly along the canals and the gondoliers avoid each other with surprising exactness and celerity they make use of the word stacando or stali to signify to those coming another way to keep on the right hand and premando or premi as a notice to pass on the left so that gondolas seldom run each other down  there is no conveyance in this town says lady millar but by water out of the door of your lodging you step into your gondola instead of your coach a gondola with two oars at venice is as magnificent as a coach and six horses with a large equipage in another country the motion of them is extremely agreeable two gondoliers manage one so dexterously that they will whip round a sharp corner of their watery streets with more agility than the best coachman in london can take a short turn there he that governs the helm stands in the most graceful attitude imaginable  one cannot be an hour on these canals without seeing several of the barcaroles shifting themselves for it is a custom among them to have always a dry shirt ready to put on the moment they have landed their fare and they would expect to die if by any accident they were under the necessity of suffering a damp shirt to dry on their bodies on the other hand it is curious to observe how little they dread damp sheets throughout italy and the people at inns are so little apprized of an objection to damp sheets that when desired to hang them before the fire they request you will feel how wet they are being prepossessed that you mean they have not been washed  over the several canals are laid four hundred and fifty some say upwards of five hundred bridges great and small and the better part of them stone the highest and longest is the rialto which in the midst of the city crosses the great canal at its narrowest part where it is but forty paces broad the bridge consists of only one single arch and a very noble one it is whose foundation takes up ninety feet resting on twelve thousand elm piles and every where incrustated with marble it is said to have cost the republic two hundred and fifty thousand ducats in the upper part of it it is thirtyseven paces broad with two rows of shops forming as it were three streets on its upper surface of which that in the middle is the broadest at each end is an ascent of fiftysix steps  the view from the rialto is equally lively and magnificent the objects immediately under the eye are the grand canal covered with boats and gondolas and flanked on each side with magnificent palaces churches and spires but this fine prospect according to moore is almost the only one in venice for except the grand canal and the canal regio all the others are narrow and mean some of them have no quays the water literally washes the walls of the houses in going along these wretched canals there is no one agreeable object to cheer the sight and the smell at certain seasons is overpowered with the stench that exales from these waters  the city may indeed be every where traversed on foot but the streets are very narrow and the pavement which is a smooth white stone is very slippery in wet weather they are always kept very neat however no carriage not so much as a chaise ever passing through them the many small bridges with their steps are not a little dangerous to cross over from the slipperiness of the pavement and their having in general no fence on either side  in allusion to the slipperiness of the pavement there is a proverb advising persons to beware of the four ps at venice namely pietra bianca putana prete and pantalone i e a white stone a whore a priest and the last p may denote either mountebanks and jugglers or the nobility themselves that being a nickname given them by the vulgar  the situation of venice has been celebrated in the following lines by the famous poet sannagario for each of which the republic made him a present of one hundred louisdors  viderat adriacis venetam neptunus in undis stare urbem and toti ponere jura mari nunc mihi tarpeias quantumvis jupiter arces objice and illa tui moenia martis ait si pelago tiberim proefers urbem aspice utramque illam homines dices hanc posuisse deos thus badly versified by collier   neptune saw venice on the adriatic strand and all the sea under her wide command now jove said he thy roman towers object and those proud walls which mars could not protect before the sea if tiber thou prefer behold both cities thou will aver that men built rome but gods placed venice there the following dialogue was formerly to be seen in st marks church written in latin between a foreigner and an old man the former was distinguished by the letter a which signified advena and the latter by the letter s which stood for senex a translation of it as showing the vanity of the venetians may not perhaps be unacceptable to some of our readers  a pray old gentleman by whom was the city of venice founded s by jupiter a who contrived its arsenal s minerva a who stocked it with ladies of pleasure s venus a who built its walls s neptune a from whom did it derive its coin s from dido a to whom does it owe its military glory s to mars a its commerce s to mercury a its laws s to minerva no wonder therefore it so far excels other cities since it owes its origin to so many deities  the view of venice at some little distance from the town says moore is mentioned by many travelers in terms of the highest admiration i had been so often forwarned of the amazement with which i should be struck at first sight of this city that when i actually did see it i felt little or no amazement at all you will behold said those anticipators magnificent palaces churches towns and steeples all standing in the middle of the sea this continues the above writer is unquestionably an uncommon scene and there is no manner of doubt that a town surrounded by water is a very fine sight but all the travelers that have existed since the days of cain will not convince me that a town surrounded by land is not a much finer can there be any comparison between the dull monotony of a watery surface and the delightful variety of gardens meadows hills and woods  if the situation of venice renders it less agreeable than another city to behold at a distance it must render it in a much stronger degree less agreeable to inhabit for it should be recollected that instead of walking or riding in the fields and enjoying the fragrance of herbs and the melody of birds a person who wishes to take the air here must submit to be paddled from morning to night in a narrow boat along dirty canals or if he does not like this he has one resource more which is that of walking in st marks place these are the disadvantages which venice labors under with regard to situation  venice is said to be built in the sea that is it is built in the midst of shallows which stretch some miles from the shore at the bottom of the adriatic gulf though these shallows being now all covered with water have the appearance of one great lake yet they are called in the plural lakes because formerly as it is imagined there were several in sailing on the lagunae and looking to the bottom many large hollows are to be seen which at some former period have very possibly been distinct lakes though now being all covered with a common surface of water they form one large lake of unequal depth the intervals between these hollows it is supposed were little islands and are now shallows which at ebb are all within reach of a pole  the lake in which venice stands is a kind of small inner gulf separated from the large gulf by some islands at a few miles distance these islands in a great measure break the force of the adriatic storms before they reach the lagunae yet in very high winds the navigation of the lake is dangerous to gondolas and sometimes the gondoliers do not trust themselves even on the canals within the city this is not so great an inconvenience as may be at first imagined because most of the houses have one door opening upon a canal and another communicating with the street by means of which and the bridges the inhabitants can go to almost any part of the town by land as well as by water  the whole city is said to be six italian miles in circumference and to make the tour of it in a gondola takes up rather more than two hours it contains seventy parish churches besides others fiftyfour convents of monks twentysix nunneries seventeen rich hospitals eighteen oratories forty religious fraternities with their chapels among which are six called scuole grandi fiftythree squares one hundred and fiftyfive marble and twentythree brass statues view of venice from the port fossetta the buildings indeed are all of stone but the greater part makes so mean an appearance that this city in point of beauty or elegance can by no means be compared with many others st marks square is certainly very magnificent and so are several palaces bordering on the grand canal though most of them are of gothic architecture in the churches and chapels what is most to be admired are the paintings which are even thought to surpass those of rome here are also two academies for painting  the number of inhabitants has been by some computed at two hundred thousand including those in the adjacent islands and such as live on the water others who do not include the islanders and the mariners think that during the carnival the whole number of people at venice scarce exceeds this number the principal inhabitants are the nobility citadini or citizens after whom may be reckoned the lawyers notaries physicians wealthy merchants glassmakers and all handicraftsmen whether dwelling in the city or the islands together with the seafaring people and the gondoliers  venice from the fertility of its neighborhood and the facility of carriage enjoys a constant plenty of all kinds of provisions the spring water being very indifferent in most places almost every house has a cistern into which the rainwater is conveyed from the roof and clarified being filtrated through sand water is also brought from the river brenta and preserved in the cisterns  from this general sketch we now proceed to a more particular description venice is divided into six large parts called sestierie of which the three first lie on the east and northeast side of the great canal which as we have before observed divides the city into two main parts and three others on the west and south side  the district of st mark contains the piazza di s marco which is one of the largest and finest squares in europe this is the only spot that one can call terra firma in the whole city it is surrounded with magnificent buildings and divided into the lesser and greater squares on each side of the large square are what they call the procuraties a pile of buildings like our inns of court and inhabited by lawyers underneath which are piazzas supported by marble pillars where are coffeehouses and taverns at one end stands the church of st mark and adjoining to it is the lesser square having on one side the ducal palace and the new procuraties on the other the sea washes the quay of this square which is built of large hewn stones with several stairs where the gondolas land very conveniently at the end of this lesser square are erected two lofty pillars of granite or speckled marble which are said to have been originally brought from egypt to constantinople and removed from thence to venice in the time of the doge sebastiano zani about the year      after they had lain a whole year on the ground they were erected by n barratier who desired no other recompense for his trouble than that any person might have free liberty to play at any game of chance between these two pillars all kinds of gaming being at that time prohibited this request was complied with but the senate at the same time ordered that the execution of criminals should in future likewise take place on that spot and criminals condemned to suffer death publicly are still executed between these pillars on the pillar that stands next to the ducal palace is a brass lion being st marks symbol with its head toward the east as an emblem of the republics dominion over several places in the levant on the other side stands a marble statue of s theodore or as others will have it of st george who holds his shield in the right instead of the left hand which either proceeds from the sculptors mistake or perperhaps it was copied from an intaglio but the venetians pretend it was done designedly to express the justice of the republic which say they aims only at defending itself without doing any hurt or injury to other powers a noble venetian would not pass between these two pillars upon any terms because when the doge falieri who was beheaded in      for treason against the state came to venice after his election he was obliged to land between these two pillars from the water being remarkably high on the canal opposite to these two pillars a galley completely rigged and armed is kept in readiness for any emergency  at the corner of the new procuratie a little disance from the church stands the steeple of st mark this is a quadrangular tower about three hundred feet in height it is not uncommon in italy for the church and steeple to be in this state of disunion this shocked a clergyman of my acquaintance very much says moore he mentioned it to me among the errors and absurdities of the church of rome this gentleman was clearly of opinion that church and steeple ought to be as inseparable as man and wife and that every church ought to consider its steeple as mortar of its mortar and stone of its stone an old captain of a ship who was present declared himself of the same way of thinking and swore that a church divorced from its steeple appeared to him as ridiculous as a ship without a mast  the ascent to the top of this tower is by steps but so contrived that a person may ride up and down on horseback which augustus king of poland once did without meeting with any accident on the top of it is a spire with an angel sixteen feet high cut in wood and gilt this tower has a gallery which is quiet open above and affords a very fine prospect while the gilding of the spire is bright it may be seen at sea upwards of thirty miles nay some give out says keysler that when the gilding was quite fresh it could plainly be discerned off capo d istria at the distance of one hundred miles from venice what sabelli further says that the foundation of this tower is laid as deep in the earth as it is high above the surface of it may be looked upon as one of those gasconades not uncommon among the venetians  at the bottom of this tower is a small neat building of marble called the loggietta where some of the procurators of st mark constantly attend to do business some people are of opinion that particularly when the grand council or the senate are assembled these procurators are placed there as statecentinels to give warning in case of any appearance of discontent or commotion among the populace which must necessarily show itself at this place as there is no other in venice where a mob could assemble  a few paces from the church are three large poles like the masts of a ship erected on brass pedestals of curious workmanship on which ensigns and flags are hung on days of public rejoicing these are in memory of the three kingdoms cyprus candia and negropont which once belonged to this republic the three crowns are still kept in the ducal palace since the kingdoms are gone remarks moore the crowns and the poles seem scarce worth preserving they are however of the same value to venice that the title of king of france is to his britannic majesty  the patriarchal church of st mark though one of the richest and most expensive in the world does not strike the eye very much at first the architecture is of a mixed kind mostly gothic yet many of the pillars are of the grecian order the outside is incrusted with marble the inside ceiling and floor are all of the finest marble  the front which looks to the palace has five brass gates with historical basrelieves over the principal gate are placed the four famous bronze horses said to be the workmanship of lycippus they were given to the emperor nero by tiridates king of armenia the fiery spirit of their countenances and their amimated attitudes are perfectly agreeable to their original destination of being harnessed to the chariot of the sun nero placed them on the triumphal arch consecrated to him and they are to be seen on the reverse of some of his medals they were removed from rome to constantinople placed in the hippodrome by constantine and remained there till the taking of constantinople by the french and venetians in the beginning of the thirteenth century when they were carried to venice and placed in st marks church  the treasury of st mark is very rich in jewels and relics and it is necessary to apply to one of the procurators of st mark for permission to see it i shall only mention says moore a few of the most valuable effects kept here eight pillars from solomons temple at jerusalem a piece of the virgin marys veil some of her hair and a small portion of her milk the knife used by our savior at his last supper one of the nails of the cross and a few drops of his blood after these it would be impertinent to enumerate the bones and other relics of saints and martyrs of which there is a plentiful show in this church it would be unpardonable however to omit mentioning the picture of the virgin by st luke from this compared with his other works says moore it is plain that st luke was a much better evangelist than a painter there are many very good painters who would have made very bad saints and here is an instance of an excellent saint who was but an indifferent painter  the mosaic paintings on the outside of this church says mrs piozzi which are surpassed by no works of art delights us no less on entering with its numberless rarities the flooring first catches the eye being being entirely paved with precious stones of the second rank in small squares not bigger than a playing card and sometimes less by the second rank in gems i mean cornelian agate jasper serpentine and verdantique on which we place our feet without remorse but not without a very odd sensation when we find the ground undulated beneath them to represent the waves of the sea and perpetuate marine ideas which prevail in every thing at venice  of this treasury it was said during the reign of charles i of spain that there was in it enough to pay six kings ransoms when pachecho the spanish ambassador hearing so much said of it asked in derision if the chest in which the treasure is contained had any bottom and being answered in the affirmative he replied there was this difference between his masters treasures and those of the venetian republic that the mines of mexico and peru had no bottom  the church treasury this lady adds is old fashioned but very rich in gold and jewels in it is kept a very famous manuscript of the gospel of st mark pretended to be autographical but the dampness of the place where it lies has spoiled it to such a degree that no part of it is any longer legible and it is not so much as certain whether it be written in latin or greek in the pavement of the portico of st marks is a small morsel of porhyry frequently kissed by the people who hold it in the highest veneration on this piece of marble the emperor barbarossa prostrated himself at the popes feet in      when his holiness gave him absolution  the venetians have not only dedicated their famous cathedral to st mark but he is considered so much the tutelar saint of this city that it is frequently called st marco in italian instead of venice of this custom of calling venice st marco mrs piozzi relates a pleasant anecdote which we shall here insert leaving it as she does to our readers to pass over or not as they may think proper  the procurator tron a noble venetian it seems was at padua and had a fancy to drive on that afternoon to vicenza but being particularly fond of a favorite pair of horses which drew his chariot that day would by no means venture if it happened to rain and took the trouble to enquire of abbate toaldo a celebrated professor there whether he thought such a thing likely to happen from the appearance of the sky the professor not knowing why the question was asked said he rather thought it would not rain within four hours at soonest in consequence of this information our senator orders his equipage directly got into it and bid the driver make haste to vicenza but before he was half way on his journey such torrents of rain came down from a black cloud which burst directly over their heads that his horses were drenched in wet and their mortified master turned immediately back to padua that they might suffer no further inconvenience to pass away the evening which he did not mean to have spent there and to quiet his agitated spirits by thinking on something else he walked under the portico to a neighboring coffeehouse where sat the abbate toaldo in company of a few friends wholly unconscious that he had been the cause of vexing the procurator who after a short pause cried out in a true venetian spirit of anger and humor odly bleaded together mi dica signor professore toaldo chi e il piu gran mincion de tutti i santi in paradiso pray tell me doctor we should say in english who is the greatest blockhead of all the saints in paradise the abbe looked astonished but hearing the question repeated in a more peevish accent gravely replied eccellenza non son fatto io per rispondere a tale dimande  my lord i know not what reply to make to such a question why then replies the procurator i will tell you myself it is st mark who is the greatest blockhead for keeping so many professors to study the stars when with all their astronomy not one of them can tell whether it will rain or no  the church of the redemtore is a curious instance of the power of art for though it is not to be ranked among the rich and expensive churches abounding neither in gold or fine marbles yet the simplicity and elegance of its structure surprised us very much the moment we entered the door and convinced us how deservedly palladio is admired and how possible it is to enjoy the beauty of proportion and design without having studied the rudiments of the art  the ducal palace is an immense building entirely of marble the front is very magnificent being beautified with a great number of marble pillars of different orders did the other three sides but correspond with the principal front there would not be a finer building in all europe besides the apartments of the doge there are also halls and chambers for the senate and all the different councils and tribunals the principal entrance is by a spacious staircase called the giants staircase on account of two colossal statues of mars and neptune placed at the top they are of white marble and intended to represent the naval and military power of the state their gigantic size might be proper enough formerly but they would be juster emblems of this republic in its present state if their stature were more moderate  under the portico leading to this staircase may be perceived the gaping mouths of lions to receive anonymous letters informations of treasonable practices and accusations of magistrates for abuses in office  from the palace is a covered bridge of communication to a stateprison on the other side of the canal prisoners pass to and from the courts over this bridge which is called ponte di sospiri or bridge of sighs  the apartments and halls of the ducal palace are ornamented by the pencils of titian paul veronese tintoret and other great painters the rape of europa and the storming of zara both by paul veronese are among the highly esteemed pieces of that master the foot of europa is honored with the particular admiration of the connoisseurs  within the palace there is a little arsenal which communicates with the hall of the great council here a great number of muskets are kept ready charged with which the nobles may arm themselves on any sudden insurrection or other emergency  the lower gallery or the piazza under the palace is called the broglio in this the noble venetians walk and converse it is only here and at council where they have opportunities of meeting together for they seldom visit openly or in a family way at each others houses and secret meetings would give umbrage to the stateinquisitors they choose therefore to transact their business on this public walk people of inferior rank seldom remain on the broglio for any length of time when the nobility are there  besides st marks place there is not another square or place as the french with more propriety call them in all venice to compensate however for there being but one there is a greater variety of objects to be seen at this one than in any halfdozen of squares or places of london or paris this square observes lady millar is particularly agreeable to walk in by night the lights in the coffeehouses illuminating the piazza render it extremely cheerful and the concourse of people resorting hither to breathe the cool air is so considerable as to fill the whole square the little streets leading from it are well furnished with elegant shops which make the most brilliant appearance from the curious arrangement of their articles and appear far exceeding the coup doeil of the foire s germain at paris the street of the silversmiths makes a splendid show there being no other sort of shops in it that of the milliners and mercers is like a parterre of flowers the goods of the most glaring colors being ingeniously mixed in such a manner in the windows as to produce a striking effect other streets consist solely of poulterers and some of greengrocers shops these last are decked out in such a manner as discovers surprising taste in the common people  in the evening says moore there generally is here such a mixture of jews turks and christians lawyers knaves and pickpockets mountebanks old women and physicians women of quality with masks strumpets barefaced and in short such a jumble of senators citizens gondoliers and people of every character and condition that our ideas are broken and disjointed in the crowd in such a manner that one can think or reffect on nothing yet this being a state of mind which many people are fond of the place never fails to be well attended and in fine weather numbers pass a great part of the night there although such a heterogeneous mixture of people throng the place both day and night yet there is no riot or disturbance the venetians are so accustomed to see strangers as not to be the least surprised at their being dressed in a fashion different from themselves nor inclined to esteem them objects of ridicule on account of their not speaking the italian language as it is the custom for the ladies as well as the gentlemen to frequent the cassinos and coffeehouses in the place st mark it answers all the purposes of either vauxhall or ranelagh  it is not in st marks place we are to look for the finest monuments of the art of titian or the genius of palladio for these it is necessary to visit the churches and palaces but not pretending says moore to be a competent judge of painting and architecture i have no new remarks to make on these subjects and i wish to avoid a hackneyed repetition of what has been said by others i was besides long ago taught a lesson which will effectually prevent me from every affectation of this kind  very early in life says our author i resided about a year in paris and happened one day to accompany five or six of our countrymen to view the pictures in the palais royal a gentleman who affected an enthusiastic passion for the fine arts particularly that of painting and who had the greatest desire to be thought a connoisseur was of the party he had read the lives of the painters and had the voyage pittoresque de paris by heart from the moment we entered the rooms he began to display all the refinements of his taste he instructed us what to admire and drew us away with every sign of disgust when we stopped a moment at an uncelebrated picture we were afraid of appearing pleased with any thing we saw till he informed us whether or not it was worth looking at he shook his head at some tossed up his nose at others commended a few and passed sentence on every piece as he went along with the most imposing tone of sagacity bad that caravaggio is too bad indeed devoid of all grace  but here is a caracci that makes amends how charming the grief of that magdalen the virgin you will observe gentlemen is only fainting but the christ is quite dead look at the arm did you ever see any thing so dead  aye here is a madona which they tell you is an original guido but any body may see it is only a tolerable copy  pray gentlemen observe this sebastian how delightfully he expires dont you all feel the arrow in your hearts i am sure i feel it in mine do let us move on i should die with agony if i looked any longer  we at length came to st john by raphael and here this man of taste stopped short in an extacy of admiration  one of the company had already passed it without minding it and was looking on another picture on which the connoisseur bawled out  good god sir what are you about the honest gentleman started and stared around to know what crime he had been guilty of  have you eyes in your head sir continued the connoisseur dont you know st john when you see him  st john replied the other in amazement aye sir st john the baptist in propria persona  i dont know what you mean sir said the gentleman peevishly  dont you rejoined the connoisseur then i will endeavor to explain myself i mean st john in the wilderness by the divine raffaelle sangio da urbino and there he stands by your side  pray my dear sir will you be so obliging to bestow a little of your attention on that foot does it not start from the wall is it not perfectly out of the frame did you ever see such coloring they talk of titian can titians coloring excel that what truth what ntaure in the head to the elegance of antique here is joined the simplicity of nature  we stood listening in silent admiration and began to imagine we pecreived all the perfections he enumerated when a person in the duke of orleans service came and informed us that the original which he presumed was the picture we wished to see was in another room the duke having allowed a painter to copy it that which we had been looking at was a very wretched daubing done from the original by some obscure painter and had been thrown with other rubbish into a corner where the swiss had accidentally discovered it and had hung it up merely by way of covering the vacant place on the wall till the other should be replaced  how the connoisseur looked on this trying occasion i cannot say it would have been barbarous to have turned an eye upon him  i stepped into the next room fully determined to be cautious in deciding on the merit of painting  over against the ducal palace stands the public library of the republic the poet petrarch first begun this collection by giving his library to the state upon condition that a decent edifice should be built for its reception at the public expense after him cardinal bassarion added his curious collection of greek manuscripts several other considerable additions have since been made to this library  the paintings by titian and several other celebrated masters together with several antiquities and greek and marble statue which are to be seen here merit particular notice among the latter the most striking is the rape of ganymede by jupiter in the shape of an eagle which some take to be the work of phidias a venus and apollo two gladiators leda paris and several busts of the roman emperors are also exquisitely done on each side of the principal entrance instead of a pillar is a marble statue of a female and these statues support the ornaments above  the arsenal at venice is a fortification of between two and three miles in compass on the ramparts are many little watchtowers where sentinels are stationed like the arsenal at toulon it is at once a dockyard and a repository for military stores here the venetians build their ships cast their cannon make their cables sails anchors etc the arms are arranged here as in other places of the same kind in large rooms divided into narrow walks by long walls of muskets pikes and halberts  in one of the docks is kept the bucentaur or vessel the doge is carried in to espouse the adriatic this vessel is kept under cover and never taken out but for the espousals it is formed for containing a very numerous company is finely gilt and ornamented within and loaded on the outside with emblematical figures in sculpture this vessel may possibly be admired by landsmen but will not much charm a seamans eye being a heavy broadbottomed machine which draws little water and consequently may be easily overset in a gale of wind of this however there is no great danger as two precautions are taken to prevent such an accident one of which seems calculated to quiet the minds of believers and the other to give confidence to the most credulous the first is used by the patriarch who as soon as the vessel is afloat takes care to pour into the sea some holy water which is believed to have the virtue of preventing or allaying storms the second is entrusted to the admiral who has the discretionary power of postponing the marriageceremony when the bride seems in the smallest degree boisterous one of the virtues of the holy water that of allaying storms is by this means rendered superfluous  but when the weather is quite favorable the ceremony is performed every ascensionday the solemnity is announced in the morning by the ringing of bells and firing of cannon about midday the doge attended by a numerous party of the senate and clergy goes on board the bucentaur the vessel is rowed a little way into the sea accompanied by the splendid yachts of the foreign ambassadors the gondolas of the venetian nobility and an incredible number of barks and galleys of every kind hymns are sung and a band of music performs while the bucentaur and her attendants slowly move toward st lido a small island two miles from venice prayers are then said after which the doge drops a ring of no great value into the sea pronouncing these words  desponsamus te mare in signum very perpetuique dominii he then returns in the same state inviting those who accompany him in the galley to dinner  this vessel remarks mr piozzi is called the identical one in which pope alexander performed the original ceremony so far back as the year      and though perhaps not a whole plank of that old galley can be now remaining in this so often careened repaired and adorned since that time i see nothing ridiculous she adds in declaring that it is the same ship any more than in saying that the oak planted an acorn thirty years ago is the same tree i saw spring up then a little twig which not even a moderate skeptic will deny though he takes so much pains to persuade plain folks out of their own existence by laughing us out of the dull notion that he who dies a withered old fellow at fourscore should ever be considered as the same person whom his mother brought forth a pretty little plump baby eight years before  it would be endless to describe the great number of palaces in this city but we may in general observe that with respect to architecture those built by palladio and other celebrated architects are in a style quite different from the roman or the florentine both in the ornaments on the front and the disposition of the apartments within the windows are generally four squares in height arched at the top and reaching quite to the floor with balconies before them through the lower part of the window all the parts of which are made to open from bottom to top for letting in the air in hot weather the middle of the front is almost entirely composed of windows for enlightening a long portico or gallery that passes through the house in every story and out of this gallery is the entrance into the apartments on each hand the most magnificent are generally up two pair of stairs they have sometimes a story of high apartments and another of what they call mezzanine or low ones alternate the former for state the latter for the use of the family  the floors are generally of a red plaster composed of pulverized marble and bricks mixed with oil it makes a beautiful appearance and is very lasting the chambers of the grand floor are seldom used for any other purpose than as lumberrooms sometimes indeed they are decorated with statues or with arms and trophies where the master of the house has been a military man and in some the chambers are full of inscriptions antique marbles and other curiosities of the like kind  the roofs of the houses in venice are flat and covered with tiles  venice with a few alterations remarks sharp would be much more magnificent than it is at present the windows instead of sashes are still as in other parts of italy made of small panes of glass enclosed in lead and what has a still meaner appearance covered with iron grates resembling those in prisons the shutters of their houses are plain deal boards tacked together without the least form or decoration and not painted as in england so that when a palace is shut up it has very much the resemblance of a bridewell or an hospital for lunatics they likewise lay on the roofs of their houses such heavy clumsy tiles as to offend the eye very much houserent is remarkably cheap for so large and commercial a city a house of seventy pounds a year being equal to one of two hundred a year in other capitals  the palaces are in general furnished with velvet and damask fringed or laced with gold the doors skirtingboards and wainscotting are painted in a most elegant manner with pale tints for the ground and prettily ornamented with curious devices festoons fruits etc they also paint in fresco on the walls with much facility and taste this is to be met with in the poorest houses and where they do not go to the expense of painting the walls their whitewash is of uncommon neatness it is glossy of a soft color and never comes off  there are some good pictures in the palaces but not such capital collections as are to be seen at rome and genoa the venetians remarks lady millar cover the walls of their palaces with pictures and never think those apartments properly furnished until they have such as fill all the spaces from top to bottom so is completely to hide the hanging this being their object there are in all the collections many more bad pictures than good and on entering a room the number of paintings is so great that it is not till after some recollection one can discriminate those pictures that merit attention from amongst a chaos of glowing colors that surround them and which are frequently so ill classed that a picture which requires to be hung high is perhaps the lowest in the room whilst another that cannot be seen too close perhaps touches the cornice  keysler mentions the palace grimaldi as one of the most elegant for its architecture furniture and curiosities both modern and antique in the palace barberigo is a weeping magdalen by titian for which the king of france is said to have offered forty thousand crowns this celebrated painter was descended from a noble family though in mean circumstances and was born at cadore on the banks of the river piave in      and died at venice of the plague in the year      and the ninetyninth of his age  one of the singularities of this singular city says martyn is its conservatories or musical schools for instructing young women in music of these there are four and at each of them they perform oratorios and other pieces of sacred music every saturday and and sunday evening and on other festivals in their convents indeed such is and such has been the rage for music throughout italy that improvements in this science have been equally encouraged by the several states as improvements in policy or arts early as the   th century guido aretinus a benedictine monk having reformed the scale of music and invented a new method of notation was invited by pope john xx to rome his improvements were patronized and the pope became his disciple  i was present says lady millar in the church when there was some very good music both vocal and instrumental performed by the women of one of these charities the gallery having a lattice before it we could not distinguish the performers i therefore begged to be permitted to go into it and see as well as hear the concert my request was granted but when i entered my eyes were struck with the sight of a dozen or fourteen beldams ugly and old one blowing a frenchhorn another sweating at the bassviol another playing first fiddle and beating time with her foot in the greatest rage others performing on bassoons hautboys and clarinets these with several young girls who formed the choir and one who played upon the organ composed the concert but such a concert as i shall never forget  about a mile from venice in the island of murano are the great manufactories of lookingglasses i saw one very fine plate for a mirror says moore made in the presence of the archduke in a few minutes though not so large as some of the paris manufactory yet it was much larger than i could have thought it in the power of human lungs to blow instead of being cast as in france and england the murano mirrors are all blown in the manner of bottles it is astonishing to see with what dexterity the the workman wields a long hollow cylinder of melted glass at the end of an iron tube which when he has extended as much as possible by blowing and every other means his art suggests he slits with a sharp instrument removing the two extremities from each other and folding back the sides the cylinder now appears a large sheet of glass which being once more introduced into the furnace is brought out a clear finished plate  this manufactory formerly served all europe with lookingglasses the quantity made here is still considerable for although france and england and some other countries which still get their mirrors from venice use a much greater quantity now than formerly so that on the supposition that the murano manufacturers have lost threefourths of their customers they may still retain half as much trade as ever they had  it is surprising that instead of blowing they do not adopt the method of casting which is a much easier process and by which larger plates may be made besides mirrors an infinite quantity of glass trinkets  margaritini as they are called of all shapes and colors are made here women of the inferior ranks wear them as ornaments and rosaries they also mould this substance into many various whimsical forms by way of ornamental furniture to houses and churches in short there are glass baubles enough made here to bribe into slavery half the inhabitants of the coast of guinea  chap iii of the other cities in venetian lombardy padua next in fame to venice may be compared to the secondrate cities in france or england its streets are lined with two rows of piazzas besides several canals of clear running water admirably contrived for the convenience of manufacturers its situation is delightful yet it is so badly peopled that deprived of its monasteries prebends seminary and what few scholars its university still draws thither scarce a soul would be left the paduans boast that the republic of venice owes its origin and rise to their city but it is now some centuries since padua has been brought under the venetian yoke which has occasioned it to decline so much from its former splendour that at present it scarce contains forty thousand inhabitants  the principal objects of curiosity in this city are the churches of st antonio and st giustina il salone the buildings of the university by palladio the botanic and economical gardens and the museum  the church of st antonio is a large gothic building begun in      and finished in   0  it has six domes or cupolas of which the two largest compose the nave it is extremely rich and so much ornamented as to appear crowded with painting and sculpture there are four immense organs in it and even on common days forty performers are employed in the service  the body of the saint is enclosed in a sarcophagus under an altar in the middle of the chapel and is said to emit a very agreeable and refreshing smell pious catholics believe this to be the natural effluvia of the saints body while heretics assert that the perfume for a perfume there certainly is proceeds from certain balsams rubbed on the marble every morning before the votaries come to pay their devotions  the walls of this church are covered with votive offerings of ears eyes arms legs noses and every part almost of the human body in token of cures performed by this saint for whatever part has been the seat of the disease a representation of it is hung up in silver or gold according to the gratitude and wealth of the patient  at a small distance from this church is a place called the school of st antonio here many of his actions are painted in fresco some of them by titian many miracles of a very extraordinary nature are here recorded there is one in particular which if often repeated might endanger the peace of families the saint thought proper to loosen the tongue of a newborn infant and endue it with the faculty of speech on which the child with an imprudence natural to his age declared in an audible voice before a large company who was his real father the miracles attributed to this celebrated saint greatly exceed in number those recorded by the evangelists of our savior and although it is not asserted that st antonio has not raised himself from the dead his admirers here record things of him which are almost equivalent when an impious turk had secretly placed fireworks under the chapel with an intention to blow it up they affirm that st antonio hollowed three times from his marble coffin which terrified the infidel and discovered the plot the miracle is the more miraculous as the saints tongue was cut out and is actually preserved in a crystal vessel and shown as a precious relic to all who have a curiosity to see it this difficulty was stated as seeming to bear a little against the authority of the miracle and the ingenious person to whom the objection was made seemed at first somewhat nonplussed but after recollecting himself observed that this which seemed an objection was really a confirmation of the fact for the saint was not said to have spoken but only to have hollowed which a man can do without a tongue but if his tongue had not been out added he there is no reason to doubt but that the saint would have revealed the turkish plot in plain articulate language  in this church is a monument of the famous cardinal bembo who was a man of great learning and wrote very pure classic latin it is said he was so proud of his elegant latin style that he would often say he would not exchange it for the duchy of mantua he is charged with having dissuaded a friend from reading st pauls epistles and with never looking into the bible or breviary for fear of corrupting the purity of his latin style  the next church in point of rank but far superior in architecture is that of st justina built from a design of palladio and reckoned by many persons one of the most elegant he ever gave st justina is said to have suffered martyrdom where the church was built which was the reason of erecting it on that spot it would have been fortunate for the pictures in this church if the saint had suffered on a piece of dryer ground for they seem considerably injured by the damps which surround the place where it now stands there is a wide area in the front of the church called the prato della valle where booths and shops are erected for all kinds of merchandise during the fairs part of this which is never allowed to be profaned by the buyers and sellers is called campo santo because a great number of christian martyrs is said to have been put to death there  st justinas church is adorned with many altars embellished with sculpture the pavement is remarkably rich being a kind of mosaic work of marble of various colors many other precious materials are wrought as ornaments to this church but there is one species of jewels in which it abounds more than perhaps any church in christendom which is the bones of martyrs they have here a whole well full belonging to those who were executed in the prato della valle and what is of still greater value the benedictines to whom this church belongs assert that they are also in possession of the bodies of the two evangelists st matthew and st luke the franciscans belonging to a convent at venice dispute the second of those two great prizes and declare that they are possessed of the true body of st luke the matter was referred to the pope who gave a decision in favor of one of the bodies but this does not prevent the proprietors of the other from still persisting in their original claim so that there is no likelihood of the dispute being finally determined till the day of judgment  the hall of the townhouse in padua it is about three hundred english feet long by one hundred in breadth westminster hall which like this is said to be the largest room unsupported by pillars in europe is only two hundred and seventy feet in length and seventyfour in breadth this immense hall is on the second floor and ornamented with the busts and statues of some eminent persons the cenotaph of livy the historian who was a native of padua was erected here  in this hall is to be seen a stone superscribed with the following words lapis vituperii and cessionis bonorum the stone of ignominy and bankruptcy  such as become bankrupt and are unable to pay their debts by sitting publicly three times with their bare posteriors on this stone and swearing that it is not in their power to discharge their debts are cleared from any further prosecution from their creditors  the university formerly so celebrated is now like every thing else in this city on the decline the theater for anatomy could contain five or six hundred students but the voice of the professor is like that of him who cries in the wilderness the licentious spirit of the students which formerly was carried such unwarrantable lengths and made it dangerous to walk in the streets of this city at night is now entirely extinct it has gradually declined with the number of the students whether the ardour for literature for which the students of this university were distinguished has abated in the same proportion we do not pretend to determine but by far the greater number of young men who now attend the university are designed for the priesthood and apply to the study of divinity as a science for comprehending and preaching the mysterious parts of which a very small portion of learning has been observed to succeed better than a great deal  there is a clothmanufactory in this city and it is said that the inhabitants of venice not excepting the nobles wear no other cloth than what is made here this particular manufactory it therefore may be supposed succeeds very well but the excessive number of beggars with which this place swarms is a strong proof that trade and manufactures in general are by no means in a flourishing condition  the air of padua is reckoned very healthful however few cities have so many apothecaries in proportion to the number of inhabitants but it must be observed that most of these venders of medicines are also confectioners great quantities of vipers are collected here some of which are kept alive for various uses and others dried and made into powder which is supposed to be of great efficacy in medicine they feed the fowls says keysler with vipers and meal at naples where they are also administered to patients as well as the broth made of these animals the best way of feeding fowls is to cram them with a paste made with viper powder and barley meal and then to give them milk to drink of these fowls the neapolitans makes a jelly and give it to consumptive patients and order them to continue drinking it for some weeks this puts me in mind adds the above writer of sir kenelm digby an english virtuoso who used to feast his wife who was a very beautiful lady with capons fattened with vipers flesh but he did not long enjoy his pampered idol for she died very young  the territory of padua is very subject to storms particularly those which come from the sea and which are extremely violent  for the honor of the muses and the edification of the students it seems the done libere or done del mondo as they are called are publicly tolerated at padua these ladies have their respective dwellings appointed them where they live together six or eight in a class and offer themselves to the service of the public that so commendable an institution may not be liable to any objection it is the peculiar office of several physicians frequently and strictly to examine these nymphs that no bad consequences may happen to those who converse with them of these public temples of venus there are two in the city of padua and what seems something out of character one joins to a convent of monks and the other to a nunnery  the jews have also their particular quarter allotted to them at padua out of which they are not permitted to stir  vicenza about    miles distant from the above city is charmingly situated between two mountains on a large plain though but four miles round it contains between thirty and forty thousand inhabitants the territory belonging to this city on account of its fertility is generally called the garden and shambles of venice this city is the native place of palladio and the best works of this celebrated architect constitute the chief ornament of the city though this city is of no very great extent it is supposed there are in it above  0 churches convents and hospitals  the teatro olympico is one of the finest specimens of modern architecture it was begun early in      the very year that palladio died the house in which the architect lived was built by himself and is no less modest than elegant in the environs of this city may be seen the marquis of capras famous rotunda copied by the earl of burlington at chiswick and which was built by palladio he was accessory to the ruin of many great families at vicenza by drawing them into a taste for architecture it is asserted there that it was done from a motive of revenge for having imprisoned his son who was an extravagant spend thrift during the fathers absence from vicenza who on his return gave them plans and false estimates to induce them to begin upon what he knew they could never finish  the piazza or great square of this city makes a very noble appearance being filled with elegant and beautiful buildings by this great architect  there is in this city an academy or literary society styled the olympici whose design is chiefly the improvement of the italian language the academicians hold their meetings in the teatro olympico which is seldom used as a theater the perspective of the stage in this theater is admirable and is decorated with statues of the roman emperors and philosophers the parterre or pit is likewise adorned with several statues and the seats are disposed after the manner of the ancient amphitheatres  in the campus martius without the city is a triumphal arch built from a design of the abovementioned palladio in imitation of the ancient structures of that kind  the finest garden at vicenza is that of the count valmanara which for its situation hedges vistas arbours and beautiful walks may be reckoned one of the noblest in italy a covered walk of cedar and orange trees placed alternately and above  00 paces in length is particularly admired on one side of it is a broad canal well stocked with fish which at the the sound of a pipe immediately appear in great numbers on the surface in order to be fed over the entrance into the garden is the following singular inscription in latin  if corrodoing cares have happily followed thee thus far though they be loath to leave thee dispel and banish them away this place is more peculiarly dedicated to genial mirth and festivity whoever shall damage these cedars or crop a flower let him be accounted as a sacrilegious person and be punished to appease vertumnus and pomona to whom they are consecrated  native friend or stranger who desire to amuse thyself with the rural charms of this place thou may securely enter these gardens designed for pleasure and recreation here is no fierce dog no frightful dragon no deity with his threatening weapon but every thing is here freely and without danger exposed to thy view such is the pleasure of count leonardo valmanara owner of the gardens who relies on thy modesty and good breeding as sufficient to protect the place from any outrage  this country produces great plenty of excellent wine particularly celebrated for its lenient qualities in fits of the gout  the inhabitants of vicenza are charged with being of a more vindictive temper than the rest of the italians on which account they are commonly called gli assassini vicentini or vicentian assassins this is certain that travelers and especially the germans who have the character of being hot and quarrelsome should be very careful in every part of italy to avoid disputes and especially with postillions and persons of the lower class for the desire of revenge in them is so predominant that they have been known to follow a traveller six or seven stages to watch an opportunity of gratifying this passion  murder is looked upon in italy in a very different light to what it is in other countries if a robbery has been committed in any of the towns of italy and the populace is alarmed to stop the thief there is always assistance at hand to pursue the criminal but on crying after a murderer no person offers to stir and the assassin saves himself by flying unmolested to a church or convent where to the great disgrace of the clergy the villain receives all possible assistance that he may escape the hands of the civil power  the meanest citizen of vicenza in signing contracts or other deeds adds to his name the title of comte vicentino or count of vicenza an empty piece of pride which they derive from an answer as is pretended given by charles v who when he was at vicenza to get rid of the importunate solicitations of several of the rich citizens to be made counts said in jest todos contes i make you all counts  verona has been celebrated in the following distich urbibus italioe proestat verona superbis aedibus ingeniis flumine font lacu verona surpasses all the cities of italy for superb buildings the genius of its inhabitants its rivers its fountain and its lake  however as to beauty it will not bear a comparison with many of the large cities in the southern parts of italy most of the streets of verona are narrow winding and dirty and the houses meanly built the river adige divides verona into almost two equal parts joined together by four stonebridges the number of inhabitants is at present computed to be under  0000 whereas a century ago they exceeded  0000 the best street in the city is il curso where the carnival amusements conclude with footraces  in the townhouse the statues of six celebrated persons who were natives of verona are erected these are the poets catullus aemilius aemilius marcus cornelius nepos pliny the elder and the architect vitrutruvius who lived in the reign of augustus  the chief magistrates by whom the venetians govern this province are the podesta and the general all civil affairs are under the direction of the former and the latter has the care of the military both these continue in office no longer than    months  among the private buildings in this city the palace of count maffei is the most splendid and magnificent the great glory of verona is in its ancient amphitheatre the arena and inside of which are perfect it has    rows of seats and is calculated to hold near   000 people when the emperor was at verona there were no less than  0000 people crowded into it  this celebrated amphitheatre through a succession of so many centuries has by the commendable care and attention of the inhabitants been kept in such good repair that in this respect it is far preferable to though not so large as vespasians theater at rome  near the amphitheatre is a museum or collection of rarities and antiques some of which are very curious and merit a particular examination in this building is a kind of public room for conversation and cards where the people of fashion in verona meet every evening there is scarcely a small town in italy that has not something of this kind were a plan of this sort adopted in some of the country towns in england it might be productive of more society and rational amusement than continually dining about with country neighbors and receiving visitors some of whom are not very agreeable  the chief commodities that the veronese trade in are physical plants oil wine with manufactures of linen silk and woollen the goodness of the verona wine is mentioned by pliny virgil and cassiodorus the wines here have something of the flavor of the old hungarian wines  the veronese women are well shaped and of a fresh complexion for which they are unquestionably obliged to the goodness of the air the neighboring mountains constantly refresh this city during the heats of summer with a cool evening breeze and though the orange trees are not exposed here in winter to the open air yet the climate produces all kinds of fruits and vegetables in perfection  here are some magnificent gardens belonging to a signior gazzuola the owner was formerly a counselor but procured the title of count and as gazuola in italian signifies a magpye that bird is his coat of arms with this motto loquendo i e by speaking these delighful gardens he owes to his skill in his profession the former owner who it seems had many lawsuits on his hands employed gazzuola so long to plead for him that he had no other way of satifying his demands but by making over the house and gardens to him as soon as gazzuola had taken possession he took down the arms of the former count and put up his own with the motto loquendo inscribed under them which contrary to his intention is interpreted as the means by which he acquired this property  lawyers from time immemorial have been looked upon in a very disadvantageous light even in augustuss time they were become very contemptible at rome for they had departed from the dignity of their profession and enriched themselves by chicanery and malpractices and the emperor was at last obliged to diminish their number and put a check to their avarice in the time of lewis emperor of germany it was sound necessary to publish a solemn edict to put a stop to their abuses however no people perhaps ever showed a greater detestation for lawyers than the ancient germans lucius florus relates that no defeat was ever more bloody than that of varius nothing more savage than the insults of the barbarians especially toward the pleaders of causes of some they plucked out the eyes and cut off the hands of others they sewed up the mouth of one of them having first torn out his tongue which a barbarian holding up in his hand sarcastically said now cease to hiss viper  the two other cities that remain to be spoken of in venetian lombardy are brescia and bergamo  brescia the capital of a province of the same name is a handsome large and populous city on the river garza the number of inhabitants are said to be  00000 the figure of it is almost square with the castle at one corner this city is remarkable for its ironworks and the firearms that are made here are famous through all italy the theater is splendid the boxes much ornamented with glasses paintings frontcloth of velvet or silk fringed the seats in the pit are roomy every row of this and of the boxes is numbered  the environs of this city though not naturally fertile have been converted into a garden by force of industry a judicious choice of manure and the skilful distribution of water the people of this city and province are treated better by the venetians than the rest of their subjects for having been formerly part of the milanese territory and being a frontier province if oppressed they might think of returning to their old masters  bergamo the capital of another fertile and populous province the inhabitants of which are very industrious is situated on a mountain overlooking a plain covered with trees as far as the eye can reach as you approach it the appearance of the suburbs with the city rising above and the mountain crowned with the citadel is very fine it is not near so populous as brescia many of the inhabitants quitting the town to seek a livelihood at milan genoa and other places bergamo is the native country of harlequin and the people have a sort of humorous repartee and an arch manner which with their peculiar jargon gives them an air different from that of other italians the inhabitants are many of them troubled with large wens or swellings in their throats occasioned as it said by their drinking snowwater  the plain of bergamo is divided into three parts by the river and that part which lies between the bremba and the adda called the isola is not naturally so fertile as the other two but the produce is much more considerable it has twelve communities or parishes that vie with each other in carrying cultivation to its utmost extent they do every thing with the spade and reckon four acres a maintenance for five persons the whole exhibits a sight more truly pleasing than all the pompous pageantry of churches and palaces  these two latter cities are supposed each to contain    or   000 inhabitants  chap iv character customs manners and dress were i says moore to form an idea of the character of the venetians from what i have seen i should paint them as a lively ingenious people extravagantly fond of public amusements with an uncommon relish for humor and yet more attached to the real enjoyments of life than to those which depend on ostentation and proceed from vanity  the common people of venice display some qualities very rarely to be found in that sphere of life being remarkably sober obliging to strangers and gentle in their intercourse with each other  the poor people live very well in the city of venice which may be in a great measure ascribed to their ignorance of gin and brandy they love gaming and are consequently often needy but government connives at it and is rather pleased to have them so as for those who by sickness or other accidents are reduced to poverty there is an abundance of charitable foundations however the swarms of beggars are surprizingly great the trade of begging in all catholic countries will necessarily prosper so long as that species of charity which is bestowed on beggars continues to be inculcated by their preachers and confessors as the most perfect of all moral duties  the venetians in general are tall and well made though equally robust they are not so corpulent as the germans the latter also are of fair complexion with light gray or blue eyes but the venetians are for the most part of a ruddy brown color with dark eyes the women are of a fine style of countenance with expressive features and a skin of a rich carnation they dress their hair in a fanciful manner which becomes them very much they are of an easy address and have no aversion to cultivate an acquaintance with those strangers who are presented to them by their relations or come properly recommended  though the venetian government is still under the influence of jealousy that gloomy demon is now entirely banished from the bosom of individuals instead of the confinement in which women were formerly kept at venice they now enjoy a degree of freedom unknown even at paris  the husbands seem at least convinced that the chastity of their wives is safest under their own guardianship and that when a women thinks her honor unworthy her own regard it is still more unworthy of his this advantage at least must arise from the present system that when a husband believes his wife has adhered to her conjugal vow he has the additional satisfaction of knowing she acts from a love to him or from some honorable motive whereas formerly a venetian husband might think himself obliged to bars and bolts for his wifes chastity  could any man imagine that a woman when chastity was preserved by such means was more respectable than a prostitute the old plan of bolts and bars without even securing its object must have had strong tendency to debase the minds of both husband and wife for what man whose mind was not perfectly abject could have pleasure in the society of a wife who languished to be in the arms of another of all the humble employments that ever the wretched sons of adam submitted to that of watching a wife from morning to night and all night too is the most perfectly humiliating such ungenerous distrust must also have had the wont effect on the minds of the women and made them view their gaolers with disgust and horror and we ought not to be surprised if some preferred the common gondoliers of the lakes and the vagrants of the streets to such husbands  along with jealousy poison and the stiletto have been banished from venetian gallantry and the innocent mask substituted in their places according to the best information i have received says moore this same mask is a much more innocent matter than is generally imagined in general it is not intended to conceal the person who wears it but only used as an apology for his not being in full dress with a mask stuck in the hat and a kind of black mantle trimmed with lace of the same color over the shoulders a man is sufficiently dressed for any assembly at venice  those who walk the streets or go to the play houses with masks actually covering their faces are either engaged in some loveintrigue or would have the spectators think so for this is a piece of affectation which prevails here as well as elsewhere and those refined gentlemen who are fond of the reputation though they shrink from the catastrophe of an intrigue are no uncommon characters here i believe this the more readily adds moore because i daily see many feeble gentlemen tottering about in masks for whom a basin of warm restorative soup seems more expedient than the most beautiful woman in venice  one evening at st marks place when a gentleman of my acquaintance was letting me into the secret of this curious piece of affectation he desired me to take notice of a venetian nobleman of his acquaintance who with an air of mystery was conducting a femalemask into his cassino my acquaintance knew him perfectly well and assured me he was the most innocent creature with women he had ever been acquainted with when this gallant person perceived we were looking at him his mask fell to the ground as if by accident and after we had got a complete view of his countenance he put it on with much hurry and immediately rushed with his partner into the cassino  the cassinos are small houses of one or two rooms on a floor neatly fitted up says lady millar but never fine those i saw she adds were papered with india paper and furnished with chintz it is the fashion here for every person of distinction to have one cassino at least and very frequently more they have little pleasure in inhabiting their palaces which are really uncomfortable and by the situation and dimensions rendered extremely melancholy a silent and solitary magnificence reigns throughout interrupted only by the hoarse washing of the sea against the walls which cannot be very exhilarating to the spirits it was therefore most probably in search of cheerfulness recreation and society that cassinos were originally resorted to the greater part of them are situated behind st marks place here small cotteries meet play cards generally sup together on some trifle procured from the pastrycooks and coffeehouses and often pass the night in conversation music or in walking about the place of st mark  these places says moore have the misfortune to labor under a very bad reputation they are accused of being temples entirely consecrated to lawless love and a thousand scandalous tales are told to strangers concerning them tales not believed indeed by the venetians themselves the proof of which is that the cassinos are allowed to exist for it is absurd to imagine that men would suffer their wives to enter such places if they were not convinced that those stories were ill founded nor can we believe after all we have heard of the profligacy of venetian manners that women even of indifferent reputations would attend cassinos in the open manner they do if it were understood that more liberties were taken with them there than elsewhere  the opening before st marks church is the only place in venice where a great number of people can assemble it is the fashion to walk here a great part of the evening to enjoy the music and other amusements and although there are coffeehouses and venetian manners permit ladies as well as gentlemen to frequent them yet it was natural for the noble and most wealthy to prefer little apartments of their own where without being exposed to intrusion they may entertain a few friends in a more easy and unceremonious manner than they could do at their palaces instead of going home to a formal supper and returning afterward to this place of amusement they order coffee lemonade fruit and other refreshments to the cassino  that these little apartments may be occasionally used for the purposes of intrigue is not improbable but that this is the ordinary and avowed purpose for which they are frequented is of all things the least credible  some writers who have described the manners of the venetians as more profligate than those of other nations assert at the same time that the government encourages this profligacy to relax and dissipate the the minds of the people and prevent their planning or attempting any thing against the constitution were this the case it could not be denied that the venetian legislators display their patriotism in a very extraordinary manner and have fallen upon as extraordinary means of rendering their people good subjects they first erect a despotic court to guard the public liberty and next corrupt the morals of the people to keep them from plotting against the state this last piece of refinement however is no more than a conjecture of some theoretical politicians who are apt to take facts for granted without sufficient proof and afterward display their ingenuity in accounting for them that the venetians are more given to sensual pleasures than the inhabitants of london paris or berlin will not be difficult to prove but as the stateinquisitors do not think proper and the ecclesiastical are not allowed to interfere in affairs of gallantry as a great number of strangers assemble twice or thrice a year at venice merely for the sake of amusement and above all as it is the custom to go about in masks an idea prevails that the manners are more licentious here than elsewhere this custom of wearing a mask by conveying the ideas of concealment and disguise has contributed greatly to give some people an impression of venetian profligacy but for my own part says moore it is not a piece of white or black paper with disjointed features that i suspect having often found the most complete worthlessness concealed under a smooth smiling piece of human skin  the custom of cavalieri serventi prevails universally here this usage would appear in a proper light and take off a great part of the odium thrown upon the italians if the cavalieri serventi were called husbands for the real husband or beloved friend of a venetian lady is the cicisbeo the husband married in church is the choice of her friends not by any means of the lady it is from this absurd tyranny that the choosing of cicisbeos and cavalieri serventi has taken its rise and will never be relinquished in italy whilst the same incongruous combinations consist  the venetian ladies have a gay manner of dressing their heads which becomes them extremely when young but appears absurd when age has furrowed over their fine skins and brought them almost to the ground i felt a shock at the sight of a tottering old pair i saw enter a coffeehouse in the place st mark says lady millar they were both shaking with the palsy bearing on each other and supporting themselves by a crutchstick though they were bent almost double by the weight of years and infirmities yet the ladys head was dressed with great care a little rosecoloured hat nicely trimmed with blond was stuck just above her right ear and over her left was a small knot of artificial flowers her few gray hairs behind were tied with ribbon but so thinly scattered over her forehead that large patches of her shrivelled skin appeared between the parting curls the cavaliere was not dressed in the same style all his elegance consisted in an abundance of ivy flowing over his shoulders enquiring who this venerable couple were i learnt that the gentleman had been the faithful cavaliere of the same lady above  0 years that they had regularly frequented the place st mark and the coffee houses and with the most steady constancy had loved each other till age and disease were conducting them both hand in hand to the grave  however a forty years constancy is far from being universal at venice coquettes are to be found there as well as elsewhere i have seen some instances of coquetry at fourscore a donna nobile whom a catarrh and satan had bound lo these eighteen years was sustaining herself on the arm of a brisk cicesbeo about five and twenty  by a late regulation says lady millar the partitions which formed a kind of cells in the lower end of the coffeehouses and into which two or three people might retire and fasten the door are now taken away and the rooms are quite open and public at first the senate had determined to exclude the women entirely from entering them but on their remonstrating very violently against such a measure they were allowed the liberty of appearing publicly but were absolutely forbidden to retire into any private room and the little rooms were without exception ordered to be thrown into the large ones  another law was at the same time promulgated that if any fille de joye is found walking the streets about the place st mark etc for the first offense she is to have her head completely shaved and suffer imprisonment for a time specified and for the second offense her eyebrows are likewise to be shaved she is also to be branded between the eyes and then banished the republic  the courtesans here says northall are the most insinuating and have the most alluring arts of any in all italy  it strikes a person very much says mrs piozzi who has visited other parts of italy to see so very few clergymen at venice and scarce any who have the air or looks of a man of fashion milan though such heavy complaints are daily made of encroachments on churchwealth and church power still swarms with ecclesiastics and in an assembly of  0 people there are scarce ever fewer than  0 or    making nearly one half of the company but here it seems as if the cry of fuori i preti out with the priests which is proclaimed in the council chamber before any vote is suffered to pass into a law were carried in the conversation rooms too for a priest is here less frequent than a clergyman at london and those we see walking about are almost all ordinary men decent and humble in their appearance of a bashful distant carriage resembling the parson of the parish in north wales or the cure du village in the south of france and seem no way related to an abbate of milan or turin and still less to monsieur l abbe at paris  the venetians says mrs piozzi one would imagine have no notion of sleep being necessary to their existence as some or other of them seem constantly in motion and there is no hour in the four and twenty in which the town seems perfectly quiet for what with the marketfolks bringing up the boats from the opposite shore loaded with every produce of nature neatly arranged in their flatbottomed conveyances the coming up of which begins about three in the morning and ends about six  the gondoliers rowing home their masters and mistresses about that hour and so on till eight  the common business of the town which it is then time to begin  the state affairs and pregai which often like our house of commons sit late and detain many gentlemen from their morning amusements  the street orators and mountebanks in the place of st mark  the shops and stalls where chickens ducks etc are sold by auction to the highest bidder  a flourishing fellow with a hammer in his hand shining away in character of an auctioneer  the crowds which fill the courts of judicature when any cause of consequence comes on with the clamorous voices keen observations poignant sarcasms and acute contentions carried on by the advocates who seem more awake than all the rest  all these things take up so much time that fourandtwenty hours do not suffice for the business and diversions of venice where dinner must be eaten as in other places and where such fish wait ones knife and fork as are not to be seen in any sea but this in so great perfection  the ladies who scarce ever dine at all rise about seven in the evening when the gentlemen are just ready to attend them they sit sipping their chocolate on a chair at the coffeehouse door with great tranquillity chatting over the common topics of the day nor do they appear half so shy of each other as the milanese ladies who seldom seem to have any pleasure in the soft converse of a female friend but though certainly no women can be more charming than these venetian ladies they seem to have forgotten the old mythological fable that the youngest of the graces was married to sleep by which it was intended we should consider that state as necessary not only to the reparation of beauty but of youth  the crowds of beggars who infest the streets during the carnival poison the pleasures of society while ladies are eating ice at a coffeehouse door while decent people are hearing mass at the altar while strangers are surveying the beauties of the place  no peace no enjoyment can they obtain for the beggars but though i hope it will be difficult to find a place where fewer alms are given yet i never saw refusals so pleasingly softened as by the manners of the high italians toward the low ladies in particular are so soft mouthed so tender in replying to those who have their lots cast far below them that one feels our own harsh disposition corrected by their sweetness  from the following anecdote by mrs piozzi one would imagine they looked upon the english as little better than heathens a woman of quality says she near whom i sat at a very grand ball enquired how i had passed the morning i named several churches i had looked into particularly that which they esteem beyond the rest as a favorite work of palladio and called the redentore you do very right says she to look at our churches as you have none in england i know  but then you have so many other fine things  such charming steel buttons for example pressing my hand to show that she meant no offense for added she chi pensa duna maniera chi pensa dun altra different people have different ways of thinking  there is a universal politeness here in every rank the people expect a civil deportment from their nobles toward them and they return it with much respect and veneration but should a noble assume an insolent arrogant manner toward his inferior it would not be borne with i was at first says lady millar surprised at the quick transition from the frothy compliments of those who champ the bit of a despotic government and the style of compliment in venice the highest expression in this way being gentil donna which signifies honest woman or woman of honor and upon entering a shop the tradesman addressing me to know what i would have called me cara ella dear she or dear maam when at rome or naples such a man would have styled me excellenza illustrissima  to try venetian ladies by english rules would be worse than the tyranny complained of when a native of india was condemned on the coventry act for flitting his wifes nose which was a common practice in his own country here is no struggle for female education as with us no resources in study no duties of family management no bills of fare to be looked over in the morning no accountbook to be settled at noon no necessity of reading to supply without disgrace the evenings chat no laughing at the cardtable no tittering in the corner if a lapsus linguoe has produced a mistake which malice never fails to record a lady in italy is certain of applause let her take ever so little pains to obtain it  a custom which prevails here of wearing little or no rouge and increasing the native paleness of their skins by scarce lightly wiping the white powder from their faces is a method no frenchwoman of quality would adopt yet the venetians are not behind hand in art of gaining admirers and they do not like their painters depend upon coloring to ensure it  nothing can be a greater proof of the little consequence which dress gives to a woman than the reflection we must make on a venetian ladys mode of appearance in her zindalet without which no one stirs out of their house in a morning it consists of a full black silk petticoat sloped says mrs piozzi just to train a very little on the ground and flounced with gauze of the same color a skeleton wire upon the head such as we use to make up hats throwing loosely over it a large piece of black mode or persian so as to shade the face like a curtain the front being trimmed with a very deep black lace or soufflet gauze infinitely becoming the thin silk that remains to be disposed of they roll back so as to discover the bosom fasten it with a puff before at the top of their stomacher and once more rolling it back from the shape tie it gracefully behind and let it hang in two long ends  the evening ornament is a silk hat shaped like a mans and of the same color with a white or worked lining at most and sometimes one feather a great black silk cloak lined with white and perhaps a narrow border down before with a vast heavy round handkerchief of black lace which lies over neck and shoulders and conceals shape and all completely here is surely little appearance of art no craping or frizzing the hair which is flat at the top all of one length and hanging in long curls about the back or sides as it happens no brown powder and no rouge at all thus without variety does a venetian lady contrive to delight the eye and without much instruction to charm the ear  keysler says there is a particular college instituted at venice to whose care the regulation of dress is committed by the republic none are exempted from the jurisdiction of this college but noblemens wives the two first years after their marriage and strangers the former however are no farther indulged than in wearing a pearl necklace and a gold fringe at the bottom of their gowns and in giving their gondoliers ribbons to wear on their caps but here also as in other countries the women are connived at in this respect particularly the courtesans who readily find patrons under whose protection they trespass against this sumptuary law with impunity though there is sometimes an instance of one or two being fined on that account  all the nobili wear black and the importation of foreign cloth is totally prohibited we have already taken notice of the black lining of the gondolas but this restriction is limited to those belonging to the city of venice for the venetian subjects on the main land are at full liberty as to this article  the noble venetians are even obliged to paint and line their gondolas with black in order to prevent the extravagant expenses that would arise from an emulation to outvie each other in the splendour of these naval equipages foreigners are at liberty to spend what money they please in fine gondolas but few strangers stay long enough in this city to make use of this political indulgence so that the only persons who distinguish themselves splendidly in gondolas are the foreign ministers who always make entries in them on these occasions the gondolas are extremely gay being decorated with the finest paintings gildings and sculpture  strangers are under less restraint in this city respecting many particulars than the native inhabitants there are many who after having tried most of the capitals of europe have preferred living at venice on account of the variety of amusements the gentle manners of the inhabitants and the perfect freedom allowed in every thing except in blaming the measures of government if a stranger is so imprudent to give his tongue liberties in this respect he will either receive a message to leave the territories of the state or one of the sbirri will be sent to accompany him to the popes or the emperors dominions  the houses are thought inconvenient by many of the english they are better calculated however for the climate of italy than if they were built according to the london model the floors which as we have before remarked are of red plaster with a brilliant glossy surface appear much more beautiful than wood and are preferable in case of fire whose progress they are calculated to check  the principal apartments being on the second floor perhaps is owing to their being farther removed from the moisture of the lakes or it may be to their being better lighted and more cheerful though the inhabitants of great britain make use of their first floors for their chief apartments this does not form a complete demonstration that the venetians are in the wrong for preferring the second when an acute sensible people universally follow one custom in a mere matter of convenience however absurd that custom may appear in the eyes of a stranger at first fight it will generally be found that there is some real advantage in it which compensates all the apparent inconvenience of this travelers who do not hurry with too much rapidity through the countries they visit are very sensible for after having had time to weigh every circumstance they often see reason to approve what they had formerly condemned custom and fashion have the greatest influence on our taste of beauty or excellence of every kind what from a variety of causes has become the standard in one country is sometimes just the contrary in another the same thing that makes a lowbrimmed hat appear genteel at one time makes it ridiculous at another  chap v amusements of all the diversions which this city affords to strangers the carnival is generally accounted the principal one young persons who seek for entertainment only in debauchery and exorbitant licentiousness may at this time if not satiate their desires at least tire themselves but the diversions at this and other festivals especially on ascensionday are of such a nature that to take an habitual delight in such a dissolute manner of living a person must have laid aside all regard to decency and morality  the courtezans who tender their services here at this time are the most abandoned wretches and lost to all sense of modesty and decorum and for the most part have been for their debaucheries and villainies driven out of the neighboring imperial dominions often bearing on their backs marks of the punished more than once suffered by the hands of the common hangman  the italians in general are excessively fond of masquerades and go generally masked during the whole time of the carnival the masquerade dress at venice consists only of a nightgown or a cloak with a mask on the face the general use of masks prevents a stranger from making any acquaintance at this season and likewise from seeing any curiosities for no person is permitted to go into a church or convent in any kind of disguise  a stranger is soon tired of the ridotto at venice and as the purses of most travelers will not allow them to game very high it would be imprudent in a foreigner to engage too far in this diversion especially as the cards are different from what he has been used to none but noble venetians hold the banco or bank as it is called in the ridottoroom close by every banker sit two ladies in masks who are allowed to put him in mind of any mistakes he may chance to commit to his disadvantage the bankers are unmasked but the punters keep them on no mask is denied admittance into the ridottoroom so that it may be well conceived what inconveniences one must suffer from such a crowd  the grand scene of all the follies acted during the carnival is st marks place where mountebanks buffoons and others whose profession is to make a prey of the simple vulgar have their stages and exhibit their shows but the most ridiculous figures among the rest are the old women or old men who sit upon a table and are consulted like oracles concerning future events the success of enterprises etc that among such a multitude of people this may be done without confusion and with the greater secrecy these fortune tellers make use of a long speakingtrumpet through which the consulter conveys his queries by a whisper whilst the conjurer conveys his ear to the large opening and inverts the trumpet to resolve the questions proposed amidst the pity which naturally must arise in the human breast at any instance of weakness or wickedness that debase rational creatures a person can scarce forbear smiling to see poor simple girls coming up to these fortune tellers whose looks and gestures betray their fear and confusion to enquire about their fate with regard to their amors etc to raise the higher ideas of their abilities these impostors are sure to place on their table some paltry globes or other astronomical instruments even ecclesiastics both regular and secular have been known openly to have recourse to these fortune tellers  in the colonade or cloister round st marks place are several coffeehouses as we have before observed but which are frequented mostly by foreigners formerly the company used to fit and converse together at their ease in these coffeehouses but this custom has been for some time prohibited this was owing to a discovery made during the carnival the son of the imperial envoy had made use of this opportunity when masked to discourse with several of the venetian nobility and since that time no benches or chairs have been allowed in the coffeehouses of this city  it is not only during the carnival but on several other occasions that masks are allowed namely on the four days that the republic holds its grand feasts at the regata or boatraces and other entertainments for the diversion of foreign princes at the nuptials of one of the nobles on the election of the procurators of st mark or on the public entry of a foreign ambassador etc these opportunities says keysler the venetian ladies wait for with the most eager impatience but the husbands are no less on their guard to secure the honor of the marriage bed however as the commerce between the sexes has undergone great alterations since the beginning of this century this is also the case at venice where ladies of character not only receive male visitors in the morning when in an undress but accept of invitations to entertainments in mixed companies and even to treats at taverns but there are parties where foreigners are seldom or ever admitted unless known to some of the principal persons of the company  on the last thursday of the carnival when licentiousness is carried to its greatest height bulls are baited in several streets and in st marks place but these may be seen at other times  the turkish sailor gave no bad account of a carnival when he told his mohammedan friends on his return to turkey that the poor christians were all disordered in their senses and nearly in a state of actual madness while he remained among them till one day on a sudden they luckly found out a certain gray powder that cured such symptoms and laying it on their heads one wednesday morning the wits of all the inhabitants were restored instantaneously and the people grew sober quiet composed and went about their business just like other folks he meant the ashes strewed on the heads of catholics during lent which ceremony is more strictly observed in venice than in any other catholic countries  on ascensionday in the afternoon several hundred boats and gondolas may be seen rowing for wagers on the canal di murano and their dexterity in keeping clear of each other tacking about etc is very surprising in most of the gondolas on this day are masks and music and a universal emulation appears among them who shall divert themselves most  when any foreign prince of distinction arrives at venice the republic generally entertains him with a regatta or rowing matches of gondolas on the great canal the word regatta seems to be derived from the aurigatio or chariotraces of the circensian games  formerly another diversion was exhibited at this season on a bridge near st barnabys church which was an engagement betwixt the castellani and nicolati during this mock battle several persons on both sides are thrown into the water this bridge is seven common paces broad eighteen long and without any fence and when such an engagement was going to be exhibited the water under it was made deeper than usual the combatants were not allowed to scratch or seize one another but only to show their strength and address with their arms and fists but this diversion has been suppressed for some time having once occasioned a dangerous tumult when the populace assaulted with stones the houses where the nobles were posted to view the battle and encourage the combatants  among the several shows that are annually exhibited during the carnival addison mentions one that is odd enough and particular to the venetians a set of artisans by the several poles which they lay across each others shoulders build themselves up into a kind of pyramid so that you see a pile of men in the air of four or five rows rising one above another the weight is so equally distributed that every man is very well able to bear his part of it the stories if they may be so called growing less and less as they advance higher and higher a little boy represents the point of the pyramid who after a short space leaps off with a great deal of dexterity into the arms of one that catches him at the bottom in the same manner the whole building falls to pieces we have seen this exhibited at a place of entertainment in london i have been the more particular in this says addison because it explains the following verse of claudian which shows that the venetians are not the inventors of this trick  vel qui more avium sese jaculantur in auras corporaque oedificant celeri crescentia nexu quorum compositam puer augmentatus in arcem emicat and vinctus plantoe vel cruribus hoerens pendula librato figit vestigia saltu claud men piled on men with active leaps arise and build the breathing fabric to the skies a sprightly youth above the topmost row points the tall pyramid and crowns the show the italian plays in general remarks keysler are wretched performances and those of venice are not at all better than the rest as the whole design of the actors is to raise a laugh in the audience to that purpose they employ all manner of grimaces postures and distortions which sometimes border upon obscenity  the italian opera may be very justly reckoned among the principal diversions both of the carnival and the ascension week in this particular the italians unquestionably surpass all other nations and nothing but an insupportable vanity can make the french bring their music in competition with that of italy the decorations of the theater of paris are indeed scarce to be exceeded and the dances and interludes between the acts are excellent but in the composition of the opera and the executive part the french are much inferior to the italians their airs for the most part resemble drinking songs and have so little variety that the repetition of the same sounds must be tiresome to a nice car when a new opera is exhibited if the french audience cannot make themselves masters of the airs so as to be able to join with the performers in singing them on the second night they are displeased with them but in the italian theater the case is different for though the latter have naturally a great fondness and genius for music yet they are sensible it requires a much longer time to be able to imitate the fine airs of their singers  interludes which consist of drolleries of all kinds accompanied with suitable songs are introduced between the acts of the opera on the italian stage in order to divert the audience ballads and dances are also frequently exhibited but these are not to be compared with the opera dances at paris  there are no less than seven theaters at venice two of these are commonly appropriated to the serious operas two to comic operas and the other three to plays but they are all open only during the carnival which begins on st stephen and continues till lent and then they are all full every night in autumn the houses are open for the comic operas and plays and at the ascension there is a serious opera a trifle is paid at the door for admittance this entitles a person to go into the pit where he may look about and determine what part of the house he will sit in there are rows of chairs toward the front the seats of which sold back and are locked those who choose to occupy them pay a little more money to the doorkeeper who immediately unlocks the seat very decent people occupy these chairs but the back part of the pit is filled with footmen and gondoliers in their common working clothes the nobility and better sort of citizens have boxes retained for the year but there is always a sufficient number to be let to strangers the price of them varies every night according to the season of the year and the piece to be acted  a venetian playhouse has a dismal appearance in the eyes of people accustomed to the brilliancy of those in london many of the boxes are so dark that the faces of the company in them can hardly be distinguished at a little distance even when they do not wear masks the stage however is well illuminated so that the people in the boxes can see perfectly well every thing that is transacted there and when they choose to be seen themselves they order lights into the boxes between the acts ladies may sometimes be seen walking about with their cavalieri serventi in the back part of the pit when it is not crowded as they are masked they do not scruple to reconnoitre the company with their spyingglasses from this place when the play begins they return to their boxes this continual moving about from box to box and between the boxes and the pit must create some confusion and no doubt is disagreeable to those who attend merely on account of the piece there must be found some douceur at least in the midst of all this obscurity and confusion which in the opinion of the majority of the audience overbalances these inconveniences  the music of the opera here is reckoned as fine as in any town in italy the dramatic and poetic part of these pieces is little regarded provided the music receives the approbation of the critics it is certainly happy for a man to have a taste for fine music because he has by this means one source of enjoyment more than those whose auditory nerves are less delicately strung it is however equally absurd to affect an excessive delight in things which nature has not framed us to enjoy yet how many people may be seen doing painful penance in the operahouse at the haymarket and in the midst of unsuppressible yawnings calling out charming exquisite bravissimo etc  it is amazing what pains some people take to render themselves ridiculous and it is a matter of real curiosity to observe in what various shapes the little despicable spirit of affectation shows itself among mankind  i remember says moore a very honest gentleman who understood little or no french but having picked up a few phrases he brought them forward on every occasion and affected among his neighbors in the country the most perfect knowledge and the highest admiration of that language when any person in compliance with his taste uttered a sentence in that tongue though my good friend did not understand a syllable of it yet he never failed to nod and smile to the speaker with the most knowing air imaginable the parson of the parish at a country dinner once addressed him in these emphatic words monsieur je trouve ce plum pudding extremement bon which happening not to be in my friends collection of phrases he did not comprehend he nodded and smiled to the clergyman however in his usual intelligent manner but a person who sat near him being struck with the sagacious and important tone in which the observation had been delivered begged of my friend to explain it in english on which after some hesitation he declared that the turn of the expression was so genteel and so exquisitely adapted to the french idiom that it could not be rendered into english without losing a great deal of the original beauty of the sentiment  at the comic opera continues moore i have sometimes seen action alone excite the highest applause independent either of the poetry or the music i saw a duo performed by an old man and a young woman supposed to be his daughter in such a humourous manner as drew an universal encore from the spectators though the merit of the musical part of the composition was but very moderate  the father informs his daughter in a song he had found an excellent match for her who besides being rich very prudent and not too young was a particular friend of his own and in person and disposition not unlike himself he concludes by telling her the ceremony shall be performed next day she thanks him in the gayest air possible for his obliging intentions adding that she should have been glad to have shown her implicit obedience to his commands had there been any chance of the mans being to her taste but as from the account given there could be none she declares she will not marry him the next day and adds with a very long quaver that if she were to live to all eternity she should continue of the same opinion the father in a violent rage tells her instead of tomorrow the marriage shall take place that very day to which she replies non he rejoins si she non non he si si the daughter non non non the father si si si and so the singing continued five or six minutes there is certainly nothing marvellously witty in this and for a daughter to be of a different opinion from her father in the choice of a husband is not a very new dramatic incident the duo however was encored and performed a second time with more humor than the first the whole house vociferates for it again and it was sung a third time in a manner equally pleasant and yet perfectly different from any of the former two i thought the house would have been brought down about our ears so extravagant were the testimonies of approbation the two actors were now obliged to appear again and sing this duo a fourth time which they executed in a style so new so natural and so exquisitely droll that the audience now thought there had been something deficient in all their former performances and that they had hit on the true comic only this last time some people began to call for it again but the old man now quite exhausted begged for mercy on which the point was given up i never before concludes moore had any idea that such strong comic powers could have been displayed in the warbling of a song  the dancing is an essential part of the entertainment at the opera here as well as at london there is certainly a much greater proportion of mankind deaf to the delights of music than blind to the beauties of fine dancing during the singing and recitative the fingers often sing for a considerable time without any ones minding them but the moment the ballet begins private conversation though pretty universal before is immediately at an end and the eyes of all the spectators are fixed on the stage this to be sure has always been the case in london and in spite of the pains some people take to conceal it we all know the reason but to find this same preference of dancing to music in italy is worthy of reason  the comedies says addison that i saw at venice or indeed in any other part of italy are very different and more lewd than those of other countries their poets have no notion of genteel comedy and fall into the most filthy double meanings imaginable when they have a mind to make their audience merry there is no part generally so wretched as that of the fine gentleman especially when he converses with his mistress for then the whole dialogue is an insipid mixture of pedantry and romance but it is no wonder that the poets of so jealous and reserved a nation fail in such conversation on the stage which they have no patterns of in nature there are four standing characters which enter into every piece that come on the stage the doctor harlequin pantalone and coviello the doctors character comprehends the whole extent of a pedant that with a deep voice and a magisterial air breaks in upon conversation and drives down all before him every thing he says is backed with quotations out of galen hippocrates plato virgil or any author that rises uppermost and all answers from his companion are looked upon as impertinences or interruptions harlequins part is made up of blunders and absurdities he is to mistake one man for another to forget his errands to stumble over queens and to run his head against a post that stands in his way this all attended with something so comical in the voice and gestures that a man who is sensible of the folly of the part can hardly forbear being pleased with it pantalone is generally an old cully and coviello a sharper  moore makes the same remarks i had got says this writer i dont know how the most contemptuous opinion of the italian drama i had been told there was not a tolerable actor in italy and had been long taught to consider their comedy as the most despicable stuff in the world which could not amuse or even draw a smile from any person of taste impressed with these sentiments i visited one of the playhouses in this city the piece was a comedy and the most entertaining character in it was that of a man who stuttered in this defect and in the singular grimaces which accompanied it consisted a great part of the amusement disgusted at such a pitiful substitution for wit and humor i expressed a contempt for an audience which could be entertained with such buffoonery and who could take pleasure in a natural infirmity while we inwardly indulged sentiments of selfapprobation on account of the refinement and superiority of our taste and supported the dignity of those sentiments by a disdainful gravity of countenance the stutterer was giving a piece of information to harlequin which greatly interested him and to which he listened with every mark of eagerness the unfortunate speaker had just arrived at the most important part of his narrative which was to acquaint the impatient listener where his mistress was concealed when he unluckily stumbled on a word of six or seven syllables which completely obstructed the progress of his narration he attempted it again and again but always without success you may have observed that though many other words would explain his meaning equally well you may as soon make a saint change his religion as prevail on a stutterer to accept of another word in place of the one at which he has stumbled he adheres to his first word to the last and will sooner expire with it in his throat than give it up for any other you may offer harlequin on the present occasion presented his friend with a dozen but he rejected them all with disdain and persisted in his unsuccessful attempts on that which had first come in his way at length making a desperate effort when all the spectators were gaping in expectation of his safe delivery the cruel word came up with its broad side foremost and stuck directly across the unhappy mans windpipe he gaped and panted and croaked his face flushed and his eyes seemed ready to start from his head harlequin unbuttoned the stutterers waistcoat and the neck of his shirt he fanned his face with his cap and held a bottle of hartshorn to his nose at length fearing his unhappy patient would expire before he could give the desired intelligence in a fit of despair he pitched his head full in the dying mans stomach and the word bolted out at his mouth to the most distant part of the house this was performed in a manner so perfectly droll and the humorous absurdity of the expedient came so unexpectedly upon me that i immediately burst into a most excessive fit of laughter in which i was accompanied by the friends who were with me and our laughter continued in such loud violent and repeated fits that the attention of the audience being turned from the stage to our box occasioned a renewal of the mirth all over the playhouse with greater vociferation than at first on return to our hotel i was asked if i were as much convinced as ever that a man must be perfectly devoid of taste who could condescend to laugh at an italian comedy when the theaters are open all the world goes there particularly in the season of the carnival where the barcaroles or gondoliers make so great a figure that it is said of them what bickerstaff said of the trunkmaker in the tatler that what they censure or applaud is generally condemned or approved by the public in short that it is the barcaroles who decide the fate of an opera or play these barcaroles says sharp are certainly such a body of sober men as in england we have no instance of among the lower class of people in masquerade time however they indulge the taste of gaming and doubtless often play with the nobles their masters but the brownness and coarseness of their hands betray their occupation besides it is impossible for them to forbear making their boasts or their complaints of good and bad fortune when their dialect and deportment never fail to discover them  the number as well as character of these people renders their body very respectable when one considers that in all the great families every gentleman keeps a distinct gondola rowed by two men except some few who have but one rower it will be readily conceived that the number of barcaroles must be very considerable they are exceedingly proud of their station and with some reason for their profession leads them into the company of the greatest men of the state and it is the fashion to converse with them to hear their wit and humor and applaud every thing they say besides the pay of a barcarole is about eighteen pence english with liveries and little perquisites which in so cheap a country is a plentiful income to a sober man accordingly it is notorious that all of them can afford to marry and do marry  we shall conclude this account of their amusements with the ceremony of a venetian wedding and the dress of the bride as described by lady millar the procession of the gondolas to the church was very fine the gondoliers dressed in gold and silver stuffs made a most brilliant contrast with the blackness of their boats the pillars and walls of the church were covered with crimson damask fringed with gold the altar richly adorned with lace and flowers and the steps up to it spread over with persian carpets and the whole church was illuminated with large wax tapers though at noon day  as soon as the company were disembarked from their gondolas they formed themselves into a regular procession the ladies walked two and two they were all dressed in thin black silk gowns except the bride with large hoops the gowns are straitbodied with very long trains like the courtdresses worn at versailles their trains tucked up on one side of the hoop with a prodigious large tassel of diamonds their sleeves were covered up to the shoulders with falls of the finest brussels lace a drawn tucker of the same round the bosom adorned with rows of the finest pearl each as large as a moderate gooseberry till the rows descended below the top of the stomacher then two ropes of pearls which came from the back of the neck were caught up at the left side of the stomacher and finished in two fine tassels their heads were dressed prodigiously high in a vast number of buckles and two long drop curls in the neck a great number of diamond pins and strings of pearl adorned their heads with large sultanes or feathers on one side and magnificent diamond earrings  the bride was dressed in cloth of silver made in the same fashion and decorated in the same manner with the other ladies but her bosom was quite bare and she had a fine diamond necklace and an enormous bouquet of natural flowers her hair was dressed as high as the others with this difference that it was in curls behind as well as before these curls had a singular appearance but not near so good an effect as the heads of the other ladies whose hair was plaited in large folds and appeared much more graceful her diamonds were very fine and in great a venetian wedding profusion all the ladies that walked about sixty in number were relations or intimate friends to the young couple many of them extremely handsome the men appeared to me all alike they were dressed in black gowns like lawyers with immense perriwigs  chap vi constitution and government the supreme authority is lodged in the hands of the nobility who are said to be in number near  000 on the birth of a noblemans son his name is entered in the golden book otherwise he forfeits his nobility every nobleman is indeed a member of the senate and on this account it is a received maxim that they are all equal in dignity but the difference notwithstanding between the interest and authority of families is very considerable crowned heads german and other princes have not thought it any degradation to be made nobles of venice  the head of the republic is the doge or duke who on the demise of the former is chosen in the following manner which is not a little complicated all the noblemen above thirty years of age meet in the palace of st mark where an equal number of balls to the persons present are put into an urn thirty of these are gilded and the others silvered over every nobleman in his turn takes out a balls and they who have drawn the thirty gilt balls retire into a chamber to continue the election these thirty electors draw from another urn in which are twentyone silvered and nine gilded balls they who draw the gilded balls nominate forty other electors which are again by lot reduced to twelve who name five and twenty these five and twenty draw lots a second time to be reduced to nine and of these nine each chooses five others making in all fortyfive and from these fortyfive eleven are separated again by lot who choose fortyone others these fortyone are then shut up in a chamber of the ducal palace and there remain till they have chosen a new doge the result of their determination is generally known in six or eight hours to the due and legal election of a doge it is required that out of the fortyone he should have five and twenty votes his election is followed by a kind of coronation the ducal cap the forepart of which projects as a mark of the unlimited power of the republic being placed with great ceremony on his head  the doge has been very justly defined to be in habit and state a king in authority a counselor in the city a prisoner and out of it a private person he is not so much as to stir from the city without the councils permission at present his privileges consist in the following leading particulars   that the coin be stamped with his name but not with his image   that all the credentials of the ministers of the republics to foreign courts be made out in his name but without his signature or seal   that all dispatches from foreign courts be directed to him which however he is not to open but in presence of some of the council   that he is to act as the president of all assemblies   that within venice he is to have the state of a sovereign prince and to be styled serenissime   that he is to uncover himself only before sovereigns and princes of royal blood and cardinals   lastly that his family is not to be subject to any sumptuary laws his yearly income is   000 ducats of this sum he must spend one half on the four grand entertainments which he is obliged to give every year and to live up to his dignity he must also spend considerably of his own fortune  among the restrictions laid upon him are the following his sons and brothers are excluded from all considerable offices and incapable of being sent on embassies as long as he lives and without the senates consent they are not to accept of a fief from a foreign prince or a benefice from the pope even the doge himself is not to marry the sister or relation of a prince without the permission of the great council on his demise his administration is strictly enquired into and frequent opportunities taken of laying a heavy fine on his heirs for maladministration even in his lifetime he is subject to the decree of the state inquisition the president of which may at all hours go into his most secret closets and search his bed and all his writings while the doge dares not express the least disgust or resentment in state affairs he cannot do the least thing nor go out of the city without the consent of the senate and during his stay on the terra firma he is looked on no more than a private gentleman under such disagreeable circumstances if it were not a flagrant truth that the human heart idolizes every thing which has a splendid exterior we should conclude that the dignity of a venetian doge would be rather avoided than eagerly sought after  in the grand council all nobles of the age of twentyfive years may take their place though some younger find means to obtain admittance it usually meets on sundays and holidays in the large hall of the ducal place and when all the nobility are present consists of near  000 persons  the senate or pregadi are a committee of the grand council by whom they are also chosen this senate has the management of the most secret and important state affairs such as making alliances declaring war sending ambassadors coining money sitting up offices imposing taxes etc it consists of about  00 persons  the third council is called the collegium and consists of the doge his six counselors and one or two others in this council letters and instruments relating to the state are read ambassadors are admitted to audience and other important affairs are transacted  the procurators of st mark were at first only appointed as commissioners to superintend the building of the church but in time wills guardianships and making a proper provision for the poor fell under their jurisdiction this office is reckoned the more considerable because it is held for life the procurators of st mark are at present but nine in number when the state is distressed for money the title may be acquired by advancing a considerable sum  the council often is a high penal court which in fact consists of seventeen members for besides the ten noblemen chosen annually by the grand council from which number this court receives its name the doge presides and the six counselors attached to the doge assist when they think proper at all deliberations  the council is supreme in all crimes against the state it is the duty of three chiefs chosen every month from this court by lot to open all letters addressed to it to report the contents and assemble the members when they think proper they have the power of seizing accused persons examining them in prison and taking their answers in writing with the evidence against them which being laid before the court these chiefs appear as prosecutors  the prisoners all this time are kept in close confinement deprived of the company of relations and friends and not allowed to receive any advice by letters they can have no counsel to assist them unless one of the judges chooses to assume that office in which case he is permitted to manage their defense and plead their cause after which the court decides by a majority of votes acquitting the prisoner or condemning him to private or public execution as they think proper and if any persons murmur at the fate of their relations or friends and talk of their innocence and the injustice they have met with these malcontents are in great danger of meeting with the same fate  out of this court the grand council of venice in the year   0  thought proper to create the tribunal of stateinquisitors which is still more despotic and brief in its manner of proceeding  this court consists of three members only all taken from the council of ten two literally from the ten and the third from the counselors of the doge who also make part of that council  these three persons have the power of deciding without appeal on the lives of every citizen belonging to the venetian state the highest of the nobility even the doge himself not being excepted they keep the keys of the boxes into which anonymous informations are thrown the informers who expect a recompense cut off a little piece of their letter which they afterward show to the inquisitor when they claim a reward to these three inquisitors is given the right of employing spies considering secret intelligence issuing orders to seize all persons whose words or actions they think reprehensible and afterward trying them when they think proper if all the three are of one opinion no farther ceremony is necessary they may order the prisoner to be strangled in prison drowned in the canal orfano hanged privately in the night between the pillars or executed publicly as they please and whatever their decision be no further inquisition can be made on the subject but if any one of the three differs from his brethren the cause must be carried before the full assembly of the council often one would naturally imagine that by those the prisoner might have a good chance of being acquitted because the difference in opinion of the three inquisitors shows that the case is at least dubious and in dubious cases this court is governed by maxims different from that of others it is a rule here to admit of smaller presumptions in all crimes which affect the government than in other cases and the only difference they make between a crime fully proved and one more doubtful is that in the first case the execution is in broad daylight but when there are doubts of the prisoners guilt he is put to death privately the state inquisitors have keys to every apartment of the ducal palace and can when they think proper penetrate into the very bedchamber of the doge open his cabinet and examine his papers of course they may command access to the house of every individual in the state they continue in office only one year but are not responsible afterward for their conduct while they were in authority  what would our modern patriots think if they lived in the same city with three persons who had the power of shutting them up in a dungeon and putting them to death when they pleased and without being accountable for so doing if from the characters of the inquisitors of one year a man had nothing to dread still he might fear that a set of a different character might be in authority the next and although he were persuaded that the inquisitors would always be chosen from among men of the most known integrity in the state he might tremble at the malice of secret informers and enemies a combination of whom might impose on the understanding of upright judges especially where the accused is excluded from his friends and denied counsel to assist him in his defense for let him be never so conscious of innocence he cannot be sure of remaining unsuspected or unaccused nor can he be certain that he shall not be put to the rack to supply a deficiency of evidence and finally though a man possessed of so much firmness of character as to feel no inquietude from any of their considerations on his own account he might still be under apprehensions for his children and other connections for whom some men feel more anxiety than for themselves  if a nobleman declines an office to which he has been elected he is obliged to pay a fine of  000 ducats and is excluded from the great council and likewise from the broglio for the space of two years the nobili are not allowed to hold any lands or fiefs on the terra firma but gardens and houses of pleasure are not included in this prohibition a noble venetian who enters into holy orders is excluded from the great council and all public employments and this law extends even to such as are made knights of malta none of the nobility must take presents pensions or receive any order of knighthood from foreign states the relations of such venetians as are cardinals are excluded from all deliberations in the council respecting ecclesiastical affairs no person enjoys more than one office at the same time be it ever so considerable no one must congratulate any person in his obtaining a part in the government except he is promoted to be doge or procurator of st mark nor must he solicit any judge but on criminal processes in the division of hereditary estates the eldest son of a noble venetian has no advantage over his younger brothers by which means several families are reduced to poverty especially as they are not allowed to mend their circumstances by trade or commerce it is hardly credible what a mean appearance several persons among the nobility make in the streets of venice by the shabbiness of their dress etc many of them are not able to keep a servant so that they are obliged to buy their provisions even in the market and carry them home along the public streets when there are several brothers in a family in order to prevent their falling thus into contempt by their poverty only one of them marries but by this practice not only the increase of the nobility is hindered but a great many scandalous cries are likewise propagated among the rest of the brothers which are committed at venice in a most flagrant manner without shame or concealment keeping a mistress is looked upon as an undoubted privilege belonging to a noble venetian and when one by reason of his poverty cannot keep a mistress for his own use alone he enters into a copartnership with three or four indigent persons who all contribute to support her and enjoy her company by turns  many people are surprised that in a government so very jealous of its power as that of venice there is no military establishment within the city to support the executive power and repress any popular commotion this is supposed to proceed from the jealousy of the government lest a few rich and powerful nobles should corrupt the garrison and gain over the commander to any ambitious plan of their own for the destruction of the constitution  but although there is no formal garrison in a military uniform there is a real effective force sufficient to suppress any popular commotion at the command of the senate and council of ten this force besides the sbirri consists of a great number of stout fellows who without any distinguishing dress are kept in the pay of government and are at the command of that council there is also the whole body of the gondoliers the most hardy and daring of the common venetians this body of men are greatly attached to the nobility from whom they have most of their employment and with whom they acquire a certain degree of familiarity by passing great part of their time shut up in boats in their company and by being privy to many of their love intrigues great numbers of these gondoliers are in the service of particular nobles and there is no doubt that in case of any popular insurrection the whole would take the side of the nobility and senate against the people in short they may be considered as a kind of standing militia ready to rise as soon as the government required their services  lastly there is the grand council itself which in case of any violent commotion of the citizens and populace could be armed directly from the small arsenal within the ducal palace and would prove a very formidable force against an unarmed multitude for the laws of venice forbid under pain of death any citizen to carry firearms a law which is very exactly executed by the state inquisitors  by these means the executive power of government is as irresistible at venice as at petersburgh or constantinople  there is unquestionably much reflection and great depth of thought in the formation of the political constitution of venice but remark some writers it would be more admirable if the council of ten and state inquisitors had never formed any part of it this institution say they destroys the effect of all the rest and is worse than the fixed and permanent tyranny of one person for that persons character and maxims would be known and by endeavoring to conform themselves to his way of thinking people might have some chance of living unmolested but according to this plan they have a freethinker for their tyrant today and a bigot to morrow one year a set of inquisitors who consider certain parts of conduct as innocent which in the sight of their successors may appear statecrimes so that men know not what they have to depend on a universal jealousy must therefore prevail and precautions will be used to avoid the suspicions of government unknown in any other country accordingly we find that the noble venetians are afraid of having any intercourse with foreign ambassadors or with foreigners of any kind they are even cautious of visiting at each others houses and hardly ever have meetings together except at the courts or in the broglio the boasted secrecy of their public councils proceeds in all probability from the same principle of fear if all conversation on public affairs were forbid under pain of death and if the members of the british parliament were liable to be seized in the night by general warrants and hanged at tyburn or drowned in the thames at the pleasure of the secretaries of state the world would know as little of what passes in either house of parliament as they do of what is transacted in the senate of venice  it is not safe for a noble venetian to acquire in a high degree the love and confidence of the common people this excites the jealousy of the inquisitors and proves a pretty certain means of excluding him from any of the high offices a government which displays so much distrust and suspicion when there is little or no ground will not fail to show marks of the same disposition when in the general opinion there is some reason to be circumspect  though it is forbid the nobility and clergy to hold any communication with strangers upon politics or affairs of state yet it is remarked that the gondoliers are exceeding ready to talk upon these or any other subjects with all who give them the smallest encouragement those who are not in the immediate service of any particular nobleman are often retained by government as spies upon strangers it is said that while these fellows row their gondolas in seeming inattention to the conversation they are taking notice of every thing which is said that they may report it to their employers when they imagine it any way concerns the government as soon as a stranger arrives the gondoliers who brought him to venice repair to a certain office and give information where they took him up to what house they conducted him and any other particulars they may have picked up  the citizens form a respectable body in the state and though they are excluded from the senate they may hold some very lucrative and important offices by applying to the arts and sciences which are encouraged at venice they have a fair chance of living agreeably and laying up a competency for their families private property is no where better secured than at venice and though she no longer enjoys the trade of asia without competitors yet her commerce is still considerable and many individuals acquire great wealth by trade the manufactories established here employ all the industrious poor and prevent that squalid beggary that pilfering and robbery one or other or all of which prevail in most other countries of europe  their subjects on the terra firma are not at all oppressed the senate has found that mild treatment and good usage are the best policy and more effectual than armies in preventing revolts the podestas therefore are not allowed to abuse their power by treating the people with severity or injustice those governors know that any complaints produced against them will be scrutinized by the senate very carefully this prevents many abuses of power on their part and makes the neighboring prince which formerly belonged to this state regret the chance of war which ravished them from the equitable government of their ancient masters  the republic is extremely rigid in the observance of quarantine and considering that they border on those countries where the plague so frequently rages they cannot be too circumspect there is not the least connivance ever practiced all letters to whomsoever directed are first opened by the officers and then smoaked before they are delivered a few years since a boy got on board one of the vessels performing quarantine and stole some tobacco he was pursued into venice and shot dead in the streets there are many customhouse officers in their boats watching the vessels performing quarantine night and day who would certainly kill the first man who should attempt to go on shore before it was expired  the republic is divided into eleven general governments no nobleman indebted to the state is permitted to vote in the senate commerce and all menial occupations are forbidden them if a nobleman is in distressed circumstances he has generally some appointment given him by the senate  there is great opportunity for chicanery in the courts of law as each province has its particular customs and privileges  the mode of pleading in their courts of law is very singular and gives their lawyers more the appearance of a demoniac than of a man endeavoring by sound reason to convince the judges and the audience of the justice of his clients cause every advocate mounts into a small pulpit where he opens his harangue with some gentleness but does not long contain himself within those limits his voice soon cracks and what is very remarkable the beginning of most sentences whilst he is under agitation or seeming enthusiasm in pleading is at a pitch above his natural voice so as to occasion a wonderful discord then if he means to be very emphatical he strikes the pulpit with his hands five or six times together as quick as thought stamping at the same time so as to make the great room resound with this species of oratory at length in the fury of his argument he descends from the pulpit runs about pleading on the floor returns in a violent passion back again to the pulpit thwarts it with his hands more than at first and continues in this rage running up and down the pulpit several times till he has finished his harangue his wig all this while seems to be in continual danger of dropping from his head and this not uncommonly happens  this republic has now existed above fourteen hundred years which is the more extraordinary considering the great number of enemies it has had and the ruinous and expensive wars in which it has been engaged but its power never shone with so much luster as during the famous league of cambray when almost all the powers of europe were combined to its overthrow  in effect the emperor maximilian louis xii ferdinand king of spain henry viii king of england the pope all the princes of italy in short the grand turk all leagued together against it which made it generally supposed that its total downfall was at hand however its conduct was so admirable that after having lost a great part of its territories which it could not defend in its first moment of attack it recovered them shortly after and even put to slight the emperor who had advanced at the head of an army of  00000 men in full confidence to erase the very foundations of its capital  chap vii revenue army navy etc the annual revenue of the republic is computed at twentysix millions and a half of french livres of which the capital alone furnishes twelve millions the expenditure is made to amount only to twentyfour millions consequently there is an annual surplus of two millions of french livres by a regulation made in the year      half a million is allotted every year for defraying the national debt the interest of which at that time amounted to five millions of livres three hundred thousand livres are annually expended in presents to the grand signior and the piratical states of barbary in time of war both the nobles and the other subjects even the doge contribute proportionably to their income toward defraying the public expenses  in the army the republic makes little use of such of its subjects as live under heavy oppressions the flower of its infantry consists of thirteen regiments of dalmatians men of great resolution but more expert in the use of the sword than of fire arms the swiss also on occasion furnish  000 men to be paid by the republic their army is said to consist of  0000 men owing to the jealousy of the superior officers some distinguished foreigner is appointed commander in chief but to him are joined two proveditori generali without whose consent he can do nothing  each province has likewise its separate militia and is besides obliged to furnish a certain number of its inhabitants to be exercised in the maneuvers of the artillery  the naval force of the republic is also considerable amounting according to public accounts to fourteen men of war twenty galleasses and twentyfive galleys commanded by a captain general who is always one of the principal nobility under him is the proveditore generale di mare and other great officers  in time of war it is said the venetians can equip near thirty ships of the line in time of peace there are    or   000 sailors employed which in war time may be increased to  0000 from the provinces of dogado and istria  venice formerly held the first rank among the trading cities or rather the trading nations of europe and her declension from so brilliant an honor is chiefly owing to two causes the discovery of the cape of good hope and the prohibiting of the nobility from commerce  before the discovery of the cape of good hope she was the staple both of europe and asia the broker for all the various sorts of merchandise within the commerce of those two parts of the world and likewise the bank of that opulence by which it is carried on in a word with only the pisans and genoese for competitors she supplied all that holland england and france do at present allowing however for the increase produced by luxury  this commerce made the greater figure as it was carried on by the nobility and the first houses of the state which being governed by the spirit of those houses had in its wars conquests and treaties its principal eye on the prosperity of trade  what a difference between such a spirit and that of the chief states of europe at the very same time among them trade was left to the jews and lombards the sovereigns and every petty lord of our northern counties looking on it as no more than an expedient which they daily made use of by heavy impositions to enrich their treasury and which they often drained by extraordinary burdens of which history furnishes too many instances these losses however the lombards and jews made up by the enormous usuries which sovereigns used to connive at in hopes of coming in for a share hence the general contempt and detestation for trade or those who followed it hence likewise the principles then laid down by the schoolmen concerning usury principles in which all the revolutions in the several branches of commerce have not yet made any change in nations who in other respects are not wanting in perspicacity how very different were the ideas of those dark ages from those which the author of the noblesse commercante has placed in so strong a light as the latter have gained ground in the rest of europe they have declined at venice which now makes no less difference between a nobleman and trader than a native of france does between a peer and a shoeblack  toward the beginning of the fifteenth century the plain old fashioned ideas being superceded by the chimera of military glory the system of the republic underwent a great change she aspired to conquests without any regard to commerce and this romantic nation alienated the nobility from trade which had ever made their most solid greatness and the republic was brought to the very brink of ruin  she has indeed preserved part of these ambitious conquests but it was by efforts which have quite exhausted her yet it is still that same trade which upholds the noble houses against the debasement they imagine inherent in commerce the greater part of their money is either in trade or bank printing originally set up at venice by n jansson a frenchman though not flourishing in that prosperity to which the abilities industry and disinterestedness of the manutii the giuntii the giolitos the bevilacquas etc raised it still makes one of the chief branches of the trade of venice several noble houses place their money in this trade clandestinely and with a view of lucre distantly imitating the societa palatina composed of the principal noblemen of milan who formed and openly keep it up for the good of literature and the improvement of the sciences motions which the highest nobility need not conceal  by means of the sumptuary laws the manufactures of the venetian territory answer its consumption and agreeable to the spirit of the government they are rather solid than showy no country in europe makes better velvets or silk stockings its lookingglasses and galloons which were formerly vended all over europe now go only to the levant the reputation of its treacle is at its ancient height which it owes to the apparatus and form with which it was composed and under the eye of the very signiory itself presents of this treacle are considered of value by the venetian ambassadors at the several courts of europe the wax which venice brings from dalmatia greece and all the levant employs many manufactories where after being whitened it is made into candles the very finest of which is no more than about fifteen pence a pound as to foreign commerce there is scarce any thing done in it except in fine linens and calicoes from switzerland and cotton and dying drugs from the levant which it sends to switzerland this trade is chiefly in the hands of swiss houses settled at venice there is not indeed a nation without some considerable houses here the trade of these houses begin with the country from whence they came but in a little time declining either for want of support or the difficulty of intercourse they give into the venetian schemes and generally turn to banking  the bank of venice called the bank of the rialto says sharp is a very small office and the whole business transacted by a few clerks who sit in a small room like an open booth which faces the exchange the business of the bank may aptly be compared to that of a banker in england where merchants deposit a large sum of money and draw upon the shop for their disbursements at venice every bill of exchange above a hundred silver ducats that is so many times three shillings and fourpence must be paid at the bank this method in so large and commercial a city as london would be very inconvenient but here is very useful as a transfer is finished in half a minute which saves the trouble of weighing and examining the coin a precaution absolutely necessary in this country where many of the sequins are light besides that no chicanery can be practiced in case the receipt is lost the transfer being a sufficient proof of the payment it may presumed too that the republic has some private views in this ordinance besides the benefit of the merchants for should any sudden emergency of the states occur they have a quantity of each in their hands for immediate use  with respect to the state of religion and the clergy in the countries of the republic the established religion is that of the roman catholic but greeks americans and jews are allowed the public exercise of their worship and protestants observing privacy remain unmolested at the head of the church government is the patriarch of venice the chief ecclesiastic in the republic he is always selected from among the nobility and chosen by the senate and though confirmed by the pope must in other respects be independent of the papal chair he is primate of dalmatia and other provinces on the continent his power and dignity however are but of little weight having only the disposal of two benefices in the city of venice and being little regarded by the clergy out of it who depend immediately on the senate or are chosen by their respective congregations  though this republic has long maintained a sort of independence from the court of rome having shown themselves weary of the jesuits two hundred years before any other potentate dismissed them while many of the venetian populace followed them about crying andate andate niente pigliate emai ritornate begone begone steal nothing never never come back again and although there is a patriarch here who is attentive to keep his clergy from ever meddling with or even mentioning affairs of state as in such a case the republic would not scruple punishing them as laymen yet has venice kept st peters boat from sinking more than once when she saw the popes territories endangered or his sovereignty insulted nor is there any city more eminent for the decorum with which divine service is administered or the decent behavior of individuals when any sacred office is performing she has ever behaved like a true christian potentate keeping her faith firm and her honor scrupulously clear in all treaties and conventions with other states fewer instances being given of venetian falsehood or treachery toward neighboring nations than of any other european power  venice say some writers is the paradise of monks they go masqued during the carnival frequent the theaters keep mistresses and do in short just what they please of all the catholic countries there is none where ecclesiastical discipline is more relaxed several of the bishops have in vain attempted to reform these scandalous abuses it is however asserted perhaps not without foundation that government opposes such commendable projects that the clergy may not by these means have too great influence over the minds of the people  chap viii of venetian dalmatia in the fifteenth century the venetians reduced the whole kingdom of dalmatia though they have since been dispossessed by the turks of a considerable part at present the hungarians venetians ragusans and turks share it among them that part of dalmatia which belongs to the venetians says busching abounds in castles and fortified places but few are of modern structure it comprehends the province of murlachia part of the ancient liburnia a country full of high mountains extending from zengh to zara being in length fifteen german miles and in breadth between five and six some of the inhabitants of this part of dalmatia are indeed under the protection of hungary others are descendants of the venetians but there is hardly a place of any strength in dalmatia which is not governed by the murlachians dalmatians use the sclavonian language and customs and profess the roman catholic religion  the rivers in dalmatia have no long course but they are mostly navigable the country is as it were entirely strewed with mountains but these not unfruitful olives vines myrtles and a great variety of palatable and wholesome vegetables growing upon them besides treasures of gold and silver ore within them it has also many fertile plains and besides a sufficiency of horned cattle feeds largo flocks of sheep the air is temperate and pure  the principal towns in this part of dalmatia are zara sibenico spalatro trace and ragusa the latter a kind of independent city with a small territory under the protection of the republic of venice  zara the principal town in venetian dalmatia is surrounded on all sides by the sea except a communication it has eastward with the continent by means of a drawbridge commanded by a fort it is reckoned one of the best fortifications in dalmatia and deemed almost impregnable the citadel is divided from the town by a very deep ditch hewn out of the rock the harbor which is to the north is capacious safe and well guarded the rain is carefully preserved in cisterns to supply the want of fresh water in the castle resides the governor of dalmatia whose office is only triennial it was formerly only a bishops see but in      an archbishop was established here near the church which the greeks call st helia are two handsome fluted columns of the corinthian order supposed to have been part of the temple of juno this place was heretofore much more considerable than at present the circumference of the walls being now but two miles and the number of the inhabitants not above  000 there are very fine paintings in the churches done by the best masters and they pretend to have the body of st simeon which was brought from judea and is kept in a shrine with a crystal before it  sibenico is likewise a very strong town on the gulf of venice twentyfive miles southeast of zara having four citadels and a very large harbor the cathedral of st john in the castle is a fine marble structure ever since the beginning of the fifteenth century it has been under the dominion of the venetians though it has been no less than four times besieged by the turks this town says abbe fortis is famous for the number of men of letters it has produced  spalatro is a rich populous and strong town on the same coast thirtyseven miles southeast of sebenico with a good harbor and is the sea of an archbishop who is primate of dalmatia and croatia it is built upon the ruins of the castle of dioclesian and its walls make twothirds of those of the city its temple likewise is the cathedral church this place is the staple where all merchandise passing from turkey into italy must be transported near the harbor which is very large and deep is erected a very large lazaretto for performing quarantine among the roman antiquities to be seen here dioclesians palace is particularly worth viewing this city ever since the year    0 has continued firm to the venetians  trace is another strong and populous town on the coast of dalmatia belonging to the republic it is situated in a small island joined to the main land by a long bridge of wood and to the isle of bua by another of stone it lies fifteen miles east of spalatro nothing can be pleasanter than the situaation of trace the northside is covered with beautiful gardens and on the island of bua it has very very fine suburbs it is the residence of the venetian proveditor who bears the title of count the harbor which is formed by a bay has depth of water enough for the largest ships which ride there sheltered by two capes it was an ancient roman colony of the emperor claudius and so early as the year     put itself under the protection of venice on which it has been continually dependent ever since the year    0 though not without many changes and disastrous revolutions  ragusa is not very large in circumference but it is nevertheless well built and is the seat of a republic and of an archbishops see it extends toward the sea and both the city and harbor are defended by fort st lorenzo were the rock of of chiroma which lies in the sea and belongs to the venetians fortified it would be impregnable the air is wholesome but the soil so barren that the inhabitants receive the greatest part of their necessaries from the neighboring turkish provinces the circumjacent islands are all fertile pleasant well inhabited and embellished with fine towns stately palaces and beautiful gardens this city lies one hundred and two miles southeast of spolatro  the government of this city and state is aristocratic and formed nearly after the model of that of venice it is in the hands of the nobility who are at present greatly diminished the chief of the republic who is styled rector is changed every month and elected by scrutiny or lot during his administration he lives in the palace wears a ducal habit namely a long silk robe with white sleeves and his salary is five ducats a month but if he is one of the pregadi he receives a ducat per day next to him is the council of ten in the great council all noblemen above twenty years of age are admitted and in this council also are chosen the persons who constitute the board of the pregadi these last superintend all affairs civil and military dispose of all employments and receive and send envoys the revenues of the republic are said to have amounted formerly to a ton of gold but being unable to defend itself they have procured several protectors the principal of whom is the grand signior it is said they pay tribute to the turks out of fear to the venetians out of hatred and to the pope emperor spain and naples out of respect and political views the tribute to the port with the expense of the annual embassy is about  0000 zequins the turks are very serviceable to them bringing hither all kinds of necessaries especially firearms and military stores  they keep so watchful an eye over their freedom that the gates of the city of ragusa are allowed to be open only a few hours in the day they wholly profess the catholic religion but the greek armenian and turkish persuasions are tolerated among them for convenience the language chiefly in use among the ragusans is the sclavonian but the greater part of them speak also the italian the citizens are almost to a man traders and this place distinguishes itself by the fineness of its manufactures silk is allowed to be worn here only by the rector nobles and doctors  chap ix of the customs and manners of the morlacchi a pretty full account of the singular customs and manners of the morlacchi a race of people inhabiting the mountains of venetian dalmatia and until the abbe fortis penetrate that country but little known to the rest of europe will we flatter ourselves not appear uninteresting to our readers  there is not only a great difference in dialect dress disposition and customs between the maritime and transalpine inhabitants of dalmatia says abbe fortis but even a remarkable diversity among the morlacchi themselves in several districts derived perhaps from the different countries from whence they come the inhabitants of cotar are generally fair with blue eyes a broad face and flat nose but those of vergoraz have dark colored hair a long face tawny color and tall stature the qualities of their mind are also as different as those of the body for the morlacchi of cotar are generally mild respectful and tractable but those of vergoraz are surly proud bold and enterprizing they have also a strong inclination to theft owing in part to their situation among barren and inaccessible mountains among the artful and bold strokes of knavery which they tell of one of these vergozani the following is characteristic the rogue was at a fair and a countryman having bought a copper kettle laid it down together with his bundle just by his side the vergoroon who stood hard by took up the kettle while the peasant was talking to an acquaintance and set it on his head without stirring from his place the other having finished his conference turned about to take up his things but the kettle was gone and asking him who had it on his head if he had not seen somebody carry it off he was answered truly friend i was not minding these things but if you had put your kettle on your head as you see i did you would not have lost it yet notwithstanding these mischievous tricks which are frequent enough a stranger may travel securely among them and will be hospitably treated  the greatest danger is from the haiduks of whom great numbers have retreated among the woods and caves of those dreadful mountains on the confines they lead their life among wolves wandering from one precipice to another agitated by continual fears and suspicions exposed to the severity of the seasons and often deprived of the necessaries of life languish in the most solitary hideous caverns were such men to commit acts of violence irritated by the constant view of their miserable situation it would be no wonder yet they seldom disturb the tranquillity of others and prove always faithful guides to travelers the chief objects of their rapine are oxen and sheep to supply themselves with food and shoes it happens sometimes in their extreme necessity that the haiduks go in parties to the shepherds cottages and readily demand something to eat which they immediately take by force if the least hesitation is made though they seldom meet with a refusal or resistance as their resolution and fury are well known to be equal to their wants and the savage life they lead four haiduks are not afraid to assault a caravan of fifteen or twenty turks and generally plunder and put them to flight when a haiduk happens to be taken by the panduri they do not bind him as our sbirri are used to do says abbe fortis but untying the strings of his breeches they fall down on his heels and prevent a possibility of escape  the morals of a morlach says the abbe at a distance from the seacoast and garrisons are very different from those of the italians the sincerity trust and honesty of those poor people not only in contracts but in all the ordinary actions of their life would be called simplicity and weakness among us the morlach naturally hospitable and generous opens his poor cottage to the stranger and serves him to the utmost of his power without demanding nay often obstinately refusing the least recompense and i have more than once adds the abbe got a dinner from one of those men who knew nothing about me had never before seen me and could not expect ever to see me again  the morlacchi are extremely sensible of mild treatment and when they meet with it are ready to perform every possible service and to become cordial friends their hospitality is equally conspicuous among the poor as among the more opulent the rich prepares a roasted lamb or sheep and the poor with equal cordiality gives his turkey milk honey or whatever else he has nor is their generosity confined to strangers but generally extends itself to all who are in want  when a morlach is on a journey and comes to lodge at a friends house the eldest daughter of the family or the new married bride if there happens to be one receives and kisses him when he alights from his horse or at the door of the house but a foreigner is rarely favored with these female civilities on the contrary the women if they are young hide themselves and keep out of his way perhaps more than one violation of the laws of hospitality has made them thus reserved to strangers  while there is any thing to eat in the house of those villagers the poor of the neighborhood are welcome to partake of it and hence it is that no morlach ever humbles himself to ask alms of a passenger i indeed says abbe fortis have often been forced to ask something from poor shepherds but i always found them liberal and many times in traveling through the fields in the heat of summer i have met poor reapers who of their own accord presented me with their flasks to drink and offered me a part of their rustic provisions with an affecting cordiality  the morlacchi in general have little notion of domestic economy and readily consume in a week as much as would be sufficient for several months when any occasion of merriment presents itself yet the morlach is a great economist in the use of his wearing apparel for rather than spoil his new cap he takes it off let it rain ever so hard and goes bareheaded in the storm in the same manner he treats his shoes if the road be dirty and they not very old nothing but an absolute impossibility hinders a morlach from being punctual and if he cannot repay the money he borrowed at the appointed time he carries a small present to his creditor and requests a longer term thus it happens sometimes that from term to term and present to present he pays double what he owed without reflecting on it  friendship that among other nations is so subject to change on the slightest motives is lasting among the morlacchi they have even made it a kind of religious point and tie the sacred bond at the foot of the altar the sclavonian ritual contains a particular benediction for the solemn union of two male or two female friends in the presence of the congregation i was present says abbe fortis at the union of two young women who were made posestre in the church of penessich the satisfaction that sparkled in their eyes when the ceremony was performed gave a convincing proof that delicacy of sentiments can lodge in minds not formed or rather not corrupted by that society which we call civilized the male friends thus united are called pobratimi and the male sisters posestreme which means half brothers and half sisters the duties of the pobratimi are to assist each other in every case of need or danger to revenge mutual wrongs and the like the enthusiasm is often carried so far as to risk and even to lose their life for the pobratimi if discord happens to arise between two friends it is mentioned all over the country as a scandalous novelty and there have been some examples of it of late years to the great affliction of the old morlacchi who attribute the depravation of their countrymen to their intercourse with the italians  the natural vivacity and enterprizing spirit of the morlacchi qualify them to succeed in any kind of employment in particular they make excellent soldiers and toward the end of the last century performed signal service under the brave venetian general dalfino who conquered an important tract of country belonging to the port chiefly by their means they also become very expert in the direction of mercantile business and easily learn to read and write even after they are grown up  notwithstanding their excellent disposition to learn every art the morlacchi have the most imperfect notions of husbandry and are very unskilful in the management of their cattle and in curing diseases they have a singular veneration for old customs and little care has hitherto been taken either to remove their prejudices or to teach them better methods their ploughs and other rural utensils seem to be of the most rude invention they make cheese butter and creamcheese too in their way the taylors art is confined to ancient and unalterable patterns which are always cut from the same kind of cloth so that any difference in the usual breadth would quite disconcert a morlach tailor they have some notions of dying and their colors are not despicable their black is made of the bark of the ashtree laid in warm water for eight days with some iron dross which they gather from the blacksmiths forges they then make use of this water when cold to give the color they also extract a fine blue from the infusion of wood dried in the shade in a lie of ashes well purified they let this mixture boil several hours and tinge the cloth in the water when cold scodanus by them called rez gives yellow and brown they also obtain a yellow from the evonimus known there by the name of puzzolina  almost all the morlach women are skilful in works of embroidery and knitting their embroidery is curious and exactly the same on both sides they also make a sort of knit or network very curious which they chiefly use as a kind of buskin to their slippers and brogues they are in no want of looms to weave their serge and other coarse cloth but the women have not much time to apply to these things their offices among the morlacchi not admitting sedentary labors  in some of their villages they make earthern ware very coarse indeed but very durable  the morlachs whether they happen to be of the roman or of the greek church have very singular ideas about religion and the ignorance of their teachers daily augments this monstrous evil they are as firmly persuaded of the reality of witches fairies enchantments nocturnal apparitions and sorcilage as if they had seen a thousand examples of them nor do they make the least doubt about the existence of vampires and attribute to them as in transylvania the sucking the blood of infants therefore when a man dies suspected of becoming a vampire or vutrodlach as they call it they cut his hams and prick his whole body with pins pretending that after this operation he cannot walk about there are even instances of morlacchi who imagining they may possibly thirst for childrens blood after death entreat their heirs and sometimes oblige them to promise to treat them as a vampire when they die  the boldest haiduk would fly trembling from the apparition of a spectre ghost phantom or such like goblins as the heated imagination of credulous and prepossessed people never fail to see nor are they ashamed when ridiculed for this terror but answer much in the words of pindar  fear that proceeds from spirits causes even the sons of the gods to fly the women as may be naturally supposed are a hundred times more timorous and visionary than the men and some of them by frequently hearing themselves called witches actually believe they are so the old witches are acquainted with many spells and one of the most frequent is to transfer the milk of other peoples cows to their own  a most perfect discord reigns in morlacchi as it generally does in other parts between the latin and greek communion which their respective priests fail not to foment and tell a thousand little scandalous stories of each other the churches of the latins are poor and shamefully ill kept i have seen says the abbe the curate of a morlach village sitting on the ground in the church yard to hear the confessions of women on their knees by his side a strange picture indeed but a proof of the innocent manners of these good people who have the most profound veneration for their spiritual pastors and a total dependence on them who for their part frequently make use of a discipline rather military and correct the bodies of their offending flock with the cudgel perhaps this particular is carried to an abuse as well as that of public penance which they pretend to inflict after the manner of the ancient church farther through the silly credulity of these poor mountaineers they draw illicit profits by selling certain superstitious scrolls and other scandalous merchandise of that kind  innocence and the natural liberty of pastoral ages says fortis are still preserved among the morlacchi pure cordiality of sentiment is not there restrained by other regards and displays itself without any distinction of circumstances a handsome young morlach girl who meets a man of her district on the road kisses him affectionately without the least immodest thought and i have seen all the women and girls all the young men and old kissing one another as they came into the churchyard on a holiday so that they looked as if they had been all belonging to one family i have often observed the same thing on the road and at the fairs in the maritime towns where the morlacchi came to sell their commodities in times of feasting and merriment some other little liberties are taken which we should not reckon decent but which are not minded among them and when they are told of it they answer it is only toying and means nothing from this toying however their amors often take their beginning and frequently end seriously when the two lovers are once agreed for it very rarely happens that a morlacco carries off a girl against her will or dishonours her and were such attempts made the young woman would no doubt be able to defend herself the women in that country being generally very little less robust than the men but the custom is for the woman herself to appoint the time and place of being carried off and she does so in order to extricate herself from other suitors from whom she may have received some lovetoken such as a brass ring a little knife or such like trifles  the dress of the morlach women is different in different parts of the country but it appears every where strange to an european that of the unmarried women is the most complex and whimsical in respect to the ornaments of the head for when married they are not allowed to wear any thing else but a handkerchief either white or colored tied about it the girls wear a scarlet cap to which they commonly hang a veil falling down on their shoulders the better sort adorn their caps with strings of silver coins they have earrings of very curious work and small silver chains with the figures of half moons fastened to the end of them the principal merit of these caps which constitute the good taste as well as vanity of the morlach young ladies is to attend and fix the eyes of all who are near them by the multitude of ornaments and the noise they make on the least motion of their heads in some districts they fix tufts of various colored feathers resembling two horns on their caps at others tremulous plumes of spunglass and in others artificial flowers which they purchase in the seaport towns and it must be confessed that in the variety of these capricious and barbarous ornaments sometimes a fancy not inelegant is displayed their holiday shifts are embroidered with red silk and sometimes with gold which they work themselves while they attend their flocks and it is surprising to see how nicely their work is executed both old and young women wear about their necks large strings of round glass beads of various sizes and colors and many rings of brass tin or silver on their fingers their bracelets are of leather covered with wrought tin or silver and they embroider their stomachers or adorn them with beads or shells but the use of stays is unknown nor do they put iron or whalebone in the stomacher a broad woollen girdle surrounds their petticoat which is commonly decked with shells of a blue color and therefore called modrina their gown as well as petticoat is a kind of serge and both reach near to the ancle the gown is bordered with scarlet and called sadak they use no modrina in summer and only wear the sadak without sleeves over a linen petticoat or shift the girls always wear red stockings and their shoes are like those of the men called opanke the sole is of undressed oxhide and the upper part of sheeps skin thongs knitted which they call apute and these they fasten above the ankles something like the ancient cothurnus  the unmarried women even of the richest families are not permitted to wear any other sort of shoes though after marriage they may if they please lay aside the opanke and use turkish slippers the girls keep their hair tressed under their caps but when married they let it fall dishevelled on their breast sometimes they tie it under the chin and always have medals beads or bored coins in the tartar or american mode twisted amongst it an unmarried woman who falls under the imputation of want of chastity runs the risk of having her red cap torn off publicly in church by the curate and her hair cut by some relation in token of infamy hence if any of them happen to fall into an illicit amor they commonly of their own accord lay aside the badge of virginity and remove into another part of the country  chap x of their marriages funerals etc nothing is more common among the morlacchi than marriages concluded between the the old people of the respective families especially where the parties live at a great distance and neither see nor know each other and the ordinary motive of these alliances is the ambition of being related to a numerous and powerful family famous for having produced valliant men the father of the future bridegroom or some other near relation of mature age goes to ask the young woman or rather a young woman of such a family not having commonly any determinate choice upon this all the girls in the house are shown to him and he chooses which pleases him best though generally respecting the rights of seniority a denial in such a case is very rare nor does the father of the maid enquire much into the circumstances of the family that asks her sometimes a daughter of the master is given in marriage to the servant or tenant as was usual in the patriarchal times on these occasions however the morlacchi girls enjoy a privilege which ours would also wish to have as in justice they certainly ought for he who acts by proxy having obtained his suit is obliged to go and bring the bridegroom and if on seeing each other the young people are reciprocally content then the marriage is concluded but not otherwise in some parts it is the custom for the bride to go and see the house and family of her proposed husband before she gives a definitive answer and if the place or persons are disagreeable to her she is at liberty to break the contract but if she be contented she returns to her fathers house escorted by the bridegroom and nearest relations there the marriage day is fixed on which the bridegroom comes to the brides house attended by all his friends of greatest note who on this occasion are called svati and are all armed and on horseback in their holiday clothes with a peacocks feather in their cap which is the distinctive ornament used by those who are invited to weddings the company goes armed to repulse any attack or ambush that might be intended to disturb the feast for in old times these encounters were not unfrequent according to the records of many national heroic songs in one of these is told the story of janco vojvod of sebigne cotemporary with the famous george castriolich named scanderberg and betrothed to jagna of temeswar whose brothers being not his friends when he came to conclude the marriage engaged him in the punctilio of performing several feats upon condition that if he succeeded he was to have the bride if not he was to lose his life these were as the song relates that he was to pierce an apple stuck on the point of a spear with his dart at a certain distance then he was to spring over nine horses placed one beside another at one leap and lastly to discover his future spouse among nine young women all covered with veils janco it seems was a valiant soldier but not expert in such trials of skill however his nephew undertook them in his place and no objection was made as they say is the custom in a certain island to hire one to fight for another at a boxing match the expedient made use of by zeculo jancos nephew to know the bride among the other nine young women was singular and merits a prolongation of our digression he opened his mantle on the ground threw a handful of gold rings on it and then gallantly addressed the ladies as follows lovely maid who art destined to be jancos wife do thou pick up these gold rings and wear them but if any other dares to touch one of them i will cut off her arm at a blow the nine young women were very naturally afraid of the danger and did not choose to advance so jancos bride collected the rings and thus the nuptial games were finished when upon trials of this nature one of the parties found himself excluded and another preferred as he thought unjustly he commonly had recourse to arms for redress and much blood was often shed in those combats and many tombs of the ancient sclavi are still to be seen in the woods and desert places of morlacchi whereon these feuds are engraved in coarse basrelief  the bride is conducted to a church veiled and surrounded by the svati on horseback and the sacred ceremony is performed amidst the noise of muskets pistols barbarous shouts and acclamations which continue till she returns to her fathers house or to that of her husband if not far off  the first days entertainment is sometimes made at the brides house but generally at the bridegrooms the domachin or head of the house comes out to meet his daughterinlaw and a child is handed to her before she alights to caress it and if there happens to be none in the house the child is borrowed from one of the neighbors when she alights she kneels down and kisses the threshold then the motherinlaw or in her place some other female relation presents a corn sieve full of different kinds of grain nuts almonds and other small fruit which the bride scatters upon the svati by handfuls behind her back the bride does not sit at the great table the first day but has one apart for herself the bridegroom sits at table with the svati but in all that day consecrated to the matrimonial union he must neither unloose nor cut any thing whatever the knum or sponsor carries his meat and cuts his bread the domachin gives the toasts generally the bukkara a very large wooden cup goes round first to the saint protector of the family next to the prosperity of the holy faith and sometimes to a name the most sublime and venerable the most extravagant abundance reigns at their feasts and each of the svati contributes by sending a share of provisions the dinner begins with fruit and cheese and the soup comes last just contrary to our custom all sorts of domestic fowls kid lamb and sometimes venison are heaped in prodigious quantities on their tables but very rarely a morlacco eats veal and perhaps never unless he has been persuaded to do it out of his own country this abhorrence to calves flesh is very ancient among the morlacchi s jerome takes notice of it and tomeo marnovich a bosnian wrer of the last century says that the dalmatians uncorrupted by the vices of strangers abstained from calves flesh as an unclean food even to his days the women relations if they are invited never dine at table with the men it being an established custom for them to dine by themselves after dinner they pass the rest of the day in dancing singing ancient songs and in games of dexterity or of art and fancy and in the evening at a convenient hour after supper the three ritual healths having first gone round the knum accompanies the bridegroom to the matrimonial apartment which commonly is the cellar or the stable if there happens to be any bed prepared better than straw he leads them to it and having untied the brides girdle he causes them both to undress each other reciprocally it is not long since the knum was obliged to undress the bride entirely but that custom is now out of use and instead of it he has the privilege of kissing her as often as he pleases whenever he meets her when they are both undressed the knum retires and stands listening at the door if there be a door it is his business to announce the consummation of the marriage which he does by discharging a pistol and is answered by many of the company the next day the bride without her veil and virginal cap dines at table with the svati and is forced to hear the coarse equivocal jests of her indelicate and sometimes intoxicated company  these nuptial feasts continue three six eight or more days according to the ability or prodigal disposition of the family where they are held the new married wife gets no inconsiderable profit in these days of joy and it usually amounts to much more than all the portion she brings with her which often consists of nothing but her own clothes and perhaps a cow nay it happens sometimes that the parents instead of giving money with their daughter get something from the bridegroom by way of price the bride carries water every morning to wash the hands of her guests as long as the feasting lasts and each of them throws a small piece of money into the basin after performing that function which is a very rare one among them excepting on such occasions the brides are also permitted to raise other little contributions among the svati by hiding their shoes caps knives or some other part of their equipage which they are obliged to ransom by a piece of money according as the company rates it and besides all these voluntary or extorted contributions already mentioned each guest must give some present to the new married wife at taking leave and then she also distributes some trifles in return which commonly consists in shirts caps handkerchiefs and such like  the nuptial rites are almost precisely the same through all the country inhabited by the morlacchi and those in use among the peasants and common people of the sea coast of dalmatia istria and the islands differ but little from them yet among these particular varieties there is one of the island zlarine near sebenico remarkable enough for there the principal guest who may naturally be supposed drunk at that hour must at one blow with his naked broad sword strike the brides crown of flowers off her head when she is ready to go to bed and in the island of pago there is  ustom more comical and less dangerous but equally savage and brutal after the marriage contract is settled and the bridegroom comes to conduct the bride to church her father or mother in delivering her over to him makes an exaggerated enumeration of her ill qualities know since thou will have her that she is good for nothing illnatured obstinate etc on which the bridegroom affecting an angry look turns to the young woman with an ah since it is so i will teach you better manners and then regales her with a blow or a kick or some similar piece of gallantry which is by no means figurative and it seems in general that the morlach women and perhaps the greatest part of the dalmatians the in habitants of the cities excepted do not dislike a beating now and then either from their husbands or lovers  in the neighborhood of dernish the women are obliged during the first year after their marriage to kiss all their national acquaintance who come to the house but after the first year they are dispensed from that compliment and indeed they become so intolerably nasty that they are no longer fit to practice it perhaps the mortifying manner in which they are treated by their husbands and relations is at the same time both the cause and effect of this shameful neglect of their persons when a morlach husband mentions his wife he always premises by your leave or begging your pardon and when the husband has a bedstead the wife must sleep on the floor near it  the pregnancy and births of the morlacch women would be thought very extraordinary among us where the ladies suffer so much notwithstanding all the care and circumspection used before and after labor on the contrary a morlach woman neither changes her food nor interrupts her daily fatigue on account of her pregnancy and is frequently delivered in the fields or on the road by herself and takes the infant washes it in the first water she finds carries it home and returns the day after to her usual labor or to feed her flocks the custom of the nation is invariable in washing the new born infants in cold water the little creatures thus carelessly treated in their tenderest moments are afterward wrapped in miserable rags where they remain three or four months under the same ungentle treatment and when that term is elapsed they are set at liberty and left to crawl about the cottage and before the door till they learn to walk upright by themselves and at the same time acquire that singular degree of strength and health with which the morlacchi are endowed and are able without the least inconvenience to expose their naked breasts to the severest frost and snow the infants are allowed to suck their mothers milk whilst she has any or till she is with child again and if that should not happen for three four or six years they continue all that time to receive nourishment from the breast the prodigious length of the breasts of the morlacch women is somewhat exraordinary for it is very certain that they can give the teat to their children over their shoulder or under their arms they let the boys run without breeches in a shirt that reaches only to the knee till the age of thirteen or fourteen following the custom of the bosnians subject to the port where no capitation tax is paid for the boys till they wear breeches they being considered before that time as children not capable of laboring or of earning their bread on the occasion of births and especially of the first all the relations and friends send presents of eatables to the woman in childbed or rather to the woman delivered and the family makes a supper of all these presents together the women do not enter the church till forty days after childbirth  the morlacchi pass their youth in the woods attending their flocks and herds and in that life of quiet and leisure they often become dexterous in carving with a simple knife they make wooden cups and whistles adorned with fanciful basreliefs which are not void of merit and at least shows the genius of the people  milk coagulated in various ways is the ordinary nourishment of the morlacchi they sometimes give it an agreeable acid by the infusion of vinegar whereby the curd becomes extremely refreshing and the whey is their favorite common drink nor is it at all unpleasant to a strangers taste when a guest arrives unexpectedly their readiest and best dish is new cheese fried with butter they are not much accustomed to bread baked after our manner but they make cakes of millet barley indian corn and sometimes of wheat which they bake or toast on the hearth every day for present use but wheaten bread is hardly ever seen in the cottages of the poor they make a large provision of cabbages like those used in germany and roots and all kinds of esculent herbs which they find in the woods or in the fields serve them for a cheap and salutary diet but garlic and shalots are the food most universally pleasing to that people next to roast meat which is their most luxurious dish it is reasonable to think that the constant use of these plants corrects in part the bad quality of their water and contributes to keep them long healthy and robust nothing is more common in that country than to see very old men strong active and lively to an extraordinary degree and this says abbe fortis i am inclined to think is partly owing to the garlic and their regular vegetable diet  a morlach in easy circumstances has no other bed than a coarse blanket made of goats hair and of turkish manufacture very few of the richest people in the country have such a piece of luxurious furniture as a bed after our fashion and there are not many who have so much as a bedstead which however when they happen to get made in their rough manner they sleep in between two great hair blankets without sheets or any other bedding the greatest part of the inhabitants content themselves with the bare ground wrapped in the usual blanket and only sometimes a little straw under it but in summer they choose to sleep in the open air perhaps to be delivered from the domestic insects their household furniture consists of a few and simple articles such as shepherds and peasants little advanced in arts require their houses are not often covered with tiles or slates and when they have any beams intended to support a second floor the families wardrobe is placed on them which it may be imagined is well provided where there is so much magnificence yet the ladies sleep on the floor even in such noble houses i have been lodged in one of them says the abbe where several of these women were grinding corn till past midnight screaming certain diabolical songs in the same place where i was laid to sleep and where ten others were stretched on the ground and actually fast asleep notwithstanding their frightful vociferation the morlacchi who have little or no correspondence with seatowns and are at a great distance from them have seldom any other houses cottages covered with straw or zimble for so they call a kind of laths used instead of tiles the animals inhabit the same cottage divided from the masters by a slight partition made of twigs and plaistered with clay and the dung of cattle the walls of the cottage are either of the same materials or of large stones laid one upon another without cement  the fireplace stands in the middle of the cottage and the smoke finds its way out at the door there being rarely any other aperture hence every thing within these wretched habitations is ornamented with black and loathsome with smoke not excepting the milk which forms a great part of their sustenance and of which they are very liberal to strangers their clothes persons and every thing in short contract the same smoaky smell the whole family sits round this fireplace in the cold season and when they have supped lay themselves down to sleep in the same place where they sat at supper for in every cottage they have not even benches to sit and to lie upon they burn butter instead of oil in their lamps but for the most part they use pieces of cleft fir in lieu of candles the smoke of which sometimes tinges their mustachoes curiously a very few rich morlacchi have houses in the turkish fashion with stools and some few of our movables but in general the richest of them live but a savage kind of life although they have no idea of cleanliness in their habitations yet in one respect they are nicer than we are nor do they fail to reproach us on that account and call us barbarous and beastly and it is a real fact that no man nor woman of that nation let the disorder be ever so severe or painful was ever known to ease nature in the cottage even dying persons are carried out to perform that operation in the open air and if a stranger should through ignorance or contempt pollute their house in that manner even in the night he would scarcely escape with his life and certainly not without very ill treatment  a morlacco clothes himself with great plainness and economy the opanke serve for shoes both in men and women and under them they wear a short woollen stocking which reaches above the ankle and joins to the breeches whereby all the leg is covered the breeches are of coarse white serge and they draw them tight about the waist like a purse by means of a woollen string their shirt is very short and over it they wear a short doublet and in winter they add a kind of short cloak made of very coarse red cloth on their head they wear a red cloth cap and above it a sort of cylindrical turban they shave their heads leaving only a small tuft behind like the poles and tartars they bind their loins with a strong reticular fillet of woollen yarn and sometimes of silk and in this fillet or bandage and their breeches they carry all their necessary implements such as one or two pistols stuck in behind and before a very large knife with the handle of brass set round with false stones this knife is often made fast to a light brass chain rolled about the bandages and near it is placed a horn with grease for their arms or for themselves next follows a little bag with their tinderbox and money if they have any and then their tobacco in a dried bladder the tobacco pipe is placed behind the reed stuck in below their shirt and the bowl appears without no morlacco ever goes out of doors without his gun upon his shoulders the chiefs of the nation however are better dressed  the morlacchi have their rustic assemblies especially in houses where there are several young women and in these the memory of ancient national stories is perpetuated a musician always attends these meetings and sings the old pisme or songs accompanying them with an instrument called guzla which has but one string composed of many horse hairs the tune to which these heroic songs are sung is extremely mournful and monotonous besides they bring the sound a little through the nose which agrees perfectly well with their instrument the verses of the most ancient traditional songs are of ten syllables not rhymed their poetry does not want strength of expression but the smallest ray of imagination rarely appears in it and the little that is attempted is seldom happy yet these songs have great effect on the minds of the hearers who are at pains to get them by heart a morlacco will travel along the desert mountains singing especially in the night time the actions of ancient sclavi kings and barons or some tragic event and if another happens to be traveling on a neighboring mountain he repeats the same verse when the other has sung it and this alternation continues as long as they can hear each other a loud and long howl which is an oh barbarously modulated constantly precedes the verse the words of which are pronounced rapidly almost without any modulation which is all reserved for the last syllable and ends with another long howl by way of trill raised louder and louder while the breath lasts  although the morlacchi usually sing their ancient song yet other poetry is not altogether extinguished among them and their musicians after singing an ancient piece accompanied with the guzla sometimes finish it with some extempore verses in praise of the personage by whom they are temployed and some of them are capable of singing extempore during the whole entertainment always accompanying the voice with the guzla there is also some written poetry among them when the memory of a signal event happens to be preserved in that manner  their games and diversions almost all consist in trials of strength or agility such as leaping running or flinging a large heavy stone they dance to the sound of the bagpipe and the voice of their singers a favorite dance which they call kolo or circle which soon turns into skocci gofi that is high dancing all the dancers men and women taking hold of each others hands form a circle and turn slowly round to the harsh notes of the instrument then the circle changes its form sometimes into an elipsis and sometimes a square according as the dance becomes more animated and at last transforms itself into the most violent springs and leaps in which the women also join and the whole becomes wild confusion the morlacchi have an incredible transport for this rude dance for neither the fatigues of the day nor a long journey nor hunger itself can detain them from it or from continuing several hours with very little intermission in such a violent exercise  it happens frequently enough that inflammatory fevers are the immediate consequences of these violent dances just mentioned in which case and in all others of the like nature the morlacchi do not apply to the physician because happily for them there is none of that profession among them but they cure themselves after their own way a large draught of a spirituous liquor which they call rakia is commonly their first medicinal portion and that if it does not effectuate the cure they repeat the dose together with a large infusion of pepper or gunpowder after this they cover themselves up in winter or lie down in the hottest rays of the sun if in summer to sweat the illness as they express it their cure for agues is more methodical the first and second day they take a glass of wine in which as much pepper as they can take up between their finger and thumb has been infused for several hours and the third or fourth day the dose is doubled their remedy for obstructions is to lay a large flat stone on the sick persons belly and for the rheumatism they use a most violent friction which at least renders the patients back quite livid and often strips off the skin sometimes they apply a red hot stone wrapped in red rags for rheumatic pains and they are used to drink a great quantity of vinegar to recover their appetite after a long series of fevers but the last remedy of all which is taken only in desperate cases is sugar when they can find any and they put it into the mouths of dying persons to make them pass into the other world with less bitterness criptemus and chamoephitis are used for articular pains and they frequently apply horseleeches to the swelled or aching parts they apply a red ochrous earth frequently found in the fields as the best remedy for excoriations or wounds they are very dexterous in setting dislocated or broken bones without having studied osteology like our surgeons who notwithstanding more frequently lame us by the rules of art they perform phlebotomy with an instrument like that used for horses and yet there is no example of any bad accident happening by that coarse operation  the family weeps and howls over the dead while they lie in the house and when they are carried out to be buried much in the same manner as the wild irish do with us but the morlacchi have several customs peculiar to themselves on these occasions such as whispering in the ear of the dead person and giving express commissions for the other world after this ceremony is finished the body is covered with a white cloth and carried to church where the lamentations begin again and the praises of the deceased are sung by the relations or others appointed for that purpose weeping after the corpse is buried the whole company together with the curate returns to the house where there is a strange mixture of feasting and lamentation the men let their beards grow a long time in sign of mourning a custom derived from the jews as is that of unleavened bread purifications and several others violet or blue colored caps are also the mark of mourning the women wear black or blue handkerchiefs and cover all the red of their garments with something black during the first year the morlach women go every holiday to renew their lamentations strewing flowers and wet herbs upon the grave and if necessarily detained from that visit they next time make a formal excuse to the dead giving a minute account of the cause of their neglect they also frequently ask news about the other world and propose many curious interrogations all these ceremonies are sung in a kind of verse in a doleful tone and sometimes the girls accompany the women in order to learn these funeral arts and form altogether a concert truly dismal  chap ix of the venetian island of all the islands of the quarnaro which between great and small are more than twenty in number the island of veglia is certainly the most considerable for the ancient date of its being inhabited the number of people it contains the singularity of its situation the amenity of the country the variety and riches of its commodities and finally for the productions of the fossil kingdom the ancient greek geographers knew it by the name of curicta which was also adapted by the latins few considerable islands are situated so near the main land as this being divided from the coast of liburnia by a channel scarcely a quarter of a mile broad it is of an irregular figure and has several promontories that stretch far into the sea its circuit is about ninetyfive miles the length of it is thirty and its greatest breadth about fourteen  the whole island contains about   000 inhabitants of which   00 live in the capital there are a great many cattle in this island and particularly horses of that small strong and sprightly breed well known in italy and much used for riding horses the cattle and horses make an article of trade in this island though not every year of equal importance the oxen are small and weak the number of sheep on this island may be about  0000 but their wool is not in much esteem they have hardly corn enough for four months provision but in recompense they make about   000 barrels of wine for exportation their wine is of excellent quality the firewood sent yearly to venice amounts to about  000 sequins saltfish is also an article of some importance  the present capital which bears the same name with the island is situated on the very spot where the ancient curicta stood as appears by the many remains of columns and engraved stone in the walls and streets it is illbuilt and full of rubbish and ruined houses in summer time there is often a want of good water to drink and the scirocco wind predominates  the doge of venice cannot attend to petty complaints of the clergy and the ministers appointed for that purpose are often more apt to profit bythe disorder than to remove it radically a priest for example accused of defloration has only to pay  0 paoli for a full acquittal according to the law of the island there goes a story of a priest who being come to pay his penalty after he had laid down his  0 paoli went on counting out more and being asked why he did so answered i pay beforehand for the next defloration of which i shall be accused  the greek superstitions subsist almost all over the island though there is no clergy of the greek rite in it in one of the principal villages the priests who have the charge of collecting the tithes and of guarding the church are obliged to sleep under a lodge open on all sides and contiguous to the steeple from st georges day to michaelmas that they may be ready at any hour to drive away the storms of hail by ringing of bells and if the storm continues it is their duty to go out into the open air bareheaded to conjure it perhaps no where are the bells more frequently rung than here and no steeple is more frequently struck with lightening  the dress of the peasants over all the island is of a coarse kind of cloth of a black color and consists chiefly in a cassock and a pair of long and wide breeches which reach down to the middle of the leg a number of people assembled together in this mourning kind of habit forms a melancholy spectacle  of the island of pago the ancient geographers have left us no description though its form extent and rich produce deserved it this island is extended from north and south over against maritime croatia or the mountain morlacca it is about fifty miles long its breadth is unequal one particular circumstance distinguishes it from all the other islands of the adriatic which is a large internal salt water lake fifteen miles long from south to north into which the sea enters by a canal not above a quarter of a mile broad  the climate of the island of pago is the same as that of the mountain morlacca in winter dreadfully cold in summer scorching hot the air is generally darkened by the salt mist that is raised by the collision of the waves in the narrow channel of morlacca altogether flanked by steep naked rocks the lake itself is not calm in the stormy season and so far from being a harbor is tempestuous and unsafe the inhabitants of the city cannot go out of their houses during the violence of the wind and are obliged to have the roofs defended all round by large stones those who have been there in the winter time speak of it as a siberia quite covered with snow and ice and always exposed to the cold north wind i says abbe fortis who was there in the hot season thought it equal to the most scorching parts of the world the naked rocks which not only form the organization but also the superficies of almost all the island the narrowness of the valleys the reverberation of the water of the lake generally quite calm in summer multiply the heat so prodigiously among those stones that the vines which are planted all round the lake ripen the grapes by the beginning of august and the few other products that grow there anticipate the usual time of maturity in the same manner the meteors are exceedingly irregular in the summer time sudden whirlwinds are frequent and heavy showers of rain the last are hurtful to the inhabitants of one part of the island and favorable to the cultivation of the opposite end  the banks of the interior marine lake are almost all cultivated with vines and particularly near the city of pago and the salt pits at the south end of the lake the part of the island under the jurisdiction of pago produces about forty thousand barrels of good wine and about two thousand of rakia one year with another the great quantity of sage and other odoriferous plants with which the island is covered furnishes excellent food for bees and the honey forms no inconsiderable branch of trade the same pasture among those barren rocks maintains a large number of sheep and goats and the wool which is very bad and cheese make a small article for export the northern part of the island is well supplied with water and has good pastures on the low grounds by which means its black cattle are larger and better than on any of the neighboring islands on the coast of dalmatia  the most considerable product of the island is salt in the year      says abbe fortis they made eight hundred thousand venetian stavios part of the saltworks belongs to the government and the rest to private proprietors they are meliorated every year and for that end the public lend money to those proprietors who want it and who without their assistance could not make the requisite improvements the lagune on which the saltworks lie is about four miles long and half a mile broad  many vestiges of ancient habitation still remain on the island of pago as well as of walled places which either have been destroyed by the incursions of enemies or of time historians say that the island was often abandoned by its inhabitants and indeed it is rather to be wondered at how men ever could resolve to settle in so wretched a country the small number of inhabitants after so many years of peace and tranquillity under the venetian government evidently proves how little the island is really habitable the whole number scarce amounts to   00 inhabitants which bears no proportion to the extent of ground if the naked barren hills that cover almost the whole did not account for it the greatest part of this population lives in the city of pago which is said to contain about  000 inhabitants the small capital of a desert island cannot be expected to offer much to the eyes of the curious and besides it is of recent foundation having been built by the venetians in the year      the plan is well understood and the streets are large and strait which generally is not the case in the other cities of dalmatia zara alone excepted  the difficulty of access to this city and the ill accommodations make it little frequented by strangers hence the inhabitants are as wild and unpolished as if they were at the greatest distance from the sea and the commerce of polite people the gentry who pretend to show their manners different from the vulgar are truly grotesque figures both in their dress behavior and insolent pretensions  the greatest part of the people of pago live by working in the salt pits and have a comfortable subsistence regularly paid by government it is therefore a very important circumstance for the inhabitants of this city to have a dry summer and hence the ignorant vulgar look upon rain as a mischief brought upon the country by force of witchcraft in consequence of this idea they elect a friar to exercise the meteors and keep the rain off the island if notwithstanding the poor friars endeavors the summer happens to be rainy he loses his reputation and his bread but if two or three dry seasons follow successively he meets with great reverence and advantage  to conclude the account of this city i found not here says abbe fortis a single medal nor inscription nor m s nor a man of good sense in all the island every body is interested in the salt pits and whoever talks not of salt is not regarded  states belonging to the king of sardinia these consist of the duchies of savoy piedmont and montserat the county of nice some parts of the duchy of milan and the kingdom of sardinia which is an island the face of the country climate productions character manners and customs being very different in each of these states they being separated from each other by very high and extensive chains of mountains will be treated in the same order we have hitherto pursued as so many distinct states with respect to their articles beginning first with savoy  chap i situation climate mountains and productions rivers etc it is only in an improper or extensive sense that this duchy can be placed in italy or lombardy  map of the king of sardinias dominions in italy map of the island of sardinia map of sardinia  to the west it borders upon france to the south it likewise borders on france and piedmont to the east on piedmont the milanese and switzerland and to the north on the lake of geneva by which it is separated from switzerland its greatest length from west to east is twentytwo german or eightyeight english miles and its breadth from south to north nineteen german or twentysix english  savoy may be reputed a nursery of heroes being sequestered from all incentives to luxury and softness on account of the lofty barren mountains and enormous rocks that overrun the greatest part of it and are known to produce only some moss and shrubs box trees indeed grow in such plenty that brooms are made of them the valleys between the mountains yield some grain but are rather more laid out for pasture the industry of the inhabitants has made the best improvements in the mountains themselves which the so could admit of  there is so much rocky and barren ground in savoy says sharp particularly toward mount cenis that the least spot of earth capable of producing corn or grass does not lie uncultivated and all through the country one or the other may be seen growing on the slope of the rocks wherever the peasant can find a little piece of flat surface with a depth of soil sufficient to admit of vegetation many of these pieces of land are not bigger and many are less than the hall of an old english country mansion but in some places they are numerous and by hanging one over the other from the top to the bottom of the hill make a very picturesque scene in a conversation i had with a monk an inhabitant of this country i turned my eyes toward two or three of these little patches of cultivated ground encompassed with a monstrous extent of barren rock and feeling some compassion for the supposed misery of the inhabitants i opened my mouth to say something on the subject but he imagining i meant a panegyric on the state of this agriculture interrupted me with great eagerness in a manner which shows the providential and blind partiality that almost every individual feels for his native country aye god be praised says he we are not like other nations dependent for our food upon a due course of the seasons for whether the rains or drought prevails we are always assured of our harvest we have so many crops on the bottom the middle and the summits of the mountains that when some fail the others necessarily succeed to have endeavored to awake him out of his pleasing dreams and open his eyes says sharp i must have been a brute  toward the barren parts of the mountains every one of the peasants is in possession of a small quantity of ground which he cultivates for the maintenance of his family and there is hardly an instance of a mans laboring by the day in these parts it is supposed there are generally sixty thousand savoyards absent from home during the winter for those who have no vineyards as soon as they have got in their little harvest and sown their seed set out some for france some for italy and others for different parts to procure a small pittance which they bring home to their wives and children just after harvest it is amazing to see the prodigious number of small stacks of corn spread over the whole face of the country in some places like haycocks in a meadow but this partition of the land into such an infinity of small farms accounts for the appearance besides the peasants make their stacks small from a persuasion that if they were larger the corn in that climate would become discolored and musty  the wine says busching is not contemptible and in some parts of their valleys there is such a good breed of cattle that most of the oxen in piedmont and the milanese are sent from savoy mules also are bred for exportation but all this is inconsiderable in proportion to the greatest part of the country which is occupied by immense mountains some of the highest are les glacieres or ice mountains and les montagnes maudites or the diabolical mountains in faucigny the perpendicular height of the latter twelve thousand feet maurienne in particular is remarkable for prodigious mountains which make part of the alps the most famous is mount cenis the road from savoy to piedmont being cut over it on the lanebourg side the height is about three miles along a serpentine road where the mules carrying the passengers and baggage may be left to themselves without any apprehension of danger these creatures being very cautious and surefooted on the top of the mountain stands a house called la ramasse from whence in wintertime the descent to lanebourg is performed on sledges within seven or eight minutes though from lanebourg up the mountain to la ramasse takes up a full hour on the summit of the mountain encompassed by others still higher and perpetually covered with snow is a plain or more properly a valley and in it a lake of about three miles in circumference here among other fish are trouts of eighteen pounds weight and upwards of a most delicious flavor it is rented at near a hundred pounds sterling a year in the middle it is said to be scarce fathomable  the borders of this lake gave occasion to a pleasant reply made by sherlock i passed these mountains said he with a young frenchman who was passionately fond of the italian music when we arrived at our inn on the middle of he alps we went to take a walk on the side of a small lake surrounded by a delightful wood parbleu said he nature is very ridiculous here  ha replied i this is something new i have often heard of the caprices of nature but you are the first who have found her ridiculous  listen said he the wood resounded with the song of nightingales and the lake was full of frogs that were croaking have you ever heard such a concert  yes i have heard some frenchmen and italian women sing together he took the joke in good part says sherlock and we laughed at the ridiculousness of nature and the operasingers at paris  this lake receives a continual supply from the adjacent snowy mountains and out of it flows a rivulet by some called semar and by others st nicholas which falling precipitately down the mountains runs into the river dora near susa close by it says keysler stood a little palace built in      by duke victor amadoeus only for the entertainment of his bride christina daughter to henry iv in her journey through france on which occasion he also exhibited on this lake a sea fight  at the inn called the grande croix from a wooden cross near it the boundary between savoy and piedmont there is another descent from a plain surrounded with mountains called la plain de st nicholas here the descent begins to grow so stony and rugged that the carriers of chairs in which the travelers ride jump down from one large stone to another as from so many high steps along this steep descent near novalese in piedmont are three or four places where the path on the brink of the terrible precipices is very narrow and so washed away by the water that half the chair hangs over the precipice but these dangerous places extend not above a few paces in this road to novalese are two very lofty cataracts one of which must be crossed over the higher mountains are perpetually covered with snow and ice and those who go in search of rockcrystal or lay springs for chamois as on the very high mountain of bon aise near lanebourg often expose their lives to imminent danger these chains of high mountains occasion the roads in savoy to be very bad disagreeable and dangerous especially as huge masses of snow or fragments of rock roll frequently into them the mountain of plain jou near passy in faucigny in      became a volcano  some men of learning says keysler have thought the rockcrystal which is found in great quantities on these mountains to be generated from ice not only seneca pliny and st augustine among the ancients but also cardan and pere fournier among the moderns adopt this transmutation of ice but not to mention says the same writer that the like origin may with equal reason be ascribed to the diamond the chysolite the topaz and other gems the favorers of such an hypothesis must either not have known or not have recollected that crystal is a native of very hot countries such as of the island cyprus and several of the southern parts of asia but from this notion it would follow that large mountains of clear crystal might be found about nova zembla  the perpendicular height of the above mountains from the surface of the lake of geneva is computed to be at least  000 fathoms or above two english miles and the surface of the lake of geneva is     fathoms above the level of the mediterranean  on the left hand between fertiere and novalese in the descent from mount cenis is the mountain of rochemelon accounted the highest of all the italian alps the ascent up this mountain is a days journey a steep valley running between that and mount cenis at first says keysler i could see clearly up to its very summit but within less than half a quarter of an hour it was quite involved in a cloud these changes are so frequent that after all the trouble of getting up this prodigious acclivity one may happen to come there at an unlucky time and be obliged to wait for fair weather to come down again but in a clear sky the toil must be acknowledged to be well rewarded by an astonishing prospect over the milanese the trevigiana venice etc some have imagined this to be the mountain from whence hannibal encouraged his army by a view of the splendour and fertility of italy a musket fired from the top of this mountain makes but a very saint report like that of the breaking of a stick owing to the lightness and thinness of the air it is said that a statue of jupiter formerly stood upon the top of rochemelon perhaps it has been obliged to give way to one of the virgin mary which is set up there mass is annually said at this place on the  th of august thousands of people repair thither from the neighboring countries either out of devotion or in compliance with an injunction of the church climbing over ice and snow and spending at least one night upon the mountain  the chief rivers in this country are the rhone which flows out of the lake of geneva and on that side separates it from france into it run the following rivers   the arvo which rises in faucigny has a mixture of gold in its sand and near geneva empties itself into the rhone   les susses the sources of which are in genevois and fall into the rhone not far fron seisel the latter being increased by the seran   the isere which runs at the foot of mount iseran among others it receives the river arc which likewise rises in the alps the arc having a great many falls is very rapid and full of foam  of lakes the chief are those of annecy in genevois and   bourget in savoy which are properly so called the last has a fish unknown in other countries called lavarette frequently weighing four or five pounds and as a delicacy never fails bringing a good price at chambery here are also some remarkable springs as the hotbath at aix not far from bourgetlake is a spring which rises and falls with some noise but not at stated and regular times after easter this alteration is often perceptible about six times in an hour and in dry seasons not above once or twice it issues from a rock and is called la fontaine de merveille of a different kind are the springs of this country which sometimes throw up more or less water and rise or fall according to the alteration in the rhone but not by such sudden and frequent fluxes and re fluxes as in the fontaine de merveille  chambery is the capital of savoy and situate on the river leise in a pleasant valley about one days journey from geneva this town is not large and its chief strength is in it walls it is the seat of the high court of justice or parliament of savoy and the residence of the noblesse here are no antiquities to be seen nor any thing curious abbe richard has said more in favor of the architecture of the church than it merits they show with great veneration a little chapel in which the saint suaire was deposited since removed to turin upon the wall hangs a long list of relics consisting of about sixty different articles such as st johns reed that was shaken by the wind in the desert two nails of the real cross fragments of some of the apostles garments but fortunately for the devots at chambery all their precious realities have been removed to turin and the list only remains the old castle was deemed impregnable in bow and arrow time but is now commanded on every side two thousand people were lodged within its walls in      or      at the marriage of the present king of sardinia with madame of lorrain the palace is in ruins there are a few small pictures in the church of the jacobins tolerably well executed the public walk admired by lalande does not answer his description here are several fountains supplied with excellent water the houses make a beggarly appearance on the outside particularly as the windows are of paper and frequently in tatters in this town there are no fewer than fifteen religious houses male and female communautes besides one convent of jesuits who though consisting of no more than fourteen or fifteen in number have a yearly revenue of thirty thousand livres  i shall conclude the account of chambery says lady millar with an anecdote of a coblers family about a quarter of a league from chambery a fine chateau just built attracts our notice the master of it goes by the name of jaques mar for he has no title and is the son of a cobbler in childhood leaving his country he traveled into spain being arrived at madrid he had the good fortune to recommend himself as a marmiton in the queens kitchen when in process of time he was promoted to be chef de la cuisinier and at length entrepreneur or caterer in which capacity he had a fixed monthly allowance to provide victualling for all the royal household in the mean time a brother of jaques mar who to seek his fortune in england had quitted chambery died in london having realized about ten thousand livres a year which he bequeathed to his brother fame says lady millar does not give so accurate an account of the rise and progress of this mar as of jaques all that could be learnt was that he served a london merchant who traded on the seas and that at length he became considerable and carried on commerce upon his own account the caterer jaques planned and built the beforementioned chateau to which he retired with a yearly income of about two thousand pounds sterling at the age of fortyfive his cousingerman continues the familystall furnishing to the necessities of the soles and heels of his neighbors with as much humility as if there had been no chateau in the family  at aix near this city are some baths famous for their medicinal qualities two of the springs burst out of a rock on the side of a steep mountain which are arched over like a grotto the waters are excessive hot our guide says lady millar told us that a geneva gentleman had but just left the town who was so paralytic when he entered as to occasion his being helped out of his carriage by five men in six weeks after he had used the baths and drank the waters he got into his coach without assistance and is returned in perfect health to geneva one of the springs brings down with it a kind of stuff or paste in flakes in color and consistence not unlike the white of an egg a little hardened which flames and burns when applied to a lighted candle curiosity led me to taste the water of which having drank a glass with several flakes in it i was almost instantaneously seized with a sickness in the stomach it is used in consumptions and all disorders of the breast i folded up in a paper some of the most condensed flakes and put them into my pocketbook to dry but an hour or two after there was not the smallest vestige to be seen nothing remained but an offensive smell the stones which receive the spray are covered over with a green coat resembling vitriol which is applied as an infallible remedy to corns no doubt it may be endued with many superior virtues though they have not yet been properly investigated there is another fountain which supplies a bath built for madame royale the water of which is green and so transparent as to discover the source bubbling up through the gravel at the bottom this water is said to have the extraordinary quality of restoring in a few hours to their original freshness all sorts of berbs and vegetables though dried and withered  lanebourg is situated among the mountains and particularly mount cenis which lies so near it toward the south and east that from the end of november to the   th of january the inhabitants never see the sun which on that day makes its first appearance above the tops of the mountains it is a large village at the foot of mount cenis consisting of between two and three hundred houses which enjoys a number of privileges and is under excellent regulations they are so happy as to be free from the oppression of a seigneur commandant or any other petty tyrant the only tax they are subject to is the taille which amounts nearly to the seventh part of the produce of their lands and is paid to the king they are at no other public expense except the keeping the public roads and bridges passable they also make provision for their cure and repair the church they never let their land as by so doing it would not produce them more than two and a half per cent whereas by cultivating their little property themselves they make it yield from ten to thirteen per cent there are few lanebourgians who possess more than twelve and none more than forty pounds a year they have but two priests in their village and no convent they are remarkably healthy and longlived no physician being permitted to live at lanebourg the simplicity of their manners and the purity of their lives is such that it very rarely happens an illegitimate child is produced amongst them but when such an event does arrive immediate marriage or perpetual exile must ensue by the vigilance of the cure and syndics no person has ever escaped one or other of these ordinances and they generally prefer the former here then subsists a community more free from superstition than the religion they profess admits content with the produce of their own labors they are always cheerful always happy their wants are bounded by the mere necessary their riches never reach beyond their means  thus do they defy the vice of avarice and chase for ever from their pillow the cares attendant on ambition  among the inhabitants of the mountains in this part of the world is a very singular custom as absurd as it is laughable i do not know that any writers of travels have mentioned as i had it on the veracity of a gentleman with whom i am acquainted and who is a native of savoy he declares that being one day on a visit at a gentlemans house the master of a capital vineyard where he slept one night on the mountains two beautiful girls the daughters of his friend with a young lady their visitor came into his chamber just as he had got out of his bed and before he could get any of his clothes on and as they did not show any disposition to retire though he was naked decency led him to jump into his bed again and cover himself with the clothes thinking they might have something particular to say to him they burst out a laughing came up to the bedside and attempted to slip down the clothes not being prepared for such a visit and one of them having a rod in her hand i was at a loss says he to know what they would be at as they strived to uncover me i gathered the clothes about me and made all the resistance i could but finding that ineffectual i determined to laugh with them and treat them in their own way accordingly i jumped out of bed catched hold of one of them by her petticoats before treated them in a manner i should have called rude at any other time made some attempts at indelicacies and though i used not my tongue i made good use of my hands  it was a general romp  they laughed immoderately and when tired fled from me and thus i got rid of them having locked my door i dressed myself and telling my adventure to a friend that morning he assured me they were girls of good character and their visit to me was merely a frolic and designed to alarm me with the dread of the rod that when in bed had i gathered the clothes about me before turned my back to them and exposed my breech they would not have given me a single stroke but would have run away laughing that to frighten their male visitants with the dread of a whipping was a customary frolic of unmarried girls of that country that their whole enjoyment consisted in the panic they occasioned and they called it alarming the stranger  the same gentleman informs me that in the alps there is a plant which is sought and gathered by moonlight great quantities of which are transported to paris but what the plant is in its nature he could not learn that it is discoverable only in moonlight and then only in certain directions when it has a brilliancy peculiar to itself and by which it is known a step of the searcher much to the right or left will lose him the sight of it  from lanebourg to the summit of mount cenis is a league which the climbing of takes up a full hour the two leagues from thence to la grande croix are rid in an hour and a half being over very fine turf here commences a declivity of two leagues alarming the stranger more to novalese which is at the foot of mount cenis on the italian side  in winter when the snow is on the ground the plain on the top of mount cenis is crossed in a sledge drawn by a horse or mule the descent from la grande croix to novalese must at all times and even in winter be made in chairs the large stones the winding ways full of holes and the dangerous precipices not admitting the use of sledges but the descent from mount cenis to lanebourg is performed in these machines which go with such rapidity as almost to take away the breath these sledges hold only two the traveller and the guide who sits forward steering with a stick on each side he has an iron chain which he drops like an anchor either to slacken the course of the sledge or to stop it this like the carrying in chairs is called ramassar les gens some travelers especially the english and germans are so delighted with this expeditious descent that they ride up again for the enjoyment of that pleasure a second time this is the village where the carriages are taken to pieces to cross mount cenis and from whence travelers are conveyed up the mountains as well as along the plain and down the other side in chairs there are mules for those who choose to ride but the porters of which there are an hundred kept always in readiness for this employment are so accustomed to it that they convey travelers up the mountaain with less fatigue to themselves than those not accustomed to climbing would experience even in walking up there are from six to ten porters allotted to each chair according to the weight of the person to be carried who relieve each other by turns  a corpulent englishman says keysler who is said to have weighed five hundred and fifty pouunds traveling here was obliged to make use of twelve chairmen  the chairs says lady millar are constructed in the most simple and portable manner imaginable there are two small bars of wood for arms and another bar behind which rises a little higher than the waist and which serves as a support to the back of the person in the chair the seat is matted with bark of trees and ropes mixed together which yield to the weight of those it conveys the seat is so near the ground that there is not the least difficulty in stepping out of the chair at pleasure there are no legs to these chairs but in their room a board is tied on by ropes to the seat for the feet to rest on and the cords as much shortened as can conveniently be the legs and feet are well supported being sufficiently raised to clear them entirely of any shock from rocky or uneven ground  these chairs are fixed on poles which appeared to me as long as those commonly used in bath or london the chairmen are aided by straps over their shoulders in the manner of those in england and they use no other assistance to keep them from slipping than a few nails drove into the heels of their shoes and a packthread passed from one to the other of them  of all disputable matters between the chairmen and travelers says sharp the syndics are appointed by his sardinian majesty absolute judges these syndics are magistrates living one at lanebourg on this side of the mountain and the other at novalese which is situated at the foot of the mountain on the side toward turin they are poor men and not above accepting a small present for drink but invested with sufficient power to compel both the muleteers and the chairmen to attend when any traveller arrives i had an opportunity when i traveled into italy says the above author of seeing this power exerted for the chairmen were in the midst of their harvest gathering in the produce of their little farms and would gladly have been excused the syndic therefore rung the alarumbell which summons was immediately obeyed and a sufficient number of them selected to transport me and my company the next morning their pay is fixed it is about halfacrown each and the hire of each mule nearly as much but by the ordinance no mule is obliged to carry above three hundred and fifty pounds weight so that if the body of a carriage or any parcel of luggage should weigh more it is in the breast of the muleteers to demand what sum they please a privilege they seldom neglect to avail themselves of and sometimes with great extortion to the amount of many guineas englishmen who take their own coaches should provide such a carriage as may be taken to pieces which those with a perch do not admit of a man may travel post through the alps if he pleases but it is attended with some trouble and as i would not advise any one says sharp to drive fast on the edges of those precipices i shall forbear to enter into a detail on that subject martin likewise observes that this is almost the only road where it is expedient to travel by vetturins unless the state of a travellers finances makes it necessary he adds that there is one sedan chair at susa which may generally be had by sending notice beforehand on the other side of the mountain and lately they have provided other covered chairs  on the side of the mountains are small houses which serve the peasants in winter as magazines for their forage and in summer as dairies for they make butter and cheese in them during the three warm months the plain is by no means sans aucune inegalite according to lalande for there is a great variety of ground and what is called the plain is rather a valley extending along between high mountains with several different roads through it some of which the mules take others the porters the grass is exceedingly thick short and full of flowers such as amuranthoides or everlastings some yellow others of a fine crimson and purple the crowfoot kind is in great abundance on this mountain with a number of aromatic and odoriferous plants the forests on the sides of mount cenis abound with the chamois a species of wild goat whose flesh is eatable the peasants sell their skins from eight to twelve livres each the blood of these animals dried and taken in wine is esteemed a sovereign remedy for the pleurisy the king of sardinia is never without the medicine it being allowed by the turin physicians to be admirable in many cases the chamois are fleet and extremely shy concealing themselves in the most retired parts of the forest and in the clefts of rocks the most difficult of access they are so alert that they bound from rock to rock and will stand with all their four feet together on the most pointed of them their smell is so exquisite that no man can approach them without their perceiving it except against the wind and they have the sense of hearing in such perfection tha it is scarce possible to get within shot of them the only way of killing them is by lying in wait behind the bushes near their usual haunts before break of day taking care the wind is in your favor no dog can catch them not even a greyhound for they run directly to the precipices as their security near which they are always found and which are so exceedingly embarrassed and intersected that a dog would break his neck that should attempt to follow them for any time  opposite to the inn situated at the further extremity of the plain is a small chapel where those who happen to perish on the mountains by cold lightening or any other accident are buried provided that a rosary or any other mark of their catholicism be found about them though this country lies so high it is not free from thunder and often suffers by thick clouds unexpectedly settling upon it and remaining four five or six days  they brought us says lady millar butter the best i think i ever tasted perhaps owing to the many aromatic herbs the cows find on the plain they asserted that for nine months in the year they keep the cows in their kitchens in order to make butter for the english travelers  the descent from la grande croix says lady millar is extremely rapid for about three hundred yards and resembles more than any thing a broken stone staircase which occasions the porters to turn so suddenly with its windings that the person in the chair passes clear over the sharp angles cutting them as it were across notwithstanding the novelty of this manner of traveling the steepness of the road and the velocity with which i descended my porters running almost the whole way i never once felt myself sufficiently frightened to lay hold of the arms of the chair my attention was so much engaged with the singularity and variety of the prospect below  in descending the mountain to novalese says keysler one is sometimes obliged to alight from these straw chairs and walk forty or fifty paces not so much on account of the dangerous road as from the narrowness and windings of the defiles between the rocks not admitting the use of the long poles with which they carry the chairs the chairmen then either put them under their arms or carry them on their heads as they are very light one of these passes is called les pas de diable i e the devils stride the path in some places is scarce a foot broad and on each side are very steep precipices sometimes our chairmen happened to stumble and fell down but it was when there was little danger and in such cases it is the safest way to throw themselves on the ground these chairmen have a very easy pace and the weather being exceedingly fine i was extremely well pleased with this days expedition in our cities of germany says keysler what a noise do the chairmen make if they are to carry a person of any bulk but some hundred steps whilst here our lanebourg chairmen without the least panting or resting run directly up a mountain whose height is a good hours journey and then on the plain above us and as soon as they have fitted the chairs which they dispatch in a few minutes carry the company for two hours together over a very bad road making only four pauses and those very short ones such is the effect of custom and a simple diet to which they also owe their uncommon longevity many of them attaining to an hundred years of age their usual drink is milk and they seldom taste wine in my inn at chambery i fell into discourse with a franciscan of some sense and learning whose conscience would not allow him to be carried by men as contrary to that equality among the human species which as he said was founded in nature and as far as possible ought to be kept up accordingly he traveled on foot in coming down the mountain to lanebourg but assured me that another time he should dispense with those scruples the steepness of the mountains being such that it was with the greatest difficulty he could keep on his legs thus it was not without extreme toil and danger of his life that he performed this journey which yet is much easier than to descend on the other side of the mountain into italy where the rocks are more dangerous and the road more encumbered with their fragments  to give an idea of this precipice says grosley it suffices to say that the descent is not quite three leagues and the ascent takes up full fiveandtwenty we were amazed at the rapidity of the arc along which the way lies in ascending but compared to the little doria along which you go down it only creeps the fall of the latter is one continual cascade distributed by flights of twenty thirty fifty feet perpendicular height down which the water precipitates itself like surf or very light froth so that at some distance it looks like the transparent clouds sailing along in a fine summers sky  the road of the descent is a zigzag at very acute angles contrived and laid out with admirable art and on it our carriers trotted as fast as the best chairmen in paris to shorten the way they would stride over the points of angles and there we and our carriages sometimes hung over a precipice two or three thousand perpendicular feet in depth the very mules when their riders are so venturous or when left to themselves take the same bold pace this descent is to travelers like being driven into italy by a storm  winter is no impediment to traveling over mount cenis for the snow renders the whole road excellent and in some of the rough craggy ways much better than in summer so that there are continually people passing into italy through the alps  a traveller cannot advance far in this mountainous country before he perceives many of the natives of both sexes laboring under that species of swelled throat which the common people call a wen or the deersneck and the medical people bronchocele near mount cenis very few are exempt from it and many of these swellings are so enormous and of so loathsome an appearance especially in ugly ragged halfstarved old women that the very fight of them turns the stomach i do not learn says sharp that this malady is ever mortal not but that sometimes the tumor compresses the windpipe so much as to render respiration very difficult which at the longrun though insensibly may affect life it is well known that in whatever place the inhabitants drink snowwater they are subject to this distemper this swelling however never begins to form till toward two years of age  end of vol xvii
