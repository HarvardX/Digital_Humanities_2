an essay on pope s odyssey in which some particular beauties and blemishes of that work are considered   each finding like a friend something to blame and something to commend popes miscel vol i le choix des grans mots done aux chooses une espece dame and de vie les beaux mots sont la lumiere propre et naturelle de nos pensees mais un discourse tout simple exprimera quelquefois mieux la chose que toute la pomp and tout lornement boileau printed for james and j knapton r knaplock w and j innys j wyatt d midwinter booksellers in st pauls churchyard london and s wilmot bookseller in oxford       the preface there is no person more odious than the man who makes himself greatly eminent it is a sort of tacit reproach on the rest of the species and every one feels his own meanness the more sensibly when he looks toward those exalted geniuss who have gained a superiority over the rest of mankind this may make it obvious to imagine that the following dialogues are partly designed as invectives and produced chiefly from that blindside in selflove which makes men willing to drogate from every one who has merit enough to provoke and fame enough to make others think themselves lessened by the overgrowth of his character  though this reasoning be exceedingly true in general it ought to be considered at the same time that any dislike to the eminence of others naturally arises only among such persons as are got into the same paths of fame the gentlemen of the sword cannot bear to have others rise over their head the men of genius look maliciously on a prevailing poet but pope i presume never envied marlborough the battle of blenheim any more than that hero envied him his translation of he iliad  it is for this reason i might almost sa that i cannot envy mr pope so ar at least i am unbiased i can hear he applauses which are given that great man i can admire the passages which contribute to the deserving them but i cannot be uneasy at those or detract from these out of any prejudices arising from this passion give me leave to say farther that in reading that work of his which occasioned this essay no one could be more delighted than i was in several parts of it many beauties i saw in it and i imagined i saw some faults in some particular conversations on this head i have found my self indifferent in the case and now i have here flung the thoughts on both together i hope with some degree of impartiality but if some things should be blamed without sufficient reason or others commended too highly and in a manner disproportioned to what they deserve i submit each to the many better judges who may happen to meet with these sheets i ask pardon for any errors in them i beg to be set right  prefaces i think are the only places in which a man may be allowed to talk freely of that worst of subjects himself i hope no body will deny one the use of so awkward a privilege and shall therefore go on without any farther apologies  to many it may perhaps seem arrogant to find fault at all with so distinguished and so noble a poet as mr pope indeed here are some things proposed as faulty from his translation but they are only proposed the world is to judge of them where i have been mistaken in any of these points it is not for want of a due deference to the merits of this writer but from the shortness of my own sight on the contrary if any such criticisms happen sometimes to be right the eminence of the poet will be so far from being a reason against them that it makes any true cautions the more proper and in some sense perfectly necessary  besides the learned world as i take it have ever allowed a liberty of thinking and of speaking ones sentiments that serene republic knows none of the distance and distinctions which custom has introduced into all others there is a decent familiarity to be admitted between the greatest and the meanest person in it this has often raised a thought in me which has something wild and agreeable in it when indulged to any degree it is in relation to the peculiar happiness of men of letters in that they can sit down in their closets and converse with the greatest writers of every age or of any nation and that in as much freedom and intimacy as their nearest friends could ever use toward any of them when living what an illustrious assembly is there on those shelves the courts of augustus lewis the fourteenth or charles the second never beheld such a frequency of great geniuss as stand round a man in his own private study how large an happiness is it for a person to have it in his power to say at any time that he is going to spend the afternoon with the most agreeable and most improving company he will choose out of all ages if he is in a gay humor perhaps with horace and anacreon and ld dorset or if more solid either with plato mr lock or sir isaac newton  it is this ease of access it is the liberty arising from it which constitutes and preserves the felicity of the republic of letters the meaner sort which compose it are all freevoters and may speak their real opinion without reserve at the same time the characters too even of the greatest and first men in it must be formed and established on this openness of judging and that freedom of observation  but waving whatever has been said of this liberty in the learned world most people will be apt to help one to an excuse of another kind for most i think are very ready to agree that mr pope is only the masterhand in this translation and that he has been obliged with the assistance of some other gentlemen in several parts of it though i believe i am acquainted with this affair more than many who speak of it with a great deal of confidence and assurance any mention of it in the piece is purposely avoided mr pope has recommended the whole with his name he gives the finishing stroke to every thing and the dialogues speak of him as if he were really the author of the whole it would have been a confused thing and often not practicable to have spoken at every turn to the right person this has occasioned several applauses of the poet which may seem too high for a stranger but as i have since had the greatest reason to be persuaded that mr pope is not the sole translator i have at the same time equal reason to think that the other gentlemen engaged are persons of established characters in the poeick world  after this perhaps those compliments may still be allowed to stand as they are i hope they are never wrought too high for mr pope himself and i believe they may generally be spoken very justly of his seconds in the work  one word more and i have done as to the manner of these dialogues it is the old platonic way which cicero brought from greece and used so happily in the latin tongue it has had its successes too among the moderns fontenelle will always be read with the greatest pleasure where he has followed it that writer is peculiarly happy in all his dialogues of whatever sort and in general may be said to talk as well with pen and ink as any man in the world mr dryden and mr addison have recommended it among us by their example indeed the method it self is more capable of variety and which makes it particularly proper for the present case it has something of action and reality in it besides that the common way among us of merely keeping up a discourse between two blind names is perhaps not very commendable the persons of the dialogue in such cases are generally like those actors who have no character in the play and who only come in to talk upon the stage they have no more distinction no other marks by which you may know one from another than the two capital letters which usually stand for them it is much otherwise and and much better among the persons introduced by the writers in the other method their great names i use only to authorize this manner of dialogue as that is all which i can pretend to imitate in them  as i ought to beg pardon of the reader for troubling him with so long a preface i shall at the same time take the opportunity of begging pardon of antiphaus and philypsus the two gentlemen who are disguised under the persons of these dialogues for giving to the world what was chiefly their thoughts in a manner so much inferior to what either of them might have done themselves i wish i might have leave to mention their real names in this place that would add a weight to every thing they say though indeed the sentiments of those gentlemen were they fully represented would not want the luster of any authorities to set them off except that of the the reasonableness with which they both think and speak and for both which they have made themselves so remarkable in the world  an essay etc evening the first antiphaus managed his affairs so as to get this winter sooner than usual to the countryseat of his friend philypsus it is there that he passes his time when ever he can clear himself from the hurry of business in a retirement every way agreeable and in a full enjoyment of those pleasures which attend on a particular friendship in an open and improving conversation the conversation there does not run in the present polite way of saying and saying nothing when alone they usually fall into some points of learning and as both of them are particularly fond of poetry their disputes turn more frequently on that subject than any other indeed their differing in sentiment can scarce be called disputes for whenever their thoughts do not meet each of them shows a diffidence in his own opinion and a willingness to submit to the judgment of his friend  it is by this means that they fall into each others sentiments more than could well be expected from men of so different a turn the enlarged genius of philypsus always led him to dwell upon the most beautified parts of a poem with the greatest pleasure while antiphaus who has a very clear head and has given much into a strict way of thinking is taken most with just descriptions and plain natural ideas the one was so possessed with the pleasure which he felt from fine thoughts and warm expressions that he did not take a full satisfaction in low beauty and simple representations of nature the other on the contrary had such an aversion to glitterings and elevation that he was distasted at any the least appearance of either if the latter was prejudiced for the ancients from the purity and justness which we find in most of their works philypsus had his foible too and was sometimes caught by the flourish and coloring of the moderns in a word if philypsus would sometimes contemn a point as low and mean though in reality proper enough and naturally expressed antiphaus in his turn might happen now and then to blame a passage which required a good degree of ornament as being too glaring and artificial  among several other topics one evening they happened to fall into a discourse on mr popes new translation of the odyssey as they both found beauties in that piece agreeable to their particular tastes they had read it over with a great deal of pleasure however philypsus was the person who admired it the most there are some lines says he to antiphaus pointing to the odyssey which lay before them there are some favorites of mine in that poem which you must not look upon with your usual severity prithee antiphaus be more sensible to the flame and spirit of a writer who is evidently our present laureate in genius and the most enlivened translator of the age i will very readily allow what you say of that great man returned antiphaus and shall always pay a deference to your more lively taste of the fine and sublime in poetry but you must give me leave to dissent from you in some particulars if i do not agree with your sentiments in relation to several lines and passages of that translation it is perhaps because i fall so much short of you in your inward sense of the high and elevated beauties of language as i cannot imagine that to be the reason says philypsus i beg to hear those particulars you talked of i am persuaded several of the passages which i have observed you to be less taken with in reading the translation will upon a closer view appear to be really beauties to tell you the truth i long to make a convert of you and beg you would be full and large in communicating whatever remarks you have made on this performance the evenings are long we have sufficient time upon our hands and i know not how we can pass it away more agreeably  antiphaus paused for some time and seemed to be taken up in recollecting his thoughts on this point at last taking a tablet out of his pocket since you desire it says he i will show you what observations i made as i went over the work they are the thoughts which struck me en passant and many of them will perhaps appear little and trifling  you will allow me i believe in the first place that lines very good in themselves may be bad when considered as a translation the aim of a translator is to give us the spirit of the original and where the original is just the very manner is to be observed by the manner i would not intend the express words or the mere turn of a period but that the imitation ought to be easy simple and unadorned wherever the first writer uses either of those styles with judgment you are well acquainted with that plain humble manner of homer which is more particularly kept up by him in the odyssey and as much as i admire several parts in this translation i cannot but think there are places in it which differ from the manner of homer without sufficient reason for a change the poet in several parts of that work seems to me to have let fall some lines that are forced some of too much flourish and ornament and a few even swelling and unnatural where the original is with good reason plain and natural and unadorned  where we admire the simplicity of homer with justice we cannot avoid blaming the want of it in his translator mr pope intimates in one of his b      notes that no reproach has ever fallen upon homer in relation to his sinking too low or being too familiar that as to these particulars he preserves an universal justness and that there is not any one place in his poem which can be justly censured upon this account if so a translator of homer has no occasion for raising any thing beyond what it is in the original if he follows his master it is sufficient all additional flourish and glitterings where we should meet with the plain and the familiar are at best so many beautiful excrescencies  there is one case which seems more particularly to lead mr pope into a glaring style it is almost ever to be found in his descriptions of day of light and of the morning it is true these are subjects which in themselves may require some brightness in the language but there is a great difference between giving one light and dazzling ones eyes beside the conformity to the original there is another certain and easy way of judging whether the brightning in these or any other points be proper or not that light we may be sure falls in a wrong manner or an undue proportion which does not make the thing more visible  there are of these descriptions philypsus which seem both to refine too much upon the original and to err according to this rule did you ever observe those lines on one of the most agreeable images in the world the break of day they are in the beginning of the third book if you will give me leave i will read them to you  the sacred sun above the waters raised through heavens eternal brazen portals blazed and wide over earth diffused his charing ray to gods and men to give the golden day several of these expressions seemed to me at first sight to take from the nature and simplicity of the description and when i turned to the greek i found those very expressions to have no foundation there it is the same case in the following lines  translat book   v     orig d  0  soon as the morn in oient purple dressed unbarrd the portal of the roseate east etc b             when the morning star with early ray flamed in the front of heaven etc  you will find these short sketches in homer to be much more simple and natural i leave it to your judgment whether they appear better with these colorings or not to add one instance more of the same thing is it more proper for circe to tell ulysses that he should stay that night with her and set sail the next morning or to hear her giving him leave to  b       m       spread his broad sails and plough the liquid way soon as the morn unveils her saffron ray i must own says philypsus this would have been more fit for the description of a voyage than for a speech in a place too where we only find orders given for setting sail at such a time  to me proceeded antiphaus mr pope seems to beautify too much in several other points beside those topics we have been talking of as where he calls the nobles of phoeacia b    0  z     a radiant band of noblemen and where he introduces helen with b       d     a gale of rich perfume breathing before her if homer mentions cups of solid gold in mr pope  b       a     the gold gives luster to the purple draught b    0  g     and in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine you cannot but observe by the way that the original here is designed to signify the real intrinsic value while only the outside and more glittering circumstances are what the english dwells upon entirely but to go on  the horns of a bullock are in this new language b       g     budding honors and those of a ram if i am not much mistaken b    0  d    translucent crescents pallas is well known to have had blue eyes given her by the ancients now it is  b    0  d     celestial azure brightning in her eyes  this heightning of things by a severe critic might be thought blameable and indeed whenever it interferes where the passions ought to be touched it certainly is so in an higher degree the reader is delighted when after a melancholy scene he sees penelope revived by a message from the gods and b    0   a   0 secretly enjoying the satisfaction of her soul but what passion what idea has he when instead of this he is told of her b    0   a   0 hearts dilating and glowing with florid joy  paint to him that unhappy princess in her distress retiring silently and crying herself tos leep only show the circumstances and the reader must be moved does her behavior and her sufferings strike him so forcibly when he finds it embellished into  b       a      echoing grief and silverstreaming eyes but however these passages may seem to be weakened by the finery and luxuriance of the language this certainly is not so much the fault of pope as of the age we give much into an airy way if a verse runs off smooth it is no matter for depth or clearness and as the ancients valued thoughts more than sound we seem to be taken with sounds more than thought to speak out we are got into an idle manner of versifying and if mr pope sometimes falls into it we are not so much to blame him for those particulars as to wonder that he does not do it more frequently in so general a debauch of taste among us  hold interrupted philypsus if you go on at this rate you will seem only to be got into the old cant of running down our own times i do not believe but that i could name some poet among us to answer any of those who flourished in the augustan age as to the present point we rarely hear of any such thing as translation among them in satyr we have the great names of rochester dryden and oldham not to mention the new kind of satyr introduced among us by butler in critical poems there are you know two or three very good beside that incomparable piece by mr pope all to weigh against poor horace as for miscellaneous subjects think of cowley pope waller and pryor to mention no more of them in the epick milton may dispute the laurel with either virgil or homer and in dramatick pieces of either kind we have writers that indisputably exceed any of the ancients  antiphaus was not inclined to enter into a dispute of this nature i was only speaking says he of our present taste in poery and the prevailing manner of those writers who are now upon the stage as to this philypsus give me leave to say that the language of our writers and the practice of the world is much infected with the finesse i think it is mr lock observes that the humors of a people may be learnt from their usage of words this symptom of the disease is very strong in the preent case thus to say that a verse is bien turn is the highest commendation among the french critics in general the beau monde is the only name now for what was called by a very different one formerly as a fine scholar polite literature and the belles lettres are the leading expressions when we would speak of learning in the best sense and i appeal to you who are so well acquainted with all our poets whether their practice in particular does not fall more and more into the finesses we have been complaining of we may partly judge of this from some lines in the best of them the writer whose works lie before us i was just going to give you a few more instances of it from the odyssey  is there any figure so much abused by the moderns as what they call the antithesis they run it into a down right playing upon words cowleys poetry could not live without it dryden uses it almost perpetually in his translation o virgil and was ridiculed you know o that head by the late duke of buckingham i have observed with pleasure that mr pope in his translation very much avoids this little beauty which the other affected so excessively yet i have a place before me where one of this kind ha slipped from his pen it runs thus he is speaking of a strangers arrival at the court of penelope disordered so much by the riot of the suitors   when to taste her hospitable board some guest arrives with rumors of her lord b        x     and these indulge their want and those their woe and here the tars and there the goblets flow pardon me says philypsus there you do not seem to do the translator justice the figure is countenanced by homer himself you see here is an antithesis in the original that answered antiphaus seems rather to be a contrast to set the riot of the suitors in a stronger light but call it what you please it is only single there whereas you see it multiplied and worn to rags in the translation this overdoing a point is observable in many other cases as much as in the former and in some is carried on to a degree which borders upon the forced and unnatural  telemachus bursting into tears at the name of his father endavours to hide his sorrow from menelaus who was then talking with him homer says only that b       d       menelaus observed him which words mr pope draws out into this couplet the conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise and viewed his filial love with vast surprise   for an humble natural description o a tripod or caldron set upon the fire i would recommend you to the following lines the flames climb round it with a fierce embrac b       the      the fuming waters bubble over the blaze   but above all in my opinion are these on a person tired and quite spent   lost in lassitude lay all the man b       e     deprived of voice of motion and of breath the soul scarce waking in the arms of death or these b       z   0   ye gods since this worn frame refection knew what scenes have i surveyed of dreadful view   would you imagine that all which countenances this in the original is a passage in ulyssess speech after his shipwreck in which he intimates that he had not bathed for a considerable time  i find it so says philypsus and own the lines to be somewhat forced and unnatural indeed those you have repeated seem generally to draw too near to that character but i cannot conceive by what means they sound so harsh to me at present when i read the piece there was scarce a line of them which gave me any offense  yes it must be by your tearing them from the body of the work that they now seem not so agreeable really antiphaus this is not sair usage of an author you rob them of their order and connection and it is thenc that they perfectly lose the beauty which they had in the whole very true rplyd antiphaus the warmth of reading the thread of the story and a general tunableness in the verse will carry a man on strangely and may sometimes cheat him into a alse pleasure but then it is for this very reason that i should think the justest method of forming a judgment on particulars is to consider them apart however let us try it for once in a more entire passage than any of the former let me see the place i have dipped upon is where minerva tells ulysses that she will transform him into the figure of an old man that he may view the posture of his affairs unsuspected and unknown the lines in homer may be thus read into english       to  0  i will make you says that goddess to the hero entirely unknown to all men the beauty and smoothness of your skin shall be taken away your limbs bent and the hair of your head turned gray i will then fling a garb over you that shall make you frightful and odious to those that see you all that flame and life in your eyes shall be lost i will so far deform them that you shall look contemptible to all the suitors to your own penelope and to your son whom you left yet an infant in your palace you know that mr pope in comparing some passages in the prophesies of isaiah with the famous eclogue of virgil turns the latter into prose if we follow that example in the present case his translation of these lines runs thus  od    v     to     it fits thee at present to wear a dar disguise and walk secret unknown to the eyes of mortals for this my hand sha wither every beauty and every eleganc of form and face spread a bark of wrinkles over thy smooth skin turn the auburn honors of thy head hoar disfigure with coarse attire every limb and extinguish all the fire in thy eyes add all the decays of life and all the wants of it strange thee from thy own thy son and thy wife every sight shall turn from the loathed object and the blind suitors scorn their destruction give me leave to go out of my way a little to try the same experiment on a single passage from the iliad which is flourished and set off in an extraordinary manner it is in the nineteenth book where we have a poetical account of a fine breed of horses the original runs thus           three thousand mares grazed these meads with their young foals running by them boreas was enamurd of them as they ed there and turning himself into the shape of a fine black horse accomplished his desires of this breed were twelve of the colts mr popes translation only allowing equivalent expressions to blind the rhimes runs thus  iliad b  0 v       0 his spacious pastures bred three thousand mare and three thousand foals ed beside their mothers boreas enamored of the sprightly train concealed his godhead in the locks of hair that flowed over his shoulders he neighd to his loves with dissembled voice and coursd the dapple beauties over the meadow twelve others of unrivaled sort sprung hence swift as their mother mares and father wind this if overwrought is the more blameable because the matter is carried very far even in the original and so is the less capable of being stretched any farther mr pope in his note upon the place observes that homer has the happiness of making the least circumstance considerable and that the plainest matter shines in his dress of poetry it is true it shines sufficiently in that some brightning is necessary in poetry but an excess of it philypsus may dazzle or may blind our eyes it can never assist or delight them  by comparing these passages you will see that which i intend the difference of manner in the ancient and modern poetry in the latter we find expressions added which seem to be added for beauties and which in reality perhaps only turn the plainness and strength of the original into the fine and the artificial  upon philypsuss acknowledging that he thought the point too much labored and the translation unequal yes says antiphaus the translator himself seems to be sensible of it in the present case for soon after when the former passage is repeated in the    0 original he gives an entirely new b        turn to it and i believe upon hearing the lines you will be of opinion that excepting a word or two it is rendered with a better grace and with more justice than we find inthe former  she spoke then touched him with her powerful wand the skin shrunk up and withered at her hand a swift old age over all his members spread a sudden frost was sprinkled on his head nor longer in the heavy eyeball shined the glance divine forth beaming from the mind his robe with spots indelible besmear in rags dishonest flutters with the air mr pope without question is happy in a great share of judgment as well as vivacity and spirit in writing but it is next to impossible in so long a translation especially as it is in rhyme not to give sometimes into sound and ornament when to crown all the vogue of the world goes so strong for both do not ask whether i should desire to see both of them banished out of poetry far from it expressive sounds are of use in the most natural and variety in the management of them is necessary to keep up attention in the reader that and ornament is what sets poetry above prose all i would say is this that sound is not sufficient where we might expect sense and that in humble passages in natural descriptions or in moving most of the passions additional ornaments are so many blemishes dressing up the expressiveness of homer in such fineries is much the same as if one should throw a very gay modern dress over the hercules of farnese or any of the most nervous statues of the ancients  but you will allow ornament where the subject will bear it and where the original leads the way  in a translation answered antiphaus it is proper perhaps only in the latter case but allowing it in both it should never be overwrought in either too much finery is always affectation and i wish our writers at present were not so generally given to elevate and surprise and all that as mr bays calls it  the running into this excess so much is what has unsinewd our poetry it is with poetry as it is in buildings the being vastly studious of ornament does not only take away from the strength of the work but is a sure token of a vitiated taste in the designer  you are always blaming the modern refinements says philypsus but will you not allow that this taste of the age is a sufficient justification at least of mr pope in those cases where he complies with it  we must write so as to please the world and speak so as to be most easily understood custom will often wear away the propriety of things of this nature and as for the propriety of language that depends upon it entirely i allow to ue your own thought that a profusion of lace and embroidery would be a disguise upon an old hero but they are so far from being improper that they are becoming on the heroes of our age   they may become the heroes of our age replied antiphaus smiling perhaps on a far different account there is another character now wove into and blended with that of a soldier to which these things are very agreeable how many are there of these heroes as you call them whose courage reaches no farther than their swordknot and whose conduct is taken up wholly in their dress but consider a man barely as a soldier think of him in the midst of some warm action and these little ideas of him will disappear then it is that posture that pressing on the foe that grasping of his sword that fierceness in his eyes that serenity and that eagerness on his countenance which strike us wholly and take up all our attention yes philypsus if you view a real modern hero in a true light those fineries do not set well upon him and i think i never saw any thing more truly ridiculous than the piece we were laughing at the other day in your picturegallery  good heaven the duke of marlbrough in the heat of an engagement with a fullbottomd wigg very carefully spread over his shoulders  but to return to the present taste in poetry  if this corruption of the age could excuse a writer for what he composes now must it be carried down as far as homers days must his heroes love and talk and fight alamode must his strong sententious lines be set to the new polite airs of handel and bononcini yet were what you would allege of any force it would carry the matter thus far and the whole iliad and odssy ought to be enervated down to the present taste no whatever may be allowed to any of the proper genuine productions of this age it ought not to make an inrode upon all others let homers energy and pathos be violated as little as is possible nature ought to rule in his works and those of the ancients as ornament and surprise and elevation have in their turn the empire of the modern world  you see i beg into show the old heat that this subject i think always betrays me into  i beg pardon philypsus and will attend more to what i am about for the future  i should have given you some instances of this elevation from the translation before us apropos what a glaring description of a sword have we in the eighth odyssey   whose blade of brass displays a rddy gleam whose hilt a silver blaze b       the  0  whose ivory sheath inwrought with curious pride adds graceful terror to the wearers side homer says that hermione was as beautiful as venus this is low and humble in comparison of mr popes hermione b      d    on whom a radiant pomp of graces wair resembling venus in attractive state   where a prodigy is sent to the ithacensians in council homer says that they were struck at the sight of it and revolved in their minds what it might presage to them this mr pope renders after the following manner b      b     the wondering rivals gaze with cares oppres and chilling horrors freeze in every breast   how mean is it and how much lik prose to tell us that penelope heard t mirth of the suitors to elevate this sufficiently you must say b          the shrilling airs the valuted roof rebounds rflecting to the queen the silver sounds   this false way of animating poetry a no doubt many will be pleased to call i grows particularly prejudicial and absur in any case where the passions are to b raised in the reader or described in the persons of the poem where we wou move pity in particular nothing is  me odious than a show of eloquence nature has provided a sympathy in o souls she has put a biass into our temper that inclines us forcibly to compassion odi reum cui esse diserto vace quin lib    c   and we should quicquid meris adjicietur affectibus omnes eorum diluet vires and miserationem secutate laxabit quintil instit l    c   leave her to her own work in such points without any of the impertinent assistances of art  the lines you have just repeated interrupted philypsus are such as i cannot admire but i think you carry the point too far against art in general is there not the greatest art required in moving the passions why then have cicero and all the critics of old given us so numerous rules in this case yes replied antiphaus great art or rather a great genius is very necessary toward any excellence this way but what i have said was intended not so much against the use of art as the appearances of it it is the greatest of arts to conceal the art you use and to have it very evident is the greatest of blemishes the critics and cicero in particular speak with the greatest plainness against any thing of that kind where the passions are to be touched apparent art is apparent fraud so that here particular care should be taken that nothing be overwrought  it is on this account that when you compare the following lines to the original you will not i dare say be over ond of them  the soul of friendship to my hope is lost b       d     fated to wander from his natal coast he said chill horrors shook my shivering soul b       d     racked with convulsive pangs in dst  roll and that entire passage of penelope  rolling convulsive on the floor is seen the piteous object of a prostrate queen words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies and breath to waste in unavailing cries around their sovereign wept the menial fair b       d     to whom she thus addrssd her deep despai etc i wish this false elevation and profusion of ornament does not carry mr pope in some few cases into down right fustian see p    a mans being lost in lassitude and a soul scarce waking in the arms of death looked very much that way do you remember where he talks of b        princes on princes rolled and obs    on b    ver    gods being heaped on gods or how in another place we are told that b     0  the pharian isle fronts the deep roar of dsmboguing nle   you know the character of some o sir john falstaffs attendants in the merr wives of windsor a sort of men who are industrious in talking hard words and whose humor is to be unintelligible one would almost imagine the humble account of shutting a door in the end of the first odyssey to be copied from those illustrious originals   the door reclosd the bolt obdient to the siken cord b       a        to the strong staples inmost depth restored scrd the valves  i own says philypsus i cannot but give up those lines to you and several of the other you mentioned before the first lines when you repeated them i took tobe the very worst you could pick out of the odssey but i know not how i comes about you rise gradually in your demands upon me and are got insensibly from lines in that piece which were forced and too much beautified to things unnatural and shocking when i thought of making a convert of you to an entire admiration of mr pope i fancy i was much mistaken at this rate you will turn the tables upon me and to tell you the truth i cannot but confess that the poet has in some cases fallen into each of the faults you mention  in some cases doubtless replied antiphaus that gentleman is not to be commended i take his translation to be as good as any translation of homer into english and in rhyme could be expected to be in all probability we might safely add that no other writers of the age could in the whole have performed such a task so well but a perfect piece of this kind cannot be expected if homer himself is allowed to sleep a little his translator certainly may nod sometimes   one thing i observed interrupted philypsus in the lines you have repeated that the faultiness of several of them was owing to an excess in one of the greatest beauties of poetry i mean the metaphors too frequent in them i observ the same says antiphaus as i was collecing these little remarks it occasion my using a particular paper for that single point if it did not grow so late  would show it to you but  no le us have it now cried philypsus i never knew any thing of yours too long and  it be that paper in your hand i shou think it much too short were it not for my concern for the poet and the desi i have of finding as few faults in his writings as possible  metaphor says philypsus is certainly the most universal enlivener of poetry at the same time that it adds to the dignity of verse it gives it an agreeable variety together with a power of painting out all its images in the boldest and strongest manner in the world it is this which animates those objects which must otherwise be still and unaffecting it lings every thing into motion life and action by this the arrow is eager and on the wing by this the sword thirsts for blood and the spear rages in the hands of the warrior metaphor raises each subject out of the heavy narrative way it creates new beings it represents the passions of men and even mere names as animated and imbodied and shows them in the posture and attitudes of agents thus when the battles are going to join you see rage stalk amidst the combatants pointing with one hand to the enemy and in the other shaking the torch of war by this the valleys and mountains rejoice when peace once more spreads her downy wings and plenty descends from heaven upon the happy climate it is metaphor which makes the woods and caves answer to the voice of the poet and the murmuring stream compassionate his complaints it is this which makes the nile know caesar and the sea its present monarch  if mr pope manages this powerful figure frequently to the best advantage sometimes he happens not to be so happy in the use of it the force of metapor is to make things strong clear and sensible any confusion destroys the very end of it and yet a little inaccuracy may occasion gross errors this way sometimes what is just with the figurative may disagree with the proper sometimes again an idea which might stand with the proper expression will be inconsistent with the figurative a misapplication either way is very obvious and yet it gives a jar to the ideas and makes the sense of a line to be perplexed and in confusion  it sounds but oddly to talk of a person and of his picture without any manner of distinction to say that the piece drawn by sir godfrey kneller for mr pope is an excellent poet and writes with the greatest command imaginable or that mr pope is a very good piece and his fac very well colored though he is but just recover from a fit of sickness either of them wud carry a mixed incoherent sense with them this i take to be partly the case in the following lines  b       d       now from my fond embrace by tempests torn our other column of the state is born nor took a kind adieu  b     0 in   0  they sweep neptunes smooth face b       b      declining with his sping whels down sunk the sun  to say the go of light was driving his car down the steep of heaven as mr pope somewhere expresses it is metaphorical to say the sun is setting is proper but should one say the sun is setting with soping wheels this would be neither metaphorical nor proper nor could it raise any thing in the mind but a confusion of ideas  again b       in       as some lone mountains monstrous growh he stood crowned with rough thickets and a noddingwoo   again b       in       hear me oh neptune thou whose arms are hrld from shore to shore and gird the sold world   i think neptune has the luck of it for it is the same deity that in another place makes just such a figure as i have seen him in some mortlockhangings b       e     the raging monarch shook his zure head and thus in secret to his soul he said etc b     0 e   0 this said his seagreen steeds divide the foam   such confusions of the metaphor and the proper have a great resemblance to that absurdity of mixing fable and reality together which appears so grossly in mr drydens hind and panther and which was the very thing that provoked lord halifax to ridicule that piece with such infinite humor and good sense the noble authors words on that subject may give a sidelight to what i mean in the present case speaking of the ancient fabulists they wrote says he preface to the hind and panther transversd in signs and spoke in parables all their fables carry a double meaning the story is one and entire the characters the same throughout not broken or changed and always conformable to the nature of the creatures they introduce they never tell you that the dog which snapt at a shadow lost his troop of horse that would be unintelligible  this is his dryden new way of telling a story and confounding the moral and the fable together after instancing from the hind and panther he goes on thus what relation has the hind to our savior or what notion have we of a panthers bible if you say he means the church how does the church feed on lawns or range in the forest let it be always a church or always the clovenfooted beast for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line  i had almost forgot to tell you that upon consulting the original there was no metaphor at all to be found for either of the lines i last repeated from the odyssey we have now metaphors perpetually the translator is vastly fond of them i need not say that an excess this way is very blameable you know the critics speak against it in a high strain and one of them goes so far as to say that this fequens mtaphorae usus and obscurat and aedio complet continuus vero in allegoriam and aenigma exit quintil instit l   c   figure when frequent obscure the piece and fatigues the reader when continual it is no longer a poem it is all allegory and enigma  as a alse mixture of the proper and the figurative confuses the sense the joining metaphors together which do no agree makes it still more dark and perplexed these are like what they call medleypieces a huddled kind of pictures which show a variety of objects flun together without any order or design as that in the beginning of horaces a of poetry they join the limbs of on creature to the body of another an confuse all the properties and circumstances of an action  if the poet be not very careful he man by these means tie not only things improper but even contrarieties together do not the following lines border o this to me the metaphors in them see to be improperly united  from elateuss strong arm the discus flies and sings with unmatched force along the skies and laodame whirls high with dreadful sway b     0 the   0   the gloves of death  at the same time nothing can b more proper and narrative than the original in that place again b        l   0   from his eyes poured down the tender dew   b       d     but anticlus unable to control spoke loud the languish of his yearning soul in these the action is described in words that import a violence while the act to be expressed is plainly something still and gentle  nothing is more known in relation to the metaphor than that rule of cicero s verecunda dbet esse translio ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse atque ut precario non vi venisse videaur  est hoc magnum ornamentum orationis in quo obscuritas fud  st cicero de oratore lib   that it should be so modest as to seem to have been handed into the place of the proper word not to have forced its way thither it should fall into it in a free voluntary manner otherwise it will make the sense dark and intricate and that absolutely destroys all the use of it for as metaphor should be the verecunda dbet esse translio ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse atque ut precario non vi venisse videaur  est hoc magnum ornamentum orationis in quo obscuritas fud  st cicero de oratore lib   greatest light and ornament of language obscurity is the most absurd thing and the most to be avoided in metaphor  if so i would ask whether it be very natural to talk of b       the womb of a vessel what congruity is there what idea have you of the forehead of night of a star or of the heavens yet in the translation we meet with metaphors of thi kind and though it may be tolerable to talk of the b        front of heaven the other two b       the blazing forehead of a sta and b    the matron brow of night ar scarce to be born with for my part i should not have expected these expressions from mr pope they rather pu me in mind of another gentleman wh in a poem of his speaking of the church of england says that tates mausolaeum divinely bright her frontletstars appeared while up toward heaven her ravished eyes she rear   i desire you would give me your sentiments on another passage what do yo think of the images in the followin line they cuff they tear their cheks and necks    do you remember whom it is spoke of really says philypsus i cannot we determine whether it is spoken of me or of a couple of beasts fighting   neither answered antiphaus it is used  eagles in the b    odyssey and in the  iliad of a couple of vultures  f iliad        there is an observation arising from this which ought to be considered in transferring metaphors it may be said that the word cheeks in this verse is justified by the original custom philypsus is the great rule of words and what is easy in one language will not bear in another because usage may have softened in one what in the other is yet harsh and unwarrantable this is evident from the very word in debate thus we use cheeks in english of some creatures beside men the term is so far familiarized and sounds very well yet to talk of the cheeks of a pheasant or the cheeks of a vulture will by no means sound the softer for it is prevailing in those other particulars  however this is agreed on all hands that a metaphor is not to be used unless it gives a greater light and makes the thing more sensible to us are the borrowed terms in this case more expressive than the native nay do they give you as clear ideas as the native would do they give you as clear where the poet talks of b       asswaging thirst with a generous intage or of polyphemes doing the same thing with a b       milky deluge what do you think of an b        ozierfringed bank of a voice just heard b       wounding the ear or of the seas being called the b       howling desert of the main mr pope b      0 notes questions whether the nodding of a mountain be a natural image should not you be apt to think too that a mountain b     00 shaking the forests on his sides is fitter for an earthquake than a metaphor what sort of idea have you of a b       wellfought wall or a b       thriceeard field in a word have you any idea at all when he tells us of joves b       rearing a tempest or of the b       whistling winds waking the sky  philypsus consulted his own mind all along as these points were offered and endeavored very fairly to discover whether the images were as clear and evident as they ought to be he knew that the great use and modus nullus est florentior nec qui plus luminis afferat orationi cicero de oratore lib   beauty of metaphor was to give light and perspicuity to a description to cloth words as he used to say with substance and to make language visible but as upon this view he could not answer fully what had been produced he was willing to evade it as much as he could these instances says he turning to antiphaus though few for so large a piece when laid together are apt to incline ones judgment to the prejudice of the translator it will not be air to look only on the worst side of him we owe it to justice and to the excellencies of that great man to give one evening to his beauties as well as this to his defects  be so good then interrupted antiphaus as to undertake that part for the next you know me so well i need not assure you that i shall be as much pleased with hearing the beauties as i am uneasy in repeating the faults of this writer  after some other discourse antiphaus going for his own apartment and reflecting upon what had passed between him and his friend took occasion to observe how impossible almost it is for thegreatest genius not to fail sometimes in an undertaking of this nature and how unavoidable it will be or the reader in a poem generally well wrote not to be led away from observing those faults by the vast power of ornament the easy fluency of the verse and his engagements to the beauties of a favorite piece the best qualified added he will thus err when ever they write for fame and the most judicious will be thus deceived when they read for pleasure  an essay etc evening the second between company and business it was some time before philypsus and antiphaus could get an evening to themselves the latter had waited for it with some impatience and did not fail pretty early in it to remind philypsus of his promise i long says he to see your remarks such a method of viewing a poem is something like the way of our favorite vertot in writing history we have the material parts of it without passing through the dead lines which go toward the narrative or the less significant passages which are to fill up the chain of events you must not expect any great matters answered philypsus though i have had longer time than we talked of at first it has been sufficient only for collecting some of the scattered beauties of this excellent translation  some of the lines which you repeated the former evening showed that the greatness of his genius had led mr pope sometimes into an excess if things can be too much beautified that fault does certainly belong to him in a few lines i confess he discovers a greater love of ornament than is becoming this is the fountain of all the several peccadillos which you observed from his writings whatever there is to be found in them either too glaring or forced or figurative or too much elevated may fairly be accounted for this way you sir produced some passages as i remember under each of these characters but how pardonable is it for so exalted a genius to run sometimes into an excess of ornament and how admirable for such to excel often in the just handsome natural manner as mr pope in the former may possibly want some favorable allowances he must certainly command the highest esteem in the latter  is not almost the entire b       to verse     episode of menelaus and proteus particularly just and beautiful what can have a greater share of nature without any excesses than the adventure with b   nausicaa how justly are the passions preserved in b    the descent into hell and before in all the speeches books   and  0 of circe and calypso  though these passages are generally of too great a length to bear repeating in a single evening you will indulge me with the reading some of the most finished parts of them  the whole episode is particularly well wrote but the things chiefly to be admired in it are the metamorphosis of proteus  his speech on the unhappy curiosity of men  the account immediately after of the deaths of ajax and agamemnon and above all that enlivened conclusion in relation to elysium and the future happiness of menelaus you remember the various transformations of proteus and i believe will allow them to be exceedingly well expressed  a lion now he curls a surgy mane sudden our bands a spotted pard restrain then armed with tusks and lightning in his eyes a boars obscener shape the god belies on spiy volumes there a dragon rides here from our strict embrace a stream he glides and last sublime his stately growth he rears b       to     a tree and welldissembled foliage wears the lines are extremely good says antyphaus but i had a thought came into my head that possessed me all the time you were reading them i could not forbear thinking what an happy contrivance it would be in the managers of the old house to bring this deity upon the stage in the same manner that he appears in these verses such a performance would set their character in the most eminent light they would infallibly get the start of their ingenious rivals and poor doctor faustus and his dragon would no longer be the highest entertainment of the beaux esprits of this age  i am got into another part of the poem says philypsus which might serve in some measure to arm their rivals of lincolnsinnfields against so formidable an undertaking there are passages in the descent into hell capable of furnishing out a great deal of the wonderful and surprising in this way but to return can any thing be more pathetick than this whole book especially the latter part when the heroes come to make their appearance though i am always lost in the variety of beauties which we find in it i must single out the speech of agamemnon and read at least the conclusion of it to you  when war has thundered with its loud est storms death thou have seen in all her ghastly forms in duel met her on the listed ground when hand to hand they wound return for wound but never have thy eyes astonished viewed so vile a deed so dire a scene of blood even in the flow of joy when now the bowl glows in our veins and opens every soul we groan we faint with blood the dome is died and over the pavement floats the dreadful tide  her breast all gore with lamentable cries the bleeding innocent cassandra dies then though pale death froze cold in every vein b        l     my sword i strive to wield  but strive invain surely nothing in nature can be conceived of greater strength and emotion than this circumstance we see the hero weltring on the floor all covered with blood and in the last agonies of death it was then that he heard the cries and shrieks of the daughter of priam pursued by the traitors and stabbed to the heart by the barbarous clytemnestra expiring as he was he endeavors to raise up his arm and at last gets his hand upon the hilt of his sword which he had strength only to grasp with a look full of rage compassion and revenge methinks antiphaus i see him now expired and dropped upon the floor but though expired there is still that rage and passion in his countenance he still grasps his sword and seems to threaten the traitors and the adulteress with his looks  i know nothing finer says antiphaus than these last efforts of dying heroes they affect the soul wonderfully and the weakness of their body which will not permit their acting at such times in my opinion sets off their courage and their desire of action in the strongest light imaginable there is nothing unnatural in this though indeed it follows nature to its last pitch the best historians as well as the first poets make use of such circumstances very finely and i remember instances of it etiam quos vires sanguisque desereret u intra vallum hostium cderent nitebantur live vol   p     per harne in livy and catilina vero long a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est paullulum etiam spirans ferociamque animi quam habuerat vivus in vulu retinens sall bell cat juxta finem sallust that carry this matter as far as g       aen       virgil or homer but some moderns as usual stretch it so immoderately that they go beyond nature and the moment it is so it must be ridiculous how often have we laughed at those rants of tasso and ariosto it would be very well if their heroes only threatened in death but they must die minacciava morendo e non languia tas away without being at all the weaker some of them in the heat of battle you may be sure forget that they are il pover huomo che non sen era accorto andava combattendo ed era morto ariost killed and so keep on fighting like stradas soldiers who after they are cut in two dimidiato corpore pugnabant sibi superstites ac peremptae partis ultores strad dec   lib   survive themselves and fight on with that half of their bodies that is left them to revenge the other which was knocked on the head an hour or two before  such things as those answered philypsus are not blemishes in a piece they are downright falsities mere outrages against truth as well as common sense nothing can be invented more ridiculous they are like the incomprehensible lies of sir john falstaff and put one in mind of his fighting with blount an hour by shrewsbury clock after that gentleman had been killed before very heartily by princ henry  on the contrary homer is as great a friend to truth and nature as he is to poetry he knows how to raise every thing as far as it will bear he ha always a command of whatever is prope to be said and which is yet greater always understands when he has sai enough  but we forget our selves antiphau this digression has carried us so far th if we do not soon go on with this spee of agamemnons which occasioned it w shall not know where it left off aft that pathetick account of his death an the barbarity of his queen he proceed  nor did my traitress wife these eyelids ck or decently in death my limbs compose o woman woman when to ill thy mind is bent all hell contains no fouler fiend and such was mine who basely plunged her sw through the fond bosom where she reigned ado alas i hoped the toils of war overcome to meet soft quiet and repose at home dlusive hope  o wife thy deeds disgra the pejurd sex and blacken all the race and should posterity one virtuous find b      0 l     name clytemnestra they will curse the ki the turn of expression in this is much more lively and passionate than the language of homer himself as you cannot value any delays where we meet with such improvements i am sure you will give me leave to read you the speech of ulysses just after that i mean in which he gives achilles an account of his son pyrrhuss behavior in the war   hear with pleased attention the renown the wars and wisdom of thy gallant son with me from scyros to the field of fame rdiant in arms the blooming hero came when grce assembled all her hundred states to ripen counsels and decide debates heavens how he charmed us with a flow of sense and won the heart with manly eloquence he first was seen of all the peers to rise b        l     the third in wisdom where they all were wise  give me leave says antiphaus interrupting him  that very verse i have formerly taken notice of the translator seems to me to have used an unnecessary caution in it he is tender of making ulysses commend himself by name where homer does it with the greatest bluntness   i know it says philypsus but that i should have put to the account of his improvements on this speech could any thing have been more gross than to have imitated that line in its own coarse rustic dialect is it not better on all hands for such a sentiment to be implied than to be expressed  custom and prejudice answered antiphaus have now rendered it unpolite and even shocking for a man almost in any case to commend himself but it was not thus anciently it is certain that it was not thus in the times of those heroes whom homer describes and home therefore acts with propriety in making ulysses say that nestor and himself were the wisest of all the grecians now is the translator in this case to follow his author or not is he to preserve the manners of the ancients in the characters or his heroes or is he to modernize them and to make ulysses and achilles appear the most accomplished finest gentlemen in the world  that will be carrying the matter to far replied philypsus i speak it only as to this particular and i own i am yet to be convinced that this humor o commending themselves was really s prevalent among the ancients perhap this is one of the places where home nods it might be a slip of haste or inattention   no interrupted antiphaus nothing can be more certain than the freedom and honesty of speech used among the ancients in this particular not only before homer but very long after his time  if homers ulysses here calls himself the wisest of the grecians his achilles does not stick at calling himself the best and most valiant of them and that too in a council of all the princes virgil has given us his approbation of both the one and the other in making aeneas talk frequently of his own piety and valor i could tire you with quotations of this kind socrates in plato is always brought in to his advantage and yet there he does just the same thing with ulysses in the present case he himself quotes the oracle which pronounced him to be the wisest of men xenophon represents cyrus upon his deathbed as taking notice of the greatest beauty of his own character his humanity in a piece which every one knows was designed for the character of a perfect prince in a word whole treatises ave been wrote of this very thing and n this very strain casar and the great ewish writer of his own life frequently ommend themselves the greatest criick as well as the greatest orator among the romans who so often reckos modesty among the things which are most necessary toward rendering a man great in his profession how open and frequent is he in praising himself and in setting his own merit in a true light but what puts this beyond dispute and shows at the same time that a just commendation of one self may by very consistent with the greatest modesty is to be found in the sacred writings in which moses says of himself that he was the meekest man upon earth  thus free were the ancients in commending themselves and not to consider here whether we or they were in the right whether their behavior may not be thought to have had more of veracity in it and our method to have been grounded in a great degree on a false estimate of things however that be i think enough has been said to show that homer was not drowsy when he wrote this line and that ulysses might use it without any thing of a vicious arrogance  to confess the truth says philypsus i was really ignorant in this point of the usage of the ancients and had modelled their manners too much by our own i now see my error and think the translator might have spared the excuse which he note on ver     b    makes for this indecency in ulysses behavior it is plain it would not have been so improper before a people less noted for vainglory than the phaeacians i thank you antiphaus for this new light and shall go on with the heros character of pyrrhus without thinking him so assuming as he formerly appeared to have been after placing the son of achiles next to nestor and himself in wisdom he proceeds to give an account of his courage and in that sets him above all the grecians without exception  but when to try the fortune of the day host moved towered host in terrible array before the van impatient for the ight with martial port he strode and stern delight  when ilion in the horse received her doom and unseen armies ambushd in its womb grce gave her latent warriors to my care twas mine on troy to pour the imprisoned war then when the boldest bosom beat with fear when the stern eyes of heroes dropped a tear fierce in his look his ardent valor glowed flushed in his cheek or sallied in his blood indignant in the dark recess he stands pants for the battle and the war demands his voice breathed death and with a martial air b      0 l     he grasped his sword and shook his glittering spear how well is the earnest spirit of a young hero described throughout this whole passage how does the impetuousness of his soul appear in these previous actions of the warrior had one the poetical liberty of making comparisons i should not stick at saying that this has a great resemblance to that admirable description of a warhorse in the most finished poem in the world   virgils georgicks      tm siqua sonum procul arma dedere stare loco nescit micat auribus and tremit rtus cllctumque prems volvit sub naribus ignem i am apt to believe that mr pope had this behavior of pyrrhus in his eye when he gave those lively strokes in the entrance of his ode for music we see the heroes there in the same postures when animated by the martial strains o orpheus  stanza   each chief his sevenfold shield displayed and half unsheathed the shining blade and seas and rocks and skies reound to arms to arms to arms by the sudden flow of their spirits and the rapidity of their imagination they prevent the war they show a noble forgetfulness of the place and circumstances of things about them and think themselves already engaging with the absent enemy  there is one speech more of those i mentioned at first which i cannot forbear repeating to you though i am sensible that i have been too long upon this head already it is that of circe to ulysses in the tenth odyssey  then waved the wand and then the word was given hence to thy fellows dreadful she began go be a beast  i heard and yet was man then sudden whirling like a waving flame my beamy faulchion i assault the dame struck with unusual fear she trembling cries she faints she falls she lifts her weeping eyes what art thou say from whence from whom you came o more than human tell thy race thy name amazing strength these poisons to sustain not mortal thou nor mortal is thy brain or art thou he the man to come foretold by hermes powerful with the wand of gold the man from troy who wandered ocean round the man for wisdoms various arts renowned b  0     ch   0 ulysses  oh thy threatening fury cease  what starts what terror and aazement what passionate breaks are here in these lines how solemn is the beginning how emphatical the account of the action and how lively the surprise and conusion of the inchantress upon finding the inefficacy of her charms nature here appears in every word that she says if the disappointment is great and shocking the lines too are all impetuous and abrupt if the passions strong and various the expressions in the translation are instant and pressing and the style often changed how great and swift is the alteration from an imperious cruel tyrant to a poor weak helpless woman and how is it equaled by that judicious shifting of the scene in this piece there the change is as sudden and immediate and nothing can be greater than the fall from the haughtiness of go be a beast  to the meanness of the line just after she faints she falls she lifts her weeping eyes   you cannot but observe farther my antiphaus that the lines in this description are every where improved with those figures which the ancient critics have always looked upon as the most proper to express an hurry of passion the transposition the omission of words the pressing use of exclaiming and interrogation and the general inconnection which runs through it are all applied in the most natural and poetical manner there is a note of the translator on a passage not long before this which gives us in one view several excellent observations of this kind and which no doubt he had in his eye here for the rules of it are exactly followed in the present case this poet is the best commentator on himself give me leave therefore just to look back for his noe on b  0 ver     note on the speech of eurylocus that you may see how exactly those observations tally with his performance here in every particular article  we have here says he a very lively picture of a person in a great fright  the very manner of speaking represents the disorder of the speaker he is in too great an emotion to introduce his speech by any preface he breaks at once into it without preparation as if he could not soon enough deliver his thoughts  again  there is nothing which gives more life to a discourse than the taking away from longinus e subl c    the connections and conjunctions when the discourse is not bound together and embarassd it walks and slides along of it self periods thus cut off and yet pronounced with precipitation are signs of a lively sorrow which at the same time hinders yet forces him to speak  again in a like case  he speaks short and in broken and interrupted periods which excellently represent the agony of his thoughts  afterward we see he breaks out into interrogations which as de subl c    longinus observes give great motion strength and action to discourse if the poet had proceeded simply the expression had not been equal to the occasion but by these short questions he gives strength to it and shows the disorder of the speaker by the sudden starts and vehemence of the periods  all these animated figures all those arts of expressing the passions are beautifully woe into this single piece of poetry but there is one peculiar excellence in it yet behind which i admire beyond all the rest it is a power almost unknown even to poetry before and the critics have not as yet found out any name for it the extraordinary beauty i mean is that insight which the poet gives his readers into circes mind we look into her soul and see the ideas pass there in train at first she is ignorant then dubious and at last discovers gradually in her thoughts the character and very name of the hero circe skilled as she was in all the arts of magic is limited in her knowledge and discovery of things and in the present discovery of the person of ulysses her mind acts with tumult and rapidity but at the same time with a series and gradual collection of truths at first unknown every one may perceive the tumult and the successive enlightnings of her mind we are led into a full view of the shifting of her thoughts and behold the various openings of them in her soul  what art thou say from whence from whom you came or art thou he the man to come foretold  the man from troy  the man for wisdoms various arts renowned ulsses  i never read any thing which sets the actings of anothers mind so distinctly to the view circes very thoughts are made visible to us they are set full in our eyes and we see the different degrees as it were of light breaking in upon her soul  it is a most charming piece of poetry and upon turning it every way and considering all its several perfections i believe one might venture to pronounce it the most finished piece the most complete beauty in the whole translation  these are the productions of a sublime genius and speak an uncommon spirit together with a firm extensive judgment and an exact sense of things but you antiphaus chiefly complain of this writer for his refinements and elevation there is too much of the enflure as the french call it in his works and you cannot bear with such a profusion of glitter and embroidery in the language i do not deny that the passages you repeated are generally blameable on these accounts but beg leave to produce some instances which may show the translator to be a master in the just and proper style as the former convince us of his excellence in the polished and enlivened and pathetick  how humble are the lines in particular b    where ulysses meets with minerva in ithaca and how rural the  b b    b    scene between him and eumaeus in that island so far that for my own part i must confess i should be more apt to imagine that mr pope on these occasions sinks now and then into lownesses beneath the dignity of the epick than that he soars too high or uses any false elevation  as for the just and chaste manner of expressing things it is very frequent in these passages there is a place just come into my head in which this very way of speaking is described the lines are close and expressive and according to mr popes method in his incomparable essay are themselves the best example of the thing they treat of they are verse     the   0 in the eighth book  with partial hands the gods their gifts dispense some greatly think some speak with manly sense here heaven an elegance of form denies but wisdom the defect of form supplies this man with energy of thought controuls and steals with modest violence our souls he speaks resrvdly but he speaks with force nor can one word be changed but for a worse the conclusion of tiresiass speech to ulsses proceeded philypsus i dare answer for it you will think excellent in this way   peaceful shall thou end thy blissful days and steal thy self from life by slow decays unknown to pain in age resign thy breath when late stern neptune points the shaft with death to the dark grave retiring as to rest b       d     to     thy people blessing by thy people blessed by this we see how mr pope can enliven any thing of this kind with the greatest justice and beauty such to mention but one more is that single passage as i take it in all homers works which describes the regions of the blessed the lines are very beautiful in the original and the translation has expressed all the beauties of it in a lively proper fluency of verse  elysium shall be thine the blissful plains of utmost earth where rhadamanthus reigns joys everyoung unmixed with pain or fear fill the wide circle of the eternal year stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime the fields are florid with unfading prime from the bleak pole no winds inclement blow mould the round hail or flake the fleecy snow but from the breezy deep the blessed inhale the fragrant murmurs of the western gale this grace peculiar will the gods afford b       d     to     to thee the son of jove and beauteous helns lord what can be more just and beautiful the thought proper and adequate the words glowing and the language alive to me the verses themselves seem to run on with joy and pleasure the delightful softness of those lines in homer  is diffused through the whole description by mr pope and the latter has the advantage of the original in concluding with a full elastick line that carries a spring with it instead of the heaviness of    i entirely agree with you says antiphaus as to the turn of the lines it is very fine and vigorous but methinks even in these what answers the two particular greek verses you have repeated are too much flourished and more remarkable for their sound than for any other idea they may give the mind the sense seems to be almost overlaid by the finesse of them  i shall not stand with you for that couplet answered philypsus what i chiefly admire is the general low of the lines in the whole passage  this manner of writing antiphaus is very assistant in expressing the nature of the subject and indeed though mr pope does sometimes go too far in the florid and artificial we may say in general that he is a very natural writer his imagination is lively his colors strong and his hand masterly in most of his strokes we should lose our selves in endeavoring to observe all that variety of beauties of this kind which are to be found in his translation one point i have particularly admired in it the poets peculiar air and happiness in drawing landscapes especially hanging woods slopes and precipices thus  high ithaca oerlooks the floods b      g    brown with oerarching shades and pendent woods   what reader will be so unconcerned and so little taken with this prospect as ulysses is represented to be in another part of the poem for it is the same place that we have a description of afterward when we are told that he   deepmusing over the mountains strayed through mazy thickets of the woodland shade and cavernd ways the shaggy coast along b      with cliffs and nodding forests overhung in ulyssess first adventures on phaeacia we are led on successively through several very beautiful descriptions first we have a b     0     e  0  rocky coast excellently pictured in two lines only thence we are carried into a b       to     e   0 thick dark wood for that night the next morning we have a b     0 to   0 z         view of the city the first things which offer to the eye are the castle and the senate house rising above the other buildings at a distance across the great road appears the port with the ships at anchor and their sails fluttering in the air on the shore just by the temple of neptune you see the phaeacians busied in the dock all in their several employments after this view you pass through a b     0 z     delicious range of groves and meadowground up to the walls while on this side b       z     appear the gardens all in bloom and the vineyards of alcinous close the scene on the other  there can be nothing better imagd and more natural than these descriptions are in mr popes translation they exceed even the original it self  i beg leave to repeat another description to you which lies not so diffused as the former it is one single view of calypsos grotto and what an exact and beautiful draught of it does it give us   a various sylvan scene appears around and groves of living green poplars and alders ever quivering played and nodding cypress formed a fragrant shade on whose high branches waving with the storm the birds of broadest wing their mansion form the chough the seamew the loquacious crow and scream aloft and skim the deeps below depending vines the shelving cavern screen with purple clusters blushing through the green four limpid fountains from the cliff distill and every fountain pours a several rill b      e    in mazy windings wandering down the hill nothing can be more beautiful to the eye than these landscapes are in the poem they make every thing present to us and agreeably deceive us into an imagination that we  longin  actually see what we only hear as the poet may improve all his circumstances at pleasure what the critics have observed in this case is not so extravagant as one would imagine we really see things more fully and with greater delight in the poem than we should in the reality the picture improves upon nature and we might look on the prospect it self with  dionysius hal  less pleasure than we hear it described  whoever is shocked at this may be pleased to consider the cave of the nymphs in the thirteenth book that alone may serve to show how largely circumstances may be added in describing the works of nature or in drawing poetical prospects  mr pope shows an excellent hand in several other places as in the first view of circes palace at a distance and constantly in the appearance of land off at sea  ulysses gives us an account of the former at his landing upon the island of that goddess  b  0     ch   0 from the high point i marked in distant view a stream of curling smoke ascending blue and spiry tops the tufted trees above of circes palace bosomed in the grove the other is very frequent take a description or two of it that come into my mind at present  b        n    like distant clouds the mariner descries fair ithacas emerging hills arise again  b       e     the distant land appeared  then swelled to sight phaeacias dusky coast and woody mountains half in vapors lost that lay before him indistinct and vast like a broad shield amid the watery waste nothing has furnished homer as well as virgil with such a variety of natural images as this element and in nothing has mr pope more finely copied his original but all these beautiful pictures are only pictures of still life this gentlemans excellency reaches farther he is as masterly in all his motions and actions he can teach his pencil to express ideas yet in the mind and to paint out the passions of the soul  sometimes we have all the imagery in motion if a ship is to set sail the canvas swells to the eye the streamers float in the air and the sailors are all full of noise and business b       b     we see the vessel move on and here the rushing sound of the water   the attending train load the tall bark and launch into the main the prince and goddess to the stern ascend c to the strong stroke at once the rowers bend full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow the sable billows foam and roar below  with speed the mast they rear with speed unbind the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind high over the roaring waves the spreading sails bow the tall mast and swell before the gales the crooked keel the parting surge divides and to the stern retreating roll the tides at another time you behold the rowers drawing b        m     the oar to their broad breasts and the different attitudes of them as they b        bend or b       stretch to the stroke  b       n    at once they bend and strike their equal oars and leave the sinking hills and lessening shores this idea of the land seeming to sink and recede is very beautifully added in another place where we have the description of a person driving very swiftly in a chariot i believe you will hear the entire passage with pleasure as it is all very just and natural  with hasty hand the ruling reins he drew he lashed the coursers and the coursers flew beneath the bounding yoke alike they held their equal pace and smoked along the field the towers of pylos sink its views decay fields after fields fly back till close of day b       g     then sunk the sun and darkened all the way along the waving fields their way they hold b       g     the fields receding as the chariot rolled   give me leave interposed antiphaus to observe one thing by the way mr pope possibly to make this the more sensible to us at present deviates a little from the truth and chooses rather to show the poet than the antiquary as i take it the horses in the chariots of the ancients were not beneath the yoke do not their medals and all the pictures of them represent it otherwise and does not the verse here in the original show its position in respect of the horses very particularly and distinctly  however this is a slip of a small nature and had the thing been expressed in exact conformity to the grecian fashion in this particular it might not have struck the reader so strongly as it does now by its agreement with the present idea of the same thing  i am not concerned says philypsus either in defending or giving up that particular i only instance this passage in general for its expressiveness of such an action and of the ideas arising in the mind upon it as to that end i believe it will hold very well the description and sentiment is very natural replied antiphaus i beg you to go on without observing any little breaks for the future which may be occasioned by such circumstances as do not affect the chief aim and design of a quotation  if the poet proceeded philypsus can paint out the ideas in the mind with so much justice as he appears to do by this instance and more particularly by another mentioned before of the successive openings and unfolding of an unknown truth in the mind of circe we shall find him to have been equally happy in expressing the passions of the soul something of this has been mentioned already and almost an infinite variety of beauties of the same kind might be added they bound every where in the translation and are generally well touched but there is the description of one passion in particular which is perservd throughout the whole piece it is ulysses his love for his country give me leave to repeat some of the first and last passages in which it is expressed how strongly does minerva represent this even in the ery entrance of the poem she says the hero is detained from ithaca by a goddess nothing human could have forced him into so tedious an absence by a goddess  who sooths to dear delight his anxious mind  successless all her soft caresses prove to banish from his breast his countrys love to see the smoke from his loved palace ise while the dear isle in distant prospect lies b      a    with what contentment would he close his eyes the first appearance of the hero is most excellently imagined calypso has just received orders to detain ulysses no longer from his country she finds him sitting alone upon the rocks the tears trickling down his cheeks and his eyes fixed upon the sea it was thus that he passed his hours in the island of that goddess he constantly  in slumber wore the heavy night away on rocks and shores consumed the edious day there sat all desolate and sighed alone with echoing sorrows made the mountains gron and rolled his eyes over all the restless main b    0  e     till dimmed with rising grief they streamed again pardon me says antiphaus even her though the passion be strongly set out yet the language of the two passages which you repeated last is not entirel free from the old fault the enflure is still discernible that soothing an anxious mind to dear delight falls short of the plainness and energy of the original  to make the mountains groan with echoing sorrow is yet more overwrought  and the streaming again of his eyes is not exactly right in the translation which does not mention his weeping before at the same time that it varies from the original which says that he never ceased from weeping  we meet with another image of this replied philypsus in the evening before ulysses sets sail for ithaca which i believe you will allow to be better expressed he was then in so delightful a place as the court of alcinos they had a multitude of diversions there the phaeaians were the happiest people in the world races and entertainments mirth wine and music were the chief business of their lives ulysses appears among them with a quite different ce he looks like a creature of an higher make of an order above them and his mind is taken up with farther views and other desires  all but ulysses heard with fixed delight he ate and eyed the sun and wished the night slow seemed the sun to move the hours to roll b       n  0 his native home deepimagd in his soul we are continually put in mind of this fondness of the hero for his country and in the last case it is particularly fixed upon the reader by a very expressive see mr popes note on the place simile we may imagine the ardency of ulyssess love for his ithaca his own proper country when we consider his affection for his countrymen the grecians in general upon an occasional revival in his thoughts of the destructions and misery they underwent before troy the heros dissimulation great as it was is overcome his passion breaks through every restraint we immediately see him all in tears this tenderness of his is painted in another simile the most pathetick that can be conceived and the most expressive of his affection for his countrymen   ulyssess griefs renew tears bath his cheeks and tears the ground edew as some fond matron views in mortal fight her husband falling in his countrys right frantic through clashing swords she runs she flies as ghastly pale he groans and faints and dies close to his breast she grovels on the ground and bathes with floods of ears the gaping wound she cries she shrieks the fierce insulting foe relentless mocks her violence of woe to chains condemned as wildly she deplores b     0 th   0 a widow and a slave on foreign shores it would be endless to repeat every thing of this nature there are a thousand sketches of it in the odyssey it is sufficient at present to observe that mr pope generally gives them to us in very lively colors and excells almost every where in the pathetick it is certain says antiphaus that he has an excellent hand his images which you have set before me are as strong as any of the works of the pencil they are so answered philypsus and on that account you will pardon me for borrowing so many metaphors from painting in this case it is unavoidable the designs of painting and poetry are so united that to me the poet and the painter seem scarcely to differ in any thing except the mean they make use of to arrive at one and the same end both are to express nature but the materials of the one are words and sound of the other figure and colors poetry can paint more particularly more largely and with greater coherence painting is the more concise and emphatical if this may excel in showing one view distinctly that can show several in succession without any manner of confusion any figure in painting is confined to one attitude but poetry can give as great a variety of motion and postures as the reality it self what seems a paradox of art in either is their power of expressing two opposite passions in the same face of this sort among a multitude of like instances is the mother of lewis the thirteenth in the gallery of luxembourg and every piece in that fine episode which concudes the sixth iliad in that picture the queens face strongly expresses the pain and anguish of her condition mixed with a regard toward her son full of the greatest pleasure and complacence in the poem we have the greater variety and each piece is perfectly just and finished hector shows a sierceness for the war and a tenderness that inclines him to stay for a last interview little astyanax has a fondness and a terror in his eyes a the sight of his father while andromaches face is all softened into a tende smile and at the same time wet with the tears that fall for her hector  i remember says antiphaus it was to you that i was obliged for the first observation i ever met with on these double passions i have since read several things in the aeneid as well as in the works of homer with a pleasure perfectly new on account of the light you then gave me into this particular and out of a thousand places that i have observed it in since i know none so beautiful as that of achaemenides in virgil which you mentioned to me the first time we ever talked of this subject  that you know replied philypsus to have been always my favorite i have read it over in dryden so frequently that i believe i can now repeat you his translation of it   from the woods there bolts before our sight somewhat betwixt a mortal and a spright so thin so ghastly meager and so wan so bare of flesh he scarce resembled man this thing all tattered seemed from far timplor our pious aid and pointed to the shore we look behind then view his shaggy beard his clothes were taggd with thorns and ilth his limbs bemeard the rest in mein in habit and in face appeared a greek and such indeed he was he cast on us from far a frightful view whom soon for trojans and for foes he knew sood still and pausd then all at once began to stretch his limbs and trembled as he ran soon as approached upon his knees he falls and thus with tears and sighs for pity calls now by the powers above and what we share from natures common gift this vital air  dryd transl aen       o trojans take me hence  it is but too evident continued philypsus that mr dryden falls as much hort of aen        subito e sylvis macie confecta suprema ignoti nova forma vii miserandaque cultu prcedt supplexque manus ad litora tendit   ui drdanio habitus and troia vidit arma pocul paullum aspectu conterritus haesi continuitque gradum mox sese ad litora praecp cum fletu precibusque tulit   virgil in the chief turn that relates to our present purpose as virgil has exceeded that il ch     passage in the iliad which seems to have given him the hint for drawing this admirable image  this distraction of achaemenides between several passions at once puts me in mind of the dubiousness and shifting of thoughts which is illustrated by homer by a very apt and expressive simile than which says mr pope there note on i       is scarce any thing in the whole compass of nature that can more exactly represent the state of an irresolute mind wavering between two different designs sometimes inclining to the one sometimes to the other and then moving to that point to which its resolution is at last determined  as when old oceans silent surface sleeps the waves just heaving on the purple deeps while yet the expected tempest hangs on high weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky the mass of waters will no wind obey jove sends one gust and bids them roll away while wavering counsels thus his mind engage fluctuates in doubtful thought the pylian sage to join the host or to the general haste iliad     0 debating long he fixes on the last there is something of this melange of passions and those too the most beautiful in this case i mean of opposite passions in that line of milton where he says that death grind horrible a ghastly smile    one would almost be persuaded that homer is the dernier ressort of all the finest thoughts in poetry for this likewise is copied from him though it fails very much as to the point in hand both of the original and of mr popes translation of it  juno makes a very mutinous speech in an assembly of the deities the infection took as much as she could desire and that success provoked and inflamed as she was forced her to be somewhat pleased in spite of her self upon this she shows a sort of il   0  uneasy satisfaction and such a smile as ovid risus abest nisi quem visi movere dolores b       gives to his envy in the metamorphosis  to see the gathering grudge in every breast smiles on her lips a spleenful joy expressed while on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent popes iliad b        sat steadfast care and lowering discontent this struggle of passions has been imitated by some moderns the first of the french writers in tragedy has a fine occasion for it in the wife of one of the horatij she was sister at the same time to the curiatij so that you may imagine how she must be distracted between the interest of the two cities and that eminent contest which so particularly involved the two families she is introduced upon that occasion speaking to this purpose albeou ay commence de respirer le jour albe mon cher pais and mon premier amor lors qu entrenous and toy je voi la guerre ouverte je crains nostre victoire auant que nostre perte corneille    alba my dearest country why could fate mark ou no other foe for rome but alba from our defeat what terror must i feel and yet  i dread our victory  there are many things in virgils fourth aeneid which might be produced on this occasion but it is more to our present subject to consider that part of the odyssey from which some of its finest strokes are borrowed calypso when she acquaints our hero with the design of his departure from her island upon his doubting her sincerity swears very solemnly that her resolutions are real the next moment she falls into a speech full of insinuations and arguments to detain him both these speeches may rather be said to be enlivened and improved than to be well translated by mr pope this only would be too narrow a commendation of them  the first runs thus  how prone to doubt how cautious are the wise but hear oh earth and hear ye sacred skies and thou oh styx whose formidable floods glide through the shades and bind the attesting gods no formed design no meditated end lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend kind the persuasion and sincere my aim the same my practice were my fate the same heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel b       e     but given the sense to pity and to feel one would think now that the goddess was to do nothing but to advise about his voyage and the conveniences for it but her passions immediately veer about and the very next page the very next time she speaks is all in a strain entirely opposite to what she has been saying in this  ulysss with a sigh she thus began o sprung from gods in wisdom more than man i then thy home the passion of thy heart thus will thou leave me are we thus to part farewell and ever joyful may thou be nor break the transport with one thought of me but ah ulysses were thou given to know what fate yet dooms thee yet to undergo b       e  0  thy heart might settle in this scene of ease etc i must not forget here that the fines of the modern italian poets has expressed this melange on an occasion which is attended with such a circumstance as exceeds any of the other the particular in which he shows it shows at the same time the swiftness of the intervening passion and expresses the strongest of any how immediately one flow of spirits succeeds upon a former and quite contrar emotion armida deserted by her rinaldo breaths nothing but fury and revenge she pursues him in the heat of the battle forgetful of her former passion she aims an arrow at his heart but see while it is yet in its flight how the passions vary on her face her rage and fury soften into tenderness and apprehensions of his danger in an instant her love is too strong for her resentment in an instant she dreads least her design should be effectual and longs to be disappointed in her aim  a swift flies the shaft as swiftly flies her prayer that all its vehemence be spent in air how finely are the passions blended in this piece the transition from the extremity of fury to an excess of love is managed in such a manner as to be wholly nsensible as when two colors are lost n the shades of each other the eye is greeably deceived and we are delightd with the delicacy of their union o unable to discover where one comences or the other ends  in this particular there is not any ing that can equal poetry or bear to  compared with it except its sistert of painting that might copy every lo stral volo ma con lo strale un voto bito usci che vada il colpo a voto tasso instance i have mentioned here and certainly what makes so beautiful a figure in the finest poets might deserve the imitation of the best painters was not the dolon and calypso of homer worthy the hand of a zeuxis or parrhasius a protogenes or apelles would not the aruns or achaemenides of virgil have been a fine design even for raphael and angelo to have worked upon if our shakespeare can give us the struggle of passions in the breast of coriolanus thornhill might trace the same and speak them as well with his pencil and if corneille expresses the contrary desires of the sister of the curiatij his countryman le brun might have had a much finer subject in the various passions of the sabines rushing in amidst the two contending armies to prevent those fatal consequences in which the victory of either party must necessarily involve them  but what i have often thought of as the finest subject of this kind either for poetry or painting is the first bruus on the judicial seat just before the act of giving sentence on his own sons for their treachery to the commonwealth what a noble strife was there betwee natural affection and the love of one country between duty and desire between common humanity and the spirit perhaps the pride of a roman what a fine groupe of figures would the suppliants for the criminals compose in such a piece on one side of the tribunal the wife of the judge and mother of the offenders and all the relations divided in the same manner between a desire of moving pity and an abhorrence of the very crime for the pardon of which they would intercede the people of rome on the other side with looks full of mixed passions some struck with pity amidst all their severity some almost condemning and yet approving at the same time the rigid justice of the father while others commiserate the youth of the sons and seem incensed at the unnatural impartiality of the judge  it is a misfortune that virgils hand was withheld from launching farther aen       where he has touched upon this subject but it would be well made up to us if any eminent person in the other art would undertake it it might certainly make a finished piece and painting in this particular would have the advantage of poetry as it could express this melange of passions directly and would strike the mind with them in their proper union all at once whereas when taken from the poetical picture the combination is not so easy and we scarce ever conceive it so closely as we ought  were you to give me full scope i should carry the rsemblance between these arts much farther than it has ever yet been carried there is scarce a figure or manner in poetry which i should not imagine to have its tally in the schools of the painters i could find it even in the very next point which comes in my way in the emphatical natural descriptions as they are pictures which take in the various circumstances of a place or action give us generally several groupes of finished figures this on the contrary is a way of expressing nature in poetry not unlike outlines and sketches in painting and as the lines in sketches are fewer but the more distinct this must be always concise and very expressive  there are several masterly strokes of the emphatical kind in the odyssey such is that speech of telemachus where he says prepared i stand he was but born to try b       g       the lot of man to suffer and to die   such is circes whole speech b  0     to     which i repeated to you before on account of its pathos such in an high degree is the first rencounter of the hero with that goddess  hence to thy fellows dreadful she began b  0     ch     go be a beast  i heard and yet was man this manner is necessary in all sententious passages and moral reflections it is often strong in expressing the passions and peculiarly useful in the sublime take an instance of each from mr pope  b      0 x     pirates and conquerors of hardened mind the foes of peace and scourges of mankind to whom offending men are made a prey when jove in vengeance gives a land away en these when of their illgot spoils possessed find sure tormentors in the guilty breast some voice of god close whispering from within wretch this is villainy and this is sin the reflection upon seeing agamemnon in ades is of this kind  b      0 l     now all atrides is an empty shade just after atrides speaks thus passionately in the account of his own death by the treachery of aegisthus b        l     but not with me the direful murder ends these these expired  their crime they were my friends   in the sublime nothing can be higher than the language of his gods neptun and jupiter b        n     if such thy will  we will it jove replies   this latter is that short full way of expression so frequent in naviget aen       virgil and       homer copied perhaps by both from the admired example of it in the great fiat moses and grown since into an  them phal  axiom among the critics it is the more to be commended in mr pope because the turn e gives the line is perfectly his own indeed in every one of these instances as i take it the chief of their strength and emphasis is owing to the improvements in the translation  antiphaus could scarce imagine that these were all clear improvements upon homer he immediately consulted the passages in the original and was surpised to find how far they fell short of the translation especially in the line that answer circes threat and the complaint of agamemnon i am pleased says he beyond measure in consulting these parts of the poem to see how much strength and force there is added to them have you not observed more instances of this kind impart them to me good philypsus it is no matter for method or regularity give them to me immediately  had i time answered philypsus i could find out several other places which have all their proper improvements at present i shall refer you to the beginning of menelaus his speech to telemachus in the fourth odyssey nestors v     g  0  in the third and in the tenth the speeches between ulysses and circe  i was going to point out some passages in the book    descent into hell but it is difficult to single out particular beauties from that book the whole of it is so excellently translated and i believe i may say so generally improved  the mentioning circe just now puts me in mind of another passage it is where homer describes the metamorphosis of the companions of ulysses they had says he the shape and the voice of beasts    0  but their mind remained firm and unaltered this mr pope improves into the following lines  b  0     still cursed with sense their mind remains alone and their own voice affrights them when they groan the addition here is very natural and full of beauty in such changes particularities of this kind strike us very much virgil touches them on this occasion  qumvis collo timuisset aratrum e spe in laevi quaesisset cornua front el      with his usual happiness and  conata queri mugitus edidit ore pertimuique sonos propriaque exrrita voce est mt      ovid who has shown a particular talent for such subjects has left us the very same thought with this of mr pope  i remember that mr pope appeared to me upon my first reading his translation to have improved much upon the original in his poetical repetitions of the same word the figure in which he is most frequent thus is it used in the following lines  a scene where if a god should cast his sight b      e    a god might gaze and wander with delight b     0 b     never never wicked man was wise b       b     here or in pyle  in pyle or here your foe and in these other very pathetical b       b   0 then stay my child  storms beat and rolls the main oh beat those storms and roll the seas in vain   it is yet more beautiful when the repetition holds farther as in this passage  b    0 the    transported with the song the listening train again with loud applause demand the strain again ulysses veiled his pensive head again unmanned a shower of sorrow shed this sometimes gives an additional solemnity and rises stronger and stronger each line  celestial as thou art yet stand denied o swear that oath by which the gods are tied swear in thy soul no latent frauds remain b  0   0 ch      swear by the vow which never can be vain this is sometimes carried yet farther and in virgil particularly there is a fine instance of this sort of repetition saevus amor docuit natorum sanguine matrem commaculare manus crudelis tu quoque matter crudelis matter magis an puer improbus ille improbus ille puer crudelis tu quoque matter    v  0  being doubled  but in nothing is this figure more beautiful than in the b      0 m     sirens song that piece of ancient music is greatly enlivened in the translation the whole flows on in a peculiar harmony and the chorus is very happily added in the conclusion of it celestial music warbles from their tongue and thus the sweet deluders tune the song o stay oh pride of greece ulysses stay o cease thy course and listen to our lay blessed is the man ordained our voice to hear the song instructs the soul and charms the ear approach thy soul shall into raptures rise approach and learn new wisdom from the wise we know whatever the kings of mighty name achieved at ilion in the field of fame whatever beneath the suns bright journey lies o stay and learn new wisdom from the wise   the peculiar justice and propriety of this is the manner in which these goddesses apply to ulysses b      0 m     by offering him knowledge a thing the most opposite to their own complexion and a motive the most likely to obtain upon that hero mr pope has shown his taste and his judgment very much in improving so finely upon this circumstance but what runs through the whole is that musical enlivened turn of the verses this is b see popes note on the place the happiness which of all things i admire in this writer either in prose or verse he has the finest flow that can be imagined i have often heard a very good critic say that whenever he is reading any prose of mr pope s he cannot help thinking that he should never have wrote any thing else and whenever he reads his verses he is angry with him for losing any time from them for prose how often has the same gentleman applied to this writer those lines in milton in which he speaks of the first poet as well as the first of men   paradise lost b       such prompt eloquence flows from his lips in prose or numerous verse more tuneable than needed lue or harp to add more sweetness  among so many excellencies the repeating those lines which make the chorus of this song of the sirens is not the least beautiful circumstance there are a multitude of other passages which deserve to be mentioned on account of the fine repetitions in them these are what fell into my thoughts at present and you have them in the same scattered manner that they appear there but one method of improvement in this translation i took particular notice of and in that i can be a little more full and distinct  mr pope has a very great happiness in transferring beauties he often guides his translation of homer by some fine thought or good expression in any other eminent writer and this has been the occasion of several improvements in that work  have you never observed how he introduces the elegance of virgil into the majesty of homer there are two b  0     speeches of circe which have much of the air of that of proteus in the fourth georgick and that of the sybills in the sixth aeneid the speech of b      0 aen      etc tiresias is improved from another of the sybill so also is the prophetical speech in the v  0  second odyssey  there are several imitations in a shorter compass of natural images and the like introduced into homer from the same treasury thus the following lines  b        downsunk the heavy beast b  0    aen    0  laestrigonias gates arise distinct in air b     0   the shores like mists arise b        aen       and all above is sky and ocean all around etc although the translator adds these fine strokes from other hands they are brought in so naturally that they seem to spring out of homers sentiment and if an instance or two should be found among them which may vary a little from the original it is only to add some apposite thought that is not only finer but at the same time perfectly agreeable to the subject in such cases a translator may demand the greater liberty of enlarging as a flattering resemblance is always allowed to painters i like that ery ingenious friend of yours who calls he french translation of tacitus la lle infidelle that piece you know ho not very precise and constant to its uthor is the more beautiful and the ore engaging  however it is seldom that mr pope vaes much in these additional beauties s translation is generally faithful even here it improves upon homer and he eps the chief mark steadily in his eye o at the same time it admits the side ances of light from other objects hus you will scarce ever find him deting from his author in such cases o this manner of improving him by itation from others is vastly frequent d often so plain that one may trace it through whole scenes together in particular i could almost be positive that mr pope read over the eclogues of virgil before he set about that part of the story which lies between ulsses and eumaeus and indeed i should be apt to conjecture that he usually read those pastorals before he sat down to any rural scene in this piece if i am mistaken in this it is the from virgil b       b      see also b      aen       b      b       b    0  b       b  0     b            etc resemblance of their beauties which has deceived me  sometimes we find the diction beautified by such resemblances or the sentiment improved from other hands from the scripture b       b           b           b       b       b  0     b        b     0  and frequently in other plces sacred writings frequently from parallel places in iliad b            etc ovid b    0  b  0     b        b        sneca b       horace b  0        b        homer himself from ovid seneca horace etc among the ancients and from dryden b   0 b        etc addison b       b        dryden addison milton and several others of the most celebrated moderns in his speeches we meet with improvements from the examples and rules of the orators of old and many from our own dramatick pieces it would not be difficult for a man of a good taste to discern the air sometimes of dryden sometimes of shakespeare b     0 b  0   0 etc shakespeare and at others of otway among the speeches in the odyssey i shall only point out to you those of agamemnon which are so very pathetick in the sea book    v     and     to    eleventh book you will easily see that they have a new manner which exceedingly resembles the hand of the most moving of all our tragic writers since shakespeare  antiphaus upon consulting the passages immediately perceived the spirit of oway in them he then desired philypsus to direct him to the other imitations he had mentioned at first he did not think they deserved so much commendation but when he came to compare the original lines from the odyssey with those of mr pope he was convinced of their  b      and frequently in other places beauty it delighted him to see what foundation the original gave for such a turn and yet how new that turn was in the translation he found almost in every one of them some addition for the better and scarce in any a deviation from the sense of homer it was homers sense but the expression of it was improved i thank you says he turning to philypsus i thank you for this clearer view you have given me of the beauties of this translation beside these last how many things have you repeated to me that are extremely just pure close and emphatical how many perfectly true and natural how many handsomely beautified and enlivened what pictures of things what descriptions of actions and what beautiful expressions both of the thoughts and of the passions of the soul in a word what improvements in some strokes upon the greatest genius of the world  yes added philypsus upon the greatest genius of the world assisted by the native use of the most noble and most poetical of all languages then were we to consider the inconveniences on the other side the general difficulties of translation and the difficulty o this in particular how hard is it for  poet to keep up his spirit and flame in anothers work and how natural to lag in representing thoughts not our own to maintain the vigor of language and the poetic warmth thorough so long a work and to express the soul of homer what a genius does it require what spirit would not sink under so large an undertaking yet does mr pope hitherto sustain his character in an handsome equal manner and we may safely promise ourselves the same of the remaining part of this work as he entered upon this stage with the greatest expectations of all men i doubt not but he will leave it with an universal plaudite  but however great and handsome his performance is in the whole i own with you that it has its faults the common marks of humanity yes my antiphaus you convinced me the former evening that it is unavoidable for the greatest genius not to fail sometimes for my art says antiphaus i shall make no apologies for the freedoms with which i then used this excellent writer any thing of that kind might look odd to you from one whose constant sentiment you now to be this that the kindest way of mmending a writer is to find fault with im now and then at proper intervals oes not this evince an impartiality in your views and add an air of sincerity and justice to those commendations which you give him your critics who extol a man universally and will not be satisfied with any thing under a erect character without any the least defect are a kind of romantic critics they are rather making an hero than describing a man they give you a picture of something which exists no where but in their own minds and a complete poet according to their representations of such will after all be only what the earl of mulgrave calls it a aultlss monster which the world never saw   very true says philypsus that sort of critics ail as much on one hand as u more modern critics have exceeed usually on the other indeed the former err on the goodnatured side yet both of them are very much to blame for as it shows a mischievous sort of frenz to start errors where there are really none so an obstinacy not to see aults where they are very evident requires either a good degree of ignorance or a most inveterate fondness  i am entirely of your opinion says antiphaus and since i find you in such a temper for it i could almost ofer to show you some farther remarks on that side of the question  have you any other then says philypsus a few answered antiphaus but i beg one evening more on this topic at present i shall only add my wishes that we may constantly use thisfair method in reading all the celebrated pieces which come out among us let us keep up the true balance and not suffer ourselves to be prejudiced either by too great fondness or too violent dislike this is the great rule of ancient criticism always to keep our hearts open to the beauties of a poem and never to shut our eyes against the defects of it  an essay etc evening the third almost all the next day philypsus was taken up in reflecting on what had been said at the close of their last meeting he began to be not so uneasy as usual in thinking that the faults of a favorite poet were to be looked into that evening he did not value mr pope less than formerly but he was thoroughly convinced that there was not so much of severity in this method as he had once imagined no says h to himself let us view impartially that we may rationally admire where before i was immediately in love with his eauties and fond of the work i now feel an equal pleasure and an equal esteem but it is in a different manner i now seem to see the causes that move me to be pleased with those fine passages and feel a more just and manly satisfaction in them it is true the soul is not hurried away with that vehemence of delight as formerly but the agreeable sense i now have from them is both more refined and more lasting how much is this rational way of admiring to be preferred to the common vulgar passionate one this is as a flash of lightning but the other is like the light of the day it is a serene difusd steady light which at the same time that it discovers all objects to us is it self the most beautiful of any  but then continued he how blind was i to the defects of this poet has not antiphaus shown me several which before i had no sense of and which now appear evidently to be such indeed that oversight was more excusable in reading the works of this celebrated writer than it would have been in any other reason may well lose something of her liberty when she is taken up with an object every way so agreeable and engaging however for the future i resolve to keep my self obstinately from being overpleasd with any thing and to read his as all other the best pieces in spite of all their beauty by that rule which antiphaus has laid down  with these thoughts he opened the translation which lay on his desk and was very busy in considering it when company came in and interrupted him for that night the next day he employed himself in the same manner this sort of view was new to him and of course the more agreeable sometimes he met with a line or two that disgusted him a little but much more frequently was he struck with the beauties of the poem and those he enjoyed with a full delight as he found that delight to be rational and just this search drew him on strangely he did not know how to leave off and though antiphaus stayed for the evening before he would disturb him he found him still closely employed at it my philypsus says he i am glad to see you engaged thus in the odyssey what new light shall we have into the excellencies of this writer have not you been collecting other beauties out of the translation  i have met with several other replied philypsus so many indeed that it would be almost endless to collect them but to tell you the truth my business was quite contrary to what you imagine i was upon a more difficult task i was endeavoring to try what faults i could discover in it that is by much the more difficult says antiphaus the few faults of that piece are scarce discernible among such a superior number of beauties how seldom do we perceive the disagreeableness of a single feature in a face that is very taking in the whole well but have you been able to overcome this difficulty can you discover any thing farther of this kind in the odyssey very little answered philypsus there is but one point yet that has afforded me any number of instances and that is a fault directly opposite to what you particularly insisted upon in our first conversation on this subject  it was then you know that we considered several points in which mr pope appears to elevate and flourish too much have you never observed on the contrary that there are a few lownesses in his writings and that he sometimes sinks into a diction which borders on the mean and vulgar i have replied antiphaus in some few lines but if you have made any remarks of that kind i beg rather to see those of your observation  the two friends were always ready to comply with the desires of each other philypsus as usual without prefacing or debating the matter immediately showed him the following lines  b  0     ch     a gallant leader and  a man i loved b       g  0 the old man early rose walked forth and sat on polished stone before his palace gate b        l     or has hells queen an empty image sent that wretched i might even my joys lament b  0     ch     struck at the word my very heart was dead b       b     euryclea who great ops thy lineage shared and watched all night all day a faithful guard b        x     they led me to a good man and a wie b      g  0 and sure he will for wisdom never lies in the note upon this line says philypsus we have a couplet repeated from the iliad which i fear is of the same stamp  iliad       in     who dares think one thing and another ell my soul detests him as the gates of hell i must confess says antiphaus that the lines you have repeated carry a mean ai with them but possibly what looks like a fault may really be a beauty in some of them  some subjects require a simplicity of style beside mr pope is to follow homer and should homer use an humble style in these places even to appearance improperly yet one should be apt to look upon it as a sufficient justification of his translator  for my part replied philypsus i have always thought that there is a wide difference between an humble and a mean style but not to urge any thing of that kind in the greater part of the instances just repeated i am certain there is not a sufficient likeness between the manner of the original and the translation  i shall only except the two last which re indeed plain and proverbial in the reek there is a simplicity as mr ppe tells us in his notes a noble simpliity in the diction and which in my pinion is not equally kept up in the english but those i shall not insist upon  as for the rest that mean close of the rst of these lines is in homer an   handsome sentiment delivered in a sounding verse and the meanest expression in the second    0  is poetical in the original the same will hold in some degree of the other lines as it happens mr pope in his b    observation xviii note upon one of them they led me to a good man and a wie has given us this prose translation of the same words the gods guided me to the habitation of a person of wisdom   now it might be thought a rude question to ask whether is the more poetical his prose or verse translation of this line  indeed where homer leads the way the case is very different i cannot say how far it might be justifiable to blame a translator for following his author and it was for that very reason that i should not have taken any notice of the delightful history of the coat and cloak which is given us in one of the longest speeches in the fourteenth odyssey  but we have several instances of additional lownesses i observed particularly that they were pretty frequent when the scene is in ithaca thus his task it was the wheaten loaves to lay b     0  x     and from the banquet take the bowls away   again but if to honor lost it is still decreed b       a     for you my bowl shall flow my flocks shall bleed   again b       b   0 is this returns the prince for mirth a time when lawless gluttons riot mirths a crime etc   the meanness here interposed antiphaus is occasioned by a just design that of writing in a style agreeable to the simplicity of the subject in several other places it has a less excusable rise i mean the labor and difficulty of rhyme the poets being in haste to get this drudgery off his hands sometimes draws him into the use of expressions which are flat and contemptible thus i believe we may account for the lownesses in these couplets  while with my single ship adventurous  b    0  in     go forth the manners of yon men to try meanwhile the gods the dome of vulcan throng b       the     apollo comes and neptune comes along  when great alcides rose b       the      and euritus who bad the gods be fo you need only read over one single passage to guess how frequently the sense may be lessened and broke by this means and how often we are put off with low wretched words merely for want of a more generous rhyme  you remember the speech of ulysses when shipwrackd in his voyage from calypsos island it is transferred you know by virgil into his storm and both are very strong and animated this is the passage which i beg leae to read to you from mr pope  happy thrice happy who in battle slain pressed in atrides cause the trojan plain oh had i died before that wllfought wall had some distinguished day renowned my fall such as was that when showers of jvlins  fld from conquering troy around achills  dad all greece had paid my solemn funrals  thn and spread my glory with the sons of men a shameful fate now hides my hplss head unwept unnoted and  for ever dead a mighty wave rushed over him as he spoke the raft it covered and the mast it broke swpt from the deck and from the rudder torn far on the swelling surge the chief was born while by the howling tempest rent in twain flew sail and sailyards rattling over the main long pressed he heaved beneath the weighty wav clogged by the cumbrous vest calpso gave a length emerging from his nostrils wide and gushing mouth effusd the briny tide etc the meanness of this passage in comparison either of the original greek or of virgils imitation of it which the english translator i doubt not had in his eye appears to be in a great measure owing to a poverty of rhyme it has given a low turn to the whole passage and that lowness is still most evident in the terminating of the lines  there are a thousand other things resumed philypsus which contribute to the meanness of style even a desire to avoid it will occasion it it is not uncommonly seen that the straining to elevate a point will make it really the more mean and ridiculous as nothing shows the littleness of a dwarf more than strutng  one would be apt to suspect this to be the case in the following verses b        l     there fis skydyd a puple hue disclose  there dgling pears exalted scents unfold and yllow apples ripen into gold   and in these other b     0 a       lured with the vapor of the fragrant feast  rushed the suitors with vorcious hste   sometimes one single word will lessen the sentiment and break in upon the dignity of verse thus where the greek calls memnon the glorious son of aurora we find it in the translation only b            swarthy memnon this by sinking below the original it may be as faulty to stick too close to it b    note   hogherd and coweeper says mr pope in one of his notes are not to be used in our poetry though there are no finer words than those which answer them in the greek language for the same reason i should think that the use of the word b  0             etc sy which occurs so often in the tenth book might be varied and in the sixth  b     0 z  0    in general what do you think b       g   0 of scudding before the gales to pylos of a b       sore soul and of b      g    sacrificing throngs are not these expressions to low for verse and is it not too low and rustic even for prose to talk of the b       swelling loins of a goddess or of a nymphs ibid     pacing along the sand  your instances replied antiphaus sufficiently show that beside the inconvenience of rhyme mr pope does sometimes without that wrong biass deviate into a meanness of expression they are directly contrary to his usual spirit there is a case says philypsus just come into my head which ought not to be forgot we may see by it on the other hand how much this gentleman can improve upon expressions in the original beyond the other translators of homer that venerable old poet uses a phrase which though i do not believe it to have been mean in his times does most certainly sound so in the present in speaking of a person entirely lost in melancholy he says that he was continually  il   0  eating up his own mind so great a man as cicero has endeavored to give this in ipse suum cor edens tsc quaest lib   latin but with that usual unhappiness which attended him in all his poetry in another part of homer we have the same manner of expression and it is as meanly translated by several hands the passage is a part of juiters speech to juno in which to set out the violence of her hatred to priam and his family the god says that she would  il d    eat them or swallow them up quick actius labeo a wretched though a court writer translated several books of the iliad into latin and if we may guess at the rest by the only verse left us of that work which as it happens answers this very line we have no great reason to lament the loss of it this an old scholiast has preserved for a taste of the performance  crudum manduces priamum priamique pisinnos labeo as mr pope observes in his note upon the il b      place is equaled by ogilby  both king and people thou woudst eat alive as is ogilby by hobbs  and eat up priam and his people all such a general meanness in giving us this expression of the greek poet must make us look upon mr pope with the greater regard if he can keep it from sinking in english this he has not only done but gives it to us in an handsome poetical turn  let priam bleed if yet thou thirst for more il b      bleed all his sons and ilion float with gore this expresses the full sentiment and that with an air of greatness and majesty in it it is now language not unfit to be put into the mouth of jupiter  antiphaus was extremely pleased to see so great a change in philypsus and that sudden as it was it had not affected him in the usual manner as men generally run from one extreme to the other he was afraid that the making him sensible of the faults of the translator might give him some distaste to his beauties but as he found he was fallen into the indifferent just manner of reading he thought he might now safely go on with him farther in the same way the defect says he which you have proved in some particulars on mr pope is sufficiently recompensed by his flame and spirit and the general beauty of his diction it is from this quarter that i am still the most apprehensive of faults in that gentlemans compositions surely says philypsus you have nothing more to produce on that head yes replied antiphaus i have a word or two to add to what we observed upon it the other night there are a sort of verses very frequent in our modern writers which run very smoothly off the tongue the stream is easy but there is neither depth nor clearness in it the truth of it is they are undisturbed with meaning and their calmness is as the calmness of the night which is dark withal if i might have leave i should call such verses as these unideal verses and i fear there are some few of them to be met with in the odyssey  pray observe what an unthinking harmony there is in this couplet which comes first into my head b       z     soft he reclines along the murmuring seas inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze   and what a panegyric in this  every eye b          gazed as before some brother of the sky   i will read you but a few more b       b     the royal palace to the queen convey   and b        n      plan with all thy arts the scene of fate   b    0  of deathful arts expert his lord employs the ministers of blood in dark surprise but among all of them upon comparing the original and the translation this seems to be the nonpareil b    0  d     then warp my voyage on the southern gales over the warm lybian wave to spread my sails   mr pope has had a critique on some lines of his iliad which is chiefly taken up in discovering or making false english of them if this can neither darken the line nor affect the sense considerably it seems to me not to be of any concern in comparison of the former finesses the ancient critics were much kinder on this head and it is hence that we owe many of our figures in rhetoric to peccadillos against grammar i am the most unfit in the world to determine in this case because i have always found my self  avere to the grammatical ort of criticism as i am fond of the poetical but i am apt to think that there are not many faults of this kind justly chargeable on the odyssey of the few which i have by chance observed the chief are to be met with in the close of his verses thus it occurrs if i remember right twice or thrice in that short passage which i reeated to you the other evening on the transformation of ulysses this rhyme philypsus is a terrible thing it has poild more lines  good antiphaus cried philypsus hastily be not so inveterate against rhyme does not it soften and beautify verse and turn poetry into a sort of music to a good ear  i am not universally an enemy to rhyme you know returned antiphaus it does very well in odes and sonnets to armida but for any thing very solid or pathetick surely it is an ornament too comtemptible as well as too much abused the first piece of latin rhyme i know of that famous stanza of adrian does well enough twas spoke out of pure gaiety and good humor but to introduce it gravely into poetry as it was the effect of a miserable deravd taste so will the productions of those ages show how happily it succeeded the runick lays answered philypsus i do not pretend to admire but surely you will allow it to have succeeded better in our language than it did in the hands of that monkish cla of poets it is true says antiphaus smiling we have not improved it yet into middle rhimes and some other of their excellencies perhaps it would have bee happy too for our poetry if we had confined this music as you call it to it proper subjects how wretchedly doe it sound in some of our tragedies i such all the actors to me seem rathe to be playing at crambo with one another than endeavoring in the least to affect the audience with all the violence that mr dryden wrote in this cause you ee he was forced to recant at last the only true reason of his persisting in it at ll is i believe very obvious though the as he would have given us it was then he humor of the age dryden every ne knows wrote for money and his usiness was to please his customers  and now i have mentioned mr dryden  may be worth the enquiry to consider  little more particularly what that riter has said on this subject as he must  allowed on all hands to have been e of the nicest judges of harmony one  the greatest masters of versification d one of the best poetical critics in neral that our nation has ever proced  in reading what he has given us in fferent places on this head it is easy  ee that he very much observes a erence between rhyme in the genuine e of the word by which he always ends the true harmony of verse  rhyme in the lowest sense or that gle and playing with sounds in which  moderns have exceeded all the other  of the world and which indeed since the last revival of letters has bad fair for the universal monarchy in poetry  though dryden understood rhyme in the first sense as well as most writers and yet generally stooped to the use of it in the other nevertheless i am inclined to believe that he always saw thorough the defects and inconveniences not to say the barbarity and childishness of it indeed one might be justified in saying even this for dryden himself follows vossius in calling it expressly preface to vrgils pastorals p    a childish sort of verse and says that some rhiming hexameters which may be discovered in homer were probably the remains of a barbarous age virgil add that writer had them in such abhorrence that he would rather make  false syntax that what we call a rhyme  the nicer ears in augustus his cour could not pardon him for a line i which he had only dropped something like it so that the principal ornament of modern poetry was accounted deformity by the latins and gree  after observing that the greek tongu falls naturally into iambicks and the latin into heroic verse he calls all o little arts of rhiming barbarities an adds that as age brings men back ito the state and infirmities of childhood upon the fall of their empire the romans doted into rhyme  what you have now read to me interposed philypsus shows sufficiently that mr dryden could give up an old friend and abuse him heartily behind his back that writer could speak the severest things of rhyme when he was got into a vein of prosewriting but the present ill treatment he gives to it may perhaps be on some particular occasion and in some cases i cannot deny that rhyme may be a very improper ornament  no returned antiphaus he is here speaking of rhyme in general and on a general occasion if you would know his sentiments of rhyme more particularly in relation to the present purpose and its use in translating an heroic pom as it happens there is a remarkable assage wrote by him on this very occasion it was in his more advanced judgment and particularly as he himself informs us when he was in his great climaterick he is speaking of hanal caros translation of the aeneid the performance dedication to his aeneid p     says he is very mean though that poet took the advantage of writing in blankverse and freed himself from the shackles of modern rhyme i will not make a digression here proceeds that writer though i am strangely tempted to it but will only say that he who can write well in rhyme may write better in blankverse rhyme is certainly a constraint even to the best poets and those who make it with most ease  what it adds to sweetness it takes away from sense and he who loses the least by it may be called a gainer it often makes us swerve from an authors meaning as if a mark be set up for an archer at a great distance let him aim as exactly as he can the least wind will take his arrow and divert it from the white  thus far mr dryden and his opinion weighs the more with me in this case because if any thing we might expect that he should be prejudiced in favor of rhyme but the reason of the thing you see prevailed over all other considerations he goes sofar as to condemn his own manner of writing rather than suffer such a corruption to pass without a severe censure and to that end very generously gives up his practice to his judgment  indeed i know of but one argument and that the meerest circle in the world to support the present practice of writing in rhyme we must use it because it is all the fashion we who were never so far infected can laugh heartily at some of the french for rhiming thoroughout their comedies yet rhyme in tragedy was very becoming among us in an age not the least knowing and polite disuse has made us see the flatness and inconvenience of that ornament and nothing reads more insipid than the best pieces left us in that way tell me philypsus why do we so much dislike those beauties of their kind in our age  i believe says philypsus it is as you observe now the taste is altered and the sashion worn off we can look back and perceive with ease the prejudice of that beauty where the end is to stir up the soul by true representations of nature to raise la tragedy roulat sur deux passions cavoir la terreur que doivent donner les suites nestes du vice and la compassion qu inspire la ertu persecutee and patiente archev de camay sur leloquence dial   terror or compasn is the business of the tragic poet and o endeavor to raise either with rhyme and all its harmony seems to me more proper for an italian opera than an english tragedy  very true says antiphaus and do ou not judge it as absurd where any other passions are to be moved as well as terror and compassion  undoubtedly replied philypsus  and is it not the business of the epick to awake the sul to raise in it an esteem for virue and an hatred to vice in a word to move the passions particularly those very passions you have mentioned why then is rhyme which you disallow in tragdy to be thought useful and comdable in the epick  as for mong the passions says philypsus rhyme i llow yu is of no use in either bu it is a fine ornament which may b more proper in the one than in the other in dramatick pieces the persons should be supposed to speak extempore but there can be no such thing conceived in an epick poem  i beg your pardon says antiphaus though not so strongly yet this is often supposed in an epick as well as in tragedy do you thin that homer is telling you a story o ulsses when we are got into phaaci in the   d aeneid have you not sever intermediate ideas which agree not wit a reader but a spectator  yes sir in all active poems as well as tragedy the author is to disappear as much as possible the greatest art of them is to deceive us into an imagination that we hear the very persons speaking and see them acting before us in ipsis omnia unt oculis every poem the nearer it comes to this the more perfect it is consider too how much of any good epick piece is purely dramatick it is carce to be imagined for instance how mall a number of lines in the aeneid are properly virgils they almost all belong to the persons engaged in the poem and where the lines are spoke we see the attitudes and behavior of the particular persons and receive the words from their mouth  much of what you urge is true answered philypsus but yet you must allow that rhyme sounds unnatural in tragedy and agreeable in pieces of the other kind that is as we were just aying replied antiphaus because in these it is at present all the mode let the fashion alter and this beauty will ook as false in one as it has already in he other this italian taste of your tassos and ariostos led away the first poet of our nation who attempted any thing toward an epick and probably we should to this day have thought it the only proper for our language had it not happily been disdained by the great genius of milton who chose rather to follow the true old roman manner it was milton who flung off our fetters and we may venture to say in the prophetical manner of a very good poet now living that mr wattss horae lyr pref p    he shall for ever be honored as our deliverer from that bondage what a pity it is he did not suffer us still to continue in it since we are so fond of our chains how happy would it have been to have given up the nervousness and majesty of his poem for pryors ease or the sweetness of waller i know not what they world may say to it but for my part when i read in the bishop of sarums history that paradise lost is a noble piece bishop burnets history of his own times p     b see the specttor v   numb  0 tho the author affected to write it in blank verse it always puts me in mind of the gentleman in the monkish ages of poetry who said of virgils aeneid that it wa really a very good poem and wanted nothing but the c sweets of rhyme to mak it the most perfect work in its kind  well says philypsus i own there is the greater majesty in blank verse but you will own too that the other is the more beautiful yes replied antiphaus but for that very reason is blankverse undoubtedly the more proper for the epick as that is the most majestic kind of poetry imaginable and even as to the sound those musical returns if allowed to be true beauties are more than balanced by the dead manner introduced with them into poetry what i mean is that perpetual likeness in the cadence and turn of the periods how frequently do they fall in several repeated couplets without any variety or relief to the ear you will sometimes meet with a rhimepoem all the lines of which run off entirely with the same pauses the stream always equal and so level that you can scarce perceive it to move what do you think of each couplet chiming on in the same stops and measure with the most tedious uniformity of sound imaginable  that is the fault of the poet not of the use of rhyme says philypsus i could name you  poem of this kind which has almost s great a variety in the periods as any piece in blankverse possibly you mean a piece with mr oldisworths name to it says antiphaus which i have heard you commend particularly on that score it is true our poets of late have endeavored to diversify the sound as much as possible we see great improvements of this kind in the excellent translator of vidas poeticks and several in the most nervous and vigorous of all our translators both in his manilius and lucretius mr pope seems to have thought of this much more frequently in his odyssey than in the former translation of the iliad and gives us an admirable od b    observe   observation upon it toward the conclusion of his last work but after all let our poets manage the cadence and structure in rhimeverse never so artfully it will fall vastly short of blank in these particulars indeed rhyme is a natural enemy to them it breaks and disturbs both the structure and the cadence the very sound of any periods the best contrived will convince one o this when a person of a good ear is reading them you may observe that he endeavors to drop the rhyme and lose the gingle of it as much as possible and when the sound of it is not sufficiently kept under you will find that it spoils the continuance and occasions too great a break in the period  you may see by what i have been saying that this charge is not designed against single couplets the corruption in this respect evidently ceases where there are no periods to be varied to determine precisely where it will grow prejudicial would be difficult and is not very material though i know not but what it might be uneasy to a very nice ear to have only four lines together with regular rhyme and possibly on this very account the stanza but of two couplets has generally unequal rhimes the second line answering the fourth and that of three varies in the last couplet however forced or delicate this observation may be thought one thing i could assert with some degree of confidence i dare say any one of a good ear who reads only ten lines of the best rhimeversification and an equal number of miltons true harmonious verses upon this view will find a nobler sound and that variety which is necessary to the beauty of periods and to the pleasure of a reader much stronger and much uller in the latter  what has been said of couplets may in a great measure be said of odes which consist of proper stanzas as these come next to couplets for shortness they have scarce room singly for the tedious uniformity we have been complaining of and unless the ode be long they do not produce it by their number there may be a variety too of singular use in this sort of poetry where a person can run these stanzas artfully into one another if the interweaving of them be not so frequen and equal as to bring in that very satiety we would avoid thus qualified rhyme is at least very tolerable in odes and even in pindaricks the most extensive and lofty of any the prejudice of it is not so pressing there is so great a liberty i mean in our modern pindaricks of varying the numbers and of fixing or deferring the rhyme at pleasure but above all in single couplets rhyme is most allowable and in them indeed i should think it deserves the preference to blankverse it may please the ear more and cannot do that mischief for which it is chiefly to be avoided in all large pieces and all compositions of a nobler sort in this respect i is with poetry as it is in building a pile composed of stones cut just alike all equal and uniform and disposed alike without any thing either great or beautiful in the whole will yield to one of a good design formed of materials various and unequal and perhaps ruder or less exactly polished at the same ime the particulars of which it is made taken singly will evidently exceed the others thus we find in a walk of trees that the two opposites when cut to nswer each other look better than if hey were in disagreeing figures but a wood or a garden full of trees all  one figure would be rather displeang to the eye than otherwise in the o similar figures we should have a easing uniformity but in this large peated view of the same thing we oud lose that variety which a late ry ingenious writer has shown to be eparable from the idea of beauty and which the mind seems to require the re as the number of objects is eneasd  it is a known rule in versification t the second rhyme ought not to reble the sound of those in a preceding uplet when it is carried to the farst it will not bear beyond the third e and even that is run generally inan alexandrine that in some degree the turn of the period and the numbers may be varied now why should it not be as disagreeable to have a perpetual uniformity of periods as a continued likeness of rhyme the latter no man in the world will allow to be proper nay it could not be born with only for three couplets together  but supposing rhyme a real beauty in poems of an higher kind which i am persuaded it is not to speak nothing of its uniform returns and the havoc which it makes in the periods nor even of the diversion it gives the thoughts of the reader and its general disservice to pieces that should be solid and pathetick to omit all this the single reason which introduced this question is as i take it sufficient to determine it if rhyme is exceedingly apt to mislead a writer often to cramp and sometimes to spoil his sentiments its benefits as being only benefits of sound will be far from ballancing those inconveniences of so much superior a nature this at least is the case with rhyme it gives either an impertinent pleasure or an unnecessary trouble to a writer and at the same time that it distracts his attention it increases his difficulties in a word it is a false bent put upon the thoughts of the poet and in the best proves frequently a counterbiass too strong for their good sense  i own it is with a strange readiness that people fall generally into this taste it has almost universal consent on its side and the few asserters of the liberty of verse meet with little praise or even countenance from the world how many persons would fly into unreasonable heats upon hearing half that i have said to you i should beg the favor of any such person who would please to be disobliged in it to ask himself what argument there is for this practice which has so generally obtained in the modern world if he can find none it is easy to bring the matter more home and to ask farther whether he thinks rhyme would be proper in the odyssey or aeneid and then what single reason can be assigned why it should be improper in a latin or greek and not so in an english epick  yes philypsus i am persuaded it is nothing but use which makes it supportable at present and whenever the world recovers it self from this agreeable stupor it will then appear as ridiculous to the reader as it has been inconvenient to the poet this i really imagine that in fuure and perhaps far distant ages the critics when they look back on any the best poem of this sort which may be delivered down to them from their ancestors will be at a loss to give any account of their manner of writing when they read mr popes iliad or odyssey they will often applaud the greatness of his thoughts and often admire the happiness of his diction as far as the present language shall be preserved to them they will honor his remains and when they look toward his ashes with veneration there will they say lies the great man who in ancient days is said to have shown the noblest genius to poetry in the world what beauties do we discover in him through all this rust of time and so much obsolete language he is every way to be commended as far as any of our ancient poets are only he fell into the common fault of those ages and always shows that trifling labor of making the last syllable of every alternate line sound like the close of the foregoing bating this insignifican tase of those times how much is he to be praised and how much to be admired  it would have been much better and much more for their honor for mr dryden in his time or mr pope in ours to have broke thorough this tedious slavery and to have reed the world from a taste so irrational and barbarous  i own it to you i have something of an impatience in me to see this great reformation in poetry set on foot i wish it could be brought about in our time and if not almost envy those who in future ages shall be so happy as to see men awake from this lethargy of verse when all the poets shall conspire to restore strength to their sentiments and nerves and variety to their numbers when the writers shall throw aside all those idle arts and tricks which we now play with sounds and true harmony shall flourish without incroaching upon true sense  conclusion of the earl of roscommons essay  translated vese o might i live to hail the glorious day and sing loud paes through the crowded way when in triumphant state the bitish muse true to herself shall barbarous aid refuse and in the roman majesty appear which none know better and none come so near philypsus began to be moved by what his friend had urged on this head i confess says he you are a powerful adversary to rhyme but you must allow one some time to get a thorough dislike of a thing which has once been so agreeable there are some allowances too to be made in the present case i believe no man is less embarassd by the use of rhyme than mr pope and his command in writing will take off much of your objection at present though i own your reasoning against this fashion in general to be very strong and forcible however this writer has a peculia happiness in it and his language flows with the greatest ease in the world i believe you can scarce instance a verse in the whole work which does not ru off smooth and handsomely it is tru says antiphaus there are very few in i that are harsh or any way faulty either in sound or composition two or thre which i remember of that kind are scar worth repeating  yes interrupted plypsus if you have observed any such l us have them what do you think  this says antiphaus b       and to the deaf woods wailing breaths  woe   or of these b    0  rich tapestry stiff with in woven gold b       by what strange fraud egysthus wrought relate by force he could not such an heros fate   no bird of air no dove of swiftest wing shuns the dire rocks in vain she cuts the skies b       the dire rocks meet and crush her as she flies b  0     i climbed a cliff  to learn if ought of mortal works appear or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear b      deem not un justly by my doom oppressed etc these lines are somewhat faulty in the sound or posture of the words but i only mention them it would be frivolous to make particular remarks on them you may see philypsus that my stock is quite out when i sink so low my task this evening was difficult enough to me and indeed it is not easy for any one to find many faults in a piece which comes from such excellent hands have you nothing farther to observe on it says philypsus i think i have heard you speak formerly of some contradictions  that particular i had forgot lays antiphaus there are indeed some seeming contrarieties in this work these are of two sorts one in which the translator is contrary to his original and the other when the translation seems to have some little circumstances in it contradictory to one another  since you mention the thing i believe i can recollect a passage or two in which the sense is pressed so far or so much altered from what it was that they seem directly opposite to the original when the grecian commanders were drawn into troy in the famous wooden horse the enemy upon suspicion of the design used an artifice to make them cry out by surprise if there were really any persons concealed in it homer tells us that all of them sat very silent only anticlus one of the officers was just ready to answer when ulysse who sat by him stopped his mouth by force prevented his making any noise and s preserved all their lives instead o which the translation says that thi anticlus b       d      unable to control spoke loud the languish of his yerning soul   in another place where in homer w hear of an hero falling in the defense o his country under the walls of his native city mr pope in drawing out the circumstances of it speaks as if it was b     0 the        on a foreign shore in the second book we meet with three or four particulars of this kind  there telemachus desires the suitors as it is in homer to leave him and be quiet as in mr pope to b      b  0   rise in his aid  there the same prince is said to draw his hand gently out of that of antinous instead of which the translation i think tells us that he frowned caught away his hand b       b        sternly and strode away in a passion it is the same case with mentor in the council he rose to make a speech to them with as the greek signifies a wise or friendly air but in the english b       b     stern as he rose he cast his eyes around that flashed with rage and as he spoke he frowned   these look like contrarieties between homer and his translator there seem to be a few others between passages in the translation it self  there is a part of mercurys speech in the fifth odyssey and another point in the description of lachaea an uninhabited island which i remember i mentioned to you formerly as examples of this inconsistency such indeed they appeared to me even after a second and third reading but upon consulting the original i at last found them to be capable of a consistent meaning however it is to be wished that the translator had set them in a clearer light for in one the reader will be apt to imagine that the poet speaks of book   compare verse     with     inhabitants in a desert country and in the other that mercury is said to have been book   compare verse    with     vastly delighted with the sight of calypsos island and not t have been delighted at all with the sight of it  in another place i take it to be in the very first book of the odyssey telemachus says that his father is b       and  0  dead and that he is wandering from country to country at the same article of time thus too we hear the sea called the b      foaming flood in one line and in the very next it is the level surface of the deep  as for mere mistakes where a verse carries something of blunder in the sound of it i have taken but little notice of them and shall only mention two or three just to show that the greatest writers are capable of falling into such errors as will be discernible to the meanest readers  b  0     i answered goddess human is thy breast   is a line of this kind and the expressions in it will appear to every one that looks upon it to be improperly put together on the same account as those in the following couplet b       some other motive goddes sways thy mind some close design or turn of womankind   there is a verse just come into my head in which mr pope may be thought to talk of b    0 see from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh seeing a sound and in another we are told of a place so nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow sent with full force could reach the depth below b     0  deep that you could not shoot to the bottom of it  i know not whether a severe critic would not think that there is a jar between the expressions where ulysses is said to be  doomed to mourn b    00 bitter constraint erroneous and forlorn and where halitherses speaks of b    0  deeds then undone but these and such like trifles i shall leave to those who are fond of finding faults and whom i can own without envy to have a greater niceness and curiosity in verbal criticism than ever i desire to have  these though less considerable blemishes in a poetical character are much more obvious to every eye than the greater defects of a poem and will be always observed upon with more scorn and contempt than any other they border on ridicule and that is a thing which will ever be agreeable to little minds that verse of sir richard blackmores in which he describes a painted vest prince voltigern had on which from a naked pict his gransire won  the vest of a naked pict and that in one of mr drydens tragedies which speaks of what horrid silence does invade my ear silence invading the ear has probably been repeated many times more than the best line he ever wrote this is low enough of conscience though it has been a very fashionable way of criticizing of late years it shows how illnatured the world is but people will have their laugh and it is vastly easier to ridicule than to admire  it is this sort of men philypsus and a clan of others equally malicious and more gloomy than the former who have brought the name of critic into such contempt among us while those have imagined that sneering and malice are the best titles to wit and these were of opinion that to find fault is to critiise how different from this was the ethod of the ancient critics of greece and rome indeed criticism as first intuted by aristotle was designed for a andard of judging well to give an inght into the excellencies of authors and to discern their faults there was  time when it was a study highly raonal far from borrowing its force from idicule and false wit it should proed upon known rules and established easures i do not say but what the st critics may have approved of parular lines without being capable of gning the reasons why they pleased m so greatly you often see a face ch is very taking without any regularity of features such an one as pleases every body though no body can give the reason of his being pleased with it eloquence has its je ne scai quois as well as beauty however most commonly we can specify the particular features which are so agreeable or know that our pleasure is founded on the symmetry of the whole  but it is not enough that criticism is rational it should ever be human and goodnatured where the design is great the disposition just the descriptions lively and the language generally good and poetical that work is in general to be commended though the poet in particular points may have fallen into many faults nay into some which look very gross when they are considered singly the greatest critic among the roman poets lays it down for a rule that where there are more beauties tha faults in a poem that piece is to be pronounced good and one of the greate critics among the greek carries it farther he shows at large longinus  etc that ther is often a negligence that is becoming  that a greatness of soul will carry man above the observation of little circumstances  and that a poet of a generous spirit with faults is greatly preferable to a low wary writer without them  agreeable to this was the behavior of these great men in laying down rules or making observations their intention was to distinguish the beauties of language or sentiments from the defects and vices of either you find them to have been in love with the charms of eloquence and the true spirit of poetry wherever they meet with them they ake not that snarling satisfaction in finding faults which many of their pretended successors are so full of in their writings indeed they very freely pointed out the mistakes and vices of the greatest writers but their chief design in this was that such of their remarks might erve as buoys to show where former entures had miscarried and to prevent others from running upon the same shalows this was the spirit of the antint critics their fate was according  their merit they still remain among s and are read with pleasure and apause whilst zoilus the only modern itick of the ancients has left nothing behind him except the odious memor of his impotence and his malice  our modern zoiluss interposed philypsus are very easily known they ru down the performances of the best writers with heat and noise every thing is a fault with them they will go regularly thorough a poem with a constant frown upon them and think themselves obliged to find mistakes or nonsens in every line of it they condemn b tale and censure by the sheet nothing is more probable than that from the poem they come to quarrel with the person of the author blemishes in his moral character and even natural imperfections have a share in their observations and in a word they labou hard to convince you that they are bad christians as well as bad critics the best of it is their attacks are as weak as they are violent they have but little of courage though they make so great a noise with it and are like a sort o currs that bark most and run the soonest the character that was given o the french as warriors is true of these people as writers they behave themselves fiercer than men in the onset and in the shock are feebler than women  i think you cannot be too severe upon them resumed antiphaus they are a contradiction to true criticism as they always show the greatest malice against every thing that deserves the most to be commended mr pope has had the fate to be attacked by these animals and indeed i do not see how he could avoid it he has too many excellencies to let them sleep in quiet  it is certain that the faults of a writer and never was any writer without faults ought to be observed and the more excellent an author is the more necessary is such a work but this is the drudgery of criticism the pleasure and the profit are on the other side  we ought to show faults but we ought ever to show malice and beside the eneral good nature which is owing to se great men who have eminently bligd the world by their labors here are particular allowances to be ade in this last work of the greatest oet of our age nothing in the world s more laborious than translation d especially when the piece is engaged r and must go on it is extremely fficult to keep up the spirit of poetry anothers compositions though you catch all the mollia tempora fandi aptest moments and never employ the mind but when there is a impetus comes upon it toward that particular business and this difficulty i greatly increased where a man cannon well set down to it only at such time as his muse is in a good humor bu may be obliged in a manner to writ by the hour and upon fixed returns know not how ar this was the case wit mr pope in this performance b wherever it was the poet will be litt more than a common man he is a such times much the same as a proph without his afflatus  beside this i must repeat what i ha sad s often the constant returns  rhim unavoidably unnerve a pem the age is in love with this weakne and mr pope in indulging their humo has taken much from the strength of h genius had he been less obliging to t taste of his readers his performan might have been more sinewy and mo complete this ought certainly to  taken into the account and wherev the translation falls short of the for and nervousness of homer we ought costant to ask our selves this question whether homer himself could have carried it farther had he wrote as mr pope does in english and in rhyme  it is true all this may be said of his translation of the iliad but if that piece exceed this of the odyssey it is very natural upon other accounts that it should do so homer exceeds himself in that poem  great actions strike the soul with rapidity while all the things that relate to lower life are less vigoous and affecting  the description of warriors and moral precepts have a very different effect on the writers themselves those assist the poetical flame while these ling the mind into a more edentary posture it is natural almost or people to sleep at sermons but a attle rouzes and animates the spectaors as well as those who are engaged  it thus there must be less spirit in he writer as well as less attentiveness n the reader of the odyssey and a tranation of it even from one and the same and could not fairly be expected to qual a translation of the iliad the rear and the poet have both of them the disdvantage of a cooler and more unactive bject a poet as age always is vastly kative a fable laid infinitely lower and a diction almost perpetual in moral sentences and reflections give a pattern very different from homer in all his vigor describing the passion of achilles and sounding out the wars of the greeks with an air the most martial and animated that can be imagined  here antiphaus rose up from his seat and as philypsus perceived that he had finished i was unwilling to interrupt you says he otherwise i should have observed on a verse or two which you repeated as rough and of a bad turn what were those lines of the rocs which you mentioned just now  of the rocks says antiphaus let me see  oh i remember them no bird of air no dove of swiftest wing shuns the dire rocks in vain she cuts the skies the dire rocks meet and crush her as she lies   the same says philypsus these and that other verse rich tapestry siff with inwoven gold ound indeed rough but to me their roughness is their beauty the turn o them seems designed and their manner to be expressive of their sense if that be the case i beg pardon says antiphaus were i the greatest enemy in the world to mere harmony and the stated returns and gingle of syllables i should be one of the first among the admirers of sound whenever it is made serviceable to nature and true sense that is the art says philypsus and the mastery for which i particularly admire mr pope it is he who took up that great rule of the sounds being a comment on the sense and enford it beyond any of the critics who went before him to this writer we chiefly owe the revival of the nobler art of numbers and the method of signifying motions and actions and all that vast variety of our own passions by sounds in his incomparable essay on criticism this writer has given us the best advises and interwove the most beautiful examples into them in a manner that will always be admired the first stanza in his ode on st caecilias day is the fullest piece of this kind perhaps extant in any language it is it self a perfect consort in the translations of homer we find him very frequent and very just in the same manner of expressing things i call it so and could almost be persuaded to think it a better way of expressing than in the common way of words these have a sense affixt to them by custom while the other speaks by the ideas of things that is a flowing variable help this is the voice of nature and a sort of universal poetical language  mr pope affords us infinite examples of this beauty in his translation of the odyssey it would be endless to repeat them all or to admire them as they deserve but amidst all this variety there is a single point which i have observed more than any of the rest whenever the poet is speaking of the watery element or any thing belonging to it his management of sounds is particularly frequent and beautiful  though it might not be much observed at the first view i know no place where a greater variety of things are expressed this way than in the twelfth odyssey it is where ulysses is giving an account of his setting sail from the island of circe  b         we rushed into the main then bending to the stroke their oars they drew to their broad breasts and swift the galley flew up sprung a brisker breeze with freshning gales the friendly goddess stretched the swelling ails we drop our oars at ease the pilot guides the vessel light along the level glides then rising sad and slow with pensive look thus to the melancholy train i spoke the objects shift perpetually in these lines and yet there is not a single period or pause in them the sound and turn of which does not agree perfectly with the sentiment i do not intend to enlarge much upon them but had it been wrote in the days of dionysius halicarnassaeus i doubt not but he would have given us a dissertation on a passage which so variously expresses that art of which he was particularly fond that is the critic i think says antiphaus who first  p    ed r steph observed this beauty in the noted description of sisyphus his stone yes answered philypsus and every one knows how perfectly well the excellence of that passage is preserved b        l     in mr popes translation  words give us the bare ideas of things but words thus managed impress them ery strongly and sensibly upon the mind do you not perceive the storm rising b        when the wild winds whistle over the main and are you not in the midst of it when b     0 east west together roar and south and north roll mountains to the shore then are we hurried over the deep and see all the rocks and dangers of it  b      0 dire sylla there a scene of horror forms and here charybdis fills the sea with storms when the tide rushes from her rumbling caves the rough rock roars tumultuous boil the waves they toss they foam  the next moment if the poet pleases like the demon he speaks of he can make all as gentle and serene as it was before rough and boistrous  b     0  sunk are at once the winds the air above and waves below at once forget to move some demon calmed the air and smoothed the deep hushed the loud winds and charmed the waves to sleep did you ever see a more perfect calm yet smooth and hushed as these lines are you may easily perceive a difference between the description of a still sea and the easy beautiful current of a river  b        smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride and in soft mazes rolls a silver tide how happy is the hand of the poet and what a command has he of nature to make the numbers of his verse speak his sentiments thus to paint even sounds and to draw by measures what does not come under the power of the pencil in this writer sir john denhams wish is effected his lines always flow as his subjec though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull strong without rage without overflowing full   i thank you says antiphaus bowing i thank you my dear philypsus for this unexpected view of one of the greatest beauties in poetry i could willingly ay to hear you farther on this head and am perfectly angry with the night or wearing away so fast i hope we all soon find an opportunity of resuing the subject answered philypsus i eed not tell you how agreeable it is to e even to be convinced of my errors  antiphaus and i am satisfied that  take a delight in any occasion of miring mr pope i beg you would  me antiphaus do you not approve  him in some points more than you e formerly i do not know how it ays antiphaus but i seem to be both re pleased and more displeased with  than i was before this enquiry  excellencies from the light in which  have set them strike me more agreeably than ever but then this looking so closely into his defects has made those too the more gross and visible however concluded philypsus you will still acknowledge with me that his faults are the faults of a man bu his beauties are the beauties of an angel  you dont seem to like the word it may sound perhaps too high but i mean only of a great

impatience for the remaining part of e odyssey as it happened they were oth in town before it appeared in pubck and philypsus who was the warmer  the two used to enquire almost every y at lintots how the press went on e grew still the more eager as the me drew nearer and the first moment  could procure it in sheets he set down  them with all the pleasure and all the verity that antiphaus had preached up to m in their former enquiries  in the time that was taken up by this agreeable search he called often upon that friend with whom he shared his studies as well as his affections this was rather a dividing than leaving his pursuits for he scarce ever saw antiphaus without mentioning something of the odyssey and hearing his sentiments in return when he had gone entirely thorough the poem he went immediately to desire a meeting in some place where they might talk more at large upon that head by good luck antiphaus was perfectly disengaged it is a fine evening says he and if you please we will take a turn together in the gardens of horatio since we cannot enjoy his company at least let us make use of that liberty he has left with us there we shall be retired from the noise and bustle of the town and safe from every sort of interruption philypsus was extremely pleased to find him so ready they stepped together into his coach which drove immediately to horatios and set them down at the gates which lead into the greatwalk of the garden  after a turn or two there they sat down by the side of a fountain full in ight of the thames which passes at the bottom of the walk the walk itself makes a fine visto in its descent to the river at a distance you see the fields and hills at first in an easy ascent varied into pasture and arable and then rising unequally and covered here and there with woods till they are insensibly lost in a bluish cast of the clouds the agreeableness of the place made philypsus forget himself for a few moments he was taken up wholly in wandering with his eye sometimes over those beautiful gardens and sometimes over the irregular prospect that lay before them at last recollecting himself and turning to aniaus there is a difference says he in the agreeable sense i eel at present from the delightful views on all sides of us which may partly confirm what we were talking of just before we sat down does not this masterpiece of art with all its symmetry and justness of proportions strike the mind in a feeler manner than that landskape of nature in its infinite irregularity these measured rises and falls in slopes answering each other those groves terminating every way in an exactness of igure these walks intercrossing without confusion and uniting o happily cannot fail of pleasing the eye very much yet that wildness and variety abroad the river lawn fields and woods so beautifully interspersed compose a scene much finer and more engaging for my part i should be apt to prefer that single grot yonder and the hanging precipice over it to a whole scenary of natural objects laid out in the most regular order imaginable there is something of this in the pleasure which is given us by the greatest writers a noble natural genius however irregular and unconfined delights us in a much higher degree than the most uniform and correct and the writer who enjoys this freedom of soul amidst all his starts and errors is greatly to be preferred to the justness of one who is too severe to commit a fault and too cool and phlegmatic to be a pet  such a temper replied antiphaus can never produce any thing truly great the noblest poet in the world has not the fewest faults and the same spirit which qualified homer to be so is what at the same time might hurry him away from a nicer observation of some little particulars the very negligencies of homer show the greatness of his spirit and where there may be any like negligencies in the version of homer methinks it would be but justice to attribute them to the same cause at least where the spirit of that poet is so discernible as it is in this late translation  i cannot but smile sometimes when i hear a severer reader very gravely condemning a poem for a few faults which may be evident in it here and there nothing can be plainer than that our judgments ought to be formed upon the whole and not upon particulars the superiority of beauties or dfects is the only thing that can determine the character of the piece it is possible that mr hobbes may have expressed a word or two correctly where the new translation has deviated into a metaphorical or licentious expression but what a strange method of comparison would it be to settle our opinion of the writers from hence by such a way of proceeding we might prefer one who loses the life and vigor of poetry throughout to others who preserve it so strongly in the general turn of their compositions  as we go on philypsus with our usual freedom of speaking our sentiments on each particular passage i dare say that even all those which may seem faulty to us will make but a small figure when compared to the several excellencies of this piece as for my part after a research of some care through the whole translation i find no reason at all to alter my opinion that the beauties of it are far more numerous and far more considerable than its blemishes even taking all those things for real blemishes which we may only imagine to be such  if the fashionable choice of verse be justly blameable it may as justly be said that no one moves with more freedom in his fetters in particular lines there may be some farther disagreeable likenesses of sound but the variety of numbers in general is great and handsome what smoothness and harmony do we find through the course of the poem and how seldom are they interrupted either by the littleness or the vastness of the words by the openness of the vowels the clashing of consonants or any other roughnesses whatever not to mention against these that significance of sound which is more frequent and more happily practiced by mr pope in particular than by any other of the modern poets  as to the diction not only the poem but our language itself is enriched by it where it is once mean it is in many instances great noble and solemn where a simplicity beyond our taste is to be preserved we may expect some flatnesses and it may be to these perhaps we owe that justness and purity which in so many places makes us imagine that we are conversing with persons of those first ages of the world in all their plainness and honesty of behavior at other times the narration is raised and the images strengthened by a figurative way of speaking though no doubt in some cases to excess but these excesses may well be passed over when we consider that they proceed from liberties which are highly useful in rendering the style the more various and poetical so far as frequently to improve upon homer himself  above all is that flame and spirit diffused through the whole poem and oftentimes so well kept up as to make us forget that we are reading a translation when we are engaged in the piece do not the great and generous sentiments we meet with perpetually make a few thoughts which have something cold or little in them appear inconsiderable upon the first comparison what eclaircisements have we and how little obscurity what a number of natural thoughts images and descriptions might be produced to overbalance such lines in it as may seem to be affected or too artificial  thus which ever way we turn ourselves whether we consider the poetical spirit the language or the versification in each of them the beauties far exceed the defects it is with this notion we ought to proceed in our enquiries we must carry this thought all along with us let us remember philypsus that all human excellence stands merely on comparison that no one is without faults and that very few arrive in any tolerable degree toward perfection that mr pope does not only appear among the few but that his superiority is every way visible if we compare his compositions in general with those of our other poets the disproportion is as great as when we compare the blemishes of his own poetry with the beauties which every where abound in it  some of these we are now to consider and we may enter on this view with the greater pleasure as we have the advantage of mr popes own observations in several points both as to those things in which he met with the greatest difficulty and the methods he has taken of raising his language and improving the versification  one of the greatest sources of raising as well as enlarging the poetical language is by inventing new words or importing old ones from a foreign soil words when they are used vulgarly grow mean like other fashions when their use is once got among the populace they soon begin to be rejected by the politer part of the world this it is as art de bien parler part   chap   sect   the gentlemen of port royal very justly observe which necessitates the introducing of new words into every language it occasions a continual decay and demands continual supplies thus whoever has a felicity this way is a benefactor to the public he adds so much to the bank and gives his assistance in supporting the present credit of language among us  it would be equally trifling and laborious to give all the particular instances of this versions enriching our language it is every where visible there is no reading a book in the odyssey without observing it frequently you will almost constantly find his new words to be apt easy and poetical sometimes he introduces the expressions and even the peculiarities of other languages into our own these when unforced please us very particularly by the variety and novelty they bring along with them we admire the stranger in our habit and are extremely taken to see him look as free and easy as if he were a native and had been always truly english  the poet has the same art and delicacy in connecting two words into one a thing much more difficult than inventing the union is proper and insensible there is no knot where they are ingrafted in short they thus mellifuous attemperd evershady illperswading serpentmazes and several others in this translation may be said rather to grow into one another than to be brought together by art i do not say that this hits so naturally in all the instances there may be thus perhaps seagirt endlong lovedttied womanstate etc in the same some words less tractable or less harmonious than others but in general we may affirm that as his translation is wrought off from a language which in this respect greatly exceeds all that ever were so the imitations of it this way are unusually beautiful and harmonious  to deviate from the strict rules which grammarians would impose on words either single or as they stand in their relations to one another gives an agreeable uncommon air to language but in the very notion of it carries something of difficulty and niceness along with it mr pope seems to have thought it the safest way in such cases to follow or resemble those deviations which have been already authorized by some masterly hand and where he strikes more boldly into any new freedom he is generally careful of giving things such an openness that they may neither perplex the sense nor embarrass the period  a thing more useful and agreeable than either of these is to turn the stream of words out of their common channel  there is a good deal of stiffness which yet attends our language from the stated order of words in such a repeated succession and though we are much freer than our neighbors the french in this particular i should be glad to see our poets at least go yet farther toward the liberties of the old greeks and romans mr pope has some strokes toward this he is sometimes bold in varying the expected range of words to give his sentences a new and agreeable air he transposes their order often by his own judgment and often in imitation of some of our best poets who have succeeded in it before  i would not have a certain grammarian or two overhear me commending these liberties so freely it would certainly cost one a dispute you know the men they are as strict in the punctilios of words as some formal people are in the little points of behavior i warrant you your neighbor the doctor would stand as strictly upon the nominative cases going before the verb as wicquefort would for the precedence of an ambassador it is certain he can settle all the rules of place from undeniable authorities disposes of the upperhand with perfect economy and upon the whole would make an excellent master of the ceremonies among words and syllables  however with this gentlemans leave there are several just liberties which may be allowed for varying the poetical plurimae sint locutiones apud poetas usitassimae and in primis elegantes quae scriptis procis usurpatae etiam grammaticae leges violant  trapps prael poet page    etc to page    style and many aids proper to enliven and elevate it in the more noble parts of a poem  among the latter mr pope has made very good use of antiquated words and no less of expressions borrowed from our translation of the sacred writings the language of scripture as it is received from the first with a certain religious awe will still retain something venerable and august it may therefore be of signal service in giving to the heroic muse that majesty which so well becomes the sublime air she ought to assume it is much the same in the revival of old words antiquity always carries a sort of solemnity with it in its very roughnesses and decays the rustic strikes the mind as strongly as any thing in architecture and ruins themselves have often something awful and majestic in them  i would not willingly interrupt you says philypsus but the humor of heaping superannuated words in some late poems is too provoking to be passed by how have our miltonick writers in particular prostituted them on all occasions in what an undistinguishing manner do they labor to draw into their works any word which their great master has adopted into his paradise lost  erst nathless behests welkin and a thousand other expressions of equal beauty and agreeableness of sound are repeated ten times in every sheet of theirs in short these gentlemen have made me quite sick of peoples going two hundred years backward for their language and furnishing out half their poems from the vocabularies annexed to spencer and chaucer  as for some of those writers replied antiphaus calmly you have reason to be angry with them but if we may reject any thing merely for the abuse of it there is nothing of the greatest use that we may not fairly reject virgil made particular use of this method in his poems and was cum sint verba propria sicta translata propiis dignitatem dat antiquitas eo ornamento viglu uice st usus quintil instit lib   cap    lib   cp   admired by his countrymen on that account what is your opinion of our milton are you displeased with the antiquated words in his writings no philypsus i know your taste too well to imagine any thing of that nature and even of those that have followed his example there is one or two who make good use of them this we see in philipss pieces not to mention the new winter by mr thompson poem we were reading the other day the author of which beside several other beauties is by no means unhappy in his management of this sort of words i agree with you the abuse of them is frequent and much to be condemned if perpetual they run into a mere barbarism and indeed wherever they are thrust in without any other reason except their being ancient they give a roughness and disorder instead of the proper solemnity but when they are placed here and there with judgment they support the greatness of our ideas and reflect a venerableness on the subject were the old oaks that are left standing in the gardens of blenheim more numerous that design might have too much of the forest in it but as they re they serve to communicate the nobler ir of antiquity to the things about them and appear in a majesty of years equal o the grandeur of the place  i would desire you to commend the inrtion of solemn words only as they are proper to the places in which they are used we see by mr popes observations on this head that he understands the benefit of them perfectly well as his works show that he practices up to his own rules and scarce ever inserts either the words of former centuries or the language of scripture but where the subject demands a solemn and venerable turn  as these are the chief methods of ennobling the poetic style so the chief to enliven it is the free and various use of epithets no one thing is of greater service to the poets for distinguishing eir language from prose this has occasioned that eo epitheto poetae and frequentius and liberius uuntur namque illis satis est conveni verbo cui apponitur and ita dentes albi and humi vina in his non reprehenduntur quintil insti lib   cap   large and unrestrained use of them so much beyond what we nd in oratory and though homer is more bold and frequent in this than any of the poets who have wrote since i know not any of the ancient critics who have ever blamed him on that account it is partly from his uncommon liberties this way that mr pope looks upon his epithets as one of the pref to il p    distinguishing marks of that poet in homer they have on several accounts a peculiar air and this translation not only preserves their proper beauties but shows many methods of improving upon them sometimes the old are set in a stronger light and sometimes new ones added with a peculiar grace sometimes several are applied to the same thing without huge horrid vast od          that strictness of connection which would  them phal  flatten the energy of them and where the poverty of our language will not convey their full sense in the conciseness of the original they are enlarged upon in the translation and laid more open to our view  epithets philypsus like pictures in miniature are often entire descriptions in one word this may be either from their own significance or by their immediate connection with some known object we see the thing when the poet only mentions the nodding crest of an hero and form a larger idea of jove from the single epithet of cloudcompelling than we might find in a description more diffuse it was chiefly from see mr popes note on il       two poetical epithets that phidias designed the countenance of his olympian jupiter as in reverse we often see the person in his epithet from our being acquainted with some statue or picture to which it refers thus when apollo is called the archergod it recalls to our memory the representations we have so often seen of that deity the complete figure is raised up in the mind by touching upon that single circumstance  it is by the same means that one single epithet gives us the idea of any object which has been common and familiar to us meadows fields woods rivers and the sea itself are often imagd by one wellchosen word thus in that see       beautiful description of calypsos bower you see the groves of living green the alders ever quivering the nodding cypress and its high branches waving with the storm it is by epithets that the ancient poets paint their elysian grves and the modern their windsorforests  where our language will not admit of this conciseness we find the image preserved by a description more full and diffusive thus  the morning sun increasing bright od          over heavens pure azure spreads the growing light   i should think that the opening of the sense in a larger compass may often be approved even where we are not driven to it by the poverty of our language homer himself who has the advantage of single words so much stronger and more significant often chooses to draw out his sentiments into several lines and sometimes n which is beautifully expressed by horace in three words nimim lubricus aspici is enlarged by homer himself on a fit occasion into three lines compare il l    with n   0 the very same sentiment which upon other occasions he has expressed in one word only may not the same liberty be allowed to his translators is it not a fine enlargement for instance where homer is speaking of penelopes veil with the epithet of pellucid only to say that the transparent veil od      0   0   her beauty seems and only seems to shade   though these imaging and descriptive epithets are the more beautiful those which add strength and emphasis are by no means to be contemned this way they are of great service in all satire and particularly in that abusiveness which homer is not over nice in bestowing upon his gods they appear well in the ridicule of the suitors and are strong and vehement in any arrogant character particularly in all contemners of the gods i shall give you only one instance of the latter from polyphemes answer to ulysses  fools that you are the monster made reply his inward fury blazing at his eye or strangers distant far from our abodes to bid me reverence or regard the gods know that we cyclops are a race above od     0      those airbrd people and their goatnursd jov you must have observed philypsus several other methods of using epithets poetically i need not mention the peculiar fitness and strength which they may acquire from the od        compared with verse     occasions on which they are used or the light they are set in that od            substantives are sometimes used as epithets and sometimes od      0     epithets as substantives sometimes the od  0     metaphor is conveyed this way with a good grace and at others two thwarting ideas are mixed together in a very agreeable manner mr addison is the first i know of that observed upon these and gave them their name and of this kind is the od     0    0 vegetable venom in the fourth odyssey which answers addisons misc vol   p       0 his instance of aurum frondens from virgil  i know not whether i perfectly apprehend you or not interposed philypsus do you not mean that particular sort of metaphor when some strange quality in a thing is turned into an epithet and directly applied to it  either that or else some strange circumstance applied in the same manner in both it is the novelty and the surprise that please us  i take you says philypsus and believe i now see a farther reason why a very natural passage in another poem by mr pope has always been so agreeable to me it is where he speaks of the odd appearance of things from their inversion in a river i think i can repeat it  often in the stream  the musing shepherd spies the headlong mountains and the downward skies the wary landscape of the pendant woods and absent trees that tremble in the floods in the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen windsorforest p    folio and floating forests paint the waves with green these are of the kind i mean says antiphaus they are bold but they are natural indeed with due caution greater contrarieties than these may be joined under some particular circumstance to justify so unexpected an union thus all epithets which contradict the general sense of the thing but agree with the particular occasion thus is grief called pleasing there are kindnesses which are terrible as when the cyclops in the height of his good nature promiss ulysses that he shall be the last he will devour od    and in many cases death and even disgrace may be desirable instances of this kind are very frequent especially among our modern poets there are od                        otherwise              etc many in this translation in particular it is this which gives a new air to that gay verse   0      speech of mercury in the eighth book  though the latins used this agreeable clash of ideas the greek poets as mr addison msc vol   p       0 observes on the former head wanted art for it they at least the more ancient of them never join things that seem to disagree in so close an union unless where nature her self has led the way in an thus in the twilight when we have really a sort of visible darkness homer uses an epithet of the same contrariety a ie darkness tinged every way with light      actual mixture of contrarieties in any point except that single one these must be entirely improvements on the original  the misfortune is that in all human excellencies there will be an alloy faults spring out of our improvements themselves and the very methods of beautifying lead often into blemishes the way to any perfection is full of difficulties and windings on each side and every step out of the right path though they cross each other every moment is a wandering from our design in a word philypsus it is much the same with errors and improvements as it is with pleasure and pain in the philosophers fable they are blended together in such a manner that it is impossible to come at the one without touching upon the other  all the methods which are used in mr popes translation and which are so often of great efficacy toward beautifying and improving the diction may sometimes fall under a different character  among the words which are introduced from other languages into our own there may be dexter circumfusile variegated od        some which still retain too much of the air of foreigners as antiquated words may seneschal viands bevrage irefull       look too grotesque or have a rough disagreeable sound the very solemnity of scriptural expressions may sometimes require that they should not be jupiter is styled god simply od     0       neptune a god above the gods od        alienated at least it may make them look to thee a son is given  od     0  and  food in the desert land behold is given od  0  0       too high for the passages in which they are inserted  next to the importing of words new to the poetical style is the varying the use of the old to deviate from the strictness of grammar is what gave a rise to rhetoric and surely there are few who would not prefer all the beautiful forms and figures of the latter at least for poetry and oratory to that bare correctness which alone is the province of the former yet there may be innovations on this too harsh or daring and figures that may look more like patchwork than true ornaments in the dress of poetry  the greater danger is when the poet assumes flown with insolence od       ilial or a daughter      any common word in a new unusual sense the worst fault of any language is ambiguity that great cause of darkness in verse and the continuer of every dispute that has been kept up for any time in prose the various appearances of words philypsus should not be multiplied unnecessarily the reader is apt to be distracted between so many lights and in such a variety may follow the false as well as the true  i have observed this particularly in words derived from other languages these you know often prevail among s very differently from their native signification the latin sense perhaps is ne thing and the english use another when this has obtained universally we ught not to run back to the latin partial od           00 objected      implcite       ense of the word in our use of it if ou should the learned themselves may ot readily fall into your meaning and he unlearned will inevitably mistake it  it may be inquired too how far this translation may make a wrong use of terms borrowed from any of the arts and sciences as where we read of architraves colonnades and the like i would not produce these as undoubted faults in the poetical style though the banishing all technical words be laid down by some critics as a rule never to be transgressed i should imagine they might be admitted in some cases even where there is not that absolute necessity either of using them or losing the sense of the original  will not the very thing on which the rule is founded allow the departing from it sometimes that the poet writes to all mankind in general and that h should avoid all appearance of labor a well as affectation is very true and very good reasons they are for his not using technical words while they carry difficulty and an air of affectation about them but if such words ever happen to be perfectly familiarized by the writing of former poets or become of common use in the world i should think the have the same right to be admitted into poetry and if not mean the same propriety as any other words the most obvious and intelligible any one may distinguish their greater or less fitness o this account in the description of alnouss palace in which there are sever instances both of terms familiariz and of such as are less allowable under one and the same view  the front appeared with radiant splendors gay bright as the lamp of night or orb of day the walls were massy brass the cornice

appropriated to particular persons or things many that are used much in the professions especially in the scholastic way of distinctions and all in general that are perplexed or not to be understood without difficulty  i am afraid i have tired you philypsus with such a string of dry observations they must have their turn in a view of this nature and to omit what is necessary for fear of an imputation of pedantry is perhaps the worst pedantry one can be guilty of  give me leave to enlarge more upon the abuse of epithets as i did before upon the use of them it is the same with these philypsus as with all other ornaments of speech their being so very serviceable may lead to a large use of them than is proper but there is this advantage too the very thing which makes them so strong and beautiful will help to discover any error in their application they are each connected so immediately to their subject that their impropriety as well as agreement is very easily discerned  on  aristot rhetor lib   p   this account we should be the more cautious how we mix the epithets of the proper with any metaphorical expressions these for the time change their nature and may signify things very different from what they stood for before that metaphor which puts the name of a place or country for its inhabitants is reckoned a great and agreeable one but wherever it is used we must remember it stands now for men and is not to be considered in its proper tate as a part of the earth if its old epihets are still applied to it the sense must e disagreeing and confused  i fear we meet with something of this here penelope complains of the numbers and importunity of her suitors after his manner  zacynthus green with evershady groves and ithaca presumptuous boast their loves truding on my choice a second lord  they press the hymenaean rite  b od             longinus cap    ed oxon      somewhere in his treatise on the sublime gives us an instance of this sort of metaphor from herodotus where that historian is speaking of a very moving tragedy at the acting of which the theater burst into tears this the critic judges to be so taking from the surprise that turn of expression carries with it the metaphor itself has certainly something great in it but had herodotus joined some of its proper epithets or description with this mataphor and said that the theater raised all o columns of the corinthian order burst into tears at the deepness of the tragedy longinus might have thought the passage more surprising but i dare say he would not have thought it so worthy of hi commendation  to mix these things in a description is really as absurd as to paint a rivergod not with his urn to signify wha he is but gushing all over into streams like some of the odd figures in ovid metamorphosis and by the way it man be a very good spectator n    rule that is given  try mixed metaphors at any time b forming in ones mind a picture from what is said and considering how the parts of it would agree were they delineated upon canvass  there is another disagreement in epithets when two expressions proper in themselves are yet joined together improperly after a great slaughter we may very well have a notion of heaps or as it is in the poetical language mountains of the slain it is natural on the same occasion to imagine to ourselves their wounds and the blood ebbing out of them these are very proper separately but to join them under the notion of a od             bleeding mountain does not look so reconcilable to the mind  an error yet more frequent is when we give a word that epithet which is proper to it on some occasions indifferently at all times and without any occasion  this in some measure has been always allowable in verse however such a liberty is not without its bounds nor should it be used intemperately purple for instance is an epithet very frequent in the ancient poets for the habit of princes yet it is not to be given to that of all great men nor of princes equally whether  arist rhet l   c   young or old nor of the very same prince under several circumstances though a remark of this kind may seem insignificant an impropriety in this case might be very gross and shocking  again what is proper in one language may not be so in another was any one to translate the purpureis oloribus of horace purple swans would not he be so literal as to miss the sense of his author entirely  there may be another impropriety from the difference of time and circumstances it may do very well to give the epithet of browzing to a goat or grazing to the ox it helps to describe them in the fields or to distinguish them from some other creatures and if neither of these at least it gives the language a poetical air yet these epithets have some restraints they belong to life and action they do not suit with those very creatures when dead and less so when they are cut out in the shambles or served up at a feast this is the case in a passage relating to penelopes suitors they   a luxurious race indulge their cheer devour the grazing ox and browzing goat od             and turn the generous vintage down their throat as epithets should be proper to the things or person they are spoken of so must we take care that they are still proper to the metaphors we add and in allegory not to confound the epithets of the real with those of the fictitious person  in the preface to the iliad page       mo we have an excellent distinction to this purpose on a known  epithet of apollo which as we are there told is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter you see the justness of the observation it may serve to explain my meaning better than i could express it my self  it is evident by the way that mr pope formed this observation upon his experience in the progress of that translation this appears from the first part of that work in which we sometimes find the properties and effects of the sun blended with the personal act of apollo thus it is in the first appearance of that deity in the poem i shall read the passage to you though something long it begins with that beautiful line  silent chryses he wandered by the sounding shore till safe at distance to his god he prays that god who dats around the world his rays o smintheus sprung from fair latonas line thou guardian power of cill the divine thou source of light whom tndos adores and whose bright presence gilds thy chrysas shore god of the silver bow thy shafts employ il    0     avenge thy servant and the greeks destroy the original here does not once attribute any thing to the deity but wha is personal it is certain the sun and i effects are hid under this allegory but then they must be hid for so far a it appears it will cease to be allegor homer never mixes shadows and reality and as mr pope perceived this in his goin on with the poem i presume he bui upon it that excellent observation  any mixture of this nature is more evident in epithets for that obvious reason i mentioned before and thus you see there are inconveniences attend each method of improving the poetical diction and that the danger bears some proportion to the excellence where the finest colorings are most visible the aulty strokes of the pencil are the sooner perceived and when we meet with the greatest improvements in a piece we must ot imagine it to be wholly without deect of all doctrines i shall never hold that which supposes any man to be inallible and of all men the poet of a rue free glowing spirit must naturally e incapable of that character no hilypsus the most correct writer is he that has the fewest faults and he is the blest poet that has most distinct excelencies  you need not repeat says philypsus that you have thoroughly convinced me f long since yes it is the whoever thinks a faultless piece to see hinks what never was nor is nor ever shall be popes essay on criticism condion of every human performance not to e absolutely perfect i can allow of seeg faults in any the most favorite piece and find a fresh and greater pleasure every day in reading an author without that biass which used to make me admire every thing i read yet i must own my infirmity to you i still find it very difficult to arrive to that indifference you would persuade in any tolerable degree  a perfect indifference answered antiphaus is no more attainable than a perfect excellence by a creature made up of so many passions as is man we must poise ourselves with all the steadiness we re masters of and when those disturbers will be interfering the best way is to turn their own artillery upon them and to play one passion against another if the superior merit of a writer or his engaging way is apt to captivate us so far as to raise any partial regards in us we must stop and consider what we owe to truth the most beautiful and commanding thing in the world on the contrary wherever we begin to feel a malicious pleasure in finding out the faults of great men we must break off that humor as soon as perceived by turning immediately to some of the finest passages in their works and indulging that delight and admiration they raise in us  i do thus replied philypsus and yet it is but too frequently that i find my self more engaged than i ought to be after all my endeavors how happy should i be could i have that command of my temper which antiphaus shows upon all occasions  if you have observed any thing in me of that nature says antiphaus interrupting him it is chiefly owing to the observance of this rule when we are thinking of any particular passage to forget the character of the author and when we are speaking of the character of the author to forget the turn of any particular passage our notion of a poem is not to be influenced y a few lines taken here and there from it the only thing by which it can e justly determined is the balance of the account after reckoning up all its beaues and all its defects against one another i mean not only as to their num but according to the real value or oy that is in them but what am i oing philypsus to talk at this rate hile i might be enjoying your obsertions  the things i have heard you eak of at different times make me ng to see them in one collected view e are here safe from the impertinence  business or visits and may enjoy r selves at large without being interpted by either  i am sensible answered philypsus after a short pause that what you particularly mean is the improvements in mr popes translation from the many figures and variations added in that work but as i am not prepared for a regular account of them you will give me leave to mention them just as they come into my thoughts my happiness is that i spea to so generous a friend i know antiphaus too well to make apologies for the weakness of my observations o the loose manner in which i may lay my thoughts before him  from aristotles lib de poet cap   to be clear and not to be mea is the great excellence of languag a style that is made up wholly of proper words will be the clearest of

rule be just as it has ever be allowed to be quite down from the gre father of criticism at athens to tho who flourish now in the academy  paris all additional figures in the translation which neither darken nor perplex the sense are so many new beauties and improvements upon the original  for my part i should not stick at carrying this point farther i should imagine that figures are the language of the passions the body it self is agitated and our features discomposed when the mind is struck violently with any object and if we speak upon such occasions it is with rapidity and disorder we ourst out into exclamations our sentients are quick and violent and our language interrupted frequently with uddain starts and as sudden pauses things appear then more strong and argely to the mind and we paint them  more expressive colors with a greater nergy of words it is this way of eaking that gave rise to what the cricks afterward called figures these re the beautiful disorders of language ey are in our words what sudden agitions are in our minds and though we ay think them chiefly the effect of art ey are really the most natural things  poetry  when we are struck suddenly with y or sorrow hopes or fears we eak out in a short quick manner of expression  ulysses in the habit of a stranger finds the good old laertes ever sorrowing for his absence and buying himself in his garden to divert the melancholy of his thoughts the hero does not discover himself immediately only just mentions to him that he had seen ulysses in his travels that is the point laertes fixes upon this island you are landed upon says he is ithaca  but tell me stranger be the truth confessed what years have circled since thou saw that guest that hapless guest alas for ever gone wretch that e was and that i am my son if ever man to misery was born od             twas his to suffer and it is mine to mourn ulsses in his answer informs him where he had met with his son and that when the parted he latterd himself with hoes of seeing him again but now he found he must despair of that happiness this was too much for laertes to bear  we see him overcome with sorrow it is now ulyssess turn to be agitated and t speak his passions in the same impetuou manner  he ran he seized him with a strict embrace with thousand kisses wandered over his face i i am he oh father rise behold  od          0 thy son  i can scarce leave the pleasure i take in repeating these passages only to tell you that they are extremely improved by mr pope no one will imagine how much that has not compared them with the original  you see these passions break out in short violent flashes sometimes they are so strong as to permit no more than one word or two when euryclea by accident discovers ulysses she can only cry out od             my son  my king  and where any go farther they rather hint at things than mention them their thoughts are ull of starts and hurry they speak with vehemence and often end abruptly thus ulysses when he discovers himself o telemachus  i am thy father o my son my son that father for whose sake thy days have run od     0       od             one scene of woe etc  and in another place from a different passion  o cursed event and oh unlooked for aid anthius or the women have betrayed   oh my dear son  these passionate breaks are one of the finest things in poetry they are as natural in anger as they are in sorrow or suprizes and indeed in the former are proper sooner and upon less motives far than in these i know not how it is they have a particular aptness in all threats and either intimate very strongly or are very well filled up with some menacing action this choice is left you to resist or die od           and die i trust ye shall    or as in the nineteenth book vagrant be gone before this blazing brand od           shall urge  and waved it hissing in her hand   you have puzzled me says antiphaus now for my life cannot i tell which to approve of most the expressing or the itimating the action in such cases the requires the greatest strength in the poe and the other has greater force in h performance oh give me leave to mention one thing  have you not observ a larger sort of break which is us artificially in a poem to incite the atention of the reader i mean wh the narration is dropped in the most engaging parts of it or just before some very material incident this adds a double desire of hearing the audience generally make it their request that the speaker would go on and inform them of the sequel thus it is in the eleventh odyssey ulysses in the midst of his account of the infernal regions od     0         verse     and v     alcinous desires him to proceed makes a feint of concluding we are immediately told that the phaeacians were eager to hear him on and it is observable that the very  donec calchante ministro  tum vero ardemusscitari  aen   00 and  0  same break and the very same sentiment after it is imitated by virgil it is indeed improved in the latter he has all the use of homers suspense without the tediousness of it  i have often taken notice of this artiice says philypsus it is very usual in the close of the particular books not only of this poem but equally of the iliad and aeneid  were it not a thing pretty obvious in itself i should be apt to imagine that it was from this practice of homer and virgil that those prudent authors who write for sale had learnt what is so common among them thus in our books of adventures and romance we seldom meet with a first part which does not break off in such a point of the story as may be most apt to engage the expectation of the reader and to draw him in for that most tedious thing in the world vulgarly called a second part  there is yet another sort of breaks antiphaus which proceed not from the artifice of the writer but the passion he feels upon some great or unexpected calamity there might be instances of this given from the poem before us but we must go to another piece of mr popes for the finest that ever i met with in my life it is in his charming ode on music where he is speaking of that great master of it orpheus  staza the  th see wild as the winds over the mountains he lies hark haemus refounds with the bacchinals cries  ah see he dies those passions which break off our language in this manner and confine it to short catches and starts when they are wrought up to the highest pitch or crowd in many of them together upon the mind are best expressed by silence such silences as these pardon me a paradox as old as  the disciples of pythagoras  philoratus de vita apol lib   cap   pythagoras his times are the voice of nature it is true in the common method of speaking there are only a few particular organs concerned but in stronger emotions in the violence of any passion the whole body may be talkative every look and turn and motion is significant and each nerve can have its share in making up what our shakespeare calls a kind of excellent dumb discourse  to be more plain our passions are often too strong to be expressed immediately by words they often choke up the passage for them and yet at the same time they are most apparent the more any one is a stranger to art and disguises the more is he moved on these occasions these silences are the pure effects of nature and the descriptions of them are some of the most natural as well as most beautiful passages in the whole poem  the recovery of ulsses is the incident of the greatest concern to all his friends and must be attended with the strongest flow of passion in them accordingly they are each too much moved with the discovery to utter their sentiments on that occasion telemachus is the first to whom ulysses makes himself known he falls on his fathers neck and they continue embracing each other without speaking od           0 for a considerable time  we have a like scene od      0      when he discovers himself to two or three select friends good old laertes on the same occasion is not only silent but scarce od     0       able to support himself under such an excess of passion and the fond tender penelope is quite overcome with it od          0  she sickens trembles falls and faints away   a great surprise or extraordinary fright has the same effect as in homers od  0          eurylochus and the sir trevisan of spencer which the od  0          notes mention as a parallel to eurylochus never was any image set in a fuller light than this of spencers it is presented to our view with all the strength that poetry is capable of i must beg leave to read it to you  he answered naught at all but adding new fear to his first amazement staring wide with stony eyes and heartless hollow hue astonished stood as one that had espied infernal furies with their chains untied him yet again and yet again bespake the gentle knight who naught to him replied but trembling every joint did only quake admirable imagery and admirable silence cried antiphaus but i hope you will not be so possessed with the excellence of our poet as to forget od             the ajax of homer whom ulysses bespeaks again and yet again without any answer at all or perhaps this has been observed upon so often that you think it needless to repeat its beauties i dont question but you admire it very much i do so answered philypsus and agree entirely with the observation note ibid and longi th that ajax has more the air of grandeur when he says nothing than when the poet makes him speak  mr pope does not only follow homer very finely wherever he has led the way n these beautiful figures he sometimes heightens and sometimes adds them with a great deal of propriety every one sees how unwilling calypso is to part with ulysses but the command of jove must be obeyed and the same fondness which makes her look on the departure of that hero with extreme regret engages her at the same time to assist him in the conveniences for it she is always directing him when employed and when not secretly dissuading him from his voyage we see her busy even to officiousness in bringing him the instruments for his work guiding him to the forest and showing what trees are fittest for his purpose  od    0       on the lone islands utmost verge there stood of poplars pines and firs a lofty wood whose leafless summits to the skies aspire scorched by the sun or seared by heavenly fre already dried  these pointing out to view the nymph just showed him and with tears withdrew this is much better expressed than in the original indeed there we scarce discern that it is a passionate silence improvements of this kind antiphaus are the more to be valued because there is not any one thing in poetry of greater beauty and energy the critics look upon it as the most  longinus  and cicero rarum est eloquenter loqui iu eloquenter acere ep ad atticum l    sublime unusual part of eloquence and it is none of its least advantages that it hits that excellent rule they give us of see them phal  leaving some things for the audience to perceive of themselves though it be not told him every man very easily finds out the heightning of such a circumstance and is sure to value it the more because he finds it out himself in short these are masterly srokes and few hands arrive to them in their true excellence though it requires the greatest art and judgment to introduce it the writer when he has chose the proper point seems to be put to no pains to rule our affections he governs all our passions without the labor of words and looks as archimedes would o ones fancy moving the whole world while he sits still himself  suspense and doubt have something of this figure intermixed with them a speaker hesitating and unresolved is in  state of halfsilence as we see the former poetical silence is observed in hmer every time ulysses discovers himself to any of his nearer friends so is there a mixture of this doubtfulness also in each of those interviews thus telemachus on that occasion  thou art not  no thou can not be my sire heaven such illusion only can impose od             by the false joy to aggravate my woes the unravelling of the doubt is what strikes us most both in laertes and penelope in the latter case this is deferred for too long a time however as they are they afford us some of the most pathetick passages in the whole poem in what an affecting manner does laertes appear to us just at the point of his being convinced that the stranger he is conversing with is his son  smit with the signs which all his doubts explain his heart within him melts his knees sustain their feeble weight no more his arms alone support him round the loved ulysses thrown he faints he sinks with mighty joys oppressed ulysses clasps him to his eager breast soon as returning life regains its seat and his breath lengthens and his pulses beat yes i believe he cries almighty jove  heaven rules us yet and gods there are above od             it is so  as to penelope where a modern would have been overjoyed and caught immediately at an occasion for so many raptures the greek poet chooses rather to show her prudence than her passion i believe every body will agree that this still interval is not illchosen the fault of it is its being carried through too many lines the queen no doubt struggled hard all the while she had difficulty enough in restraining herself and the moment she is convinced she is all tenderness and passion  while yet he speaks her powers of life decay she sickens trembles falls and faints away at length recovering to his arms she flew and strained him close as to his breast she grew the tears poured down amain and oh she cries let not against thy spouse thine anger rise o versed in every turn of human art forgive the weakness of a womans heart  o let me let me not thine anger move that i forbore  thus  thus  to speak my love thus in fond kisses while the transport warms pour out my soul and die within thy arms  od      0    0 i yield i yield my own ulysses lives this unravelling of a doubt is generally followed by what is the most contrary to it of any thing in the world precipitation to doubt of any happy circumstance is to fear that it should not prove true when we are agitated by the expectation of some bliss we long to indulge that flow of spirits which it occasions only some particular caution forces us to restrain them in the midst of their career the moment our doubt is cleared and the obstacle removed they rush on with the greater violence and impetuosity then are our words quick and vehement we speak short and fast a thousand things we want to say and are so eager we dont know which of them to say first i know nothing in music that strikes me equally to those suddin pauses when the consort stops at nce and after the still interval breaks out unexpectedly into a full tumult of harmony this pause and the impetuousness that succeeds upon it  the case to carry on a scene which w have touched upon twice or thrice already when telemachus recognizes his father telemachus wants to know ever thing at once and ulysses wants to te him every thing as fast all all ulysses instant made reply od             i tell thee all my son    such an hurry of spirits the more violent it is makes us speak in the more broken and interrupted manner you always see that a crowd is the longest in getting out of a place where they are in the greatest haste and press most when the passions are less disturbed they go in train and follow one another easily but if they move all of them for a passage at the same time they hinder one another this sort of precipitation s very well expressed in penelope upon eceiving telemachus after his voyage  few words she spoke though much se had to say d scarce those few for tears could force their way ight of my eyes he comes  unhopdfor joy s heaven from pylos brought my lovely boy snatchd from all our cares tell have thou known o           thy fathers fate and tell me all thy own you cannot imagine antiphaus the ll heightning of this passage without omparing it with the original it is e same case in most that i have menond they are some of the justest imovements in the poem as well as innces of the best sort of figures such  show the passions of the mind in a ong and lively manner there are other which the poet makes use of sometimes to raise and diversify his language sometimes to give stronger colors to the things he describes and sometimes to engage or possess his readers i need not enter into a long enquiry concerning the more known figures of either kind but shall touch upon one or two which as yet have not been introduced by the critics into their systems  poetical prophecy is when we acquain the reader beforehand of some events which will happen in the progress of the poem prevention is when we speak o such things yet to come as if they we already present prevention gives an u common greatness and energy to the language it places distant actions fu before our eyes and carries a certa boldness and assurance with it that very becoming the other is of gre strength in possessing and captivating t reader we love to look on into futrity thus it flatters the powers a capacity of our own minds at the sa time that it gives an air of super knowledge and authority to the poe  from the invocation of the muse the entrance to his poem the poet h a right of prophesying and it mig be rtly from this that the name prophet and poet has in some languages been used in common but though he may and does prophecy in person things of this nature are usually introduced from others as from superior beings from priests and augurs from as tiresias in the   th odyssy or anchises in the  th aeneid persons in the other state or just at the sea il p ver     and     aen  0     point of departing from this this latter method perhaps may carry the greater sanction with it but the other is the more poetical  some of the strongest speeches in homer and virgil are delivered after this manner by men of the prophetic character it is to this figure if you will give me leave to call it so that the sixth book of the aeneid and the fourth of the odyssey owe the greatest share of their beauty even the frightful raptures of theoclymenus and the harpye of virgil engage the reader with a sort of pleasing terror there is something horribly delightful in these lines  floating in gore portentous to survey in each discolored vase the viands lay then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow and sudden sighs precede approaching woe in vision rapt the thoclymenus hypersian seer uprose and thus divined the vengeance near o race to death devote with stygian shade each destined peer impending fates invade with tears your wan distorted cheeks are drowned with sanguine drops the walls are rubied round thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts to people orcus and the burning coasts nor gives the sun his golden ob to roll od  0   0      but universal night usups the pole i beg pardon says antiphaus but the speech of theoclymenus is a particular favorite of mine and now you repeat it in english i seem to want something of that strong pleasure it used to afford me where the greek speaks   of the su being perished out of heaven and of darkness rushing over the earth i cannot express the fullness of the words  but you know the original and i fear will never see a translation equal it this whole prophetical vision of the fall of the suitors is the true sublime and in particular gives us an higher orientalism than we meet with in any other part of homers writings you will pardon me a new word where we have no old one to my purpose you know what i mean that eastern way of expressing rvolutions in government by a confusion or extinction of light in the heavens it is this manner of thinking which works up that speech the nearest of any to those noble passages in holy scripture joel      i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood  amos     i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day  ezekiel      all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land  i have often wondered philypsus at some particular persons who are ever ravished with any thing of the sublime in common authors and yet seem to have no taste for the finest touches of this kind those which are so frequent in our sacred writings with what greatness and sublimity do they abound such as might persuade that wear not only blessed with instructions but favored too with a language from heaven those sacred pages want only to be read with  common regard that all men might acknowledge them to contain the greatest masterpieces of eloquence yes philypsus it is there that eloquence sit beside the throne of truth in all he noblest attire and with a look tha strikes us at once with reverence and delight i long to expatiate on so gloriou a subject but perhaps we may find  time of joining together in some view o this nature there has been a very goo blackwalls sacred classicks example set the world this last summer and if ever we should follow i and enter thoroughly into this sort  criticism i dare say it will make an other kind look poor and insipid when compared with it  but at present  are in another sphere and i have alrea interrupted you too much   philypsus desirous as he was to laun immediately into those noble depths  eloquence complied for the present a returned to the point in hand my l instance from the odyssey prevents wh i had designed for the next you  it speaks all along of future things  if they were actually present theomenus has the whole fact passing successily before his eyes the destruction  the suitors is pictured in his mind  sees their blood sprinkled upon the wa their bodies floating in gore and their ouls sinking to the regions of the dead  now i am upon this head of prophecy and prevention i should be very defective ere i to omit the other branch of it which takes in all cases where the poet orewarns us of events in his own proper erson this is to be found in the very ame point the fate of the suitors but  is not delivered with the same air of nthusiasm the poet is informed by the ue of things to come while the proet is possessed by vision the knowdge of one is from instruction of the her from a sort of frantic possession  mind the poet therefore anticites events with less emotions of lanage and seldom rises into any fervor love what we meet with in these passas   incensed they spoke hile each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke and as they were  for death even now invades his destined prey and wraps them all in shades and before   in his soul fond joys arise  his proud hopes already win the prize speed the fying shaft through every ring etch is not thine the arrows of the king shall end those hopes and fate is on the wing  od           b od     0      you observe antiphaus that this event which is so often anticipated by the poet is the great point on which the completion of his fable turns and i believe you may have observed that virgil puts on the prophetic air see aen  0  0  exactly in the same case virgil oftentimes improves upon his master the circumstance that introduces that passage in the aeneid and the greater distance of time give it a much finer and a nobler air than we find in homer himself  these figures for so i beg leave to call all unusual manners of speech are of more difficult observation as they lie out of the common road i am afraid of wandering too far and shall therefore return very readily to the more beaten path  all passions warm the imagination and make its images more strong and sensible it is this in my opinion tha might render metaphors very proper in the pathetique though you and i perhaps should not agree entirely on tha head  at least this is certain that the strengthen and enliven the narrative part of poetry beyond any other metho whatever when the poet treats of the most common things he does not treat of them in the common manner  fame speaks the trojans bold they boast the skill to give the feathered arrow wings to kill to dart the spear and guide the rushing car with dreadful inroad through the walks of war od     0       strip these lines of the metaphor and they lose their greatest force and beauty to say barely as it is in the greek that the trojans are good warriors that they lanch the spear and handle the arro well that they manage their horses detrously and in general that they are ey strong and successful in battle this eclares the whole of the thing but with submission it is more like a prose han a poetical narration at least when compared with the same sentiments in those lines i have just repeated  there are many innovations of this nd which make the english homer apear with advantage a naked relation f fact is enough for history but poey requires something more than bare truth it has a thousand ways of raig and beautifying its subject phoebu  the luminary over which he presides does not only show but sets a luster too on every thing he touches the poet is not so much to declare events as to give its colors and life to every action in doing this nothing is so requisite as strong animated figures as of all figures the metaphor affords the most sensible strokes and comes nearest to the pencil  even in common cases they are not without their beauty thus in that enterview between ulysses and laertes  beneath a neighboring tree the chief divine gazed over his sire retracing every line the ruins of himself now worn away od             with age yet still majestic in decay thus agamemnon after all his dangers murdered by the hands of villains in his own kingdom is not said barely to die but to end od           the sad evening of a stormy life   when this figure expresses some strang particularity or includes any magnifying comparison one single word is ver powerful in raising the narration an enlarging our ideas up to the occasion  with dreadful shouts ulysses poured along od             swift as an eagle as an eagle strong  now by the sword and now the javelin fall od             the rebel race and death had swallowed all etc i know no case in which metaphors of a bold sound are more proper than in arrogant speeches when men defy the gods or quarrel with the dispensations of providence philaetius in the odssey is no arrogant character yet in one place upon considering the afflictions of his prince whose piety and virtue he was so well assured of he falls into a rant against providence in which the language is as lively and vigorous a the sentiment is illgrounded and absurd  o jove for ever deaf to human cries the tyrant not the father of the skies unpiteous of the race thy will began the fool of fate thy manufacture man with penury contempt repulse and care od  0       0  the gauling load of life is doomed to bear these metaphors which are of that ind we may call the audacious come ery near the spirit of oldham and dryden ho undoubtedly in their satirical orks flash out into the greatest boldesses this way of any of our writers deed in both there are some which may come too near to profaneness but we must always take care not to attribute to the poet what he speaks under some other person a devil is no longer a devil unless he be haughty impenitent and blaspheming and dryden is no more to be condemned than milton for making such impious spirits speak according to their true character  what yu assert i take to be perfectly true says antiphaus but were i blessed with any genius for poetry i own that a shocking impiety should be one of the last things i would choose to describe and where it is chsen there is room to be mderate without ijuring the character with to great a show f godness we see that milton is not so gross as dryden nor virgil seldom descends to particulars h cuses rather to say in gnal atque ds aq atra vocat crudl a mr vn his  i ore reserved than homr deisrs he rather idicules than affnts as a me divum pter aq hominum rx viderit  afterward he grow  little wamer and more meaphoical  dxtra mihi deus and lum quod missile libro nunc adsint   where he speaks plainest of all virgil touch upon his miserable fae in the very next line  nc mortm horremus nec divum parcimus  dsine jam venio moriturus  aen    virgil so blunt as homer  well says philypsus there are other points which you might choose and which serve as well for this sort of metaphor thus all pious fra uds infamous priests or any prevailing superstition here the figure retains much of the audacious air without any thing of impiety in it agamemnon indeed goes too far in the iliad where he seems to neglect apollo as well as his priest  hence with thy laurel crown and golden rod nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god il          mine is thy daughter priest  here is something of irreverence to the god and an evident injustice to man and the poet very prudently condemns he speech before he delivers it in his oem but there is no such mark st n one of hectors nor does it at all inringe that heros character which is emarkably pious all through the poem e is speaking against a very popular uperstition the trade of augury  ye vagrants of the sky your wings extend  where the suns arise or where descend o right to left unheeded take your way hile i the dictates of high heaven obey without a sign his sword the brave man draws il             and asks no omen but his countrys cause this has the audacious air because it speaks contemptuously of a practice which was vulgarly looked upon as religious and sacred and is just because it shows at the same time the greatest reverence to the gods he obeys the dictates of heaven but he contemns the artifices of the priest  whatever restraints this kind of metaphor may deserve there is another sort which has always been received with the greatest liberty the animating metaphor though the praecipue ex his oritur mira sublimitas qu udci proxima periculo translationis attollitu  tllunur quum rebus sensu carentibus actu quendam and animos damus quintil lib   cap   aristotle and phalaeus say exactly the same se the laer  most sublime and the most daring of any except what was last mentioned is very common and that even in the chastest poets and in the foftest pieces it is this by which we give action and spirit to things that are still and insensible this will raise the meanest points in the world it may treat mere names as if they were things and things still and inanimate as i they had thought and action wha might seem the most surprising is tha this method of raising things above their nature has nothing of ridiculous in it we easily perceive this to be true but i own for my part i should have been at a loss for the reason of it had not i met with a od vol   page     fine observation in mr popes appendix to this work i wonder now why i could not before perceive that ridicule is confined to moral agents and obtains only where choice and freedom is directly concerned that this is the case is the more plain because even among moral agents the very same thing which if brought on by our own folly is a certain subject for ridicule when it proceeds from some inevitable misfortune or necessity is the farthest from being ridiculous  i am pleased to see that this figure stands on such good reason for it is the very life and soul of description and might it not be of a larger use antiphaus than has commonly been observed it is chiefly mentioned indeed of enlivening things inanimate whereas possibly it may hold through the whole chain of beings in the world as they rise gradually bove one another thus when we attribute any thing of absolute perfection to the highest orders of created beings any thing which we think angelical to man or any thing like humanity or virtue to beasts it might as well be included in this branch of metaphor as when we give the powers of motion to things still or passions to things inanimate  nay it may even return from the lower to the higher when the species of a lower rank upon the whole has any as when we amplify the swiftness of a hero by comparing it to the flight of an eagle  or particular excellence which the higher wants or partakes of any the swiftness of an eagle by comparing i to the swiftness of the winds excellence which is common to them both in a greater and more excellent degree  but it must be observed that where this figure in its higher notion is applied to intelligents it must not be done with the same indifference or rather it requires the strictest caution  the poet is at liberty to attribute action and passions to any part whatever of the mute creation he may make the woods or any such insensible sympathize with his grief with the same freedom as any inferior animals we find it thus used particularly in all the pastorol writers whether ancient or modern every beast may have the compassion of man but few men can sustain the properties of an angel nothing would make a common mortal so mean and ridiculous as such an elevation the same holds in the higher intelligents the first of the angelick order looks monsrously ridiculous as well as monstrously impious when he would imagine an equality where there was an immutable disproportion  however in some cases the property of an angel may be given to a man the heathen poets compare their greater hers to their gods and when the christian poet extols any superior geius any character that has something n it above the common race of mortals e may well draw some expressions from he order of beings next above the huan had not mr addison thought is justifable we should have lost one f the finest amplifications imaginable  see addisons works vol   page      0 so when an angel by divine command ih isg empest shke a guilty land uch s of late over pal bitannia past m and serene he drives the furious blast d pleased the almightys oders to perform ides in the whirlwind and directs the storm but whither am i wandering my antiphaus you will think such flights as these too airy surely i am got into the wilds of criticism  i dont know what the world might think of you at present says antiphaus but if ever mr drydens scheme should take place and the poetical characters of angels be generally established what you may think the wildest of your flights now might then be of good service this way in poetry  be that as it will says philypsus i believe i had better draw in my thoughts a little for the present and keep to things that are more obvious and secure all agree that the giving thought to things insensible and human passions to the brute part of the creation is equally just and beautiful and at the same time nothing is of greater efficacy in rendering our sentiments raised and poetical that the sufferings of our fellow creatures affec our souls by a natural sympathy is a very good moral sentence but the poet is to elevate this effect of misery he invest her with a sort of new being and the gives her address and action in poetry our tears od  0          speak our misfortunes ar od            eloquent and misery appears od    0       as aen       in person to plead for the distressed  when more uncommon things are transferred this way the metaphor may be safer if it has some grounds in the fact though it will bear very often without it it is allowable to represent the sea as flying back and astonished at the terrible c voice of the cyclops but it is more close to attribute this fear and flight to it when its waves are od            aen       drove asunder by the same cyclops flinging a rock into the midst of it  another thing which made this fiure the stronger among the ancients as their notion of genii or presiding eities in particular there was scarce  river or brook amongst them but what ad its genius and in speaking of these he poets carry this metaphor farther an in any other case whatever what  appearance does xanthus and simois ake in the battle of rivers which kes up the    st iliad what a bold raught is that of the nile in the seaht at actium by e virgil and how uch more sublime than either is our ranslation of the sacred writings where it makes the deep habakkuk    0 utter his voice and lift up his hands on high  you may perceive i am run into another figure but it is of a kind so nearly allied to the animating metaphor that one often finds some difficulty in distinguishing the one from the other indeed when any of these personages are introduced distinctly in full state then it is something beyond metaphor but in short sketches it may pass very well under that figure there is nothing but a stronger name adapted to the thing than its strictly proper acceptance affords i think for instance that we need not seek for a new figure in this passage awed by the prince so haughty brave and young od  0          rage gnawed the lip amazement chained the tongue   or for this in every sorrowing soul i poured delight od     0       and poverty stood smiling in my sight   in the close of this poem the narration is elevated by a successive chain of these metaphors or fictions call them which you will when the ithacenians are ranged in arms against their prince it is not said that they shall die but that od      0    0 death attends them in the field  to express ulyssess aptness to forgive them od             oblivion is ready to stretch her wings over their offenses as when they are shockt with their crime and fling down their arms there is this voice from heaven to effect it forbear ye nations your mad hands forbear od             from mutual slaughter peace descends to spare   these antiphaus are the most remarkable things i have taken notice of as to the figures i could have produced a greater number of excellent lines from this translation had not i ndeavourd chiefly to give such instances s contained at the same time some peculiar improvements in them you would be surprised to see how many beauties hey have that are wanting in the oriinal  surely they who are the most rigid or closetranslating will allow such beautiful variations as these which without losing the sentiments of the oriinal only set a finer turn upon them let them call them if they please glorious offenses or beautiful wanderings from the letter these are such offenses as one would wish to see more frequent than they are and of which the best translators are the most guilty  for my part i am particularly pleased when i see a translator reflect new light upon his original wherever this is done justly it does not alter the objects it only makes them more bright and visible  i believe antiphaus you will not disapprove of some other methods used in the english odyssey for this purpose which i am just going to lay before you sometimes the language is raised and strengthened sometimes the order transposed to advantage in several cases w have homers thoughts inspirited b collateral thoughts from other authors some little things are omitted and some short strokes added to correct the sentiment or to heighten the colors in the original  before you enter upon those point says antiphaus give me leave to mentio some few things which look like blmishes under the subject you have ju concluded  it is allowed that metaphors are the most useful of figures to raise the poetical style to give their color to our descriptions and a just swelling and relief to our images it is allowed that a translator may add these colors where the original is less lively and expressive than the subject may very well bear the faults then must lie either in the excess or impropriety of such additions some things will not bear a strong light and others require to be flung into shades  where there is no occasion for figures they are at best only so many unnecessary ornaments i cannot see why a quiver full of arrows should be called od             a store of flying fates why a fire should be termed od            a burning bed or a libation od             the sable wave of offered wine  it is not the disproportion of the meaphor to the thing which might render hese expressions blameable if any thing tis the want of occasion when the oet is to aggrandize small subjects we an bear with much bolder metaphors an these though it may not be proper to call a stream of wine by the title of a sable wave on common occasions yet when the work requires heightening we may go so much farther as to call a as does virgil georg      small river by the name of the ocean  if we judge by the occasion there can be but few liberties for metaphor in common conversation i mean the common conversation of poetry not that they are to be banished thence entirely rather it will require them frequently but it requires only such as are single and not far removed from the subject when a person is speaking to penelope in commendation of ithaca he might be allowed to say that its soil is rich that it abunds in corn and that its trees ar laden with fruit homers expression scarce carry this so far and yet i should think them preferable to these in the translation od          see v     ib    in wavy gold thy summer vales are dressed thy autumns bend with copious fruits oppressed   where the original says that eurmus was among the suitors of penelope do not it seem better as well as plain than this translation  to climb with haughty fires od          the royal bed eurynomus aspires   a metaphor may be continued too far as well as carried too high a long chain of them leads us away from the proper sense and flings that into allegory which we intend for reality strongly expressed this is very common especially in our pindarick writers indeed few of our poets but what have see od               0 verse    to verse  0     to     see spectator numb   fallen into it some time or other but in those you find the most gross and insufferable instances of it that can be imagined  in these strings of metaphor nothing in my opinion is so faulty as that point which has been so often touched upon the shifting of circumstances in the same description and representing a thing confusedly sometimes in its figurative and sometimes in its proper appearance while an actor is upon the stage his wn private character must be wholly said aside he must be entirely booth or ntirely cato nay even in the scenary self things must be of a piece and r addison has the justest occasion for s frequent severities upon this c contradictory mixtures prevailing so monstrously in our theater how would the wits of king charless time have laughed to see nicolini sailing in an open boat upon a sea of past board what a field of raillery would they have been let into had they been entertained with painted dragons spitting wildfire enchanted chariots drawn by flandersmares and real cascades in artificial landskips the making things after this manner partly real and partly imaginary is to join inconsistencies shadows ought never to be mixed with realities in the same piece whether in poetic scenary or that o the stage  a poet is never more apt to fall into this confusion than when he is speakin of allegorical persons as particularly the deities of the heathens when  speak of them personally we are apt  mix something of their mystic characte this is certainly vicious in writing a it is more so to confuse the properties  those things over which any of the deities were supposed to preside wi the personal acts of any particu deity  the poets are allowed the privile of elevating every subject they take i ther management if they please t may represent the sun as guided by an intelligence and it is but one step farther with them to give that guiding intelligence a name they call him phoebus and obviously enough feign to themselves that he drives round the world in a chariot of fire by degrees the allegory is formed regularly and enlarged with more particulars he has so many horses assigned to his chariot his own appearance is well known beardless and young a glory round his head and a quiver full of arrows over his shoulder thetis is ready to receive him at the end of his journey and when he is to set out again aurora rises from the ocean to open the gates of heaven that are kept for him by the hours  how very regular can fiction be upon occasion the establishment of this allegory under these particulars has prevented a world of confusion this we may see by any allegory which is not yet settled on some uniform plan to show how far i shall beg leave to enlarge a little on one of the same nature that of aurora the goddess of the morning  phoebus is never represented on this occasion but in his chariot i was speaking of as for aurora i know not whether she rides sits or walks sometimes she is in heaven and sometimes upon earth in short the poets seem to leave it undetermined how when or for what time she makes her appearance i have laid together several passages relating to this but they leave the point as confused as it was before now did the rosyfingerd morn arise od           and shed her sacred light along the skies   there she is plainly in heaven   when over the eastern lawn in saffion robes the daughter of the dawn od            advanced her rosy steps  and here as plainly upon earth  with her orient wheels od      0      aurora flamed above the eastern hills   here i cannot absolutely determine whether she be in heaven or upon earth but it is plain she is got into her chariot now as she was pleased to walk the time before  but when it is evident that she is not upon earth it is still difficult to know whether she is near it or in the higher heavens whether she  ascends the court of jove il    0     lifts up her light and opens day above   or only il       heaves her orient head above the waves   there is the same difference in the degrees of that brightness which is attributed to her appearance sometimes she only il      blushes with newborn day and sometimes she is encompassed with il          the full splendour of it when i read one description i take it for granted that the glory round her head should be of a od            glimmering light but when we come to another it is of a strong od             flame you are at the same loss to know whether her robes are od            rosecolourd od            saffron or od     00      purple in fine it would puzzle the critics to answer directly whether she has a quiver on her shoulders and whether she is to appear in a compare od     00 with      martial or in a gentle peaceable posture  this unsettledness in the present case runs through almost all the poets since homer the most correct that ever wrote are not entirely free from it virgil himsef oftentimes aen       etc continues her course so far that his thus donatus ruaeus etc commentators to salve the matter say we must understand phoebus by aurora in him the very horses that draw her chariot are aen      and       rosecolourd as in theocritus they are   idyl    white sometimes she has the aen    0 horses of phoebus sometimes aen       four of her own sometimes aen      two and sometimes she is forced to ride only and that upon k  l cophron the wings of pegasus  it may be left to the poets themselves to determine whether this management be just toward persons of their own making i shall only say that the greatest critics have ever thought that consistency is required in the most unbounded fictions and if i mistake not greatly homer is more regular in this very fiction before us a person better versed in his writings than i have the happiness to be might i believe form from them a settled a scheme in relation to this goddes as has been drawn up for any other of his deities this is certain that he has precisely fixed the time of her appearance it is that the twilight is reckoned into the night       and the first direct appearance of ays attributed to the sun ibid     interval which commences after the first dawn of light and ends just before the actual rising of the sun she always ascends il to   from the sea to the eastern extremity or as it is in the language of poetry the sea mr popes note on il       gates of heaven there she sits in her od ps    golden chariot which has two horses assigned to it distinct see note on od      0 from those of phoebus and there she waits to  il b    etc prepare the way for the chariot of that deity  the dress and the epithets which homer gives to this imaginary being are as they ought to be in all such allegories at the same time evidently this eustathius shows  large in his first note on the second book of the dyssey particularly as to the epithet  drawn from the nature of the thing and fairly applicable o the fictitious person  so much for allegory it is a dangerus topic and we are apt to be lost in the clouds of it either the natural description or the allegory by it self may have a thousand beauties but when they are dashed together every thing is dark and confused they put me in mind philypsus of the two liquors sir isaac newton speaks of which from a fine azure and a beautiful red if you mix them produce no color at all the transparence and glow which each had separately is immediately lost and their beauties vanish away into one thick impenetrable shade  before these confused allegories and mixed metaphors i should have mentioned some other instances in which single metaphors are faulty either as they are improper or affected  is it proper to speak of penelopes wi and beauty or her beauty alone under the notion of o             drooping verdure is i proper to talk of od           raining kisses or of od      and          storing a vessel with prosperou gales  is not the metaphor and the turn  expression somewhat affected or over wrought in this passage of the nineteenth odyssey  these swarthy arms among the covert stores are seemlier hid my thoughtless youth they blame od           imbrownd with vapor of the smouldring flame and a little farther in the same  my woes awaked will violate your ear and to this gay censorious train appear od              o           a winyvapour melting in a tear again upon telemachuss return  all crowded round the family appears with wild entrancement and exstatick tears swift from above descends the royal fair her beauteous cheeks the blush of vnus wear c chastend with coy dianas pensive air in the following lines she hangs over him  in his embraces dies c rains kisses on his neck his face his eyes   you have here says antiphaus what as appeared to me as blemishes in this oem under these several heads i have ndeavourd philypsus to read it with everity and when my regards for the uthor or the influence which such riters will always have over ones soul began at any time to sway my mind i have called up all the ill nature i am master of to my assistance i am fully sensible how difficult it is to keep the balance steady sometimes our admiration may warm us too much and sometimes a little malice will prevail if any thing i have been saying seems discolored with this temper of mind point out my faults to me dear philypsus correct me like a friend and show that openness i have deserved at your hands  when i have time to consider the notes i see you have taken down answered philypsus and to compare some passages with the original you shall know more of my mind as yet i see no reason for your request but think you have dealt with that fairness which i so much admire in my antiphaus  in the mean time i have a word or two to add on those other excellencies of this translation which i mentioned to you before  that method of improving the original by tranferring beauties from on fine writer to another is carried on through this remaining part of the poem in the same frequency as it was used i the former volumes  these foreign infusions of thought and language to use the name which mr addison has given them are very discernible to any one of a tolerable taste it is true they must have something of a new air but they still  a distinct resemblance of the old something like that of the sister neids in ovid  facies non omnibus una c diersa tmn qualm dct ss srorum   in pointing out these resemblances to some people i should be apprehensive that they might think me taken up in an imaginary chase but any one of much less dscernment than antiphaus will perceive immediately that this likenss is real and designed by the poet himself there is an csaubon eminent critic who has wrote a whole treatise on this single point in praise of a persius particular favorite of his in the present case mr pope tells preface to his works fol and pref to the storals p  0 us that he read the ancients with this design that he serves himself of them as much as he can and that they have been his chief inspirers in poetry i believe the gentlemen who are concerned with him in this translation would give me leave to say the same of them it is too evident to be denied it appears both in their see note on odyssey            0  observations and in their excellent works  in these last volumes how finely are from ss book        ibid   0 b        b       etc vrgil b      0 b        b         ibid     b        b        etc  homer b        b         milton b        b  0  0 b        etc  dryden b        b     0  iid      some thoughts wove into this translation from the sacred pages from the iliad and aeneid from dryden and milton among ourselves and from several others both ancient and modern  the translator is sometimes as artsul in adding of himself some short strokes to what homer has said we meet with several of these little insertions which are very just and improving i shall mention but one as mr addison spctator numb     proposes a correction of paradise lost by cutting off the two last lines mr pope improves this poem by adding a line in the conclusion of it this insertion possibly is better chose than that alteration so modestly proposed by mr addison the reader indeed would willingly go off with some hopes and satisfaction after the melancholy scene in miltons last book but it may be said that considering the moral and chief design of that poem terror is the last passion to be left upon the mind of the reader on the contrary the odyssey ought on all accounts to terminate happily and mr popes addition in the close of it is therefore an improvement because it forwards the moral it gives us a so pallas spoke the mandate from above the king obeyed the virginseed of jove in mentors form confirmed the full accord and willing nations knew their lawful lord homer himself does not end in so full and complat a manner his last line does not rest well and chapman seems resolved to show the infirmness of it as much as he could possibly in his translation which breaks off in these lines   twixt both parts the seed of jove athenian pallas of all future love a league composed and for her form took choice of mentors likeness both in limb and voice  fuller view and confirmation of the happiness of ulysses and leaves it upon a firmer foundation  in the beginning of the evening antiphaus you were speaking of the poets transposing words to advantage i believe this may sometimes be of greater use in altering the order of sentences o the succession of some incidents in the poem though i own this must be attempted but rarely and with the greatest caution difficult as it is you will find a good instance of the former in one of the suitors ridiculing speeches and of the latter in eurycleas transports  euryclea you know discovers ulss by a scar upon his leg while she is bathing him the moment she makes this discovery she drops the jarr of water and is ready to faint away with surprise and joy though these in the nature of the case must follow immediately upon one another homer has inserted a long story how the scar wa occasioned just after the discovery a before those passions which are the imediate effect of it thus is a suddai event declared ourscore lines before  is described  a succession of time tak up in the narration contrary to t time of the fact  an impetuous pa kept in suspense in a word two thin inseparable in their nature are  in the description i know  whether i see this in a wrong light b t present it puts me in mind of  fliging his basin down travell to heaven seeing the lord knows what there and returning again before the water is run out  if i mistake not this impropriety is avoided very artfully euryclea is not made to discover this scar before that long digression od        and          and     it is rather said in the prophetic manner of the poets that she would soon discover it than that she has actually discovered it it is after the digression that it is mentioned directly as fact so that in the translation this fact is not disjointed from those emotions which it immediately raises in euryclea we are not told fourscore lines after the jarr is flung down that the water is running out of it  if this be really the case says antiphaus i think the alteration is much to be commended but why may not homer himself be understood to speak in the prophetic manner too for i suppose that single point would salve all you do not blame the digression itself  no says philypsus it is not the digression which i blame but the point in which it is introduced just between a fact and what in nature must be immediately consequent upon that fact if as you ask homer speaks at first only in the prophetic manner then it is all cleared up but i fear his expressions confine it directly to a thing then done and cannot be taken in the prophetical way  philypsus was so engaged to this moment that he had not once observed how the day wore away he was surpised to find the night was just coming on why did you suffer me says he to antiphaus to keep you here so long i did not imagine the night had been so near us you know i am an eternal talker  however i see the coach is at the door and we may reach our lodgings i believe before it is quite dark  an essay etc evening the fifth before they parted the last evening the two friends agreed that their next meeting should be in the same place and as this was to be the last which they intended to set apart for this enquiry they set out for horatios earlier than usual when they alighted philypsus ordered his servant before them to the dome of apollo with a book or two he had brought in the coach whilst he and antiphaus walked on gently to enjoy the freshness of the air and the beautes of the place the sun which now began to be in its decline as it shot through the trees made a thousand wavering mixtures of light and shade the birds on all sides were answering one another in their little natural airs every thing looked fresh about em and every thing was agreeable  delighted with so many calm undisturbed pleasures they wandered on from one walk to another and chatted as they went of a thousand indifferent things among the rest philypsus fell into an account of the company he had to dine with him you know morfori says he  perfectly well answered atiphaus  he was there too and made it his business as usual to contradict every thing that was offered against any of our celebrated poets  i am very glad says antiphaus that i was not of the company his way of arguing is t general to be answered and too positive  be brn with  yes says philypsus it was his old way if one person blamed some particular littleness in milton he would immediately ask him how he could blaspheme such a sublime poet and when another mentioned a gross line from addisons works how absurd is that say he to charge such a thing on the chaste and most correct compositions in the world  right and i suppose t very next thing he must ask was how yo could dislike such glorious men as addison and milton  you have him exactly it was in vain to tell him that you disliked only this line or that thought he would have hs way and i doubt not but in his opinion we are all a set of heretics or at least freethinkers in poetry what an egregious fault is it antiphaus with some men only to have ones eyes open  but there are times says antiphaus assuming as he spoke the imperious air and manner of morforio there are times sure when they had better e shut  and therefore i should wink always  not so neither your betters ay direct you what to look upon and what ot  that is a good thought truly tis great pity the legislator has not considered of it i should be in love with n act of parliament about the use of eyes  why where would be the great arm of the matter if you were ordered to ink hard or to turn away from every disaeeable object that offered it self  how ay i behave if the object be agreeable  look as long as you please  and how if there be a mixture of disagreeble in it  you suppose then that here may be something disagreeable in that which is beautiful  really sir that s my notion nay i am apt to think farther that there is nothing so beautiful as to be without defect without some mixture of the disagreeable by your rule then we must lose the sight of a thousand fine objects how can i look on that lady you were admiring so much the other day in the ring without seeing that her hair is of a disagreeable color or must i swear that her eyebrows are black because she has a fi shape  that is overstraining the matter but i think you might pass by such a trifle if it were only in complaisance where there are such exact features  charming a complexion and a make so delicate it is barbarous not to let such a sma affair as the color of an eyebrow esca your observation  depend upon it i would not be so blind as to think the lady was disagreeable on that accou  bt i cannot allow any thing disagrable about her  where are your eye then  i would not believe them  that is one way  or what would  say to the new ivention  what invention i beseech you  only of a ett  glasses which shall make each favouri object appear exactly the same to every e  and exactly beautiful  t too  an hopeful project truly l but morforio be the designer and so things would appear all glaring and beautiful while all the rest i suppose only upon turning the tube might be nothing but deformity  in the midst of this roving sort of talk they were got to the dome before they thought of it well says philypsus as he entered till i meet with the perspectives you were talking of i shall not be ashamed to confess that i find my eyes at present to be of a different turn i cannot help perceiving some little blemishes in our most delightful poets and yet i am far from an insensible to their beauty i view them with delight i admire them passionately nay i believe i have all of morforios love except the blindness of it it is there that you have opened my eyes antiphaus you have taught me to love not only with passion but with reason  rather say replied ntiphaus that your own mind asserted s true prerogative and rose up to guide our passions to none but proper obcts  however that be says philypsus am sensible of an alteration for the betr and can now indulge a passion for y writer with the greater appetite  i am persuaded it gives the mind a fficient pleasure without making so great a fool of it do i not love thi writer added he taking up one of the pieces that lay before him i read hi with the same eagerness and find ne charms in him continually nay  think my love of him more secure tha ever since i can suffer my self to se his faults and by that means am satisfied that they can never be sufficien in the least to cloud his perfections  i am entirely of your opinion say antiphaus and doubt not but in ou finishing this enquiry we shall have the greater security in admiring him  only speak of our selves there may b many other beauties and other fault visible to men of better eyes but w may safely fix our own sentiments o what we have been able to discover ou selves i hope we have endeavour sincerely to hold the balance steady and when we have done what we can we have done what we ought  i wish you would have left that sentence for me says philypsus it would have served admirably to introduce wha i am to enter upon this evening  i is at your service says antiphaus an therefore i beg you would proceed  though i might begin very well with the sententious manner in writing my subject says philypsus is so various that i o not well know what i ought to choose rst the prospect widens rather too uch upon me and indeed takes in ost of the faults and virtues of any oem i own that in general the great and first excellence of a poet is to be tural but it will be allowed me that  chief and distinguishing beauty of  epick poem as such is a true ar of reatness and a style that carries weight d emphasis with it as the vice most pposite to it is trifling vulgarity and anness i wish i may manage these oints as fully as i doubt not antiphaus ill display the natural strokes that are  frequent in the odyssey  sentences carry much efficacy with em in a poem they are usually of the erceptive kind though they seem rather  insinuate than to command as they e general truths and maxims of life ell adapted to some particular occasion  the poem they appear with authoty and contain the most useful instruions without the stiffness and odium  personal advice  it is a mistake to use a maxim of lord shaftsburys to think that no body ws how to take advice the fault is  few know how to give it to do this agreeably and at the same time with weight is the great art of sentences in poetry  poetry in its birth was calculated for the service of religion the design of the epick muse was to paint the successes of virtue or the punishment o vice hence the tragic that follow the very same purposes and afterwar the old comedy whose business lay in encouraging lesser domestic virtues an ridiculing the foibles of mankind stire the offspring of both these patakes of either kind she smiles in hrace looks severe in persius and commanding in juvenal the satirist man se different methods but whether  lashs or ridicules it is still the vici who are to suffer  all the other species of poetry eit all in with these or follow the sa ends such as forget this deserve  the name of poets they prostitute t muse and whatever they produce m be of a bastardkind  among many other excellencies  ought particularly to be observed in hnour of the true genuine poets of aquity that they seem to treat of molity even better than those who profes that study were it not for the wo of their poets we might very well imagine benevolence for instance that which gives its life and spirit to the whole family of virtues was suppressed o the last degree among the heathens n reading their philosophers one is lmost persuaded that they teach reenge and make it their business to liit and restrain that love which men ave naturally to one another in short e that wants to find the true philosohy must go to their poets they break ut into warmer notions and more exlted lessons of humanity among them e face of charity is less veiled and ouded and goodness appears with a ountenance more generous and erect  the odyssey as a moral poem exceeds l the writings of the ancients it is rpetual in forming the manners and tructing the mind it sets off the dus of life more fully as well as more reeably than the academy or lyceum race who was so well acquainted th the tenets of both has given a mers poems the preference to eer  quid sit pulchrum quid turpe qud uile quid non nius ac melius chrysippo and cranoe dicit    ep   surely antiphaus men were more virtuous in the days of homer than they were in the time of plato or cicero at least they were more charitable and tender to strangers how else could the poet speak in such a spirit of goodness whenever he touches upon this duty nothing is inculcated by him more frequently and nothing with greater strength and emphasis  homer in relation to strangers does not stint the charity of his countrymen to the common use of fire and water he seems rather to proportion the bounty to the want it is ours the sons of sorrow to relieve od         0  cheer the sad heart nor let affliction grive   he scarce looks upon this as bounty he rather thinks it a debt owing to every one of the same nature with us it is what the happy to the unhappy owe od            it is what the gods require   what is given to them says he is paid o and will infallibly be rewarded by the divine power by jove the sranger and the poor are sent od        0  and what to those we give to jove is lent   as the neglect of this will be avenged by the same to jove their cause and their revenge belongs od            he wanders with them and he feels their rongs   i doubt not but this notion of the gods wandering on earth in a disguised manner was a very common motive to charity in those times it is mentioned very strongly in the original in this place and od            afterward when ulysses appears as a suppliant among the phoeacians  such high exalted thoughts of this duty have carried the poet so far as see od            to teach that we should not value any labor of our own in assisting others but as that is not delivered in the sententious manner i should go out of my way to repeat it at present  to us who have always enjoyed so clear and steady a light in regard to every branch of this duty these sentences may appear common and obvious but i imagine any one who should compare these passages by the rules of benevolence in the philosophical writings of the ancients would upon such a view allow them to contain thoughts highly noble and extensive  i shall mention but one more which though it run through several lines is but one entire sentence and which by the way if i forget not contains a motive to charity not to be found even in de officiis p  0 in beneficentia delectus esset dignitatis etc ciceros catalogue  who calls from distant nations to his own the poor distinguished by their wants alone round the whole world are sought those men divine who public structures raise or who design those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal or bless with salutary arts to heal these states invite and mighty kings admire wide as the sun displays his vital fire it is not so with want how few that feed od             a wretch unhappy merely for his need i ought not to dissemble one thing that the translation is not to be trusted entirely in this argument we find these passages improved in the handling and those lines in which they resemble our sacred writings may be drawn more strongly however the original it self may give us a great deal of reason to suppose either that homer had borrowed some lights from thence or that he could discern the light of nature more clearly than any other of the heathen writers  before i compared passages i must own to you that i was in particular expectation of improvements from mr pope under this article a virtuous generous soul is certainly as necessary to constitute a great poet as a great orator and in sentiments like these we may discover that temper of mind which i dare say has contributed much toward making that gentleman so good a poet as well as so good a friend  there is one particular more extremely frequent in homer it runs thorough all his works and is scarce once omitted where there is any occasion for it i believe your thoughts outrun me and might prevent my saying that i mean his reflections on the miseries of this life they are mostly very emphatical and lead to a very easy and useful inference   to his native land our charge resignd heaven is his life to come and all the woes behind then must he suffer what the fates ordain for fate has wove the thread of life with pain od            and twins even from the birth are misery and man in another place we have the same thought as strongly expressed though branched out into several other particulars let us suppose ullysses before us a prince great for the ages in which he lived and greatly distressed how much does he speak like one born to wisdom and long instructed by adversity  of all that breaths or groveling treads on earth most vain is man calamious by birth to day with power elae in strength he blooms the haughty creature on that power presumes anon from heaven a sad reverse he feels untaught to bear against heavn the wretch rebels for man is changeful as his bliss or woe too high when prosperous when distressed too low there was a day when with the scornful great i swelled in pomp and arrogance of state proud of the power that to high bith beongs and used that power to justify my wrongs then let not man be proud but firm of mind bear the best humbly and the worst resigned od             be dumb when heaven fflicts  of all sentences there are none which strike the mind more forcibly than those which carry a bold air a certain nobleness of thought with them there is a moral heroism greatly to be preferred to that which generally usurps its name a generosity of soul that looks beyond the vulgar and speaks up to the truth of things it is this generosity which animates those lines in virgil est hic est animus lucis contemptor and istum aen    0  qui vid been credt emi quo tendis hoorem   the same spirit is inusd into this line od             death illexchangd for bondage and for pain   the noblest sentiments are not such as make an eclat but those which are solidly generous and good we have frequent instances of both from two persons in the iliad hector speaks things that are great ajax often what is mavelous and surprising both speak loftily but one is more solid and the other nearer to a rant both show courage and generosity in what they say but they seem to talk as they act ajax fights merely for fighting sake while hector engages always for the good of his country  i shall beg leave to close this head with two sentiments as much celebrated as any in the iliad and spoke by the two heroes we have been talking of the one in the mere spirit of an hero if greece must perish we thy will obey see note on il             but let us perish in the face of day   the other in that of a patriot too without a sign his sword the brave man draws il             and asks no omen but his countrys cause   i am sorry says antiphaus you have quitted this point so soon methinks you might afford a little more room for a thing of such considerable use sentences are fitted by their nature to carry on that chief design of poetry to mix the useful with the agreeable  together with a certain air of authority they serve to establish the poets moral character which according to a origin of our ideas of beauty and virtue late hypothesis may render him at the same time more delightful as well as more instructive  besides this they often flatter the vanity of the reader and as the sea arist rhet lib   cap    first of critics tells us take the more readily with this or that person as they confirm in general what he has before concluded from his own observation on particular occurrences in life  i wonder at one thing says philypsus that so many of the critics should blame sentences and look upon em as particularly unfit for poems of the epick kind see note on od       rapin i think condemns them as they seem to jut out of the structure of the poem and are apt to interrupt the narration too much bossu who is rather on their side yet observes there is a kind of calm wisdom in them that is contrary to the passions even the person whom you just now called the first of critics puts us in mind of your rusticks that are always arist rhet ib   cap    stringing of proverbs together and  very good critic of our own says in o many words that addisons misc vol   p       0 they are generally ome of the heaviest pieces in a whole poem  let them add if they please says aniphaus that they sound aukwardly from he mouth of a young person and prepoerously from an atheist i own the harge the best writers themselves seem o be sensible of it and where they do any thing of this kind are the first to orrect themselves addison port it is not in mortals to command success ut well do more sempronius well deserve it emp curse on the stripling how he apes his  mbitiously sententious  cato act   puts a entence into the mouth of portius but e corrects him for it in the next line ho the son of a cato and when virgil aen  0   0 makes his atheist sententious there is still a mixture of the atheist to be discovered in what he says  but grant that sentences are not proper from persons that are young or vicious grant that they are not proper in a mezentius or a portius what then may they not be proper in cato himself or in aeneas  it is the same case in every particular you have produced from the critics they speak rather against the abuse of this ornament than against the ornament itself there can be no doubt of it sentences are certainly faulty when they appear too grossly and stand off from the rest of the work but what is this to sentences which are fitly applied and wove in artfully with the other parts homer and virgil are very happy in this particular they give them a sufficient fullness but they never glare so as to attract the eye singly to themselves you admire them as much from their relation to the things about them as for their own particular beauty in short they might be beautiful by themselves but they are much more so in the toutensemble of the piece  we may add to this that their sentences are so far from hindering the narration that they are almost constantly a part of it and help to carry it forward but though they are usually wrought into the speeches of the poem we do not receive them from persons improper or hurried by any violent passion and where the subject is still and gentle that alm wisdom that has been objected to them cannot be very prejudicial indeed in any place or on any occasion a long thread of them is insupportable these are worse than the sanchoisms of cerantes because they are not so ridiculous we can laugh at sancho all the time he is multiplying his proverbs upon us but in poetry such dry preachments are of all other the greatest opiates and have the quickest effect on the audience lcans poem and senecas tragedies notwithstanding all their beauties are inances of this to a great degree  there is another way of murdering sentences for which we are wholly oligd to those ingenious gentlemen the ditors it is that art of cutting off entences from the body of a work and rcing them to jut out from it whether ey will or no by printing all such hereever they can catch them in italick characters mr addison if i remember is condemning this practice in that very place where he says that sentences are some of the heaviest pieces in a poem and i imagine nothing could make him speak so severely of them in general but this practice that is so destructive of their beauty  in short sentences that are cold affected or illplaced such as are either too distinct or too much thronged may be blamed with a great deal of justice but such as are handsomely wove into the narration at proper intervals and from none but proper speakers will not only be safe from the censure of the critics but are allowed by them in general to be highly serviceable toward gving its proper weight and emphas to an epick poem  i think you have defended this beaut sufficiently says philypsus and shall g on to the next under this head concise ness there is no greater symptom  weakness in a writer than his being a to say a little in a great deal as nothi is more strong and emphatical than  say a great deal in a little  hence the force and emphasis of the line of mr pope  od          0  oh every sacred name in one my friend and of this od           od             the great the good your father and your king   the want of a scrupulous connection draws things into a lesser compass and adds the greater spirit and emotion c he shrieks he reels he falls    the more rays are thus collected into  point the more vigorous the flame hence there is yet greater emphasis hen the rout of an army is shown in he same contracted manner as that  the   th of the v   0 odyssey which has me resemblance to sallusts description f the same thing agreeable to his usual onciseness in these four words only  sequi fugere occidi capi  there may be a contraction of many ircumstances to a point which turns ore on the sentiment than the diction s when we place the success of a thound important events on one effort or ne moment of time thus antinous e bell jug   0  ed mattaire the chief of the suitors to his companions od             arise or you for ever fall arise   which has such an air of miltons lucifer awake arise or be for ever fallen   those lines says antiphaus serve the purpose for which you repeat them very well but is there not something too much like a turn upon the words in them i was sensible of that answered philypsus but i follow your example antiphaus in viewing a thing only in one light at a time to prevent the infinite confusion that would happen in turning each line every way this is brought as emphatical you allow it to be so if it answer the end for which it is produced that is all that i intend and i beg once for all to be understood under this view in every instance that i have or may use on particular occasions  this masculine nervous conciseness i am speaking of is very usual from generals to their soldiers but among a multitude of instances i am particularly pleased with that speech of henr the great before the battle in the plains of ivry i am your king you are frenchmen and there are the enemy  sometimes we find an emphasis and vigor impressed on every particular word of a sentence od             now grief thou all art mine   and in these lines which we have often admired for their peculiar strength and efficacy they speak of ulyssess extreme love of his native country  to see the smoke from his loved palace rise while the dear isle in distant prospect lies od          with what contntment would he close his eyes this is not only of use in the grand or pathetick there are excellent instances of it from terence haec verba mehercule un falsa lachrumula quam oculs trendo misere vix vi expresserit restinguet  eun act   sc    in the tender and familiar as there are others from virgil in the natural and even in the satirical and that so strongly in the latter that thus dryden from his  non tu in triviis indocte solebas stridenti misrum stipula disperdere carmen ecl      as others from this line qui bavium non odit amet tua carmina maevi ib  0 some have been apt to imagine from them that virgil might if he pleased have made the greatest satirist that ever wrote  sometimes this very emphasis is increased by a certain opposition of the words used in it there is a passage in the iliad which i have particularly admired on this account give me leave to repeat it from the original because the greek tongue is particularly emphatical and has more nerves than perhaps our language is capable of  il ch    the opposition is carried on farther in the next lines between  and     the emphatical manner in writing flies all dress and ornament all superfluous and descriptive epithets all turns and elegancies of thought hence that conciseness which generally attends it the most obvious fault in conciseness is obscurity what is obscure can never be sufficiently emphatical this makes the concise way the most difficult of any it is easy to follow the stream of ones imagination and write on with an unthinking rapidity but to express every thing fully and to say nothing that is needless requires a great judgment and much force in our expressions the great monsieur pascal had a particular happiness of comprizing much in a few words he had a very mathematical turn of thought and of all things hated an idle prolixity you will be pleased with an excuse of his in a certain case where he had been guilty of it it is in the close of one of his letters where he begs his friend to pardon the unusual length of it by saying that he really had not time to make it shorter  some emphatical passages are not only so concise as to contain just as many ideas as words they have often force enough even to intimate several ideas more than they express  thus it is in all intimations of power one of homers greatest excellencies lies in this in setting off the hero of his iliad he does not say in words that he was vastly terrible to the enemy he mentions the effects and leaves the reader to collect what terror must attend him after the death of patroclus the whole army of the trojans is put into confusion only s     at hearing his voice they are all trembling and dispirited il s     they had seen achilles it is not a sudden panick it continues upon them when they poured down in such numbers from the city it was because ib p  0 they did not behold the crest of that hero and now they are all consulting whether they should not quit the field because  s     he had shown himself at a distance and might possibly enter into the next engagement  homer has the same address in intimating the power of his deities when he introduces them as effecting their designs with a il n  0    touch with a ib x   0 voice with a ib of     single thought  it is the same sentiment that gives their air of grandeur to these lines  od             declare thy purpose for thy will is fate let al be peace  he said and gave the nod od             that binds the fates the sanction of the god and this of the same import from our shakespeare  what he bids be done is finished with his bidding    on this turns the greatness of that thought in the sacred history of the creation god said let there be light and there was light though i should imagine this to exceed every instance above because it intimates all that they express and intimates it as fully and strongly as they express it  let the greatness of this sentence stand or fall by the rules of sublimity we need not mention that cap   ed oxn      longinus chose it for an instance of the sublime whether that great critic ever saw it or not is not material but i wonder that some later writers of very great name cannot be persuaded to see any force or energy in it i own i have never read what monsieur le clerc offers against the sublimity of this passage surely it would not be very difficult to answer it if it be of a strain with what see preface to bileaus works monsieur huetius offered before him where he seems to argue that see huetij them ev prop   sect    this passage cannot be sublime because the language is simple  it is this art of leaving more for the reader to collect than you express in words which runs through several of ulyssess speeches both at the court of alcinous and before the suitors whether the hero tells his own story or feigns some other he is equally careful in laying before them something of the high station he once enjoyed and hence his speeches have generally a great air of that celebrated answer of marius to a message sent from the roman general plutarchs life of marius go and tell sextilius that you saw marius itting among the ruins of carthage  intimation is so strong and nervous that the sea quintil instit lib  cap   and lib   cap   ancient critics confined the name of emphasis to this one point though as we use the word the very contrary of this may be of great service in making a discourse emphatical the soul is sometimes possessed by the number of great circumstances thus in that passage of homer which mr pope translates after the following manner  mn steeds and chariots shake the trembling ground the tnult thickens and the skies resound victors and vnquishd join promiscuous cries il    0     triumphant shous and dying groans arise we meet with the same tumultuary figure in the description of the field after the battle il  0          through dust through blood over arms and hills of slain   this passage we are told is imitated by xenophon and i am sure the historian has not weakened it by drawing it into a greater length and expressing the circumstances more fully allow me the satisfaction of reading it to you note on il  0    when the battle was over one might behold through the whole extent of the field the ground died red with blood the bodies of friends and enemies stretched over each other the shields pierced the spears broken and the drawn swords some scattered n the earth some plunged in the bodies of the slain and some yet grasped in the hands of the soldiers  now we have fallen upon an historian give me leave to observe one thing that both with poets and in history minus est totum dicere quam omni there may be some fraud in saying only the bare truth in either it is not sufficient to tell us that such a city for instance was taken and rvagd with a great deal of inhumanity there is a poetical falsity if a strong idea of each particular be not imprinted on the mind and an historical if some things are passed over only with a general mark of infamy or dislike it was in instit lib   cap   quintilian i first met with this observation and i wish our historians of all parties did not give us so many examples of it as we find every where in their works  it is the same in poetry when all the circumstances are laid out in their proper colors and make a complete piece its images strike us with greater energy than when the whole of the thing is only mentioned in general thus the diffused style has its propriety under this head and makes a larger and more continued impression as the force of its contrary excellence a just and emphatical conciseness may be more collected and pierce the deeper i do not mean when we mention a thing but when we show it in a few words there are just miniatures of great objects in poetry as well as in statuary or painting a hercules in little may have all the nerves of a colossus and even that prodigius design of to form moun ahs into a statue of alexander the great so desigd as to hold a city in one hand and to have a river run thorough the other dinarchus might not have been more gigantick than timanthes his picture of that giant in miniature his polyphemus noble images whether in a large or smaller compass rike the mind very strongly either must be according to the occasion things sometimes demand to be drawn at full length and the soul requires to expatiate over them sometimes they choose a more contracted space but though they lose from their size they lose nothing of their spirit it fills us with a oble and enlarged pleasure to consider he heavenly bodies their courses and their immense distances at the same me we are struck with a very partilar admiration when we view their tuation and measures in the orrery  any uncommon extensive image causes  enlargement of our ideas and posses the mind more completely in ch cases it is observable that even e turn of the verse may assist these ages i may seem too particular if i y that large words and lines which nsist chiefly of long syllables may be use to extend our thoughts in conving any gigantick form and yet haps both will be found not unservicee in mr popes description of his cyclops  a giantshepherd here his flock maintains far from the rest he solitary reigns in shelter thick of horrid shade reclined and gloomy mischiefs labor in his mind od       a form enormous  or where we see him b ibid     stretched forth in length over half the cavernd rock   or when he sends a dreadful groan the rocks around ibid     through all their inmost winding caves resound   whether you think this length and heaviness of the syllables necessary in the present case or not i am sure you will allow it to be so in melancholy images  where heavenlypensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns  and a thousand more  homer too in describing a large object makes use of a word which of itself is il      above half a verse and ovid on a like occasion joins several together of an unusual length we behold his aegeon bestriding his whale even in the turn  balaenarumque prementem egeona suis immania terga lacertis met    0 of the words which are to describe him  delay and repetition are sometimes proper for the same reasons there is a delay almost in every syllable where mr pope intimates the vast size of a stone as well as the difficulty in heaving it up  then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand a stone the limit of the neighboring land b there fixed from eldest times black craggy vast virgil adds a repetition in his imitation of this very passage in homer saxum circumspicit ingens saxum antium ingens  and mr pope commends the beauty of this repetition as see note ibid it makes us dwell upon the image and gives s leisure to consider the vastness of it  it may seem strange that the vastness the mere bulk of an object should possess the mind in the manner i have been peaking of but though there is no real exellence in largeness it is certain that e are apt to apprehend it as excellent this puts me in mind of a point that lways strikes me very much in poetry  il      0   0  a sort of comprehension as i should choose to call it for want of some better name it is when any great view is completely contracted into a few lines but to come up perfectly to my notion it should be such a view as is sufficient to fill the whole mind we are in a manner surrounded with it on all sides and which ever way we turn our eyes we cannot look out of i this is the case where ulysses is represented in his shipwreck on the coast of phoeacia above sharp rocks forbid access around od            roar the wild waves beneath is sea profound   if you can fancy yourself in the place of ulysses at that juncture you will apprehend what i mean the more fully you can then see nothing but what is painted out in this couplet  i apprehend you says antiphaus and indeed have observed this beauty often in reading there is a thought if i mistake not repeated twice in the eleventh odyssey of this kind od        and   above below on earth and in the sky   i know not whether the image be total but it cannot want much of it in that description of a shipwreckt person just before the lines you repeated  amidst the rocks he hears a hollow roar of murmuring surges breaking on the shore nor peaceful port was there nor winding bay to shield the vessel from the rolling sea but cliffs and shaggy shores a dreadful sight od       all rough with rocks with foamy billows white if this be not total at least it will engross two of your senses whilst you keep in the same posture but those as you say seem the most complete which take up the eye what ever way you turn  as this resumed philypsus to keep to the same element od        and all above was sky and ocean all around   these total views are much more vigorous and affecting when the objects are not inanimate or at least when some more moving considerations are annexed to them thus in the picture of a rough sea terminating in craggy shores and rocks and a tempestuous sky every object has an additional terror from our seeing ulysses painted in the midst of these dangers and struggling to make so difficult a shore  i remember a passage of this kind in a writer of a very strong imagination which is heightened by the same method we have it in a description of mount atlas though i believe the author took his ideas from the alps it is delivered in this bold poetical kind of prose characteristicks vol  page     see with what trembling steps poor mankind tread the narrow brink of the deep precipices from whence with giddy horror they look down mistrusting even the ground which bears them whilst they hear the hollow sound of torrents underneath and see the ruin of the impending rock with falling trees which hang with their roots upwards and seem to draw more ruin after them   in these cases our passions as well as our senses are engaged and i take such views to be then entirely complete when all our passions as well as all our senses may be engrossed by them were i to give an instance of such a view i should prefer that passage in virgil where he places you in the midst of a city covered with the dismal shades of night taken and fired in a thousand places by the enemy and every where filled with ruin terror and confusion aen        crudelis ubique luctus ubique pavor and plurima mortis imag   i have dwelt the longer on these comprehensive views as they fill and delight the mind very strongly there is another case much of this nature and of particular energy i do not mean when we surround but when we carry the mind out to a vast extent as in this sentiment od        by heaven above by hell beneath   there is a thought of this nature very justly reckoned among the sublime which appears with a perfect uniformity in ingrediturque solo and caput inter nubilacondit ae        lxx per grabe     virgil in homer and in the book of wisdom formerly ascribed to solomon for my part i do not at all wonder at this exact resemblance in them it is such a thought that when it is once set before one it possesses the mind so strongly that it will leave its image behind it and indeed it is obserable that a great critic where he would applaud it in homer t de subl the edit oxon repeats it himself in the very turn of his own criticism longinus is the person i mean who in a thousand instances as well as this essay on criticism  is himself the great sublime he draws   one of the most common topics for this among the poets is in speaking of the distance of tartarus homer makes it as far from hell to earth downwards as it is upwards from earth to heaven it has been note on il      observed that two of the best poets since have enlarged it gradually virgil to twice and milon to thrice that depth but if i mistake not hesiod of old has carried the mind further than either of them it would please you to see how exact he is in his measures  v     an anvil says he will be nine days complete in falling from heaven to our earth and as many in falling from our earth to tartarus  this is the distance from us to the gates of tartarus only he afterward carries the mind much farther in this description  there lie the treasures of the stormy deep of earth and water and extended darkness a dreadful chasm squalid and uninformd and hateful even to gods whoever within the dreadful opening of its gates should plunge prone through the great abyss twelve times the course of the pale moon should feel it storm and tempest in dire descent still hurried on precipiate amidst the various tumult and confusion of disagreeing natures often the powers immortal cast their eyes upon these regions hesiods      and shudder at the sight  this imagination seems to be imitated in milton where satan meets with that violent shock in traveling through chaos but the fall here strikes us more because it has no bounds it is still continuing lower and lower and the mind in endeavoring to conceive it is lost in its desired infinitude  when our bodies are all so straightened and confined what must the soul be made of antiphaus and what might be its powers if unrestrained since even in such dull company as the body with all these weights and incumberents about it it betrays on every the allest occasion such an appetite to nfinity  mr addison in one of his finest works he essay on the pleasures of the imagination reckons greatness as first among those things which give that spectator numb     pleasure nothing says he numb   gratifies the mind so much as those large growing ideas which lead her on almost to an infinitude numb     our imagination loves to be filled with an object or to grasp at any thing that is too big for its capacity we are flung into a pleasing astonishment at such unbounded views and feel a delightful stillness and amazement in the soul at the apprehensions of them  every one may know this pleasure by experience it is not a dry maxim laid down by the philosophers whoever will consult his own mind when he looks only on a prospect may say as much as mr addison or mr lock have on this occasion when i had the pleasure of conversing with the gentleman who designed these gardens as indeed the finest in the nation owe their beauty to his directions i was very much pleas with a maxim which he then mentioned that as the greatest fault in a prospe was confinement so the meanest thin too in a design was to have the bounds and restraint of it immediately visible  there may be several other points to be considered under the character of emphatical whether from the strength of the language the nobleness of the sentiment or the greatness and extent of the object itself but i am only giving a few sketches of the kind you will give me leave in the same manner to take a short view of its contrary the low or mean style  it has been said that eadem fere est ratio minuendi nam otidem sunt descendentibus quot ascendentibus gradus quintil instit lib   cap   lowness as just as many causes as elevation since whatever raises the sentiment or diction has its opposite which is mean this has the appearance of truth but if one general measure must be given i should think that it is an excess either way which causes meanness things overwrought as well as things underwrought will be mean  when the least object is expressed in just and proper terms it will not of itself come under the character of meanness nay small things may be managed so as to change their nature and to compose the grand air we meet with dissertations on the late discoveries in the lesser world of animals which have something great and sublime in them littleness itself may be assistant too in amplifying a subject homer uses it thus in his character of tydeus and it is visible to any one that bold martial atcheivments look greater in a nassa than they would in a maximin  such considerations as these have induced me to imagine that all meanness arises from some disproportion or other when a person is represented in a view beneath himself or any action of force is expressed weakly the expressions fall short of the nature of the thing again that meanness which arises from the language may have the same measure the close of a sentence may fall beneat the expectance raised in the beginnin of it and then will necessarily have a mean air some sorts of poetry are o a nobler kind and descriptions of things that would not be mean in a sonnet o satire may become so in epick in general all vulgar terms and all ver disagreeable descriptions are beneat the heroic style as all triflings o any affectation of ornament argu something beneath the care of a poet who has taken upon him to rule the nobler passions and to sing of heroes and of gods  when any thing has an epithet higher than its own nature and the occasion requires or lower than the proper idea of the thing might very well demand it is much the same in both there wll be a disproportion and a meanness thus e mindful of yourselves draw forth your swords od           and to your shafts obtend these     and this line od            is shoulder blade received the     the same critic who observes on a certain writer for saying that some persons who were shipwreckt met with n unpleasant death is equally severe n those who carry things too ar he anks any vain c elevations and the uerile style under one and the same ead  indeed both are frigid and both are ean a little or pretty thought dressed p in grand words is like the cpid in lnginus cap   one of coypels pieces who is crept into marss armor and looks as if he was endeavoring to strut about in it whilst a great thought in little words puts one in mind of that tall gentleman we saw one night at the masquerade dressed like an infant and dangling its hands as if it were perfectly helpless  a mixture of mean language with the grand makes the meanness more visible as possibly in this line od      stripped of his rags  he blazed out like a god   thus where a libation to the gods i cld od           an holy beverage in the  and mars il        the heavenly homie in the iliad  there seems to me to be something oo mean for the ide we form of a giant in this expression od  0          her antiphates husband scowrd away    and just after the men like fish they stuck upon the flood od  0          and crammed their ilthy throats with hum food   in the same manner we hear of ulyssess companions being od             dashed like dogs by the cyclops  i doubt not this was expressed thus to give us the larger idea of that monster but might not it have been expressed so as to serve that purpose without giving us at the same time too low an idea of the men  the dignity of the person will make any mean language appear yet meaner whether we consider ulysses as od       so great an hero or as the od     godlike guest of alcinous this couplet sounds beneath his character od             shrunk with pining fat my craving bowels still require repast   nothing can be more just than horaces observation de art pet     that a king in exile or distess must lay aside that air of grandeur and those swelling words which might come him in his power yet must he remember that he has been a king heres a greatnes even in dstrss and a due medium between words of a ootandahalf long and monosyllable be that as it will there is certainly much reason that he should reassume his style with his dignity and whatever may be said for that speech of ulysses in his wanderings after he is reinstated he ought certainly to speak like a monarch i am afraid he fails in this respect in the following lines  e it my care by loans or martial toils to throng my emptied folds with gifts or spoils but now i haste to bless lertess eyes od           0 with sight of his ulysses ere he dies when the god of the ocean sees ulysses escaped from his dominion he is so much provoked that he flies immediately to the throne of jupiter to lay his complaints before the father of the gods let us hear part of his speech on this grand occasion  against yo destined head in vain i swore and menaced vengeance ere he reached the shore od             behold him landed  careless and asleep when an expectation is raised by the preceding verses and little or nothing follows upon this expectation  we need not quote de ae po v     horace to prove that it will be mean every one will see it and every one may see that it arises from the disproportion  i have often observed how fatal this particular is to that sort of people who are known by the character of storytellers the greatest baulks these gentlemen meet with are occasioned by their bespeaking attention too much and after all ending in some inconsiderable circumstance there is a certain passage in the odyssey which puts me in mind of this disaster so common to them prpare then said tlemachus to know od           0 a tale from falsehood free not free from woe   what follows upon this no earthly thing igad as mr bays has it only that he is the son of ulysses and that he is searching after the king his fther  there is another see od        to        0 to     instance of this nature in that important dialogue between neptune and jupiter just mentioned  of this kind also is a certain figure which mr addison misc vol   p  00   0 calls an anticlimax a downfall in the close where a passage has been very promising in the beginning i remember he quotes a allz vous luy ditil sns bruit chez vos parens ou vous avez laisse vore honneur and vos gans ib french couplet upon that occasion which i suppose was designed for ridicule but there are many instances of it from more serious writers such is what a grave doctor has said in his character of your miltonick friend mr philips it is delivered in this grand air of prophecy mr philipss poems says he will last as long as blenheim is remembered or ds on the classicks p     cider drunk in england  i beg leave to mention one thing says antiphaus  what you have been saying may afford the reason why that species of criticism which goes upon ridicule in the manner of the hind and panther is not to be depended upon the best lines that ever were wrote may be rendered ridiculous only by raising too great an expectation in the reader just before they are introduced in the criticism  there is another kind of littleness proceeded philypsus when the language does not become the poetic style all prosaick poetry or as dr garth used to call it a diction loytering into prose carries something of meanness with it something below the harmony the emotion the majesty that is required from the epick muse  here are two or three couplets which i think descend too near to prose  and now telemachus the first of all od     00      observed eumeu entering in the hall  let eurymachus receive my gest od      0      of nature courteous and by far the best his food an herald bore and now they fed od          and now the rage of craving hunger fld it might be thought too trifling to observe that this meanness is often owing to an illjudgd use of monosyllables from vossius de carm cantu p    a long run of these little pigmy words beside an unavoidable air of meanness often makes a line rough and hobling and almost ever keeps it from being firm and compact  it is very rare that you meet with a latin verse terminating in a single monosyllable and sometimes where we do meet with it it is evidently as in horaces art of poetry v     and virgils  geog v     designed to assist in expressing the littleness or ridiculousness of the subject  unless it be thus designed or be significant a verse even an hemistick may be rendered mean merely by consisting of these little words i know there are entire lines of them that are tolerable nay that run with some degree of vigor as this in the odyssey  od      re yet he loosed the rage of war on troy and that close in shakespeare cried havoc and let sp the dgs of war the sentiments here are so great that they take us off from observing the littleness which the dictio might otherwise occasion yet to speak my mind i believe that these very thoughts would appear more majestically in large adequate expressions  beside this littleness from the nature of words there is oftentimes a meanness annexed in our thoughts to such particular words and phrases all mere vulgar ways of peaking are mean in poetry  the muse should reject any low poverbs and the language of the crowd  even the ideas of things in which they particularly ar employed are ullied and debased  i believe i may add that whatever has an air of burlesque or has been marked for ridiculous on any other occasion will be apt to retain something of the mean wherever it is used  his shoulder blade received thungentle shock he stood and moved not like a marble rock od      0      but shook his thoughtful head  i doubt not i have formerly met with something in burlesque to which this passage has a distant resemblance though the thing itself be gone out of my head the distaste to such a particular expression still remains with me it is true this would not justify a criticism and yet it leads one unavoidably to dislike the passage  this sort of acquired meanness may be sometimes more general as where menelaus calls telemachus od       the mirror of constant faith this expression has been so often used in a ridiculous ort of writings that it will sound mean to the generality of those that ear it  a starlight evening and a morning fair   is a line in drydens virgil essay on grg   pref p   condemned by a very exact critic upon account of its being low and mean it is of the acquired kind any one who has been at all conversant with the poetry of a belman will certainly look upon it with something of contempt yet is there nothing mean in it of itself and a critic in france might think it a good handsome line but the best expressions degenerate when used by the populace and applied to low things the use they make of them infects them with a low abject air  thus proverbial speeches and all other expressions very common among us become unworthy of our poetry foreign proverbs are often great and emphatical to us as many of ours may sound great to foreigners yet at home both if vulgar will be apt to appear mean or at least unfit for poetry one instance or two will be sufficient in the tenth odyssey we have this line v     with broken hearts my sad companions stood   and this in the    d v         dogs ye have had your day    i shall not presume to say how far the odyssey or iliad might be blameable for any of these meannesses in the days of homer himself it is the privilege of every dead language to be entirely free from them at present we hear not the proverbs nor know the current ridicule of those times his language is safe enough from the vulgar now and as to any words that might be vulgar enough then to seem low we are in an entire ignorance this is a considerable advantage which the ancients have over every living writer and for which by the way there should be a large allowance made in any comparison between an ancient and a modern  thus any meanness that is acquired may be lost again or worn off by time and accidents it is not so with meanness in the things themselves they have something settled in them and ar delivered down to us through the stream of ages unaltered and the same perhaps if we would take off the veil which superstition has flung over the worshippers of homer we might discern some traces of this in the conversation of the suitors in the scene at eumuss lodge and in sicily when we are with the cyclops it is true the odyssey is built upon an humbler plan homer suits himself to his design and it may be very justly said with mr pope od vol   p       0 that where this poem cannot support a sublimity it always preserves a dignity or at least a propriety if these points may fail in dignity they have always some propriet in the poem either from the speaker or the audience or the occasion  to return to the translation every idea that has something awkward in it has something mean and ridiculous the first laugh in the iliad i occasioned by the awkward behavior and odd address of vulcan as the only laugh in the aeneid is raised on the untoward figure which menaetes makes i that poem  there seems to me to be somethin mean and awkward in this image his loose head tottering as with wine oppressed od           obliquely drops and nodding knocks his brea   perhaps the sneezingpiece in the    book v          borders too much on the sam fault or if it be no fault on the sam disagreeableness  for the same reason all descriptions that have any thing of the nauseous in them might be avoided in poetry or at least be but slightly touched in it i cannot think it is any particular niceness or effeminacy in my temper which inclines me to wish that the colors had not been laid on so strongly on some see od       and       0     etc od            aen       addisns  v   page      0 occasions the worst image i know of this kind is in the description of the drunken cyclops and what is surprising o me the very same grossness on the ame occasion is kept up in b several f the best poets that ever wrote  here ou will forgive me if i am ready to nk under authority in a point where y very senses almost contradict it ut when such great names as homer irgil pope and addson may be produed to defend one and the same descipon what are we to think antiphaus an we say a thing is not offensive when e feel the contrary or must we alw that nature ought to be justly and lly expressed even in the most nauses of subjects  it cannot be denied answered antiaus after having turned the question for some time in his mind every description that is just is poetically good but then i fancy it is as true that a description poetically good may be the more improper to be inserted on that very account this will be readily allowed in all cases of obscenity the bt description in such points is certainly the most improper and surely the same will hold in a great measure of any images directly nauseous we have you say the examples of the greatest poets that ever wrote against us but i the reason of the thing be against them no authority whatever nor any numbe of examples can be of the least rea wght i am delighted with the corretness of a virgil or an addison i adre pope and reverence homer bu were there any one piece of obscenity  the works of all these great men wou such a description alter its nature an become amiable it is the same in other cases as well as in obscenities a things that have something in the nature disagreeable will still be  agreeable wherever we find em  the line you hint at in the drun cyclops cannot but carry a very nauseo idea with it and had mr pope deviat from the original and dropped it in  english i am persuaded most people would have looked upon it as a commendable injury to his author i remember il       a passage of this nature though less gross than this in the iliad which mr pope has improved by concealing the grossness of it and in the note upon it he says it is unworthy of homer he does not see any color to soften he meanness of it it must ever have been oo nauseous to be described  what fine critics should we make ays philypsus since we can be both so eady to wish a translator had erred more requently from his copy  but hatever those severe gentlemen may ink we should certainly have a large arty on our side in the present case that would they say to another prinple that it may be necessary to deate from the words of the original to eserve the sense of it and yet this ay happen as for instance where r notions of things are directly conary to what was thought of them in omers days  words are to be considered not as nds but as they are significant and strict translator should endeavor chiefly to give us the same ideas which the writer he represents gave to his readers it is on this account i should take o          the monarch of the swains for instance to be a juster translation of  than the chief swineherd would have been in the present acceptance of things a literal translation would have been a travesty it would have made that ridiculous and mean which was not mean or ridiculous in the original  of old useful employments were also honorable the chief courtiers were masters of the flocks and of the herds a skill in agriculture was reckoned a very handsome part in the character of a monarch homer see note on od        places it upon a evel with military science and looks upon the reputation it deserves as equal to the glory acquired by achievements in war  to preserve something of these s od              and        primitive notions of things at least not to sink into those very low ideas which we in the present world entertain of such sorts of arts and employments a transator of homer is obliged to vary the expressions in common use for the same things nothing would be more ridiculous now than to call a first minister by the name of a hogherd or to say of kings that they overlooked the dairy  there are some other points relating to the manners of antiquity which may require some alterations in the turn of expressing them i have been too tedious already let me only mention one particular of this kind and i have done the heroes of old in rating each other are very free with the mutual terms of dogs cowards villains etc in the odyssey we have a queen calling one of her maids of honor an impudent bitch and jupiter if i mistake not pays exactly the same compliment to his royal consort in the iliad i think no one can dispute which is the better translation in the former case the new which makes penelope call her servant od      0     a loquacious insolent or the literal of hobbes bold bitch said she i know what deds you have done   this is equally a misrepresentation of fact and shocking in its very sound it offends the ear and makes one sartle at the behavior of penelope a reader ought to think that lady well bred this he cannot do at least he will be prejudiced not to do so by hearing such language now however decent it might be thought in those times  i am obliged to you says antiphaus perceiving that philypsus stopped here for the fair account you have given of these lownesses in an epick poem i know not whether your general rule of meanness will hold in every point that might be mentioned but in those you have produced it seems to square very well i imagine too there is one particular of pretty large extent in this question not yet touched upon  there may be several but you have all that i have observed says philypsus  i doubt not says antiphaus you have observed the same thing and put it under some other head you must know i would rank all thoughts which border on puerility all cold fancies all forced antitheses and any mere turns and sporting upon words under the class of meannesses in an epick poem  as you have hinted such a variety of subjects says philypsus will you not complete the favor and afford some instances too under these heads  what i can recollect replied aniphaus is at your service  does not there seem to you to be something affected and cold in this thought which i doubt not many will be apt to take for a pretty clash in the ideas  here ceased he but indignant tears let fall od     0       spoke when he ceased  such is this thought od  0          and my tossed limbs now wearied into rest   nothing is meaner than what is overwrought i own it is in poetry as in statuary figures that are to be set up at such a height must be something larger than the life but even then there are exact rules of proporion and nothing is to appear too vast to the eye  in giving ones opinion of an exquisite statue we may say it lives or speaks but when we go to refine on this we grow affected and mean pardon me if i take this to be the case in the las line of this couplet alive each animated frame appears od           and still to live beyond the power of year    i was formerly pleased with the incription under a saint bruno in italy but give it up now as carried too far it tells us as you may remember egli e vivo e parlerebbe se non osservasse la ragola del silentio that he is alive and would speak were it not for the rules of silence he had established a man must understand the history of the grand chartreux to take the meaning of this and after all it appears too forced and artificial  a fault of this kind is the more evident when the thoughts and language look noble about it there terrible in arms ulysses stood od           and the dead suitors almost swam in blood   you know a late excellent mr wollaston philosopher has endeavored to prove that no action which disagrees with truth can be good and i should not be new or singular in my opinion were i to assert the same of any point in poetry every one knows the dialogues of one of the most bouhours penetrating critics in the last age are wrote chiefly in this view he asserts constantly that no thought can be good which is not poetically true and i imagine this that he asserts may be defended as easily in the fiction of poetry as in any of the plainest passages but such an enquiry would take up more time than crticism deserves and i mention it at present only as a measure of such thoughts as are mean from their being false i e really beneath what they pretend to be  this rule if just would be of particular service in this kind of pursuits i shall give you but one isance when circe mentions ulyssess descent to the infernal shades she adjoins this reflection  o sons of woe decreed by adverse fates alive to pass through hells eternal gates all soon or late are doomed that path to tread od           more wretched you twice numbered with the dead do you not think this last thought has something weak and little in it according to your general rule it fails in its proportion that proportion i mean which every thought should bear to truth  if it fails in that says philypsus i must allow it to be mean by my own rule but i do not perceive in what respect that sentiment is false  no says antiphaus i beg you would consider the very word on which the whole of the reflection turns it has plainly too significations widely different if their being nmberd with the dead be taken in its strongest sense it is certain this did not happen twice to ulsses and his companions if in its weaker on this occasion their calamity is put on a level with something much more terrible and calamitous than it self  or thus if this being twice numbered with the dead be intended both in the same sense the sentence is directly false if in very different unequal senses it is fallacious and false in its consequence  i beg pardon for putting on this grave face and affecting such an air of demonstration but you must know this though is exactly the same in the original o if any thing rather more fallacious ther than in the translation in such a cas all ones gravity is scarce sufficient an the superstitious perhaps would rathe disbelieve a real demonstration tha allow of any fault in homer i beg pardon of them for thus assuming the chair of criticism as the noblest of lord bacon de agm scient lib   cap human writers calls it and am very willing to descend and act in an humbler sphere  all sporting upon words may seem unbecoming of the epick muse i shall leave you to determine how far there may be any suspicion of this in some particular lines  od           thy last of games unhappy has thou played   to me has some resemblance to the rebellious angels in milton where they run on in such a vein of insulting and punning i know not how far the original might help in leading a translator into the former turn but here is another line which runs into it without that wrong biass  od  0  0     0 they on the future banquet feast their eyes i should think this yet more improper on any grave or affecting circumstance do you remember the death of antinous in the odyssey it is in the instant of his lifting a goblet of wine to his mouth  wretch that he was of unprophetick soul high in his hand he reared the golden bowl even then to drain it lengthened out his breath od         0 changed to the deep the bitter draught of death i fear that some points which generally pass for elegancies are of this kind  a case which touches all readers of a little taste very much is addisons msc vol   p       0 when two very different ideas are joined to the same verb this is very frequent in cowley and he has been often blamed for it as in that instance o           0 up rose the sun and saul   i know not how it is there is something agreeable in this management of words but it is very apt to njure the sense a thinking malbranche search after truth v   p    french author lays down a rule which is very useful toward discovering fallacies in reasoning it is this to put the definition instead of the thing defined i have often tried something of this nature in poetry if we make the experiment in the preent case and insert the enlarged meaning instead of the particular words used by the poet we shall generally find a fallacy in this sort of verse or at least a lameness in the sense of it  it will not be any great trouble to try this in one single point the poet speaking of telemachuss voyage uses this turn of expression to distant pylos hapless is he gone od     0     0 to seek his fathers fate and find his own   this sounds very well but what is the meaning of the word fate which is of such double service upon this occasion try it in your own mind to distant pylos hapless is he gone to seek whether his father be dead or not and find  what   there is no need of trying it says philypsus i allow it to be dficient upon the first hearing but by the way i wonder you let the antithesis in it escape so peaceably  indeed i am no great friend to them replied antiphaus especially when they are multiplied upon us as in this line od      0      dust mounts in clouds and sweat dsnds in dews   i do not fear my philypus should mistake me it would be too srupulous to discard every antithesis out of poetry as it seems affected to run into them very often some are of force and emphasis and some agreeable and engaging possibly even the double use of the same word is not absolutely to be rejected but however these ornaments may obtain on some occasions they eem generally too little and artificial for the more noble parts of poetry they are of the ovidian kind rather than of homer and are more apt to hit the taste of schoolboys than of men  and now i have mentioned ovids manner give me leave to say that in spite of his several beauties and that peculiar ease and address with which he tells a story i fear his writings are one great reason of the trifling manner keeping its grund so much in the present age ovid is generally made use of to initiate our youths in parnassus we look upon him as soon as ever we open our eyes to poetry he is then it is true fit for our taste but the misfortune is he is too agreeable it is odds but this fondness grows up with us and a false taste of wit drawn from him may infuence our writings many years after we have flung him from our bosom the boyisms of ovid as dr garth calls em are agreeable enough to infect us to old age mr dryden for instance was thus infected by em ovid and cowley our english ovid were his favorites at ten years old and his corrupters at seventy  as great geniuss and more correct writers than mr dryden may be touched with the same infection i will give you an instance or two of this with which a person may be pleased even while he condemns em  od          0  she to her present lord laments him lost and views that object which she wants the most again his arms he stretched his arms the touch deceive od             nor in the fond embrace embraces give   any one the least acquainted with the manner of the poets will readily perceive this to be of the ovidian kind it is pretty and agreeable as ovid but to be so it loses something from the air of homer it sinks beneath that simplicity and nature which is the distinguishing character of his writings  now you mention mr dryden and this sort of pretty writing together give me leave says philypsus to commend one sort of turns which that critic drydens pref to juvenal p     0 judges not only pretty but really good and substantial i will not defend all his instances but i would engage to do it were they all as good as that from gnoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere man virgil  a very good critic since has treated of this more distinctly his notions as i remember are that a dextrous turn upon words is pretty the turn upon the thought substantial but the most complete of all is when the turn of the words and of the thought concur bckwalls introd to the classick p     when both our reason an our ear are entertained with a noble sentiment expressed vigorously and beautifull finished i should be glad to know you opinion antiphaus how far a person might admit these turns in heroic poetry  as for the first says antiphaus i believe one might venture to say that i should be rejected universally i am s little versed in these particulars that cannot readily say any thing as to the second the other whether justly or no takes one very much i own for m part that i imagine them not only beatiful but useful i remember an instan of gorg    0  one in virgil which fixes the images very particularly on the mind and it is this which helps to touch us in those lines of mr addison which strike every one who reads them  the listening soldier ixt in sorrow stands loath to obey his leaders just commands the leader grieves by generous pity swayed addiso vol   page       to see his just commands so well obeyed if you ask my opinion in this point rude and unsettled as it is i should think that no turns should obtain in an epick or any solemn poem except such as have more strength than beauty that in lesser pieces those may be allowed which have more beauty than strength but that they can be justified in no piece whatever unless they have some share of strength as well as beauty  the great art of them is to appear unartful as in these pretty lines from mr philipss pastorals  fair is my flock nor yet uncomely i if liquid fountains flatter not and why should liquid fountains flatter us yet show the bordering flowers less beauteous than they grow as i take it the beauty of this passage is in a greater degree than its strength and the natural air of the sentiments is more exquisite than either the turn of the lines makes them observed by every reader more than they would otherwise be and yet that very turn does not seem to be designed but rather to be the natural result of the shepherds thoughts as he speaks them  if i have said too much philypsus you must blame your self for it who led me from my chief design i was just entering on the several natural peces in the poem before us  some fanciful writers afford us nothing but pictures and descriptions they continue image after image and put one in mind of those americans who when first they were discovered are said to have used painting instead of writing  homers judgment will not allow him in any of his works to be thus perpetual in his descriptions and the design of the odyssey will not allow near the variety which he has very justly employed in the iliad the odyssey is a poetical treatise of morality it does not admit of a profusion of colors this is not to be looked upon as a defect we might with the same reason blame a book of maxims or platos moral dialogues for not having all the flourishes and charms of rhetoric  and as the plan of the odyssey in general excludes that great variety of description which abounds in some poems the chief scene in the remaining part of it is so wholly domestic that it scarce allows room for any thing of that nature the action now is confined it lies all between either the country house of eumaeus and the palace or this latter and the gardens of laertes what a narrow scene is this for description and yet these are the only places capable of any if you except a two days journey and a short voyage n the    th neither of which could be enlarged upon without injuring the main design homer was unacquainted with the modern affluence of painting wherever there may be any fine object in the way as these opportunities offer only in an episode he passes them with the utmost dispatch we see his haste in the very lines and indeed in every one of them distinctly  with speed the mast they rear with speed unbind the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind minerva calls the ready gales obey with rapid speed to whirl them over the sea crunus they passed next chalcis rolled away  the silver phaeas glittering rills they lot od             and skimd along by elis sacred coast it might be the indigence of his subject this way which induced homer to repeat the view of hell in the    th book and the wanderings of ulysses in the    d but nothing could make him run into descriptions on that occasion we have the names of places repeated in order and though penelope has the ful relation the reader is only tantaliz with hearing in general that od        h images the rills and flowery vales   these things however they had been laid out would have been only sideviews for in the main scene as i now lies in ithaca i think there are bu four places capable of description if  am not mistaken in this it will give u great reason to admire the managemen of homer who as he was too pruden to run out into any impertinent descriptions at that same time has not omitted any one of those places that might very well allow of a description without wandering we have distinct draughts of laertess gardens od    v   to    eumaeuss lodge of od        and     the royal palace and the road between these and the palace these complete the present scene of the poem and any one by laying them together may form an exact picture of it in his mind  some of these have been mentioned already on other occasions and the way from eumaeuss house to the metropolis deserves very well to be mentioned ere i dare say you will think part of t the most delightful road you ever ravelld in your life  now passed the rugged road they journey down the cavernd way descending to the town where from the rock with liquid lapse distills a limpid fount that spread in parting rills s current thence to serve the city brings an useful work adorned by ancient kings itus ithacus polyctor there n sculptured stone immortalized their care n marble urns received it from above and shaded with a green surrounding grove where silver alders in high arches twined drink the cool stream and tremble to the wind eneath sequestered to the nymphs is seen a mossy altar deep embowerd in green where constant vows by travelers are made od    v   0 to     and holy horrors solemnize the shade there is a sort of melancholy pleasure hangs upon the mind wherever we have a view of laertes in his retirement the good old prince od        labors thorough life he od        longs to lay down the burden and when he is not so overcome with his distress as to od       neglect his employment in his gardens he seems busy rather to od        avoid pain than to enjoy pleasure thus is he engaged with something of diversion and much of melancholy when the scene changes to his gardens  we have not a set description o these altogether but it begins at thi point and is carried on od    v            and     successively till we may easily form an idea o the whole  though homer has not wandered into any descriptions of places that lay ou of this scene of the poem he has here and all along in the former part of it brought in short draughts and side views of things by such arts as a some of them necessary and all very allowable in poetry  such are all descriptive similies where in some picture out of the subject is borrowed to illustrate any point that belongs to it this affords us several occasional pieces and some of them very natural i have just dipped upon one of this sort it is just after the slaughter of the suitors they are yet gasping and ulysses is surveying their bodies to see whether the number be complete  so when by hollow shores the fisher train weep with their arching nets the hoary main and scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain ll naked of their element and bare he fishes pant and gasp in thinner air od      0      wide over the sands are spread the stiffening prey it is a known remark that all alluons of this kind drawn from calm life s fishing hunting and rural affairs ave a peculiar beauty and it is as well own that they acquire an additional nergy when they are introduced amidst y confusion or to illustrate images of error virgil compare aen    0  d     has imitated this rt of contrast from a similie in the ad which affords frequent instances the same kind nor are they wanting the sea od     00 and the note re poem before us  the more concise and natural any image the stronger the illustration how do you approve of this on a number of females employed at the loom  their busy fingers move od         0  like poplarleaves when zephyr fans the grove   when these occasional images hit i several points they are the more descriptive of the things which they ar brought to illustrate homer gives u an idea of the spirits in ades of their still posture their motion their confusion and the odd noises they utte all in one single picture of this kind  trembling the specter glide and plaintive ve thin hollow screams along the deep descent as in the cavern of some rifted den where flock nocturnal bats and birds obscene clustered they hang till at some sudden shock they move and murmurs run through all the rock so cowring fled the sable heaps of ghosts od       and such a scream filled all the dismal coasts it seems not improper to point o these distinct likenesses as the translation has done in the present cas more plainly than the original the same may be said of se od     0    0 some other this is done sometimes by insisting much on one circumstance and as in mr popes iliad    v     to     book    repeating it over and over  borrowed images appear with a particular propriety and grace when they have some near relation to the scene on which the poem turns at the very instant of applying em thus in the battle of rivers in the b iliad every similie is quatick and adapted to the place thus if the swiftness of a deity passing er the land is to be illustrated in this anner homer images it by the swiftess of an eagle but when mercury is ying over the sea by that of some od      aterfowl  the image of an angler is used in e iliad of a person in the field of bate in the od     00 odyssey of persons at sea oth on occasions which make that age proper but it seems more proer in the latter from the agreement  place in this and all like cases rt of the picture is nearer to us and ill be conceived the more readily and early  there may also be some propriety om any previous relation between the person and the thing to which he is compared any faithless wavering creature may be compared to the sea but it strikes one more when venus is said to be as guarinis pastor fido at   sc   inconstant as the waves from whence she sprung any rough man may be compared to the element in another view but there is a peculiar fitness in these lines a rce of rugged mariners are these o     unpolished men and boisterous as their seas   i remember i used formerly to be mightily taken with a similie in the  cui saepe suis in montibus hirc prolixam invidit barbam  de cambrobri thus virgils abietibus juvenes patriis and montibus aequos mscipula and i believe now it was n this very account ideas which ave been alreaded joined on any other occasion will agree the more easily on a new one  the picture is less broken also when the borrowed image is adapted to the present circumstances where penelop is represented as chaste and beautiful it is said she looked od           like diana with all the charms of venus when her beauty is the chief circumstance to be insisted on she is compared to od             venus without any mention of diana  we may observe by the way that the heathen poets in comparing a person to any of their deities had a sure method of giving their readers a picture of that person the statues of their deities were known by every one and the faces of each as well ascertained as the faces of the roman emperors for instance can be by frequently conversing with their medals this i take to be one reason why this sort of comparison is so very frequent in the ancients the case is very different in any modern composition though we seem to be equally fond of the same comparisons  if it does not add to the strength at least it makes the piece more agreeable when these images are unusual thus ulysses in his bed of leaves to a od     0      coal of fire preserved in the embers and before in his raft at sea to an ibid     heap of thorns driven by the wind  there may be a prettiness as well as a likeness in these images i always used to be pleased with that passage where penelope is compared to a od     0       nightingale though i am more pleased with the same image in georg       virgil which beside its agreeableness is perhaps the most complete instance that can be given of such similitudes as hit exactly in every point virgil certainly excells homer in these as we may say that homer excells him in the vague similitude for both have their distinct beauties  it is the proper air of poetry to be unconfined and free the muse loves a flowing dress her motions are ever easy and her very ornaments must be natural such is the muse of homer and hence the poet in this sort of pictures does not in the least scruple to take in several circumstances that do not affect the main resemblance when a painter is copying a piece he must preserve the likeness but he may var in the drapery the posture the under figures and the scene around em  thus in homers philomel the main likeness is very well taken when the poet has secured this he touches upon the history of itylus and launches out into particulars which are od to      so far from squaring with the case of penelope that they have no manner of relation to it  homer is almost singular in another sort of similie the reverse of the former when the principal figures have in themselves no likeness but agree in some one circumstance of action these are very frequent in the iliad and odyssey and i cannot say whether it be from a true judgment or a scrupulous niceness that later writers endeavor to imitate them but very rarely  perhaps this is blameable and so may be that stringing of several similies together which we sometimes meet with in homer i do not mean when several things are chosen to illustrate the sea il x     same point more fully but when similies on different things follow too close on the neck of one another in the   d iliad       to     we have one of these strings which takes up thirty lines and though they are all excellently well chosen and have one common point of union between  they may seem something faulty as they are too numerous for the lace in which they stand and too much crowded on one another  now i have digressd so far on two or three vices in ancient similies i shall just mention one or two of a later date such is the continued similie which is very liable to the great fault of mixed metaphors when a writer to lengthen a comparison carries it beyond the likeness i remember one of mr drydens in a before his translation of the georgicks dedication that begins very well the greatness of birth shows a nobleman with advantage but if he degenerates the least spot is visible on ermine  this does not seem to be continued so happily as it is begun to preserve this whiteness in its original purity you my lord have like that ermine forsaken that common tract of business which is not always clean  the art of extracting similies out of a thing directly contrary to your purpose is i think wholly modern every one knows an instance of this in that famous doctor who to illustrate the danger of the church compares it to one of the prophets who was encompassed with emen and chariots of fire  for his fence  nothing is so opposite to the design of this beauty in poetry as to labor after a vast number of likenesses in any the minutest points and to multiply them rather to show how far the poets wit can carry the resemblance than to strengthen the image of the things described this descends even to playing upon words nay sometime to particularize several points in which they are unlike as well as those in which they agree this is the cowlean similitude and i could produce see a pindarick ode on cowley in drydens misc vol   particularly the whole third stanza monstrous instances of it from a very fine writer where he endeavors only to imitate cowley at a distance it is the same person who has introduced similies into his prose in a manner unknown to the ancients but he who would blame any of his writings of this kind must blame them as mr lock does eloquence with the tenderness of a lover  it is not difficult to judge of any similie ancient or modern their ad inferendam rebus lucem repertae sunt similitudines  praecipue custodiendum ne id quod similitudinis gratia adscivimus aut obscurum sit ut ignoum quintil instit lib   cap   chief design is to make things clear obscurity and confusion is their great fault poetry may go much farther in them than prose but even in poetry none can be good which do not give us either more distinct larger notions of the thing or at least of some circumstance of the things to be described  i long to add several things on this head but i have wandered too far already from our chief design it is time now to consider a higher class of descriptions and images which we touched upon when we were talking over the former books of the odyssey that poetical power of expressing the passions and even ideas yet in the minds of men  i am not angry with you philypsus for preventing much of what might have been offered here when you were considering the starts and turns which our passions occasion in the various manners of speaking i know not how such a notion would appear to the world but you have thoroughly persuaded me that all the figures of speech of the figures either belong to the diction or the sntiment the latter is what is here intended nobler order are viewed in a truer light when we look upon them as naturally expressive of what we feel within us than when we consider them only as the arts and machineries of writing  it was on this occasion you went thorough the most passionate scenes in the odyssey for such are the several enterviews in which ulysses makes himself known to his book    friends his b    son his b    father and his b    consort penelopes od        speech at that juncture is excellent and indeed all her speeches in general are of the pathetick kind and under this view afford us the most beautiful passages in the whole poem  to the many things that have been said on the double passions as you were pleased to let me call them give me leave to add one particular case more what i mean is dissimulation we have frequent descriptions of this in the odyssey every instance of it if passionate at all will fall under this consideration and that in the highest degree as the passion assumed and the real are direct opposites every one who only pretends to courage is certainly affected with fear and when we put on a false gayety the heart is as dull and oppressed as the countenance is enlivened  could we look into the breast of one who affects a liveliness when his thoughts are really gloomy we should see his spirits in such contrary emotions as are described in the suitors under those unaccountable mixed fits of mirth and heaviness   od  0     pallas clouds with intellectual gloom the suitors souls insensate of their doom a mirhful phrenzy seized the fated crowd the roofs resound with causless laughter loud then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow such is that od             smile of penelope which has something very uneasy in it she seems all the while to struggle with her tears it is like a transient gleam of light when the heavens are overcast all around is gloomy and the light itself is dim and waterish  this perhaps is an instance not of the affected but the natural kind it is true one passion sometimes usurps the effect of another without tumbling over descartes for a solution of the matter we know that an excess of joy often breaks out into tears and that rage may vent itself in a smile these indeed are contrary appearances but it is very different in all points of dissimulation the mixture then has something peculiar in it contrary to the natural blending of such emotions this has always an air forced and artificial the soul was not made to be a counterfeit every time we would teach her these new arts we fling her off her biass and give her an unnatural motion there will ever be something awkward in the passions of the most profound dissemblers  only view ulysses when he is struck to the soul with the affection and tears of his penelope and at the same time resolved to conceal those his emotions from her as much as possible  od        withering at heart to see the weeping fair his eyes look stern and cast a gloomy stare of horn the stiff relentless balls appear or globes of iron fixed in either sphere firm wisdom interdicts the softening tear even ulysses that ulysses who is so see note ibid celebrated among the ancients for his command over his passions does not appear without something forced and unnatural in his looks amidst all his dissimulation he can command his tears he can command his tongue but still his very features would betray him  i know not what to say to one thing that homer makes dissimulation one of the greatest excellencies of his hero the heathen system of morality was incomplete enough to bear with this proceeding and even christians of the greatest name have bordered much on the same notions one of our ancient writers who was as capable as any of them to do it has see chrysostom tom   page   ed savil  etc launched out into a long defense of useful frauds and father paul to mention one not inferior among the moderns reckons dissimulation where the historian says that pope died con allegrezza non mediocre della core a quale ben ammirava le virtue di quello che erano una gravita natural et essemplare parsimonia and dissimulation odiava pero maggiomente l avariaia durezza and crudelta hist del concilio trid p    expressly among the virtues of pope clement the seventh i do not mention this as any argument for the thing but to extenuate the proceeding of homer it is no wonder that he should mistake a counterfeit virtue in the dark which such great men could not distinguish in the light  but whatever color dissimulation may bear in the schemes of morality it is certainly a great excellence to paint dissimulation well in poetry the pretended passion must appear most strongly and yet the real passion must appear under it it must be like the drapery in pictures which shows the turn of the limbs at the same time that it hides them and in particular puts one in mind of that veil in homer which seems and only seems to shade the face of penelope  there is nothing more difficult in poetry than to express justly ideas in the minds of persons whom we describe but though this be the least obvious it is perhaps the most agreeable of all studies the poet must search carefully into the nature of man and the working of his thoughts in general he must know what emotions are natural on each accident of life and on every single occasion is to consider not only the circumstances of actions but also the temper the education and the very make of the person concerned in them these will alter mens views of the very same point when nestor talks of achievements in war he will dwell chiefly upon the prudence and experience of a general hector will mention the great effects of strength and courage tdeus must place the whole on a bold daring spirit without taking the body into the account while polypheme on the contrary must speak of nothing but the advantage of a vast size and superior strength  a mans notions of excellence are formed generally from some advanced powers of his own each man is apt to make himself the measure of all the species and his species the standard of all perfection all beings above him must be exactly like the superior moiety of his own being and all below him must be purely of the inferior the vulgar of mankind form their heaven hereafter out of those things which have pleased them most in life and the very notions of the deity in most men take a turn from their own complexions the god of proud tyrannical minds is a being that delights only in the glory of being terrible as with the soft and pitiful the deity is all mercy the gods of epicurus were mere pleasurable intelligences and the deities of the irroquois are mighty hunters commend me to that philosopher who said that were his horse to give us his notion in this case a broad chest and a flowing mane would certainly be the principal things in it  one cannot easily apprehend how general an effect this has in the actings of our minds i know not that it is yet designedly managed in any system of philosophy for mr lockes association of ideas seems to be something very distinct from it and as it wants a name give me leave to call it for the present the assimilation of ideas  if you would save me from a fit of philosophizing be so good as to reach that volume of the odyssey just by you that i may read you a passage which took with me particularly on this account it is where ulysses has acquainted the cyclops with his real name and character this is part of the monsters answer  oh heavens oh faith of ancient prophecies this telemus eurymides foretold  long since he menaced such was heavens command and named ulysses as the destined hand i deemed some godlike giant to be hold o lofty hero haughty brave and bold not this weak pigmy wretch of mean design od    0       who not by strength subdued me but by wine even the excellence of those things with which we converse chiefly is apt to influence our thoughts in the same manner hence the eastern writers image the height and stateliness of any illustrious person by cedars homer by the od z           delianpalmtree and virgil by what a british reader will think the most noble a aen       and    00 large lofty oak  there is a passage which i remember i was mightily pleased with formerly in reading cervantes without seeing any reason for it at that time though i now imagine that which took me in it comes under this view speaking of don quixot the first time that adventurer came in sight of the ocean he expresses his sentiments on this occasion in the following manner he saw the sea which he had never seen before and thought it much bigger than the river at salamanca  this turn of thought is not so commonly observed perhaps as it might easily be in life there are other occasional traces in the mind which are known and obvious things that are common in some degree to all men and such are all those apprehensions which follow from any masterpassion one might expatate here very agreeably on each of them but i am ever apt to be too tedious and will therefore confine my self to one single passion that of fear  we may see in the descriptions of the poets how this passion acts on the soul through all its different degrees from a wavering and irresolution of mind to the excess of confusion and despair  when a coward as most cowards are vainglorious undertakes any enterprise of difficulty the moment he is engaged in it his mind turns all upon the danger of the undertaking he immediately wishes himself fairly out of it his body begins to tremble and his thoughts are all confused and irresolute thus it is with dolon that wretch engages under the covert of the night to steal to the camp of the greeks and discover their motions before he is got half way the first tread of men that he hears he hoped in his mind says il ch     homer that twas a messenger from hector to recall him  the whole book where we have this image is nothing but one picture of fear in different postures the apprehensions of distant danger are very naturally expressed in the grecian guard   cautious of surprise each voice each motion draw their ears and eyes il  0         each step of passing feet increased thaffright this description seems to have been improved beyond the original from  vastos a rupe cyclopas prospicio sonitumque pedum vocemque tremisco aen       virgils achemaenides  any near danger has more visible effects the motions of a person thus affected are  ex oculis se turbidus abstulit ae         tum pectore sensus vertuntur varii rutulos aspectat and urbem cunctaturque met telumque instare tremiscit         broken and disordered his color comes and goes his eyes are tum primum nostri cacum videre timentem turbatumque oculis        disturbed he cannot bear to look         full on the face of his enemy he approaches faintly and winks even when he strikes  fear has another strange property of magnifying our ideas of the danger when we are possessed with it we are apt like sosia in the play to take every shadow for a man and every man for a giant if the danger be present we think it greater than it is and to its real terrors add a thousand that are only imaginary thus the suitors view ulysses when he is ready to revenge himself upon them their fears od     0  to  0  aggravate every fierceness of his actions they look upon him as more than human as an incensed destructive deity  if i mistake not there is a certain great writer who calls fear a natural inebriation of the mind it shows every thing double i know not what the mythologists may teach but this in my opinion might account for the multiplicity of cerberuss heads and all the hands of briareus  there is something very expressive in a thought of virgils if we might take it under this view  se turni media inter millia vidit aen     0 hinc cies atque hin acies astare latinas   this spreading of any danger in our ideas may widen so far as to possess the whole mind then it is that it takes away all od        power of action even od        of flight it fixes  subitus tremor occupat artus diriguere oci tot erinnys sibilat hydris tantaque se facies aperit  aen        the eye entirely in one horrid stare and even  etc  il the    see note on odyssey  0     shuts up all the senses to any other object but that of its terror and amazement it is this excess of fear which in any eminent danger makes a person this sort of idea is strongly expressed in the odyssey gods should the stern ulysses rise in might those gates would seem too narrow for thy flight                 think it impossible that he should escape and it remains so strong and lively that after he is got perfectly out of danger he can scarce persuade himself but that he is still in the midst of it    with timorous awe from the dire scene the exempted two withdraw scarce sure of life look round and trembling move od             to the bright altars of protector jove all these are points which lie in common between painting and poetry i would willingly touch upon one thing more under the same view i mean those pieces in poetry which answer copying in painting and each of which is really the picture of a picture  you will give me leave by picture here to understand any artificial images of things from embroidery embossing or any other method of expressing nature by likenesses of art and indeed it is of this kind that all the pictures spoken of in homer are and i believe all in virgil at least what we call painting now was not the painting of the homerick ages  it is to the honor of the art in this general sense that the poets when they are copying from painting generally exceed themselves i believe there is not a more masterly piece in all virgils works than his copy of troilus thus the same hand in the images of aeneass shield as in that of achilles homer has all the life and expression that poetry is capable of  in both of these the poets use a way of speaking in relation to picture which is very strong and emphatical and which may show the high notions they entertained of this art they do not say that the images seem to perform such actions but talk of em as real life they say directly that they move and act and speak the critics who have blamed some boldnesses of this kind show only their own see pope and dacier on the shield of achilles  book    coldness and want of taste it is a figure as just as it is daring it animates the description and where the poet is thus where europa is said  terras spectare relictas et comites clamare suas tactumque vereri assilientis aquae timidasque reducere plantas one should forget it was only in picture did not the poet take so much pains to inform us of it ipsa videbatur terras etc  verum taurum freta vera pataras met    0  more cautious he is less lively on that very account  my want of skill in this noble art is the same disadvantage in viewing these poetical pictures as want of a proper light would be to the real but with all this disadvantage they seem extremely beautiful and i cannot resist the temptation of setting one or two of em before you  the design on the shields affords such a variety of images exquisitely well wrought and disposed so justly that it would be perfectly gothic and barbarous to take them to pieces ignorant as i am the sea aen       young romulus and remus and ibid     the genius of the nile strike me particularly in the one and in the other the sea popes il        to     ambuscade and engagement the ibid     still rural prospect and il        the dance considered as a poetitical piece of painting  to what perfection must embroidery have arrived in homers days if its works could equal his descriptions of them how full of life is od            that figure in ulyssess robes and i suppose the cestus of venus was of the same nature in which was    every ar and every charm to win the wisest and the coldest warm ond love the gentle vow the gay desire the kind deceit the stillreviving fire persuasive speech and more persuasive sighs il             silence that spoke and eloquence of eyes herculess belt and the description of it in the odyssey is the reverse of this the belt it self perhaps was of a different make answerable to the shield of achilles which by the way may ntimate something of an art that is ow lost which if you will allow me in  mere conjecture of my own seems to ave been a sort of mosaickwork of diffeent metals see il s     brass stannum silver etc intermixed with gold ibid   0 all varied and ibid     shaded so as to express the different properties and actions of the things described but whatever the materials were the workmanship certainly excelled them greatly any one to be convinced of this need only turn his eyes on the hercules in ades where  gloomy as night he stands in act to throw the aerial arrow from the twanging bow around his breast a wondrous zone is rolled where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold there sullen lions sternly seem to roar the bear to growl to foam the tusky boar there war and havoc and destruction stood od          0  and vengeful murder red with human blood these are all copies and i have done if you will give me leave only to set virgils troilus before you which is certainly as fine a piece as any drawn by that great hand   amissis troilus armis infelix puer atque impar congressus achilli fertur quis curruque haeret resupinus inani lora tenens tamen huic cervixque comaeque trhuntu aen       per terram and versa pulvis inscribitur hasta how beautiful does this look in the poem and in the picture yes the painter and the poet have one and the same art or rather one and the same power of creating  aut utramque credes esse pictam aut utramque credes esse veram i am extremely obliged to you says philypsus for so various a view of these beauties believe me i have scarce known for some time whether i was not got into some strange picturegallery where one meets every moment with new subjects of admiration and delight the misfortune is you have only led me thorough by the hand and given me a transient view of them when i could have dwelt hours upon admiring each by itself it is just like some traveling enjoyment of this kind when we have been forced to run over whole apartments furnished with pieces by the greatest masters too numerous to be observed articularly you have delighted me in aste and i know not how it is i find y self pleased and dissatisfied at the ame time  i am sure says antiphaus i have dealt ith you like the connoisseurs which a traveller often meets with in places here there are the best collections were you left to your self you would njoy a thousand beauties in them but must be plaguing you all the while with inting out the most particular though after all i know only where they stand who they were drawn by and what they represent  but we forget philypsus that we are at present half travelers in earnest we are from home and you see the sun is just setting  no  interrupted philypsus we have half an hour good at least and if you have any thing farther on this head i beg you would favor me with it  as you please says antiphaus  you know e have hitherto been viewing those points in which petry and painting ee there is one method behind ich petry has of impressing its images ecuar to itself  the poet an imitate the colors of the painter but the painter can never imitate the sounds of poetry you may see the hero all in picture but in the poem you see him fail and hear the clang of his arms  yes philypsus there is a natural fitness in sounds every passion has its distinct voice each action its proper turn and every motion a particular sound that may correspond to it  only observe the difference in the sound of these lines it is as sensible a that of the real sounds which they describe compare this couplet of mr pope od      trembling the specter glide and plaintive vent thin hollow screams along the deep descent   with this of the same hand  the string let fly od             twangd short and sharp like the shrill swallows cry   thus we might fluviorum rex eridanus georg       sxosumque sonans hypanis georg     0 or these  fluvio tiberinus amaeno vorticibus rapidis and multa flavus arena in mare prorumpit aen       fragosus dt sonitum saxis and torto vortice torrens ae        compare in reading virgil several descriptions of rivers there we have the full course of the po and the windings of the tiber the georg     0 largeness of benacus the georg      slowness of the mincio the georg    0  murmuring of a brook and the broken aen    0  course of a river encumbered with men and arms in a word every variety of streams that can be conceived all imagd in the various numbers and cadence of his verse  in poetry the bow twangs the arrow od        whizzes through the air and il      the quiver rattles on the shoulder of the warrior even the particular difference of the same sort of actions is to be distinguished in the sound of the verse and the javelin that od      flies impetuous from ulysses languishes in the hand of the suitors this very circumstance as i take it is beautifully described by the translator of vida among several other see pitts vida p  0  and excellent images of the same kind  we do not only meet with a great variety of these significant numbers in the odyssey but are instructed too in the methods of rendering our numbers proper and significant here we are taught how the poet roughens his verse to imitate the subject he is to express thus the note tells us that his description of the sea abounds      with the harshest letter our language affords it is clogged with monosyllables that the concourse of the rough syllable might be more quick and close in the pronunciation and the most open and ounding vowel occur in every word  on the contrary a gentle flowing stream runs as easy and smoothly in the description we then hear see note on od      nothing of those rough consonants instead of them we meet with several liquids and those liquids are softened with a multitude of vowels  what a violent and strong motion does homer give to sisiphuss stone in its fall od l        whence this rapidity and violence in the numbers see note on od        if we observe it we find that there is not one monosyllable in the line and but two dissyllables ten of the syllables are short and not one spondee in it except one that could not be avoided in the close which perhaps too may be of service toward imaging the stopping of its course at last there is no hiatus or gap between word and word no vowels left open to retard the celerity of it and yet though the motion be carried on with such a vehemence one seems to see the bounding of the stone as well as the impetuosity of its descent  i should think though the notes do not mention any thing of it that the translator expresses this double image in the english when he makes the stone od         resulting with a bound thunder impetuous down and smoke along the ground   at least in both we may say of the versification as of the stone it describes ipsa suis viribus ruit   the opposites to these express a slowness and difficulty of motion when a hero strains  some rocks huge weight to throw mr popes art of criticism the line too labors and the words move slow   thus is sisyphus described in the former picture with many a weary step and many a groan od             up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone   never was a translator more just to his original the observation which has been made on the greek these lines answer will hit equally with the sea note on od        english the verses are clogged with long syllables and with vowels open upon one another the very words are heavy and as it were make reistance in the pronunciation  in the same manner virgil and homer describe the labor of the giants when they endeavor to scale heaven ter sunt conati imponere pelio ossam scilicet atque ossae frondosum involvere olympum georg       sec ed ruaei       heaved on olympus tottering ossa stood on ossa pelion nods  od        virgil chiefly by the openness of his vowels homer by the resistance of his syllables and the pauses of his lines and his translator by slow syllables burdened with several elisions close upon one another  the numbers are thus minutely adapted to the motions described by these great masters and we need not wonder if they observe like rules in points of greater concern such are all occasions where they speak the language of the passions or endeavor to touch the soul of the reader either with pleasure or pain  when homer describes any terrible object see note on od       he rejects the more flowing and harmonious vowels and makes choice of such mutes and consonants as load the syllables then long weighty sounds and words of many syllables are proper and often a designed harshness unusual pauses and a broken structure in the verse  but the lyre must be new tuned when the subject is agreeable or delightful the poet then softens every line see note on od       with vowels and the most flowing semivowels he rejects harsh sounds and the collsion of rough words the tone of the verse must be neither serious nor majestic but rather qualified by as great a frequency of short syllables as can well be admitted without rendering the lines weak and effeminate the cadence is soft and gene his words descend like a kind rer shing shower or like the snow that melts in falling  the joyous verification admits of more sprightly notes and a greater mixture exulting in triumph now rise the bold notes mr popes ode on musick of energy and vigor sometimes she rises even to breaks and pauses a see note on od       but they must be always like those in music pauses of delight and the verse muse spring on again when it recovers itself without losing any thing of its exultation and vivacity  unless some as virgil from the glories of rome to the death of marcellus aen   afflicting theme breaks in and turns our thoughts away to dismal scenes where sighs and melancholy reign the muse compassionate speaks all in tears and moves with the same quantos ille virum magnam mavortis ad urbem campus aget gemitus vel quae tiberine videbis funera cum tumulum praeterlabere recentem aen       this delay also fixes the melancholy on ones mind and for the same reason repetition seems to be particularly useful on these subjects  ut vultum vidit morientis and ora ora modis anchisiades pallentia miris ingemuit miserans graviter  aen  0      slow melancholy air  it is scarce to be imagined philypsus how great the powers of sounds are when adapted to the subject and the passion for my part i should think that our very bodies are disposed to receive them that this frame of ours is like an instrument ready tuned and when the proper key is touched our nerves tremble and answer it with a kind of musical sympathy how far this may reach in others i know not but as for my particular make it is strangely susceptible of such impressions after a period set to melancholy i have been surpised to find my eyes full of tears there are some exquisite lines which i can never read without a certain shivering thorough my blood that i cannot express to you i have felt my spirits burn within me upon hearing a point of war well wrote and have been almost ready to start from my seat at the poetical sound of a trumpet  this energy of sounds and the great and various emotions they are capable of raising in our breasts may serve partly to excuse those critics who are very particular in laying down rules as to this part of versification the ancients as well as moderns have left us whole treatises upon it and those who have wrote in a more general way are very diffusive when they come to this part of their subject they speak to every the least circumstance and readers who have never thought over this point would be surpised to find the great cicero very industriously ettling quantities and measuring words fit for such and such a period they would wonder whence he is so peremptory for ambicks on this occasion and on another so great a partizan for tribrachs and dactils  why seriously says philypsus i have often thought him quite tedious on these particulars the orator even the critic seemed to be lost sometimes and nothing but a mere pedant appear in their room i admire the force of numbers continued he as much as any one but when i have been reading the rules at large in the critics i could not help thinking them too minute and trifling if a man must be taken up thus in weighing syllables and ranging of vowels what elegance of language can we expect or what life in his compositions  what you say answered antiphaus is what i believe most men think on this occasion and were a poet always to be studying his rules such an objection would be very powerful but it is with this which is only the mechanism of verse as it is in the mechanism of writing we must learn to draw the figure of the letters and study how to form the particular turn of each before a man can write down a whle sentence by use this knowledge grws familiar we then write by a see quintil instit lib  0 cap   est igitur usus quidam irrationalis etc or mr locks essay lib   cap   sect   and  0 sort of instinct and our pen runs over each letter without our considering distinctly at each which way we shall direct it it is much the same in these arts of versification when we have learned the force of letters and the powers of sound when we know what syllables are proper to express such a motion and what run of verse hits such particular images use makes the mind ready in applying what is proper and the thought is as nimble in suggesting words of a suitable sound as the hand is in motions proper to set down those words on our paper  but it will be hal a life perhaps before the poet can come to this readines  i do not say it is to be acquired immediately answered antiphaus but acquired in some measure it must be by any one who desires to be a true poet in the mean time a man may indulge his vigor he may compose his lines with full spirit and set them to music afterward le a man write with flame if he will but correct at leisure  besides this is not so difficult to be attained as one would imagine the fitness of sounds to things is natural invention itself will go some way in the work and where there is naturally what we call a good ear nature will do the business almost without the help of art i do not speak this in a declamatory way good philypss i imagine fact and experience will go a great way in proving what i say a man who thinks vehemently will speak swiftly and when we are on a grave point our words will of themselves be in a great measure slow and weighty this is yet plainer from the invention of languages how many single words are there in every tongue that have been originally cast in a proper mould and on the first heat carried off the images of things impressed upon them i was saying too that the posture of the mind at the time of composing will assist the turn of the composition and is this more absurd in particular cases than that the temper of a people in general should affect their language in the same manner yet has it been often observed that the dispositions of a people are perceivable in that turn of words they chiefly delight in thus the french tongue is brisk and voluble the germans talk in vast syllables and perpetual consonants english is neither too soft nor too rough though our northerly situation inclines us rather to the latter and as the spaniard is the most haughty of all nations their language is the most grand it prides itself in firm syllables in a frequency of the fullest vowel and the most sonorous terminations of its words  nature certainly forms us within for fit sounds we see every day that even brutes can express their passions by the tone of their voice and is not an intelligent being as well qualified by nature to adapt sounds to his sentient  indeed they are thus adapted already in a multitude of instances our language abounds with such words and n many cases we need only utter our sentiments in the most common expressions to speak with this significance what was it that led the first inventors into this frequency of such words was in art or the natural resemblance and their obviousness upon that account it is in this light we must understand our master critic where he calls nature dion hal  the great original and mistress of propriety in the present point it is she that leads us to imitate things by sound and to express what we conceive by words that are turned according to those strong likenesses which we form in our minds  it is plain the use of words is arbitrary we might if we had a fancy for it call any thing by any name yet there is something from within that has influenced all nations so ar as to lead them to descriptive sounds in their giving names to things and that more frequently than one would readily imagine what nature has done in single words the poet carries on in composition almost all the particular names of sounds themselves for instance are naturally significant in most languages as with us the roaring of waves the whistling of winds etc of such words assisted by a proper structure of quantities and a significant cadence of verse the poet makes an hurricane by land or a storm at sea nature first presided in establishing those proper sounds and still directs in the assemblage of them  hence it is that this point takes such a compass in the doctrine of the critics some of them no doubt carry the matter too far when they would require this natural significance of sounds to be kept up in every thing we write such was vossius it would make you smile to hear some of his fancies he talks as if every language like that of hi favorites the chinese should be nothing but music he would have our very actions all tuned a soldier cannot run the gauntlet but he must be the ancients says he used music in every thing adeo quod ipsae quoque plagae ad  harmnics sontibus igerebantur de

hermogenes is perhaps more trifling though in a graver manner he questions whether this sort of sounds be not preferable to the sentiments in a poem this is to oppose two things that are in the strictest amity and concord these sounds do not like the modern pretend to rival the sense their whole business is to make the sentiments more strongly perceived and more effective on the mind  i have heard it frequently objected to those gentlemen the critics that they find out several beauties of this kind in the works of homer which he never so much as dreamed of in composing em in many cases this may be true and in many the lines may be justly commended and really significant though that particular beauty might not be designed in composing them but those who can persuade themselves that homer never designed any such thing in his writings i should think might soon bring themselves to believe what has been so frequently produced as an instance of absurdity that his poems might be made by chance  the notes of music in a good composition are fitted to the subject and a good copy of verses wrote for music will be fitted for notes i cannot once doubt that the first stanza in mr popes ode for st caecilias day has a designed harmony all thorough it it is just the same case with homers poems they were all made for music and have been all sang to the lyre  as for my part says philypsus i find music enough in them even now without the lyrist neither have i any quarrel with the critics for giving mepleasure and pointing out beauties of this kind whether designed by homer or not but i wonder at one thing while they speak of the defect in this point perpetually i never yet heard them speak of any excess in it it is certain that the greater number of poets err in neglecting the significant turn of their verses but is there no erring too by an affectation of it  i thank you answered antiphaus for putting me in mind of this particular undoubtedly there may be faults on both sides even in the poem before us i imagine this is sometimes carried too far and sometimes used improperly the infirmness of a couplet mentioned on another occasion agrees with the thing described and may perhaps be blameable on that very account  od             his loose head tottering as with wine opprest obliquely drops and nodding knocks his breast terrible images have something

described a poet is to reject as well as to choose it is want of art to set every thing in a strong light and there are many objects which if they must have a place at all require at least to be flung into shades  if this be true there are some few images of this sort which i think are drawn too strongly or too lavishly  od             down dropped he groaning  od            he said chill horrors

odyssey is rather disagreeable than dreadful  swarms of specter rose from deepest hell with bloodless visag and with hideous yell they scream they shriek sad groans and dismal sounds od             stun my scared ears and pierce hells utmost bounds i leave this to your judgment for it is very difficult in these cases to discern the true from the faulty a harshness of sounds is often proper and significant but when and how far is a knot that i will not pretend to untye  i beg leave to repeat a passage from the iliad in which some of the lines may be strained too much under this notion of rendering them significant  first march the heavy mules securely slow over hills over dales over crag over rocks they go jumping high over the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattring cars and

upon one another but this if it be a fault is such an one as in the present state of poetry requires an unusual eminence in the writer to be capable of committing it  it is much more frequent among our poets to neglect the sentiments in their versification to give up the significant structure of words for mere harmony and softness of verse and even to make ue of numbers contrary to the image or passion they are describing though to describe actions of rapidity for instance in slow solemn measures is as absurd as for an actor to scold or rant with the tone and steadiness of a philosopher  we have not time philypsus otherwise i should have ventured on some farther faults of our versification but i must not now run out into complaints on the frequent consonants and frequent elisions multiplied so much in our verses though both ought to be particularly guarded against in a language naturally overladen with them  on the neglect of measure and taking all syllables whether long or short to be of equal time and the lameness and inequality from hence in verses of the same kind  the discord of the emphasis or accent and of the pauses  the repeated cadence and continued likeness of sound i need only mention some other identities of sound as all middle and double rhimes and all that are alike for two couplets together and methinks philypsus as all these likenesses of sound would be given up at the first word unless there be some particular reason for retaining that fashionable jingle at the close of our verses we may even reckon that as bad as the rest i should have said something on this but it is no great matter since it stands condemned over and over by the greatest critics among the modern for my part i will talk no more of it that we may go in humor to our claret
