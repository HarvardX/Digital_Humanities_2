prologue spoken by mr toms this night the muse devotes to days of yore when the fierce dane insulted englands shore she hapless isle in the wild tempest tossed saw all but her inherent courage lost like some stout ship which sinking to her grave surveys what none but british hearts can brave death in a thousand shapes of horror dressed night without stars and billows without rest when some bold voice loud as the roaring sea cries out  all hands the port is in our lea instant they rouse  brace up the swelling sail she rights she lifts she rides before the gale then safe in port the joyous glass goes round and all past sorrows in that glass are drowned so in the night of englands deep despair great alfred issuing from his secret lair rose like a meteor  the glad nation heard his glorious call and this was alfreds word  fight fight or perish in your countrys cause stand for your king your liberties your laws it is alfred leads you on  his heart is true and he for whom your

ancient days and recollect whatever here is shown their cause their courage both are now your own they met the fierce invader at their doors no foes but captive foes invade your shores their wives their daughters filled the air with cries to your kind land the helpless sufferer flies blessed in a king mild merciful and good firm in allegiance to that king they stood when they saw death disease

the sea oswena gothrun oswena why do you follow me i will go no further   goth i am your countryman a vanquished dane   osw speak your necessities is it for food or rest or shelter from pursuit of the victorious foe that you would importune me   goth i need them all yet ask for nothing but your patient hearing   osw speak then and to the point  be brief   goth it suits me so to be for i am spent with toil and sorely bruised in fight under the walls of exeter   osw twas a disastrous day    goth a fatal one for denmark  what thousands fell in battle how many of your wretched countrymen were slaughtered in pursuit or perished in the sea to which they fled were horrible to tell all all is lost  alfred invincible in arms reigns in his peoples hearts for virtue and for valor worthily of force i must confess it surnamed the great   osw if this be all farewell   goth nay lady hear me out   osw have i not heard enough well may our cause be lost when we have lost our courage we have lived in england till we are become fat as the soil and foggy as the climate it is our meanness that makes alfred great there was a dane that made that great one tremble  knew you not hastings   goth i knew him well and honor those who loved him most of all the illustrious oswena    osw hah do you know me   goth i know you for the widow of my chief  a noble gem hid in a barbarous soil   osw why then do you expose me to discovery  who and what are you   goth gothrun the dane  dishonor never yet was coupled to that name   osw no nor defeat till now well may we say alfred is great when he has conquered gothrun   goth he is unassailable by open war all england is his garrison but though we cannot face him in the field we may yet foil him by surprise and stratagem  it is not the warriors process i confess yet when all nobler means are out of reach hope lost his soldiers spirits sunk his conqueror triumphant and his own life at risque nature will rouse him in mere selfdefence to deal the avenging stroke   osw strike then and vindicate your countrys cause  but what can i do living here by sufferance under the watchful eye of the earl oddune whose proud castle overpeers my humble cottage and keeps all around him in terror and subjection   goth you have a son  revenge is his inheritance   osw i have a son  but such a son alas as cannot be inspired with any noble passion least of all with ambition or revenge his mind is like a tuneless instrument unstrung and not to be provoked by any touch even of a masters hand   goth unhappy tidings if the son of hastings and oswena so degenerates what hope is left may i not see your son   osw it were a spectacle to wound the heart of any loyal dane whether his spirit is debased by spells and filtres for rumor speaks of such or that his fathers death has plunged him into grief enervating his faculties i cannot say but all the noble promise of his youth like blossoms scattered by the eastern blight is withered and decayed   goth no more we are observed  some one approaches whose noble carriage ill accords with the mean garb he wears   osw it is my son  it is voltimar himself  oh that a shrine so rich should encase naught but beggary  voltimar enters how now whence come you   volt from the sea i come i have brought fish to feed you i angled for them rarely   osw they were but foolish things to be trepanned by such a witless angler   volt they are alfreds fish land sea and air are alfreds good chance but i am questioned for conspiring the death of alfreds subjects   goth there is matter in that mind although derangd   volt this mans a dane i know it by his locks they are yellow like my fathers his were a shade betwixt the butterflower and marygold but they are paler since his death grisly and pale a sad sad spectacle  there was blood upon his beard when i saw him yesternight as i came home by moonlight from the beach he nodded to me thrice and graciously as he passed on but i was scared and what small wits i have would not stay by me  so he did not speak  was not that pitiful   osw oh that i had been with you   volt oh that you had your senses are entire mine are  alas alas where are they   osw come come be pacified  another night i will go with you to the spot he visits   goth do you believe this vision   osw three several times within these few days past he has repeated the same tale   volt i have i have three times you are right and eight days are gone by i notchd them on my staff i can count ten and there my learning stops   goth this is most mavelous his eye is steady his demeanor grave and though his thoughts are wild yet are they uttered firmly and in language apposite i can discern no outward symptoms of an unfound mind   volt go get you gone why do you peer at me and listen to my talk i am for alfred i you are a naughty dane such are not to be suffered hence away with you   goth would you drive me away being a friend and countryman   volt i keep the seas for alfred i pay him tribute of the spoil i take and when i flesh my hook i do pronounce his name three times for luck and then the silly fry come to the bait religiously and i catch them  oh it is brave sport  i will go again tonight and if i meet my father on the beach so you will watch good mother i will call to you  good bye to you   osw stay voltimar i have a thing to say to you    volt no no no send hence that ugly man he means no good  i will not fight against the king not i  besides the sun is up and then i sleep till he reels home to bed like a hot fleckord reveller as he is the moon the moons my mistress when she is up then i come out and prowl upon the shore to plant my ozier traps under the rocks or fix my baited trimmers in the sand when the ebb leaves it dry   osw have you no feeling for your countrys fate stay and this warrior will describe the battle   volt let him not tell me what i saw myself twelve miles upon the stretch i ran to haldown hill that overlooks the field the roebuck or the heart cannot outstrip me on the level plain i saw the danish host scattered like sheep by sea earth air and fire if i were other than the the thing i am i could have told them where to plant a blow in alfreds battle that had made it reel   goth i would this sword was planted in his heart   volt you are not wise to talk thus to a fool  go go begone mother that yellow dane will be your ruin  trust him not farewell  exit goth i am cast into astonishment and can form no conjecture of his mind whether this spectre has disturbed his reason or that he feigns infanity for purposes concealed and secret is not for me to say but this i boldly will aver his name alone will be a tower of strength and his important presence the sure rallying point for all our scattered powers if by persuasion you can draw him forth   osw gothrun be sure my heart is with your cause and pants for vengeance show me but the form and shape of any hopeful enterprise and voltimar if words of mine can move him shall be yours come then with me  rest and refreshment my poor cottage can still afford there well consult together  exeunt scene changes to kenwith castle belonging to oddune earl of devonshire earl oddune and mollo oddune mollo   mollo my lord   oddune are we provided for tomorrows festival this glorious victory of our king at exeter together with the celebration of our daughters nuptials will demand ample largess for our vassals i am not one that pamper the rich guest and leave the poor unfed   mollo most puissant earl your careful purveyor has spared no pains to make provision for an entertainment worthy the princely giver on a day of so much joy and triumph if kenwith castle does not blaze tomorrow let mollo bear the blame your larders do not own one idle hook your cellars not one empty cask and your slaughterhouses stream with the blood of beeves that makes our rivers tide run purple to the sea   oddune so your execution does but keep pace with your eloquence all will be well have you bespoke the minstrels   mollo they are forewarned noble sir there will be harpers pipers and anticks from all parts with masks and interludes not void of fancy though i say it twill be a glorious wassail   oddune is voltimar amongst them if you have not secured that fool of noble quality the lady adela who listens to his harp with such delight will think your choir imperfect   mollo i have retained the fool and that his memory might take some root i laid him under orders lustily with a good oaken cudgel   oddune hah you did so twas an irreverend cudgel that smote the son of hastings his brave father who kept our royal alfred pent in the neatherds cottage would not have let even your words cudgel his ears unpunished   mollo it is a mere dolt my lord sluggish and only to be taught by blows   oddune spare your instruction then and what his nature will not apprehend with ease forbear to enforce with cruelty when he presents himself as is his daily duty at the castle set him before me  go observe my orders  adela approaches  exit mollo adela enters adela health and a happy morning to my father   oddune bless you my child and may tomorrows fun rise with peculiar luster to bedeck the fairest bride that englands isle can boast   adela ah sir tomorrow did you say tomorrow   oddune can happiness my child come out of time for whom but you my darling and your betrothed the noble alric of northumberberland are we thus busied watching every hour nay every minute such is our impatience till those whom we have stationd in our castles towers give signal of his coming   adela call it a knell that warns me from the arms of a fond fostering parent to receive a husband perhaps a tyrant whom i cannot love   oddune how adela you cannot love a man not less distinguished for a noble nature than for illustrious birth graceful in person courteous in his manners and which confirms his merit high in the favor of our virtuous king   adela i would the king had favored him so highly as to have raised his thoughts to loftier objects than the poor humble adela   oddune what would you mean by those cold freezing terms when my heart glows with joy why do you chill it am i not pledged to alric are not you have you forgot the sacred sense of honor do you not reverence truth and me your father do you not love me adela   adela oh with the truest heart i reverence you love you and obey  only in this let me not offend my father  if whilst i submit i tremble   mollo enters mollo my lord the foolish voltimar is come   adela better be foolish mollo than unmerciful i hear sad tales of you is it a manly act to strike a harmless unresisting creature   oddune i have reproved him for it   adela i thank you sir it well becomes a hero   oddune go tell the dane that we would see see him here  tell it respectfully as to the son of one who awed this island at whose frown you would have cowerd into the dust with terror  and recollect that when you call him foolish you give yourself the worst of titles for to strike a fool like insult to a woman what is it but to stamp yourself a coward  exit mollo adela i thank you from my soul   oddune well well you have an interest in that soul sad though you have made it i will be a friend to this poor youth for your sake none shall hurt him when you are far away and he has lost his gentle patroness   adela oh that is kind indeed most kind and charitable he will have need of comfort   voltimar appears ushered in by mollo who bows and retires oddune now voltimar what news   volt good news great sir your steward is grown courteous and forbears to scoff and strike me  save you sweet rose the dew of heaven fall on you   oddune love you our gentle daughter my good fellow   volt i would most noble sir did i know what love is if it resembles weeping i do that when she looks sad and sorrowful as now   adela nay voltimar i am not sad except to hear that mollo is so harsh   volt pray be not sad for me hereafter i will laugh when mollo beats me as i did once to see a scurvy ass kick at the thunder the thunder did not heed the foolish insult for twas an ass that kicked and the clouds were too high to be injured by his heels   oddune talk thus and you shall no more be called the foolish voltimar but voltimar the philosopher   volt if i outlive tomorrow i shall merit it aside   oddune what say you of tomorrow speak out i heard it not   volt i say tomorrow will be one day more than i have yet outlived   oddune aye and the happiest you have seen well hope therefore array yourself in your best trim and screw your harp up to its sprightliest pitch for we shall need your minstrelsy   volt my harp and i have quarreled and are parted   oddune what do you mean explain yourself   volt there came your servant mollo high in glee and warned me to attend the wedding day of this your beauteous daughter with earl alric  i was to harp forsooth in his northumbrian ears  this summons did not please me  was i earl alrics harper i demanded  at this your servant grew in wrath and with his staff smote me upon the head   adela impudent varlet he deserves the death   volt the sun was then just glittering over the waves and i was sitting on the seabeat rock greeting his rising beams with such poor minstrelsy and humble oraisons as my small art could furnish stunned with the stroke and somewhat angry to be so saluted i took my harp and in a thoughtless moment dashed it from off the rock with all my might into the waste of waters  the tuneful victim gave one dying groan and burst asunder never again will it discourse sweet music the ebbing tide wafted the shivered fragments out of sight   oddune twas a rash act and had you not defect of reason for your plea you should be chidden for it  but well provide you with another harp   volt i cannot play my soul is out of tune if i should touch the string it would not speak   adela urge him no further let his humor pass   oddune we do not yield to such a stubborn humor let come what will he shall perform tomorrow   volt i cannot harp to alric and i will not   oddune what not if adela requires it of you   volt she is too merciful she will not require it   oddune but what if i command it   volt oh then i will play most lustily to alric as i did once at bamflete fight the tune has slipped me but his better recollection will bring it to my mind   oddune what do you mean was you in bamflete fight   volt i think i was but i know nothing rightly i am a fool with a most witty memory all things fall from it  even my own miseries  he retires to the back scene adela sure you forget his father fell at bamflete lo how he is rapt   oddune shame on me i forgot it  true most true twas there the mighty hastings fell i was not in the battle i am sorry at my heart to have disturbed him i see the filial feelings are alive weak as his reason is go go and comfort him   adela oh that i could  going but stops short bugle sounds   oddune hark what is that the warden on the tower gives the alarm by all my hopes lord alric is arrived   volt hah alric    adela peace are you mad thus to betray yourself   volt down down my heart   one of earl oddunes men enters oddune speak is the earl arrived   serve my lord it is a courier from the king   oddune hah say thou what does his dispatch import   serve alfred the great having dispersed his foes and raised the siege of exeter has put his army into march and purposes this night to be your lordships guest at kenwith castle   oddune alfred my guest  his kingly purpose is most kind and gracious  now adela your king who is his peoples father will be yours and join your hand to alrics  i will forth and welcome these glad tidings exit attended   voltimar and adela volt so this concludes my destiny  alric is fortunes minion i a poor beaten slave   adela think what i suffer agonize me not with your complainings  above all things voltimar i do conjure you by the love you bear me do not alarm my father words cannot describe what terrors i endured whilst you spoke so unguarded   volt who can be calm at such a moment to you alone the secret is confided that i have feigned this folly i need not feign henceforth  when you are alrics bride i shall be natures scorn that wretched thing whose reason grief has wrecked   adela how terrible is that thought the bride of alric  no my heart revolts how can my father so approve and favor that cold obscure impenetrable man whose mind is black as night his thoughts perplexed and absent and whose conscience seems ever to upbraid him whilst he professes what he does not feel   volt i know lord alric but for my weak nature this fate had never befallen you  when my brave father drew his battle forth at bamflete trenches i fought beside him where it was my chance to encounter this same alric and unhorse him i had him then at my swords point defenseless prostrate  pity smote my heart his youth his cries his wounded helpless state pleaded for life i checked the mortal stroke and for that act of mercy am repaid with misery worse than death  and does your father think that i play the antic and pipe to my own prisoner  will i will perish first   adela it shall not be required  oh voltimar if you could see my heart    volt i should behold the victim of obedience i should then see the very shrine of virtue witness the struggles of a pure affection oppressed and thwarted by paternal power i should contemplate all that can inspire me with love and animate me with courage to brave all dangers even death itself rather than tamely yield you to lord alric   adela ah voltimar i fear my doom is sealed lord alrics high nobility    volt the worms had fed on his nobility but for my mercy    adela my fathers will  the kings authority    volt is your fathers will irrevocable is not your king compassionate in short is any thing impossible to love ardent as mine and a soul resolute to attempt your rescue   adela you terrify me what do you intend   volt when hastings lived alfred though now surnamed the great was but the second man in england  the son of hastings vanquished and a prisoner depressed by fortune and reduced to assume a counterfeited weakness is not so degenerate as to submit tamely without a struggle to a rival in arms less than his equal in nobility not greater   adela break off we are observed   a servant enters serve lady the earl demands your instant presence   adela the earl shall be obeyed  i will but drop a word with this poor ignorant and follow you   exit servant hear me and make no answer or speak softly you know my window in the eastern tower underneath which you have so often harpd  be there at eveningfall in the still hour  i read your answer in your eyes  be cautious not a word more  well if it must be so there is my hand  now be content release me  farewell  exit voltimar end of act i act ii an apartment in the house of oswena oswena and lothaire oswena come hither lothaire i have a word in secret for you  you loved your noble master and you will be faithful to his sad widow though times are changed and you no longer are the fine gay page that followed the lord hastings when he held his court in splendour and gave law to england   loath i have been faithful ever and i will be   osw that is my good lad  now mark me  here are danes scattered about the relics of the fight at exeter who would do noble service if we could persuade my son to be amongst them i have urged him to it every means i have tried to stir his stagnant spirit a cause methinks like ours might move the very stones to rise and cry for vengeance   loath he fought courageously at bamflete trenches   osw and sometimes i incline to hope courage so natural to him will awake from sleep and reassume its energy i noted his emotions as i talked and though he answered not his eyes shot fire his color came and went and i do think the senses that should quicken him afresh were in commotion  you can do much lothaire for you are in his heart me he regards with caution and reserve   loath ah madam if i have any interest in his heart it is simply that of pity and benevolence on matters of such moment as you hint at i dare not move him for since this malady has hung upon him he will not suffer me to speak of denmark nay hardly will endure a dane to approach him   osw it is true and sometimes i suspect he feigns this humor only to avoid their importunities   loath i cannot tell but certain it is he has kept all quiet in these purlieus where none will stir but at his bidding with me although he passes many hours he talks but little fishing is his sport watching his baits by night upon the beach a pensive occupation sometimes indeed he touches his harp and then i sing to him   osw could you not introduce the madrigal i late gave you which touches on his malady   loath i am prepared with it and only wait his call to sing it to him  and see he comes   osw i will leave you  oh lothaire rouse him redeem him save him if you can  exit voltimar and lothaire loath bless you my gentle master   volt bless you bless you   loath i am proud to see you in your best attire   volt it is a proud day lothaire kings are abroad the sun himself is in his best attire and so am i   loath it well becomes you you now show as the son of hastings should   volt the son of hastings should be what he is not he should be braver than to take a blow from a base menial groom nobler than to beat the strings of a poor trembling harp to pleasure the proud ears of young northumberland  i harp to him his heart strings shall make music with my sword or ere i will harp to him mark me lothaire my folly is not constant   loath would heaven that it were passed and gone for ever   volt madmen have intervals of sober reason fools have the gleamings of a mind at times now if you say this to my mother lothaire you are no friend of mine  for she is mad without the loss of reason  answer me this  what is the best device to remedy a sick mind   loath i know no other remedy but patience   volt you might as well say to the bedridden wretch  rise and be well at once you have forgot your lesson twas not this that my revengeful mother bade you say  she would prescribe rebellion blood and plunder those are her danish drugs but i will not taste them  give me the softening the assuaging powers music and meditation   loath shall i fetch your harp   volt not for the world i love you much too well to send you on that errand my harp is wrecked at sea  but i will sit down and you shall sing to me   loath i have a song the words are new the strain familiar and by your favorite minstrel old llewellyn i caught it from your harp   volt it is well his plaintive melody delights me most   loath you may suppose it addressed to some warrior who being lost to his country and buried in profound melancholy the poet strives to rouse him by the following strain where is that towering spirit fled which zeal heroic fired is that creative genius dead which every muse inspired is it in griefs oerwhelming tide that ardent fire was lost or have those senses turned aside in love severely crossed come then sweet sounds for you alone can bid the tumult cease restore his reason to its throne his bosom to its peace the turbid passions shall retire before the minstrels art and the same hand that sweeps the lyre shall heal the stricken heart    volt enough lothaire if this will not exercise the foul spirit it is because he has no ear for melody  and now retire you have done your part and whether i redeem my mind which you think lost or perish in my folly you are clear in your allegiance and the everfaithful servant of the noble hastings has proved himself the zealous friend of his ignoble son leave me without more words  i have some thoughts abroad which i would fain call home   loath i will not disturb your thoughts  farewell  exit lothaire voltimar alone oh england generous but hostile country how would thou tremble did thou know this arm could make thee kingless ere tomorrow i have the death of hastings at my heart  but i will not strike so deep revenge so terrible i will not take  rest rest poor land denmark has drank too largely of thy blood  spirit of my illustrious father if thou it is that visitest me nightly foster these meditations    oswena and gothrun enter osw lo where he sits let us pursue our talk without regarding him  if alfreds armies are so far advanced he leaves the country betwixt them and exeter open to an attack   volt aye aye more blood  she lives upon the scent aside   osw what force could you collect on an emergency and where is it disposed   goth of those who survived the slaughter a remnant saved themselves on board the ships then hovering on the coast these are entire and though our thousands are diminished to hundreds yet i could disembark a force sufficient for any sudden enterprise if such presented itself if not i shall go off to them and sail for denmark   volt sail then and leave this island to its peace  he rises and comes forward osw peace to your folly mean degenerate dane   volt who talks of folly if i have assumed this weakness thinking it less shame to seem the fool of nature than be the slave of man it is because i have a spirit indignant of subjection and you who think me mean and degenerate are in an error   osw convict me of that error and stand forth for denmark   volt away i have a better cause than to lay waste with fire and sword defenseless villages  accursed warfare worthy only of savages not soldiers   goth give us to know your cause and well support it   volt gothrun you thirst for blood so do not i  you said when last we met you wished your sword was buried in the heart of alfred had i met alfred fairly in the fight where he dealt slaughter round him i would have proved the temper of my sword upon his mailed corslet but had i struck him down as i did alric of northumberland i would have scorned to stab a fallen foe and when his valor was no longer terrible i would have reverenced his virtues and have spared him   osw remember we are prisoners of earl oddune and chains how light soever they may be are still inglorious  remember too that the lost standard of your country the magic raefen the proudest trophy england has to boast floats in earl oddunes hall   volt enough remember on your part that meekness is the womans grace and to abide ill fortune patiently a conduct more becoming of your sex than to resent it proudly fare you well  exit voltimar gothrun and oswena osw i am wrapped in wonder how his spirit towers how awful and how stern   goth let us not quit him but follow and endeavor to obtain some insight into his mysterious purposes   osw it is well advised proceed  exeunt a hall in kenwith castle the warders and servants of the earl ranged for the reeeption of the king the danish standard of the raven is displayed earl oddune enters hastily oddune throw wide my gates or cast them from their hinges turn out my warders in their best attire and let my castle towers if it were possible bow down their heads in honor of our guest sound trumpets and salute the sovereign the savior of his country hah fall back give large and ample room show yourselves courtly to our noble visitors flourish  alfred preceded by his lords and courtiers appears through the gate brave sibald and brave egbert welcome welcome redwald and kenulph swithun and my honored kinsman roger de malvern  and oh sight of joy the head and heart of england  my king my father kneels   alfred rather say your son for it was you that nursed my infant hopes and taught me how to conquer  rise stand up my heart bounds to embrace you   oddune each drop of blood that flows from it is alfreds   alfred we know your love and rate it at a price not less in value than the crown we wear you was our great forerunner you first trackd the road to victory and we have traced your steps at humble distances if our memory needed a prompter we have but to cast our eyes upon that ensign of your victory and mend our recollection but our thoughts are faithful to your services and by the rights of hospitality which i now claim of you as my much honored host i call upon you to demand a boon and may that banner fall upon my head if i refuse it   oddune my gracious liege it is at my lips already   alfred speak and it is granted   oddune sire that you will honor with your royal presence my daughters nuptials   alfred which of our nobles does the lady adela make choice of to promote to this felicity   oddune one whom i looked to have found attending on your highness earl alric of northumberland   sibald heaven give me patience did you say lord alric   oddune aye sibald is he not a worthy lord   alfred our kingdom boasts none worthier  you brave sibald of all whom i have heard are warmest in your praises of his courage honor and accomplishments for you are alrics nearest and most ardent friend and much it glads me when my friends and nobles ltve in such love and concord with each other   oddune let me then ask under favor of your highness this noble lord why when i named earl alric for my daughter he started and gave signs of such astonishment   sibald i know my king is just and i might speak without offending him what truth and honor warrant though my charge glanced upon his heart even in the tenderest point but it is not my custom to appeal till i stand face to face before my judge with him who wrongs me till then i humbly pray our joys may not be damped by any inference drawn from my incautious words   alfred let it be so though i must own i am touched even to the quick to think that any cause of difference should arise betwixt two gallant heroes whom i have ever held not less incapable of doing wrong than i myself of screening the offender but well not show so little courtesy to our kind host as to give way to sorrow till it meets us  come my good lord you must not think to keep your castles richest treasure out of sight if lady adela will condescend to admit us as we are in the rough trim of soldiers on their march we shall be proud to pay our homage as her faithful knight   oddune not so my liege but with lord sibalds leave her gracious sponsor   alfred ah sibald sibald but let that grief sleep  that we may touch upon no string that jars well visit her alone  lead i will follow you  exeunt alfred and oddune sibald egbert redwald swithun and roger de malvern egbert the king is vexed   sibald i am sorry at my soul   redwald i know not when i have seen him so much moved   roger de m lord oddune too can scarce restrain himself   sibald roger de malvern you have known me long so have you all and if i am no common talker to let fly my words at random without forecast am not noted for one that vouches rashly and after shrinks from what he has so vouched i will believe you will credit me for making good whatever i have hinted or deposed in hearing of my sovereign and yourselves till then though i cannot recall the words improvidently wrested from me by surprise i can at least refrain from adding to a fault which i repent of   roger de m spoken like yourself and we with the same candor will not prejudge you or your cause the king who loves his friend as we all know and no friend more deservedly than yourself is yet so pure so equal in his high seat of justice that no appellant has been heard to say why did he this   swithan the nation with one voice will testify to this   roger de m long may he live and reign honored obeyed and loved and mark my words young lords  i am old enough to be a prophet were i as wise withal  the character of alfred has not yet attained to half that luster which in future times if heaven preserves his life it will diffuse through the admiring world victorious as he is and great in warlike qualities the powers and energies of his capacious mind are but obscurely seen till peace shall give his meditations scope for action and display then he will shine and you who may expect to see those glorious days will call when i am dead these words to mind and say  malvern predicted rightly   sibald no my good lord we rather hope you will live to witness the fulfillment of these auspicious words  then well record them joyfully together   roger de m and i shall die content   egbert die when you may your memory will be honored to all time  now let us seek the king and tender him our duty  come my lords  exeunt scene changes to adelas apartment in the castle adela alfred is now arrived and i must face or fly the doom that threatens me unhappy adela sealed down to misery if once the fatal word shall pass my lips in presence of the king what shall i do to whom shall i resort is not the father of his people just tender of heart and pitiful to those who kneel to him for mercy  i will kneel  hark he approaches  benignant heaven support me   alfred preceded by earl oddune oddune daughter behold your king kneel now to him for whom so often you have knelt to heaven she offers to kneel   alfred not so fair excellence  saints kneel not to sinners and kings themselves will bend the knee to beauty   adela my humble duty waits upon your highness   alfred my love on you  winged with a thousand wishes that heaven may prosper what it has adorned and beautified so highly  i am now your guest fair adela and if my hopes deceive me not shall be in nearer trust with you tomorrow i have requested therefore of your father admission to you private and alone   oddune my liege i have thrown my treasure at your feet and now resign it to you  exit oddune alfred pray be composed you tremble gentle maid   adela i have cause dread sir it is an awful thing to be in presence of him whom more than all the world i honor and revere   alfred it is more awful to approach the altar with a backsliding heart  let me know therefore if with free consent and hearty approbation you espouse lord alric of northumberland   adela it is my duty to obey my father   alfred i am to be your father in that office and how far i am warranted in conscience to execute that office will depend on your reply   adela my heart is full  oh that i had dared to speak    alfred speak i conjure you i am all attention   adela you are all goodness sir the power that heaven has put into your hands you as heavens almoner dispense so bounteously that misery flies to you as to a friend and every child of sorrow owns you for its father i have ventured to lift up my eyes toward yours and i have there discovered beams of such mild benevolence that i perceive where you are present fear cannot inhabit even in my womans heart   alfred if purity and truth could fear my presence i were a tyrant which i trust i am not  therefore proceed   adela i am in love and duty so fast bound to obey my fathers will and yet so adverse to this marriage that i have nothing in my choice but choice of misery   alfred adverse to marriage and yet on the very eve how is this adela do you see good cause to marry alric and no cause to love him   adela twould be redemption for me if i could   alfred have you discovered aught that contradicts what fame reports of him  he may have faults errors of temper but integrity and honor are his own   adela it is the test of merit to be praised by him whose praise resounds throughout the world  glory enough for alric and good cause why i should honor him whom alfred favors but judge me royal sir am i in fault if nature which has given him grace to merit these high honors has not endowed me with a heart to love him   alfred what shall i say it is not in my hand those springs are placed that guide the will and govern the affections forewarned as i now am i will not approach the altar there to make a lying deposition and affront the majesty of heaven no adela that is past but when you know how ardently your father patronizes alrics suit i must believe a heart so dutiful as yours would not oppose his wishes nor reject a choice so worthy were it not bestowed upon some happier lover   adela ah gracious sir my heart is in your sight i dare not stand before you and prevaricate   alfred and wherefore should you for if i conjecture rightly you have placed your choice on one whose virtues valor and illustrious birth rank with the first in england though hard misfortune has fallen heavy on him   adela how glorious is such praise from alfreds lips how godlike such benevolence i do perceive you have discovered him   alfred i saw the secret workings of his heart his horror and surprise when your father announcd your nuptials for tomorrow   adela my father  did my father see all this   alfred assuredly he did   adela oh heaven and earth then we are both undone if voltimar has thus betrayed himself   alfred how say you  voltimar  i speak not of him   adela sir  not of voltimar   alfred i speak of sibald  voltimars a dane the son of hastings  can you love a dane   adela he is a dane but noble brave and virtuous he is the son of hastings but merciful to alfreds friends as alfred is to him the very air that alric breathes is voltimars at bamflete fight he struck him from his horse and when he might have speard him to the earth even in the heat and madness of the battle in pity he forbore and gave him life is not such mercy lovely   alfred it is enviably noble it is heroic   adela i knew to whom it was that i appealed   alfred i have heard lord alric speak of this generous action in terms of rapturous gratitude and i trust it never shall be said of my countrymen that they suppress the good deeds of an enemy and only publish evil ones and now fair adela thanks for your candor what you have imparted to me i shall commit to my most serious thoughts and in all honorable measures serve you   adela ah sir i stand in wonder at your goodness and blush to think that any thought of me should occupy a mind where a whole nations interests are reposed  but pity ever marks the heros character   alfred i shall confer with voltimar  farewell  exit exit   adela alone confer with voltimar  hark what is this  he strikes upon the harp it is his signal calling me to the window  oh well timed blessed occasion i can now prepare him for his interview with alfred allay his fears his jealousies of alric and by the sympathy of souls transfuse into his breast the hope that springs in mine  again he summons me  i come i come   end of act ii act iii the castle adela speaks from the window adela hush hush not a word more  i hear my fathers voice  away away  shuts the casement oddune enters oddune i left you to your conference with the king tell me what passed   adela alfred is ever gracious   oddune that is granted and as such that you have confided to him your whole heart i can well believe he is now gone forth alone to meet lord alric else i had heard from him what would have made my question needless   adela you have been ever good to me and so tender that you have even treated my faults with gentleness therefore it is i am the more afraid to offend you   oddune nay no evasion i need not to be told your heart is not accordant to my wishes in plainer words you do not love lord alric   adela if i may judge of him he has as little wish to gain my heart as i have will to give it him  sullen obscure and with himself displeased he took no pains to recommend his suit but coldly told me you had given consent and hoped i would confirm it to this i made no answer nor did he urge me to it but taking my silence for his acquittal from an irksome penance bowed and departed   oddune truth to confess his manners have not pleased me there seems to be something upon his mind that presses and dispirits him time must reveal it  of this be sure i shall not be less forward to resent contempt than you are quick to feel it   adela upon my knees i thank you  oh my father honored revered and loved save your poor child from misery and destruction   oddune be patient rise  there needs not all this vehemence of prayer to melt a heart that is not made of marble i am not one of those obdurate fathers to stop my ears against the cries of nature  was you this instant with the king did you confess yourself to him averse to this impending marriage and in like fervent terms   adela i did confess and he with a benignity for which may heaven crown him with blessings heard and approved my prayer   oddune hah did he so what said he   adela the words indeed of alfred may be repeated the grace that marks all that he says or does who can describe i pray you let my humble plea approach you not through my lips but alfreds   oddune it shall be so you have appealed to alfred let alfred judge betwixt us  retire to peace   adela kind heaven reward and bless you for this goodness  exeunt severally a grove withoutside the castle alfred and alric alfred here we are private and now my lord of northumberland by the right i have in you as your king and friend i call on you to make answer to a few plain questions which concern not only your own honor but mine also   alric sir if i were as clear in conscience toward all others as i am true and faithful to your highness i should not fear the closest scrutiny   alfred fear nothing only give me up your heart   alric it is at my lips command and it shall forth   alfred how is it you have suffered me to be informed by any other than yourself of your engagement with the lady adela is it fitting that you should have so great a happiness in contemplation and i your friend not know of it   alric i cannot answer you but on my knees implore you to dismiss me as one no longer worthy to approach you   alfred stand up i will not hear you in that posture   alric ah my too gracious master though you can pity errors you cannot pardon crimes i am undone for ever in your thoughts and have so deeply wronged the earl of devonshire that all the atonement i can tender him is to lay bare my bosom to his sword and meet the death i merit alas dread sir when i forbore to speak to you of what you term my happiness it was because i trembled to reveal my shame i must not can not wed the lady adela   alfred you cannot why does that impediment spring from yourself or her   alric from myself solely for i deserved the cold reception she gave me   alfred how then are you dishonored with the earl if finding her repugnant to your suit you modestly withdraw it   alric because to my eternal shame i own it i made proposals for earl oddunes daughter when i was bound by solemn word and promise to another   alfred my lord my lord what plea have you to make for such duplicity   alric none royal sir but that i am unhappy in a nature which loving ardently resents too quickly in one of these rash moments on a suspected slight when my fond heart twixt love and jealousy was rent asunder almost bereft of reason and hurried on by an impetuous passion i took the desperate measure that has plunged me in this disgraceful business with earl oddune   alfred and not with him alone but with the lady whose appeal will bear so hard against you and whom yet you have not named   alric there i am doubly guilty for that lady is graced with loveliness so charming joined to a nature so ingenuous that nothing less than folly blind as mine could have mistaken it  born of a noble house illustrious for its loyalty whose branches death has severed without mercy the lady bertha    sibald enters hastily sibald has yet a brother living who will not suffer insult and perjury to escape his vengeance my sovereign lord i kneel to you for justice   alfred rise sibald and if we cut short your accusation it is because the justice of your appeal is known already and the lord alric by his own confession stands selfcondemned   sibald my wrongs dread sir cannot be put aside by an extorted penitence i once accounted this unworthy lord my honored valued friend he has betrayed me you have a heart my liege alive to all the feelings of a man you know the stabs that a false friend can give and by your own sensations will allow for mine   alfred not to the passions sibald but to justice make your appeal  proceed   sibald my name great sir will not be found less frequent or less honored in our annals than that of alric my house can boast as many trophies of a warlike ancestry a nobler father and three gallant brothers have died in arms for alfred and their country the danish sword has gashd our line so deeply that nothing now remains to me but one dear sister pure as the air she breathes and without spot save that of loving this false faithless man who has abandoned her for earl oddunes daughter for which act here in your royal presence i brand him for a traitor to his oath a perjured traitor and demand the lists   alfred a dreadful reference you make lord sibald and put your cause to an uncertain issue but if when justice tenders you her sword you still prefer your own what you will do you must i cannot stay you   alric nor shall i shun the lists if he demands them but i must execrate those bloody laws that subject me on the same day which wedded me to bertha to the dire chance of being found the murderer of her brother   sibald wedded to bertha speak that word again   alric yes sibald i have asked and obtained pardon of your injured sister she has sealed it with her hand before the altar and let my sovereign say if i who have not yet atoned to the father of adela am warranted to take up the gage from the brother of bertha   alfred i do forbid the lists  sibald i know you well no english bosom wears a braver heart as well i know lord alric and esteem him worthy no less praise yet herein i commend him not that he should suffer a mere lovers quarrel to spread into such mischief   sibald oh my revered and ever gracious lord permit me first to embrace him as a brother and after cast myself at your feet and supplicate your influence with earl oddune to mediate for his pardon   alfred rise sibald to this task i willingly accord for much twould wound my heart if when your swords are wanted to repel the invaders of your country feuds and dissentions betwixt friend and friend should turn them on each other  follow me to the castle alric will keep his station here without till we return  exeunt alric who would not die for such a generous master faultless himself he is all candor to the faults of others and lives amongst us like a descended angel sent to reform our errors by the example of his own perfections   voltimar enters to alric volt hah by my hopes lord alric  do you know me   alric do i know voltimar  my conqueror my preserver come to my arms   volt forbear there is a spirit within me sunk though i am in misery and despair that will not suffer you though now a conqueror in your turn and towering far above the wretched son of hastings to take this base advantage of your fortune and drag a trembling victim to the altar only to riot in the tears of beauty and throw your chains upon a heart that never can be yours   alric pause from your rage and say in plainer terms on whose behalf it is that you accuse me   volt i do accuse you of unmanly conduct  accuse you on the part of the lady adela   alric my conscience does that office without the aid of other advocates to plead against me   volt draw then and answer one whom nothing less definitive than death can satisfy or silence   alric she has a father him i now expect he has the prior claim upon my sword   volt what do you tell me of a fathers claim i love her to distraction he destroys her therefore no more it is a poor evasion to talk of prior claims to one who boasts possession of her heart defend yourself   alric i will but first explain our cause of quarrel   volt away you trifle with the time what more can you desire  you are armed accoutred practiced in the combat and flusht with conquest  i a vanquished prisoner a

with adela   alric i will not wed with adela i cannot    volt go on   alric i am the husband of lord sibalds sister  a broken faith i have to answer for  but that is oddunes quarrel  if you are oddunes champion so deputed lo i draw forth my sword  set to and spare not   volt return your sword into its case again till oddune calls it forth i have no cause to murmur at your choice though much to wonder at it   alric had i no other duty for my sword than to defend the justice of my choice i were most happy  but the time approaches when i expect earl oddune and the king that is an interview
