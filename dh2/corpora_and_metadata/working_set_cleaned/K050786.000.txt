servants  by mr philips  london printed for b lintot between the temp gates in fleet street mdccxxii  to the right honorable the countess cowper while my lord cowpers thoughts are intent as they have been many years on the good of his country i know your ladyship delights in reading as often as the care of your family and the ceremonies of life allow you leisure for an amusement too elegant to become fashionable the two young ladies likewise emulating the accomplishments of their mother are sensible of the advantages arising from the early use of books which give such a bloom to the mind as the prime of beauty discloses in the features had i therefore been able to make this tragedy which i humbly request may appear under your ladyships protection as complete as it is innocent it might have proved a lasting testimony of my sincerest acknowledgments for such obligations as i can never forget nor disown  i have had the honor though i live concealed in the utmost privacy of life long to enjoy your ladyships favor if you are pleased to pardon this public declaration of my gratitude what has been the secret boast of my heart will henceforward turn to my greatest reputation  i am with the greatest respect madam your ladyships most obliged most humble and most obedient servant ambr philips  prologue spoken by mr wilks virtues and vices are to realms confined and climates give a tincture to the mind still this or that peculiar inclination remains unaltered  and denotes a nation thus rivers flow thus mountains ever stand the marks through every age of every land britons you will see when vanoc comes before ye the love of freedom is your ancient glory the romans first this native virtue broke made us polite  and bowed us to the yoke the saxons then unpolished  greatly rude strangers to luxury  and servitude revived the british manliness of soul that spurns at tyranny nor brooks control in time another set of romans came and brought worse slavery  though they changed the name tamed us with luxuries of a different kind and made plain truth distasteful to the mind by nassaws aid at last we drive them hence and once again return to common sense in britain ever may it keep possession established by the protestant succession blessed in a prince whose hightraced lineage springs from the famed race of our old saxon kings our zeal for liberty we safely own  he makes it the firm basis of his throne remember then the dangers you have past  and let your earliest virtue  be your last epilogue spoken by mrs younger what tragic bustle in this british play  but  i am told it is writ the ancient way nay  that it is not modern is plain fact  there is not one simile  to close an act but let me see  what other art is wanting  in tragedy there ought to be some ranting something so exquisite  so very good  it cannot possibly be understood but gwendolens hard fate i censure most  the blooming princess  fair  as any toast captive to valens yvors promised bride between two bashful knights  a virgin died three hours unblest  with an italian passed no warbling lover could have been more chaste  our keener sportsmen would have seized the quarry  but thus it is  when men design  to marry still harder fate  if druidsongs be true she must  for ever  her first flame renew such monstrous constancy let heathen schools injoin  we christian maids are no such fools one month  at most  we can a husband bear  there is not two honeymoons in any year then what a brute is vanoc  what a pother  how could she help it if  she loved another poor cartismand  there is not a man  now living but would have seemed at least far more forgiving what  not connive at one  or two  or three  well  britain never till of late was free how would his british blood be set a madding had he in masquerades beheld her gadding but why does vellocad not once appear he was a pretty fellow  you may swear and what though vanoc says he could not fight is that the way to do a lady right since those rude times husbands are more discreet and know their cue to wink at  what is meet then take us as we are  it is no great matter  for women will be frail while men can flatter the persons

your arrival to this distant isle how bid you welcome to these shattered legions  did scarce had i escaped the perils of the deep thrown by a tempest on the rocky coast ere the unwelcome news of your defeat had reached my ears  but valens bear a heart remember still the roman virtue scorns a cheap renown a triumph without toil  val such easy purchase here you shall not find the brave ostorius our late general in war experienced to fatigues inured impaired by wounds and the slow waste of years despairing to subdue these hardy britons died with his laurels blasted on his brow  did no sooner was his death to rome conveyed than i petitioned to command in britain claudius approved my zeal and bade me speed to tame barbarians and assert his empire  val may jove the guardian of the capitol he the great stayer of our troops in rout fulfill your hopes and animate the cohorts  did at rome indeed the britons are allowed to dare in war  perhaps even more than romans and caradoc their captive chief was praised as a rough warrior of undaunted boldness  val oh didius had you proved their martial rage the desperate fury of their wild assault  not scythians not fierce dacians onward rush with half the speed  nor half so swift retreat in chariots fangd with scythes they scour the field drive through our wedged batalions with a whirl and strew a dreadful harvest on the plain  did but conduct overcomes the forward foe and fabius under disappointments patient taught romans first to conquer by delay  now to the business valens  since from you as foremost tribune of the soldiers here do i your general expect my knowledge instruct me whence this uproar through the land and wherefore vanoc the sworn friend to rome for so our emperor esteemed this prince why he should spurn against our rule and stir the tributary provinces to war val you must have heard of cartismand   did you mean the wealthy queen  our powerful allie who gave up caradoc  val a female warrior queen of the brigantians  her did vanoc prince of the cornavians wed  a contract more in ambition founded than in love while this alliance held we stood secure but cartismand missled by fond desire provokes a husband jealous of his honor unable longer to conceal her flame and fearing vengeance gathering to a storm she crowns her lover takes him to her bed by solemn nuptials and defying vanoc attempts by war to vindicate her choice  did but how are we concerned in this debate this private jar  val i hasten to the point one battle  yes  a skirmish more there was with adverse fortune fought by cartismand her subjects most revolt  distressed pursued she begs protection from the roman arms and vows perpetual homage for the service ostorius interposed  no terms of peace would satisfy the conqueror  then we to balance vanocs power receive the queen and aid her to sustain unequal war  did and can we not entreat this angry prince  val oh that you might  yet old ostorius failed  did by promises suspend his rage a while  val what offers would he not reject from romans did you but know him  i have known him long you would not wish to count this man a foe  in friendship and in hatred obstinate provoked with ease as hard to reconcile in justice rigid in resentment warm punctual alike to punish or reward a wilful hasty  but a gallant briton  did such hannibal appeared  yet hannibal was overthrown  impatient hannibal but tribune who approaches our pavilion  behold a glare of light shines through the dusk this way it moves  val the british queen   did our part it was in courtesy to be the foremost the best amends will be that i receive this interview in private  valens anon we must have farther talk  scene ii didius cartismand did madam i blush that you should thus anticipate my purpose  cart alas a woman overborn by wrongs a queen reduced to supplicate relief lays all the pride of majesty aside humbles her thoughts and stoops to her condition  did but greatness in distress claims most respect an awful pity in a roman breast  cart if royal lineage if distinguished blood down from an ancient race of potent kings now treasured in my veins  now boiling high with injuries  with outrages  that burn that set the very suffering soul on fire  oh general  excuse this burst of tears  did princess assuage this vehemence of anguish  i come ambitious to support your cause  cart my cause  it is the cause of rome  should that unforgiving vanoc once prevail vanoc the roman name is lost  this bold attempt shakes the foundations of your masters empire if britons with impunity rebel will other nations not renounce his sway what leagues will not be formed  if his allies are known to suffer  as it will be known  his most avowed allies  what suppliant prince shall sue to claudius for a vain protection who dread his enmity  did dismiss your fears rome will uphold her friends  in such a cause she neither counts her blood or treasure lavished not to recall in other lands exploits that signalize our faith  your ancestor i think his name was mandubrace who fled to gaul imploring aid from caesar was to his realm by caesars arms restored when last he enterprizd on this new world  cart still may you prove the terror of your foes the bulwark of your firm allies and still teach traitors to repent of faithless leagues my faith you cannot doubt  witness caradoc  oh that like him proud vanoc were my spoil to give to claudius yet one triumph more a tributary crown with him i love with vellocad who best deserves my love is all i ask to recompense my faith he is my lord  the chosen of my heart the man who sympathizd in all my sufferings the man who braved the tyrants jealous rage who eased me of a yoke too rude to bear  with him i vowed to live  with him to die this didius is the whole of my ambition  did your injuries had you a while dissembled   cart that is an art we britons are to learn divided from those climes where art prevails undisciplined by precepts of the wise our inborn passions will not brook control we follow nature in her strong desires our joys our griefs our pleasures and our pains alike sincere admit of no disguise our words declare our very looks betray the feelings of the soul the workings of the heart still happy or still wretched in excess  did we romans should prefer the golden mean and choose to steer through life with gentle gales  cart we too would choose did nature give us choice  but sir i should inform you now our hopes from their low ebb begin to rise  your presence not granted yet untimely will inspire new courage and retrieve what valens lost already do the soldiers in your name from tent to tent each animate his fellow and promise vengeance to the hoary shade of brave ostorius  did just to his renown the senate had decreed not so the gods to cheer his age to sooth his long fatigues and close his restless warfare in a triumph  cart his memory now committed to your care be greatly pious to the worthy dead  nor shall you want assistance  did generous queen his ashes be my trust in a strange land his manes shall not wander unappeasd  cart too long already vengeance is delayed  oh give the spirit of ostorius rest  the spoils of vanoc he demands  from you  vanoc alone can furnish out his trophy vanoc whose breach of faith and foul rebellion oppressed the aged with a weight of sorrow  did so all ye powers propitious prove to me as i avenge this much dishonored shade  cart soon shall you stand acquitted of your vow this night  this instant hour my vellocad to whom your emperors glory is most dear comes with auxiliaries  hence far northward a swarm of caledonians hugelimbd warriors who wield with sinewy arm a deadly sword and fight secure behind the sevenfold target  did but how may vellocad conceal their march or need we send out forces to protect them  cart this woody forest that divides the camps a length of shelter covers their approach mean time the vain usurper in my palace prepares his daughters nuptials nor suspects these distant aids  but didius we shall call the bridegroom forth  before the appointed hour  did and pacify the slaughtered sons of rome  cart and blot the name of vanoc out of life his brother died my prisoner  nor shall himself nor shall his gwendolen  his daughter dear survive to lengthen out his hated race and nurse a brood of traitors in my realms but see where idwall speeds  a trusty soldier a loyal subject  not unknown to valens  scene iii didius cartismand idwall id madam the bidden guests are come  they wait impatient to salute their general  cart your captains sir  within my humble tent they wait  the good ostorius often deigned to grace my slender table with his presence there shall you find your friends with truest welcome to such coarse fare as this rude land affords  did still princess you outgo my courtesy  cart ere half the night shall waste my absent lord will bid you welcome  did i should speak to valens  cart idwall do you expect him here  he too must be our guest  entreat him not to fail  did by the result of what your queen imparts i shall have orders for him  of importance let him not fail me idwall  cart let him bring the map ostorius traced  it shows his marches his several camps and posture of the island  did a care well worthy of a roman soldier  now madam i attend you  cart this way sir behold the moon shines on the pearly dews and through the night directs the advancing troops  scene iv idwall prompted at once by vengeance and by love what will not woman dare  o cartismand adventurous princess  boldness be thy praise thy refuge now thy title to the crown  no cool advice no caution will avail rashness is prudence in a desperate cause  the sword alone can justify thy passion if in good plight these northern kerns arrive then vellocad does fortune promise fair and give at least one trying battle more this is the utmost effort of thy queen her last surviving hope  if we succeed  and yet while this highmettled vanoc lives the romans never shall have peace in britain nor cartismand be rescued from alarms scene v idwall valens id valens you come in time  val in search of you have i employed my absence  id the general is the queens guest  nor are you uninvited i was enjoined to wait and bring you to them they want  a map   val the draught ostorius made  id the same  val this very parchment roll  whereby i meant to point the country out  id you hear the caledonian succors are at hand  val within some furlongs of the forests shelter  id your new commander need not pine for action before to morrows sun shall gain the pitch of noon we may control the pride of vanoc restore the queen retrieve your late defeat and turn their purposed revels into mourning then valens shall fair gwendolen be thine thy captive prize the servant of thy will and satisfy the longings of thy soul  val thou idwall do not know how valens loves nor feel the power of such excelling beauty  i would not triumph over gwendolen nor make her mine against her free consent there was a time before her injured sire declared perpetual enmity to rome a time there was  when valens loved in hope but though my hopes are fled  my love remains no idwall no  the princess must be happy or i be doubly wretched in her sufferings  id but i would urge the mischiefs to ensue should this alliance be confirmed by marriage consider valens   val i foresee the ruin i know that yvor the silurian prince who weds  who merits  but i merit too  if services if faith if love can merit  a love so pure debased by no alloy a passion that pursues no other bliss save the felicity of her i love  only i wish fair gwendolen might find oh heavens that fond felicity in me she is my claim  her fathers promises have made her mine nor have i forfeited nor will i ever forfeit gwendolen a friend accounted long i felt her charms when yvor was a stranger to her thoughts when vanoc had not yet espoused your queen and she then heiress to no large dominion might not disdain to wed a roman tribune  id still i remind you of the growing power that threatens us that threatens you in yvor  val i know he rules an untamed mountain race a nation walled on every side with rocks a fiery people desperate foes to rome whom dangers only kindle into rage i know this strict alliance sought by vanoc unites three bordering nations in his cause  id the brigants the cornavians the silurians nor will the trinobants your old allies your tributaries be enabled long to stand against this formidable union vain is your triumph over caradoc if this cornavian a more vengeful foe surpasses him in power as much as will  val now didius governs here to him belongs the conduct of the war  let him command and i obey  this idwall is my duty and yet i grieve at this untoward quarrel for rome and for my self i grieve  and wish we had at least a fairer show of justice  id an idle wish princes and states you know approve their actions by success  nor you nor we have other hope  the contest valens is now not who shall reign but who shall live and whether if the queen be overthrown the romans shall be marked for slaves in britain or perish by the druids hands in flames and give their entrails to the searching knife a message from the queen  scene vi idwall valens a messenger id we come centurion   val he bears some earnest purpose in his looks  mess the queen is apprehensive for the succors a scout informs her that the enemy prepare an ambush  a body far advanced marches in silence close behind the wood  he takes them for silurians  yvors men  id we come this instant  scene vii idwall valens id this restless vigilance this active soul of vanoc will undo us  val come idwall  now my heart revives and i take courage from despair  if yvor leads this enterprise then didius send me forth to meet my rival  ere the dawn appears or he or i may fall  id now is your time to save the romans and to win the fair should you succeed  though gwendolen a while may grieve  yet womens grief is transient and they soon learn to love the fortunate  val o venus parent of the roman line delight of gods the luxury of men attend my vow  as in the cyprian isle in britain will i make thy worship known accept my piety to raise thy shrine  and in return let gwendolen be mine  end of the first act act ii scene i scene a hall in the palace of vanoc vanoc alone above the mountain tops the ruddy sun breaks through the mists and dims the moon  ere now has yvor tried these northern blades  and yet by busy thought is doubtful of the event his life would be too dear a price for conquest since my loved daughter darling of my soul will claim that life  oh gwendolen my child my only comfort thy fond mothers pledge for thee for yvor is thy father anxious ye guardian powers  and chiefly o adraste virgin goddess  thou renown of britain with spear and helmet terrible in war grant me this victory  and here i vow before the day scarce yet begun shall close to flood thy templecourt with roman blood what hasty steps  scene ii vanoc alan van alan where is your prince  alan he lives   van the caledonians  say silurian  alan may every day to vanoc prove like this  van are they defeated then  alan he bade me fly to bear the victory  while i said he pursue the rout the gleanings of the battle  van thanks to our gods  but how  inform me alan  alan the noon of night was past before we reached our place of ambush  where the forest ends we range in covert  when anon the foe came dreadless over the level swart that lies between the wood and the swiftstreaming ouse the signal given we rush in three divisions lancing a storm of spears  the van the rear attack while yvor rages on the center our onset fierce the conflict was not long ere the disordered host gave ground  onward we press and urge them to the margin of the flood this peril forced them to resist a while  still on we press and here renew the carnage so great that in the stream the moon showed purple some drown more perish by the sword the rest a flying remnant yvor will account for  van now vile adulteress  now ye base upholders hardened approvers of a womans shame  where now your impious hopes  what refuge now from our just vengeance  from the wrath of heaven have i not sworn destruction on your heads and should my heart relent  no  if i do then vanoc is the abettor of your crimes  alan  thy master is a worthy prince  he hates these romans  an entire defeat you say  a slaughter  should this didius dare this new commander sent to awe our people once dare to draw a sword for cartismand and interfere in my domestic wrongs or put a stop to justice  but a moment  nay if he give not up my infamy  my whole reproach to speedy punishment to death  her and the traitor vellocad  nor will i bate a single life  not a soul obnoxious to the forfeit of their treason  but my daughter  i blame not her impatience  scene iii vanoc alan gwendolen van come my dear child my gwendolen and share thy fathers joys  yvor returns victorious  gwen then am i overpaid for every care for every fear that kept my heart awake  van nay and thou shall have large amends i promise  amends for every silent bitter tear wrung from thy gentle nature much abused think thou that i forget the waspish moods of that imperious stepdame to my child  an unchaste barren wife  who never felt a parents yearnings  had thy mother lived  how often do i weep beholding thee  in thee she lives  but thou wast not of years to wear the dear remembrance i must cherish how will it please the watchful lovely shade that keeps my couch and blesses all my dreams to see my justice on the shameless creature and find thee flourish under yvors care  gwen since you are pleased to authorize my love i need not blush to own it sir nor doubt the truth of him who merits your esteem  van he loves thee gwendolen  my word he does he has not learnt deceit the roman breeding to speak kind words to every handsome face and snare the innocent  but i waste time  alan will entertain thee with his valor while i prepare dispatches to convey our new success

valens vanoc now tribune   val health to vanoc  van speak your business  val i come not as an herald but a friend and i rejoice that didius chose out me to greet a prince in my esteem the foremost  van so much for words  now to your purpose tribune  val sent by our new lieutenant who in rome and since from me has heard of your renown i come to offer peace to reconcile past enmities to strike perpetual leagues with vanoc whom our emperor invites to terms of friendship strictest bonds of union  van we must not hold a friendship with the romans  val why must you not  van virtue forbids it  val once you thought our friendship was your greatest glory  van i thought you honest  i have been deceived  would you deceive me twice no tribune no you sought for war  maintain it as you may  val believe me prince your vehemence of spirit prone ever to extremes betrays your judgment would you once cooly reason on our conduct   van oh i have scanned it thorough  night and day i think it over and i think it base most infamous  let who will judge  but romans did not my wife did not my menial servant seducing each the other both conspire against my crown against my fame against my life did they not levy war and wage rebellion and when i would assert my right and power as king and husband when i would chastise two most abandoned wretches who but romans opposed my justice and maintained their crimes do i not reason cooly on your conduct  you have the art to gloss the foulest cause i show it undisguisd  for cartismand the romans stood the britons and the gods declared for vanoc  do i argue fairly  val at first the romans did not interpose but grieved to see their best allies at variance indeed when you turned justice into rigor and even that rigor was pursued with fury we undertook to mediate for the queen and hoped to moderate   van to moderate  what would you moderate my indignation the just resentment of a virtuous mind to mediate for the queen  you undertook  wherein concerned it you but as you love to exercise your insolence  are you to arbitrate my wrongs  must i ask leave must i be taught to govern over my household am i then void of reason and of justice when in my family offenses rise shall strangers saucy intermeddlers say thus far and thus are you allowed to punish when i submit to such indignities when i am tamed to that degree of slavery  make me a citizen a senator of rome to watch to live upon the smiles of claudius to give my wife my children to his pleasures and sell my country with my voice for bread  val prince you insult upon this days success you may provoke too far  but i am cool  i give your anger scope  van who shall confine it  the romans  let them rule their slaves  i blush that dazzled in my youth with ostentation the trappings of the men seduced my virtue  val blush rather that you are a slave to passion subservient to the wildness of your will which like a whirlwind tears up all your virtues and gives you not the leisure to consider did not the romans civilize you  van no  they brought new customs and new vices over taught us more arts than honest men require and gave us wants that nature never gave  val we found you naked   van and you found us free  now on my soul the mountain stag that springs from height to height and bounds along the plains nor has a master to restrain his course that mountain stag would vanoc rather be than be a slave  much less the slave of slaves  val would you be temperate once and hear me out   van speak things that honest men may hear with temper speak the plain truth and varnish not your crimes say that you once were virtuous  long ago a frugal hardy people  like the britons before you grew thus elegant in vice and gave your luxuries the name of virtues the civilizers  the disturbers say  the robbers the corrupters of mankind proud vagabonds who make the world your home and lord it where you have no right  val you wrong your friends your benefactors your instructors since you will have the truth i speak it out who but the romans fashioned your rude natures smoothed your rough tempers changed you into men from wild barbarians savages in woods  van you changed us into beasts most servile beasts to bear your impositions your dominion taught us indeed to cloth to dwell in houses to feast to sleep on down to be profuse a fine exchange for liberty  what virtue have you taught  val humanity  van oh patience   val can you disown a truth confessed by all a praise a glory known in barbarous climes far as our legions march they carry knowledge the arts the laws the discipline of life our conquests are indulgencies and we not masters but protectours of mankind  van prevaricating false  most courteous tyrants  romans  rare patterns of humanity came you then here thus far through waves to conquer to waste to plunder out of mere compassion is it humanity that prompts you on to ravage the whole earth to burn destroy to raise the cries of widows and of orphans to lead in bonds the generous freeborn princes who spurn who fight against your tyranny happy for us  and happy for you spoilers had your humanity never reached our world  it is a virtue  so it seems you call it a roman virtue that has cost you dear  and dearer shall it cost if vanoc lives  or if we die we shall leave those behind us who know the worth of british liberty  val i mean not to reproach your ancestors untaught uncultivated as they were inhospitable full of ferocity lions in spirit cruel beyond men your altars reeking often with human blood nor will i urge you farther on our merits i come instructed sir to offer peace the peace that didius offers valens sues for propose your terms and you will find me forward to win the general to a compliance and to deserve once more the name of friend  van deliver up the queen send back my daughter this done we may be brought to treat of peace  val therein the dignity the faith of claudius would highly suffer  van is then the dignity the faith of claudius founded on injustice is it his glory to protect a traiteress a base a profligate adulterous woman fit emperor indeed to govern romans  but valens let me tell you the free britons would not endure his sway  they must have justice and from their prince do they require it most  nay they demand it  were i a villager the meanest freeman in all your state and claudius should presume  or any caesar  to abuse his power and authorize enormous crimes i would not  no  were his anger death  i could not bear it but would oppose him to my stretch of power  val in blaming us in making your demands you do not recollect the services the debt we owe to cartismand  van the services the debt  notorious deed  her earliest infamy your worst disgrace not recollect o caradoc  thy prowess not thy credulity be my example not know your shame  yes every briton knows it you triumphed by a womans perfidy ostorius bought the foe he could not conquer who else had conquered him and freed this island  val impetuous briton partial in your rage  van the fate of caradoc and shame of cartismand will ever be remembered through the land did she not promise aids invite him to her receive him with adulterated smiles then bind the brave believing man in chains and barter with you for the boast of britain yet this your emperor vainly called a triumph and made a spectacle of virtue thus betrayed  val you need not thus employ your eloquence we know it all  van yet let me recollect through the wide crowded streets of rome behold the warrior walk majestic in his bonds  in the full senate now he stands undaunted an aged awful a triumphant captive his looks his words appall the robed assembly and shake vainglorious claudius on his throne  val claudius took off his chains  remember that  van then did your nobles see a man a briton the admiration the terror of the romans this is the mighty debt you owe that woman  val yet after this you married cartismand  van i was ambitious  that i learned from you that i did wed with treachery and was a friend to romans is the whole reproach of vanoc but they and she combined have cleared my honor and when i stain it by forgiving either let my own subjects brand me for a coward  val talk not of honor prince  an empty sound the vaunting of a briton in his choler  to me at least you should have spared the boast you can renounce your word we know at pleasure forget past services worn marks of kindness then quarrel with your friends to free the debt and sacrifice all faith to your resentments  van this accusation i can hear unmoved it sullies not my soul nor taints my fame it is a slander i expect no better  val do i calumniate then  ungrateful vanoc  perfidious prince  is it a calumny to say that gwendolen betrothed to yvor was by her father first assured to valens by solemn promises you made her mine and i by faithful services deserved her what have i done to merit this injustice  van then valens was our friend  val i never was your foe  urge not that weak defense  you know how much my heart approved your cause in secret how i remonstrated against the war how i abhorred the conduct of the queen what did i not for you  through my persuasion how often did ostorius proffer peace  van when i had worsted him and kept the field which still i keep thanks to the valiant yvor  val i once did think the word of vanoc sacred  you may confirm it still  van where it is due it shall not fail  you never were my foe  those are your words  yet when ostorius died and the command devolved on you alone you fought for cartismand  my daughter  no  were it to save her life she should not wed a roman  val then hear me  proud cornavian  unthinking prince i take you at your word nor shall you forfeit it a second time she shall not wed she shall not be a wife but she shall be a slave  and to a roman the wretched mother shall she be of slaves and live to curse her offspring and her father i will not ask your leave to use my captive as i please  she is my right my property we thank you that there needs no farther courtship i can command her and she must comply fortune is just  what you refuse she gives and vanoc suffers for his breach of promise  van hence menacer  nor tempt me into rage  this roof protects thy rashness  but be gone  i cannot answer for mine indignation if thou should dare to violate my child or but pollute her cheek with one rude kiss what heavy vengeance shall i not require  nor man nor woman nor the new born infant nor any thing that is roman will i spare but in the bitterness of wrath destroy and for thy iewd illmannerd threats remember that i henceforward do abjure all peace nor shall you buy my friendship with your empire away  alan conduct the tribune forth  and let him pass unquestioned  scene ix alan valens valens soldier come the king is much incensed  alas he knows not how far a lovers tongue belies his heart  mine are fond menaces the throws of love

pay for vanocs friendship it will not be refused  do general do give up the queen who gave up caradoc and expiate my folly by your falsehood but didius i will disappoint your malice you shall not send
