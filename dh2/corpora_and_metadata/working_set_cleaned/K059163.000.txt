a declaration of truth to benjamin hoadly one of the high priests of the land and of the degree whom men call bishops  by a ministering friend who writ to tho bradbury a dealer in many words  london printed for e more near st pauls and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster      price six pence  a declaration of truth to benjamin hoadly be it known unto thee friend benjamin that albeit we who are the people of the lord own thee not in thy proud titles neither in thy office as thou exercisest the same neither can we treat thee with that distinction wherewith men distinguish thee forasmuch as we do not acknowledge the same as thou do to be of god nevertheless i shall treat thee respectfully in this thing whereof i am now to commune with thee seeing thou have uttered much truth with thy mouth and therefore have moved much wrath of wicked men against thee  and would thou benjamin faithfully pursue the light which i perceive is in thee and which shines abroad far and nigh i say would thou act according to the light which i plainly see is in thee thou should have praise for thou have verily done worthily in that thou have restored the kingdom to them to whom it solely appertains and have dethroned the usurpations of wicked men who have unrighteously set themselves up in the throne of jesus  verily benjamin thou have done worthily in that thou have appeared for the cause of our god against the unrighteousness of men and have not been afraid neither discouraged when they have risen up against thee with great wrath and i am sent unto thee to declare in words of seriousness that thou should not faint neither be dismayed for that many of the faithful servants of god are with thee in this thing and do say unto thee god speed which thou know we are forbidden to say unto the ungodly and unto men who are not led in the right way  having thus given my testimony to thy good works i communicated my intentions to friends among these aminadab a righteous man fearing not the face of men but fearing god only says unto thee that his heart is likewise with thee in the things which thou have said to wit that the power of men or the laws of men have no authority to interfere with or to join their power with the right hand of jesus who allows no partners in the throne of his glorious kingdom on earth any more than he will admit partners in the throne of his glorisyd kingdom in heaven moreover he has sent messengers unto me saying speak thou ebenezer in the ears of benjamin hoadly and say unto him fear not the face of men though many rise up against thee saying thou lie thou lie for verily thou lie not benjamin but have spoken the truth and it shall prevail  aaron a man filled with knowledge and a teacher of wisdom sent also unto me saying ebenezer the thing which aminadab our friend has communicated unto thee concerning benjamin hoadly are things which savor of truth and thou will do well to speak unto the said benjamin saying fear not benjamin for wise men are with thee and good men are with thee and verily they be better men and more in number that are with thee than those that be against thee  i might name unto thee many friends endowed with wisdom and knowledge who speak well of thee for that thou have spoken the truth with great boldness and have not feared to utter it even in the hearing of the king and we may not doubt but that our lord the king will be thy strong helper against all thine enemies and will assist thee to silence the gainsayers of thy doctrine for verily the king is an unfeigned friend unto the truth and would be willing that all men should walk in the path to heaven howbeit he may not be enlightened equal to our friends which nevertheless we hope he may hereafter be if god sees it good to bring his heart over unto us  and albeit friend benjamin thou art not yet joined unto the faithful servants of god our friends but that thou for a little while remainest as to some things in the darkness of the world yet forasmuch as thou joinest with us in the truth we embrace thee willingly nothing doubting but that the heavenly light which has shone out in thy word will hereafter shine in thy heart and thou will come over more perfectly unto us friends who are already established in the truth  and i am the farther confirmed in the truth hereof in that thou have so boldly acknowledged the truths of god being the same professed by us and for the sake whereof we are inclined to think well of thee and seeing i have informed thee that thou have so exactly taught what we in principle believe and closely adhere to in practice i shall let thee know benjamin how exactly thou agreest with us who have received the truth and that we hold and believe all the truths that thou have taught and that also even in the same words in which thou have declared them or but with small variation thereof as thou will farther be informed when thou shall read the following heads which are part of the principles of truth or of those things about doctrine which we friends do most surely believe and recieve to wit  concerning religion we believe that it is only the spirit of the lord that makes men truly religious and no man ought to be compelled to or from any exercise or practice in religion by any outward law or power but every man ought to be left free as the lord shall persuade his own mind in doing or leaving undone this or the other practice in religion and every man of what profession in religion soever ought to be protected in peace provided himself be a man of peace not seeking the wrong of any mans person or estate  and we believe that to reprove false opinions and unsound doctrines and principles seeking to convince them that oppose themselves by exhortation or sharp reproof by word or writing ought not to be counted a breach of the peace or to strive about the things of the kingdom of god by men of contrary minds or judgments this ought not to be punished by the magistrates and their laws for we believe that the outward laws and powers of the earth are only to preserve mens persons and estates and not to preserve men in opinions neither ought the laws of the nation to be laid upon mens consciences to bind them to or from such a judgment or practice in religion  and we believe that christ is and ought only to be lord and exerciser of mens consciences and his spirit must only lead into all truth  and we believe that obedience and subjetion in the lord belongs to superiors and that subjects ought to obey them in the lord that have rule over them and that children ought to obey their parents and wives their husbands and servants their masters in all things which is according to god which stand in the exercise of a pure conscience toward god but where rulers parents or masters or any other command or require subjection in any thing which is contrary to god or not according to him in such cases all people are free and ought to obey god rather than man and we believe that herein god will justify them being guided and led by his spirit in all that which is good and out of all that which is evil  herein friend benjamin thou may see as in a vision of clear light that thou art in the same way of truth with us and i have freedom to own thee therein for verily thou have clearly testified unto the truth which we believe in that thou have likewise said even in our words that every man ought to be left free as the lord shall persuade his own mind  now benjamin let it not seem strange unto thee that i say unto thee that these are our own words for i speak therein with truth and soberness referring thee for testimony thereof unto a little book published more than forty and five years since by a body of our friends and signed by john crook a man endowed with a spirit of a sound mind and also by three other ancients who were likewise men of true wisdom this book is entitled truths principles etc in which book the words which i have written unto thee above are to be found  searching likewise thy book benjamin which thou have made public by the command of the king i find these words which i hope thou have learned from our friends above written to wit that the language of the word is that knowing the terrors of the lord we should persuade men but that the language of the mens conduct who profess to succeed him that taught the other is that having the terrors of this world in their power they do not persuade men but force their outward profession against their inward persuasion  verily thou have spoken benjamin as one having the light of the spirit and this is a truth which the men of the world cannot be able to resist verily friend benjamin we agree with thee that the kingdom of jesus is not of this world and that the laws of his kingdom likewise and the rewards and punishments of those laws are suited to the end of those laws and to the nature of his kingdom nay benjamin i will use thy words as thou have used the words of wise men who went before thee to wit the laws of this kingdom therefore as christ left them have nothing of this world in their view not tendency either to the exaltation of some in wordly pomp and dignity or to their absolute dominion over the faith and religious conduct of others of his subjects or to the erecting of any sort of temporal kingdom under the covert of name of a spiritual one the sanctions of christs law are rewards and punishments but of what sort not the rewards of this worlds not the offices or glories of this state not the pains of prisons banishments fines or any lesser and more moderate penalties nay not the much lesser negative discouragements that belong to humane society he was far from thinking that these could be the instruments of such a persuasion as he thought acceptable to god but as the great end of his kingdom was to guide men to happiness after the short images of it were over here below so he took his motives from that place where his kingdom first began and where it was at last to end from those rewards and punishments in a future state which had no relation to this world and to show that his kingdom was not of this world all the sanctions which he thought fit to give to his laws were not of this world at all    i confirm these thy positions and doctrines benjamin with my voice and give thee praise therefore for verily thou art worthy of praise not only that thou have spoken boldly the truth but for that thou have done it in the face of the adversary and have not been afraid and blessed be the king into whose heart god has put it to frown upon the gainsayers and albeit they were gathered together against thee he has seattered them and has sent them away discouraged  neither do i flatter thee with my lips for friends are not guilty of such things and it would be in me a great iniquity but i speak to thee in sincerity and in truth and my thoughts are moved to utter the words of my mouth for verily thou have dethroned and pulled down that man of sin the son of perdition which has exalted himself thou have valintly encountered the tribe of ungodly priests who have by an injurious usage of the lords people for many years usurped the authority of king jesus and have exercised dominion over the souls who they have had committed by men unto their charge these they have tyrannized over and have cruelly persecuted under pretense of authority from jesus albeit jesus the true king and only head of all true believers as thou have well said has given no such authority unto them  now concerning ministers i will tell thee what friends do surely receive and believe and i will not give thee my own words but the words of the said declaration of truths principles mentioned before to wit  such ministers as are made by god who are sanctified by his word and power who have freely received perfect gifts from god and so by the spirit and power of god are sent forth into the world to turn the people from darkness to light and from the power of satan to the power of god who freely minister unto others without coveting any mans gold or silver or apparel not seeking theirs but them warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that they might present every man perfect in christ jesus such as minister from the spirit and have the word of god abiding in them who are never unprovided but at all times and seasons and in all places do speak and declare the truth as they are moved and instructed and as the spirit of truth does give them utterance such ministers we own and have in great esteem  this we surely do believe benjamin and thou have done worthily in concurring with us and in that thou have taken away from those who call themselves ministers all that power and pretended authority which they assume and which we say they usurp contrary to the nature of the office of a minister which we also declare to be only to teach and instruct not to terrify and affright the people of the lord and herein we know that although thou will offend them and they will show great wrath against thee therefore yet i say we know thou have spoken the truth against them and i concur with thee therein nay i acknowledge thee and own thee therein because thou have concurred with us in the truth not doubting but thou will be farther enlightened in the lords due time to join with friends in all the words of truth which we profess  i must farther say in thy behalf friend benjamin that thou have spoken excellent words of wisdom in defiance of the men of high notions who are of the tribe who thou did belong to in former time for thou have taken the people out of their hands and have set them free from the mock terrors of vain men such as they call the artillery of the church which we that know the ways of truth are acquainted with the deceitfulness of and as i glory in thy words thereupon i shall repeat them in thy praise as follows to wit  not the least tittle of salvation or damnation depends upon the will of weak men but all upon god and your selves humane benedictions humane absolutions humane denunciations humane excommunications have nothing to do with the favor or anger of god but are humane engines permitted to work  like other evils by providence  these are excellent things spoken with wisdom and thou shall have due praise of the same likewise have thou battered down the strong holds of satan in thy words on the same subject  in all your religious concerns that effect your eternal salvation and your title to gods favor your rule is plain and evident christ is your sole lawgiver and your sole judge as to those points the papists may excommunicate the protestant non jurors the nonjurors may excommunicate the highchurchmen as well as all other british protestants who pray for king george these again may excommunicate unchurch unchristian those whose church government or worship differ from their own and these again may exercise the same spiritual discipline wherever their terrors can extend themselves they may thus scatter damnation about playing one would think as the man in the proverbs with firebrands and death and saying are we not in sport and they may every one flatter themselves that this power of the keys shuts out from the catholic church here and from the kingdom of heaven hereafter but it is in truth only from themselves that they can excommunicate and this is very often their own crime and their own loss but christ himself and his apostles have plainly told you what it is and what alone that shall cut you off from him and declared a curse upon all who preach any other gospel and consequently who add any thing as absolutely necessary to his favor which he has not made so  to these truths of thine such i call them as thou have been honored to speak them first among men i bear my testimony and the good people the people of the lord despised by men of whom i am the meanest have born their testimony many years ago i say with thee that the boasted terms which those men make wicked use of such as regular and uninterrupted successions authoritative benedictions excommunications absolutions etc are vain words mere terrors of men not the terrors of the lord niceties and trifles and therefore it is that we disown the whole tenor and substance of the canons and institutions of that which they profanely as i doubt not thou will in time be led by these lights to do also i despise and contemn all the pretended authority of that which they weakly and impertinently call a power derived from christ and his apostles i know no ministers but such as is before described as for such as are brought up at schools and colleges and so made ministers by the will of man who have not freely received perfect gifts from god for perfecting of the saints but denies perfection and so denies the ministers work neither do minister freely but seek for gain from their quarters and will not preach without a price who are not sanctified by the word of god but plead for a continuance in sin while people walk upon the earth such as minister from the letter and not from the spirit who cannot preach except they have time to study and so by their industry provide themselves and are not provided of the lord such a ministry is of works and not the free gift from god such cannot profit people but lead them captive in an empty and dead form always hearing but never able to come to the true knowledge of god such called ministers we do deny and turn from them and testify against them as the holy men of god formerly did  i doubt not friend benjamin but thy words tend to bring thee to the same just contempt that i have entertained and that friends most righteously do entertain of these uncalled priests and that in the mean time thou will by thy sober and weighty speeches bring all that wicked hierarchy which those priests so violently contend for into contempt among the people  i am therefore moved to bear my testimony with thee against them forasmuch as they usurping high dignity and authority have erected a kingdom which they say is the kingdom of jesus howbeit as i verily think it is a kingdom of this world forasmuch as they exercise jurisdictions which be of this world therein and have taken to themselves powers which be of themselves which nevertheless they take upon them to say are descended to them and by the notions and pretenses of a succession of those powers they assume a right to exercise those powers over the consciences of men which friends say they have no right to do and furthermore we say and believe that whereas they exercise the power and authority which alone belongs to king jesus the king and sole chief of his faithful followers they therefore erect their own kingdom not the kingdom of king jesus and exercise the authority and power which is his only as their own  i rejoice benjamin that thou have published true doctrine and have given thy testimony with us to the truth which we on so good and solid foundations have received and i question not but thou will be assisted by the spirit of truth to pull down and overthrow the whole power hierarchy and constitution of that people who call themselves the church verily they are usurpers of the kingdom and throne of king jesus and thou shall be a champion of the truth in that thou shall overthrow those ecclesiastic principalities and powers which are not of god and shall establish true religion in that mighty principle of heavenly light in which it is only to be found  this is that inward revelation which thou have been obliged to bear thy testimony unto  viz that light which persuades the minds of men and whereby every step of reformation which has been made in the world has been justified and which as thou say well is all the account which protestants can give for their being reformed from the people called papists  and doubtless thou have by the same arguments justified all those the people of the lord who being persuaded in themselves of their being guided by heavenly light have separated and withdrawn from these usurpations of which thou have spoken so worthily  and what remains beloved friend benjamin but that thou should according as thou have worthily begun and according to the light which shines in thy mind separate thy self from these usurpers of unrighteous authority and joining thy self with the friends to truth should bear thy testimony against all ungodliness for verily benjamin thou can not but see and abhor the doctrine which these men teach saying we are the church and power is with us which thou know is false and is not of god and that the power which they use is not of god but is the power of men tending to ungodly dominion and usurpation such as is that of the pope of rome which nevertheless they have disowned while they yet practice  for verily benjamin it seems to me that thou who have received such light and have acknowledged the truths which are directly contrary to these men can not any longer continue among them or wear those profane ensigns of idolatry whereby thou art distinguished from other men even in a manner which thou thy self know is not appointed by king jesus for verily benjamin the robes of distinction which thou wearest and wherewith thou art honored among men are the ensigns of that usurped power which thou have so worthily condemned and thou can not longer abide among those who thou know are the enemies to the light which thou have received and who walk contrary to the doctrine which thou have taught and which we the lords people have so many years ago received  wherefore i am moved to advertise thee in behalf of the truth that thou should not delay any longer joining thy self unto the lords people whose cause thou have already so worthily pleaded for why should thou not cause thy life and thy doctrine to conform unto each other and why should thou decline to profess openly thy adherence to the lords people whilst thou do not decline to teach the principles which they believe and which they have received from the beginning  it is true benjamin the mean and humble station of those who be teachers and ministers of the lord among us may not be agreeable to thy present temper who art exalted to be great among men but whereas thou know that the kingdom of jesus is not of this world and that likewise his rewards are not of this world as thou have most worthily taught so benjamin how should thou not reject the honors given by men which are the rewards issuing from that usurped power which is not according to the laws of his kingdom these sincerely according to thy own rules are not of god neither can thou who art now enlightened from a higher spirit submit to be decked with their ornaments but should cast them off like as christians in primitive times refused to be decked with the garlands and vestments of idolatrous priests and like as those people who are called protestants refuse and detest the habiliments and vestments titles dignities and distinctions of the popish priests choosing to be called by the truly venerable name of ministers of christ rather than by the titles of popes cardinals abbots monks friars and the like  forasmuch then as the usurpers of the power and authority of king jesus have manifestly invaded his crown and judicatory also as thou have said and have set up marks of their usurped authority to wit their antichristian excommunications absolutions exorcisms and other profane practices and have likewise given honors which our lord and only sovereign jesus christ never gave it seems unto me that thou benjamin who have so manfully dethroned their power and authority and have exposed their usurpation to such contempt or at least have contemned it in thy heart and with the words of thy mouth i say it seems unto me that thou can not receive the honors given by that usurped authority without some breach upon the aforesaid declaration of thy principles and acting therein contrary to the light which is within thee  furthermore benjamin i admonish thee to consider that thou can not abide in the truth which thou have now taught in thy speaking place and published with boldness in printed papers unless thou come out from among that sort of people of whom thou art said now to be a ruler forasmuch as thou have declared them to be workers of iniquity and sons of belial thy conscience therefore will not suffer thee to be called any longer by their name neither can thou be found any longer to own and join thy self unto them can thou benjamin be joined unto usurpers of the authority of thy master and king can thou share his power whom thou have so loudly declared to be the sole lawgiver and governor of his kingdom do not these men continue their usurpations do they not continue to claim that authority which as thou have said appertains only to christ the king and thou know benjamin they will continue to claim the same and to exercise it as if it was granted unto them albeit thou know that it is not wherefore o man remove thy self speedily from these men yea i know thou will remove thy self from them for why should thou be found at last in the company of those men whom thou have filled with contempt saying they are enemies to the kingdom of jesus in the world  verily benjamin thou have done well in that thou have openly declared the iniquity of those who have armed themselves with unlawful power and have exercised tyranny over their brethren saying ye must join with us otherwise ye shall go to prison or otherwise you shall have no honor or part or lot among us whereas king jesus never left any such commandment but it remains as a difficulty or doubt unto us who are friends how thou can o benjamin lay a confederacy with these men art not thou therein an usurper also with them of the power and authority of thy only lord and king and that in a much grosser manner than they verily benjamin if thou come not out from among them thou will give occasion to wicked men to say of thee that thou have said that in thy teaching office which thou will not put in practice in thy own person and they will speak evil words of thee saying thou teach men to do what thou shunnest to do thy self and that thou shunnest not those things which thou teach others to shun and avoid moreover benjamin art thou not even at this time and after the similitude of thine own words according to thy own doctrine an usurper of the authority of king jesus in that thou continuest to exercise that same power of which thou have said that king jesus gave no such power unto men to wit that profane unlawful power which those whom men call bishops generally exercise over their brethren oppressing the lords people in their ungodly courts do thou not preside in thy usurped judicature exercising that power there which thou have said the lord has not given thee a right to exercise and do thou not there make use of those things which thou have owned to be trifles and nullities to wit excommunications absolutions and such like things i say do thou not suffer these things to be done in thy name to the subjects of thy lord in those seats of evil men called ecclesiastic courts and how can thou do this after thou have so plainly told us that this is to make thy self king in the stead of thy king jesus nay friend benjamin in this thou have not done well forasmuch also as thou have sinned herein against the light that is in thee and have caused thy feet to tread aside out of the path of truth which thou have chalked out for others that they might walk therein but i trust that thou will be guided by the good spirit and by the light of truth shining in thy soul and then thou will be sure to come away and remove from the tents of wickedness  wherefore friend benjamin as i know that the truth has been spoken by thee i warn thee for thy good that thou come out speedily from among them lay down thy painted vestments and profane trinkets the ensigns of that usurpation upon thy lord and masters kingdom which thou have so faithfully born thy testimony against i say i exhort thee to lay them down speedily and come out from among them forthwith joining thy self unto us whose principles thou have acknowledged so shall thy life and doctrine be uniform and thou shall be sure to deserve that blessing which attends those who are not ashamed to practice the things which they profess  likewise benjamin this will enable thee to overcome the gainsayers for behold they do already upbraid thee herewith and verily the man called andrew snape has spoken unto thee words of scorning with boldness in a book which he styles a letter written unto thee and in the twenty and fifth page thereof that if the case be as thou have said it is the men called parsons have nothing more to do but to throw up their orders since their church has no need of them and since they not only do no service but are guilty of a criminal usurpation  likewise has the same andrew snape said unto thee in his said book and in the thirty and sixth page thereof these words to wit that he does not see how upon these principles thou can take thy place in the provincial sanhedrim of the priests or how thou can require subscriptions or declarations of those of the sons of the prophets whom thou do admit to the priesthood among thy people or how thou can exercise almost any act of episcopal jurisdiction  now verily benjamin albeit this same andrew snape is a man by his profession in an evil way and such as i allow not to be according to the truth yet nevertheless herein has he spoken unto thee words which thou should consider well of for that they are of weight unto thee to wit that thou should separate thy self from evildoers whose ways thou know to be wrong and that whereas thou have condemned them for usurpation and invasion of the kingdom of king jesus thou should not at the same time continue among them or sit in thy seat in their assemblies  moreover it seems unto me benjamin that whereas thou have replied to andrew snape in harsh words saying that he has evil entreated thee and has written bitter things against thee and things which savor not of truth yet nevertheless i perceive that thou have not said one word unto him to gainsay what he has told thee concerning thy coming out from among them or that thou can not by thy own principles take thy seat in the assembly of thy priests wherefore i rejoice in thy behalf nothing doubting but that thou will come and join thy self with the lords people who are friends unto the truth and unto all that thou have said of the usurpation of men and as i have already given thee to understand have many years received the truths which thou have preached at this day  neither let it grieve thee friend benjamin that thou shall relinquish the things which men call honors and greatness and shall lose thereby the advantages and profits which thou do now receive forasmuch as thou know that the rewards of the kingdom of jesus are not of this world and if the rewards of this world are the sanctions of the kingdom whereof thou have spoken then it is not of jesus so that thou shall only relinquish the rewards of this world and shall seek the rewards of that kingdom which is not of this world  these things being so naturally drawn from thy own words i trust thou will not hesitate thereat but wilt accept of my wholesome advice and show thy self not to be ashamed of the practicing those things whereof thou have testified saying that they are true  neither can thou friend benjamin be in danger of joining with any other people than those whose profession i have here invited thee to since there are not any who have received the truths which thou have preached in their full degrees so as the people who in contempt are called quakers with whom as i have showed thou have perfectly conformed thy self to the honor of thy judgment and of the divine light showing forth in thee  as for those people called presbyterians thou can by no means join thy self unto them seeing they have declared themselves in terms greatly opposite to thy doctrines saying that men have power to make laws binding the consciences of others and that rewards and punishments of this world appertain to humane authority exercised by such as they call a succession of officers these their opinions are not according to truth as friends have received it neither are they like unto those truths which thou have preached and therefore we see that questionless thou will avoid also the erroneous opinions of persecuting presbyterians and wilt join thy self unto us and this i speak unto thee with the more certainty forasmuch as blessed by the lord thou art already come beyond the corrupt tenets of those people moreover beloved friend benjamin i make known unto thee that the said presbyterians are equally guilty of those things which the people of the lord abhor to wit the pretenses to a power which as thou said well jesus the king of all those who are led by the light of the truth never delegated to them and this they not only give to their followers but make laws of their own i say humane laws and sanctions of laws such as rewards and punishments for enforcing others to comply therewith to wit that they admit none to be teachers among them or to preach and prophesy unto the people unless they profess to believe and to receive certain points which they call profanely articles of faith wherein these wicked usurpations of power are openly declared by them saying    that the lord jesus as king and head of his church has therein appointed a government in the hand of church officers distinct from the civil magistrate    that to these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed by virtue whereof they have power respectively to retain and remit sins to shut that kingdom against the impenitent both by the word and censures and to open it unto penitent sinners by the ministry of the gospel and by absolution from censures as occasion shall require    that these church censures are necessary etc for preventing the wrath of god which might fall upon the church if they should suffer the seal of the covenant to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders    these things thou know benjamin are contrary to the doctrines and positions which thou have so openly avowed being no less than invasions and manifest usurpations of the kingdom and authority of king jesus and in themselves nullities and trifles  yet these things and in these words thou will find in those heads of belief which these ungodly presbyterians call the confession of their faith article the xxx howbeit blessed art thou o benjamin in that thou have born thy testimony against these also wherefore i know that leaving behind thee all these wicked and erroneous opinions and bearing witness to the truth thou will at length join thy self unto us and i rejoice over thee in this that thou art enlightened to know the truth testifying that i embrace thee with affection in the lord  friend timothy greeteth thee in like manner as also james the aged a lover of those who forsake the errors of the wicked in a word all friends greet and speak well of thee  fare thee well finis
