hostile feet or rooted up and waste deforms the broad highway from space to space far as my straining eye could shoot its beam trees cottages and castles smoke to heaven in one ascending cloud but oh

from his cave alfred thricehappy hermit whom thus the heavenly habitants attend blessing thy calm retreat while ruthless war fills the polluted land with blood and crimes in this extremity of englands fate led by thy sacred character i come for comfort and advice thy aged wisdom purged from the stormy cloud of human passions and by a ray from heaven exalted sees deep through futurity say what remains what yet remains to save our prostrate country nor scorn this anxious question even from me a nameless stranger  hermit alfred englands king all hail and welcome to this humble cell  alfred whence do thou know me venerable father  hermit last night when with a draught from that cool fountain i had my wholesome sober supper crowned as is my stated custom forth i walked beneath the solemn gloom and glittering sky to feed my soul with prayer and meditation and thus to inward harmony composed that sweetest music of the grateful heart whose each emotion is a silent hymn i to my couch retired strait on mine eyes a pleasing slumber fell whose mystic power sealed up my senses but enlarged my soul at once disclosed amid the dark waste night a vision to my phantasy appeared for know this ample element contains unnumberd spiritual beings or malign or good to man these when the grosser eye of nature sleeps often play their several parts as on a scene before the attentive mind and to the favored man disclose the future led by these spirits friendly to this isle i lived through future ages felt the virtue the great the glorious passions that will fire distant posterity when guardian laws are by the patriot in the glowing senate won from corruption when the impatient arm of liberty invincible shall scourge the tyrants of mankind  and when the deep through all her swelling waves shall proudly joy beneath the boundless empire of thy sons i saw thee alfred too  but over thy fortunes lay cloud impenetrable  alfred ah good hermit that scene is dark indeed ye awful powers to what am i reserved still must i roam a wanderer here inglorious and unknown or am i destined thy great instrument from fierce oppression to redeem this land  hermit perhaps the last  but prince remember then the vows the noble uses of affliction preserve the quick humanity it gives the pitying social sense of human weakness yet keep thy stubborn fortitude entire the manly heart that to anothers woe is tender but superior to its own learn to submit yet learn to conquer fortune attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds and offices of life to life itself with all its vain and transient joys sit loose chief let devotion to the sovereign mind a steady cheerful absolute dependence on his best wisest government possess thee in thoughtless gay prosperity when all attends our wish when naught is seen around us but kneeling flattery and obedient fortune then are blind mortals apt within themselves to fix their stay forgetful of the giver but when thus humbled alfred as thou art when to their feeble natural powers reduced it is then they feel this universal truth  that heaven is all in all  and man is nothing  alfred i thank thee father for thy pious counsel and witness thou dread power who see my heart that if not to perform my regal task to be the common father of my people patron of honor virtue and religion if not to shelter industry to guard his honest portion from oppressive pride from wastful riot and the sons of rapine who basely ravish what they dare not earn if not to deal out justice like the sun with equal light if not to spread thy bounty the treasures trusted to me not my own on all the smiling ranks of nourished life if not to raise our drooping english name to clothe it yet with terror make this land renowned for peaceful arts to bless mankind and generous war to humble proud oppressors if not to build on an eternal base on liberty and laws the public weal if not for these great ends i am ordained may i never idly sill the throne of england  hermit still may thy breast these sentiments retain in prosperous life  alfred prosperity were ruin could it destroy or change such thoughts as these when those whom heaven distinguishes over millions prosusing on them honors riches power whatever the expanded heart can wish when they accepting the reward neglect the duty or worse pervert these gifts to deeds of ruin is there a wretch they rule so mean as they guilty at once of sacrilege to heaven and of perfidious robbery to men  but hark methinks i hear a plaintive voice sigh through the vale and wake the mournful echo  song   sweet valley say where pensive lying for me our children england sighing the best of mortals leans his head ye fountains dimpled by my sorrow ye brooks that my complainings borrow o lead me to his lonely bed or if my lover deep woods you cover ah whisper where your shadows over him spread   it is not the loss of pomp and pleasure of empire or of tinsel treasure that drops this tear that swells this groan no from a nobler cause proceeding a heart with love and fondness bleeding i breathe my sadlypleasing moan with other anguish i scorn to languish for love will feel no sorrows but his own   scene vi alfred hermit eltruda advancing alfred sure by the voice and purport of the song this generous mourner is my queen eltruda and yet how can that be  o all good powers it is she it is she  eltruda my lord my life my alfred oh take me to thy arms with toil overcome and sudden transport thus at once to find thee in this wild forest pathless and perplexed  alfred come to my soul thou dearest best of women come and repose thy sorrows in my bosom o all my passions mix in doubtful strife if pain or joy prevail i scarce can say while thus i clasp thee yet recall the perils to which thy trembling steps have been exposed why have thou left the convent where i placed thee why unprotected trust thee to a land a barbarous land where rages danish war our hospitable england is no more  eltruda dire was the cause my alfred the roused country all hurled in breathless terror and confusion informed us a near party of the danes whose brutal fury spares no sex no age no place however privileged or holy were on full march that way instant i fled in this disguise with only these attendants but in our way often cheered by airy voices to bear to this retreat our helpless children  alfred ah wanderers too young ah hapless children but more unhappy sire who cannot give to those he loves protection  eltruda thou too alfred art thou not unattended none to serve thee to soothe thy woes to watch thy broken slumbers and when the silent tear overflows thy eye none with the warm and cordial lip of love to kiss it off there is in love a power there is a soft divinity that draws even transport from distress that gives the heart a certain pang excelling far the joys of gross unfeeling life besides my alfred even had the fury of this barbarous foe not forced me from the convent life is short and now it trembles on the wing of danger why should we lose it then one wellfavd hour in such a tender circumstance to lovers is better than an age of common time  alfred oh it is too much thy tenderness oercomes me nay look not on me with that sweet dejection through tears that pierce my soul  cheer thee my love hope still the best that better days await us and fairer from remembrance  thou eltruda thou art a pledge of happiness  on thee good angels wait they led thy journey hither and i have heard them in this wild retreat warbling immortal airs and strains of comfort  but ah the foe is round us and this isle now holds my souls best wealth the treasured store of all my joys  i go to skirt it round to visit every creek and sedgy bank where rustles through the reeds the shadowy gale or where the bending umbrage drinks the stream and now by slow degrees solemn and sad widefalling over the world the nightly shades hush the brown woods and deepen all their horrors while humbled into rest and awed by darkness each creature seeks the covert to that cell retire my life i will not long be absent  end of the first act act ii scene i alfred alone it is now the depth of darkness and repose nowwalksmute midnight shadowy over the plain to rule the solitary hour and sheds his slumbery influence over the peaceful world all nature seems to rest while alfred wakes to think and to be wretched  my brave friend i fear me has miscarried  where yon oak with wide and dusky shade oerhangs the stream that glides in silence by i took my stand what time the glowworm through the dewy path first shot his twinkling flame attent i stood listening each noise from twilight hill and dale but all was hushed around nor trumpets clang nor shout of roving foe nor hasty tread of evening passenger disturbed the wide and awful stillness homeward as i sped over many a delve through many a path perplexed maze running into maze illboding thoughts haunted my steps  perhaps my gallant friend discovered to the danes this moment bleeds beneath their swords or lies a breathless corse the prey of midnight wolves  some mournful sound struck sudden on my sense  scene ii alfred eltruda eltruda here will i lean on this green bank to wait the wished return of morning and my lord  alfred my gentle love eltruda why to this untimely sky expose thy health the dews of night fall fast the chill breeze sighs aloud  eltruda i could not rest can love repose when apprehension wakes and whispers to the heart all fearful things that walk with night and solitude methought in each deaf murmur of the woods i heard the dreadful foe  or heard my alfred groan our tender insants too  their fancied cries still sound within my cars  alfred eltruda there i am a woman too i who should cheer and shelter thee from every care my children the thought of what may chance to them compleat their fathers sum of woes o what safe shade can skreen their opening blossom from the storm that beats severe on us not sweeter buds the primrose in the vale nor sooner shrinks at winters churlish blast   eltruda behold my lord  good angels shield us  what a flood of brightness waves round our heads  alfred

eltruda hermit hermit i have heard thy fond complainings alfred  alfred you have then good father heard the cause that wrings them from me  hermit the human race are sons of sorrow born and each must have his portion vulgar minds refuse or crouch beneath their load the brave bear theirs without repining  alfred who can bear the shaft that wounds him through an infants side when whom we love to whom we owe protection implore the hand we cannot reach to save them  hermit weep not eltruda  yet thou art a king all private passions fall before that name thy subjects claim thee whole  alfred can public trust o reverend sage destroy the softer ties that twine around the parents yearning heart that holy passion heaven itself infused and blended with the stream that feeds our life  hermit you love your children prince   alfred lives there on earth in air or ocean creature tame or wild that has not known this universal love all nature feels it intimate and deep and all her sons of instinct or of reason  hermit then show that passion in its noblest form season their tender years with every virtue social or selfretird of public greatness or lovely in the hour of private life with all that can exalt or can adorn their princely rank  alfred alas their hope must stoop such my unhappy fate to humbler aims affliction and base want must be their teachers  hermit affliction is the wholesome soil of virtue where patience honor sweet humanity calm fortitude take root and strongly flourish but prosperous fortune that allures with pleasure dazles with pomp and undermines with flattery poisons the soil and its best product kills should thou regain thy throne   alfred my throne what glimpse what smallest ray of hope   hermit that day may come  what do i feel my laboring breast expands to give the glorious inspiration room and now the cloud that over thy future fate like total night lay heavy and obscure fades into air and all the brightening scene dawns gay before me a long
