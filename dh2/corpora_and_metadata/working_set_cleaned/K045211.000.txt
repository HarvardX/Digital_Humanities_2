you thoughtless vagabonds yet upon my conscience it is very hard these poor fellows should scarcely have bread from the soil they would die to defend  enter doctor rosy ah my little doctor rosy my galen abridge what is the news   doc all things are as they were my alexander the justice is as violent as ever i felt his pulse on the matter again and thinking his rage began to intermit i wanted to throw in the bark of good advice but it would not do he says you and your cutthroats have a plot upon his life and swears he had rather see his daughter in a scarlet fever than in the arms of a soldier   lieu upon my word the army is very much obliged to him well then i must marry the girl first and ask his consent afterward   doc so then the case of her fortune is desperate hey   lieu o hang fortune let that take its chance there is a beauty in laurettas simplicity so pure a bloom upon her charms   doc so there is so there is  you are for beauty as nature made her hey no artificial graces no cosmetic varnish no beauty in grain hey   lieu upon my word doctor you are right the london ladies were always too handsome for me  then they are so defended such a circumvaluation of hoop with a breast work of whale bone that would turn a pistol bullet much less cupids arrows then turret on turret on top with stores of concealed weapons under pretense of black pins and above all a standard of feathers that would do honor to a knight of the bath upon my conscience i could as soon embrace an amosen armed at all points   doc right right my alexander  my taste to a tittle   lieu then doctor though i admire modesty in women i like to see their faces i am for the changeable rose but with one of these quality amazons if their midnight dissipations had left them blood enough to raise a blush they have not room enough in their cheeks to show it  to be sure bashfulness is a very pretty thing but in my mind there is nothing on earth so impudent as an everlasting blush   doc my taste my taste  well lauretta is none of these  ah i never see her but she puts me in mind of my poor dear wife   lieu ay faith in my opinion she cannot do a worse thing  now is he going to bother me about an old hag that has been dead these six years aside   doc oh poor dolly i never shall see her like again such an arm for a bandage  veins that seemed to invite the lancet then her skin smooth and white as a gallipot  her mouth as round and not larger than the month of a penny phial her lips conserve of roses  and then her teeth  none of your sturdy fixtures  ask as they would  it was but a small pull and out they came i believe i have drawn half a score of her poor dear pearls weeps but what avails her beauty death has no consideration  one must die as well as another   lieu o if he begins to moralize takes out his snuss box   doc fair or ugly crooked or straight rich or poor flesh as grafs flowers fade   lieu here doctor take a pinch and keep up your spirits   doc true true my friend grief cannot mend the matter  all is for the best but such a woman was a great loss lieutenant   lieu to be sure for doubtless she had mental accomplishments equal to her beauty   doc mental accomplishments she would have stuffed an aligator or pickled a lizard with any apothecarys wife in the kingdom why she could decypher a prescription and invent the ingredients almost as well as myself then she was such a hand at making foreign waters for setzer pyrmont islington or chaly beat she never had her equal  and her bath and bristol springs exceeded the originals  ah poor dolly she fell a martyr to her own discoveries   lieu how so pray   doc poor soul her illness was occasioned by her zeal in trying an improvement on the spa water by an infusion of rum and acid   lieu ay ay spirits never agree with water drinkers   doc no no you mistake  rum agreed with her well enough it was not the rum that killed the poor dear creature for she died of a dropsy well she is gone never to return and has left no pledge of our loves behind  no little babe to hang like a label round papas neck well well we are all mortal  sooner or later flesh is grass  flowers fade   lieu o the devil again   doc lifes a shadow the world a stage  we strut an hour   lieu here doctor offers snuff   doc true true my friend  well high grief cannot cure it all is for the best hey my little alexander   lieu right right an apothecary should never be out of spirits but come faith it is time honest humphrey should wait on the justice that must be our first scheme   doc true true you should be ready the clothes are at my house and i have given you such a character that he is impatient to have you he swears you shall be his body guard well i honor the army or i should never do so much to serve you   lieu indeed i am bound to you for ever doctor and when once i am possessed of my dear lauretta i will endeavor to make work for you as fast as possible   doc now you put me in mind of my poor wife
