support the civil magistrate in maintaining the peace man being by nature a social creature it is natural for him to associate with his brethren and neighbors for common defense against all unjust violence and such association being just and reasonable as well as natural we have not only a right thus to associate but are even bound to do it by a branch of the common law which cannot legally be changed for it is fixed upon all men in their respective districts and countries as an indispensable duty by the law of nature and nations that we may become assisting says cowel tit   both to our parents and country and repel force and injury and from hence it comes says he that whatsoever we do for the defense of our own bodies is adjudged legal for which he cites bracton l i c   this c

fecisse existimetur item cum inter homines cognationem quandam constituit natura consequens est hominem homini insidiari nephas esse but this noble constitution of nature whereby we ought to esteem all mankind as brethren is utterly corrupted by the hardened iniquity of temporal governments the laws of nature and sound policy require every industrious citizen to be exercised and expert in arms of defense and peace for mutual protection but these alas are too generally discouraged and neglected whilst arms of offense and robbery are eagerly preparing in every port the unprincipled and abandoned part of mankind that lay aside all discernment between right and wrong are prompted by royal proclamations not merely to covet their neighbors goods but to lay wait for and take them whereby war is more notoriously declared and is infinitely more active against trade and the honorable merchants of the world than against the standing armies and navies of our enemies thus the seas swarm with piratical banditti carrying letters of dispensation for dishonesty and the earth is filled with violence have we not cause to expect some tremendous vengeance to vindicate the righteousness of god or that the almighty will once more command the elements to sweep corrupted man from the face of the earth we are secured indeed by divine promise from any future general destruction by a deluge

can never be annulled by any act of parliament but must ever be esteemed as immutable rights of the common law and must always remain in force unless the government should unhappily cease to be legal by setting aside the first foundations of the law ancient statutes however though not the foundation of these rights yet bear ample testimony to the exercise or usage of them for what is the power of

servaunts apprentices and villains and likewise of wards and of other young men that be above the age of xv years for all of that age are bound to have harness the word harness was used to express all necessary accoutrements for war according to the rank of the bearers and comprehended not only belts and armor but likewise arms and weapons of every sort that for the time being might be esteemed most useful so that in the old dictionary by minsheu printed in the time of king james i the word is explained by the greek plural  which signifies arms or instruments of war of all sorts in general and this is the sense also of the word armure as used in the above cited statute of winchester    king edw i which in the old english version of it is rendered harneis viz and further it is commanded that every man have in his house harneis in the original statute written in old french the word is armure which by the context must necessarily be understood to comprehend arms as well as armor for to keep the peace after the ancient assise that is to say   every man between    years of age and  0 years shall be assessed and sworn to armor according to the quantity of their lands and goods   that

also in page     of the eirenarcha a farther testimony that the law requires all laymen not only to have arms but also to be well exercised therein see title archerie if any man being the queen s subject the author wrote in the reign of queen elizabeth and not have reasonable cause or impediment and being within the age of  0 years except spiritual men justices of one bench or other justices of assise and barons of the exchequer have not a long bow and arrows ready in his house or have not used shooting therein which is a clear command to be exercised in arms or have not for every manchild in his house between   years and    of age a bow and   shafts and for every such being above    years a bow and   shafts or have not brought them up in shooting etc he loses   s   d for each month and under the same head he informs us that if any man above the age of    years have shot at any mark under eleven score yards  viz one furlong or   0 yards with any prickshaft or flight he shall  loose   s   d for every shot also if the inhabitants of any town have not made and continued their buts as they ought to do  lose  0 s for every   months eirenarcha   book p         for which he cites    hen viii c   in which indeed the obligation for every man to have arms and be exercised therein is expressed still in stronger terms viz  that butts be made on this side the feast of st michael the archangel next coming in every city town and place by the inhabitants of every such city town and place according to the law of ancient times used and that the said inhabitants and dwellers in every of them be compelled to make and continue such butts upon pain to forfeit for every   months so lacking  0 s and that the said inhabitants shall exercise themselves with longbows in shooting at the same and elsewhere in holy days and other times convenient and to the intent that every person may have bows of mean price be it enacted etc iv and v thus the law not only permits but absolutely requires every person to have arms and be exercised in the use of them  the exercise of the longbow was formerly esteemed the most effectual military discipline for the defense of the kingdom and is so declared in another act of parliament of the same year cap    diverse gentlemen yeomen and servingmen now of late have laid apart the good and laudable exercise of the longbow which always heretofore has been the surety safeguard and continual defense of this realm of england and an inestimable aread and terror to the enemies of the same extract from the preamble to the act of    hen viii c    hence it is plain that gentlemen yeomen and serving men were required by law to be exercised in the use of such arms as were esteemed the best for the safeguard and defense of the realm   and therefore as the law at that time required every man to be exercised in the use of the then fashionable weapons the reason of the law holds equally good to require the exercise of all men in the use of the present fashionable weapons the musket and bayonet  but even at that time the use of muskets or guns was allowed to the inhabitants of all cities boroughs and market towns and for the very fame reason the defense of the realm by a provisional clause of the lastmentioned act vi provided always and be it enacted etc that it shall be lawful from henceforth to all gentlemen yeomen and servingmen of every lord spiritual and temporal and of all knights esquires and gentlemen and to all the inhabitants of cities boroughs and market towns of this realm of england to shoot with any handgun demihake or hagbut at any butt or bank of earth only in place convenient for the same whereby it appears that proper places for exercise should be appointed in every town so that every such handgun etc be of the several lengths aforesaid and not under and that it shall be lawful to every of the said lord and lords knights esquires and gentlemen and the inhabitants of every city borough and market town to have and keep in every of their houses any such handgun or handguns of the length of one whole yard etc and not under to the intent to use and shoot in the same at a butt or bank of earth only as is above said whereby they and every of them by the exercise thereof in form above said may the better aid and assist to the defense of this realm when need shall require etc this statute is still in force  every temporal person was formerly liable to pecuniary penalties if he have not says lambard and keep not in readiness such horses geldings weapon armor or other furniture for the wars as after the proportion of his ability he ought to have and keep eirenarcha book iv c   p   0 thus stood the law so late as the latter end of queen elizabeths reign when the book lastcited was published and the general tenor of the doctrine respecting the right of englishmen to have arms has since been confirmed by the declaration of rights in the act of settlement   wm and mary st   c   though it seems now to be limited to protestant subjects viz that the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law  this latter expression as allowed by law respects the limitations in the abovementioned act of    hen viii c   which restrain the use of some particular sorts of arms meaning only such arms as were liable to be concealed or otherwise favor the designs of murderers as crossbows little short handguns and little hagbuts and all guns under certain lengths specified in the act but proper arms for defense provided they are not shorter than the act directs are so far from being forbidden by this statute that they are clearly authorized and the exercise thereof expressly recommended by it as i have already shown and indeed the laws of england always required the people to be armed and not only to be armed but to be expert in arms which last was particularly recommended by the learned chancellor fortescue  et revera non minime erit regno accommodum ut incolae ejus in armis sint experti  indeed it will be of no small advantage to the kingdom that the inhabitants be expert in arms de laudibus legum angliae c xliv p  0  and in the notes and remarks on this book by the learned mr justice aland we find the following observations to the same purpose in the confessors laws says he it is debent all freeman ought  debent it is their duty to have arms and to keep them always ready for the defense of the kingdom etc universi liberi homines etc arma habere et illa semper prompta conservare ad tuitionem regni etc see says he the laws of the conqueror to the same purpose the custom of the nation continues this learned judge has been to train up the freeholders to discipline v    and    c ii c iii and ib  0 and title war in the table to the statutes  among the ancient constitutions or ordinances of the kingdom recorded in the myrror of justices chap i   we read that it was ordained that every one of the age of    years and above should prepare him se apprestat to kill mortal offenders in their notorious crimes or to follow them from town to town with hue and cry etc  the true purpose and advantage of having all the inhabitants of this kingdom trained to arms is farther manifested in our old law books and statutes as in the westminster primer cap xvii on the case when any cattle are unlawfully taken and driven into any castle or strong hold etc  le visc ou le bailife prise ove luy poyar de son county ou de sa bail et voile assaier de fair de ceo repl des avers a celuy qui les aver prise etc that the sheriff or the bailiff shall take with him the power of his county or of his bailiwick and shall endeavor to make replevin or recovery of the cattle from him that has taken them etc and lord coke remarks on this  nota every man is bound by the common law to assist not only the sheriff in his office for the execution of the kings writs which are the commandments of the king according to law commandment of the king according to law any commandment of the king which falls not within this description is not binding or valid in law for the kings commands ought only to proceed by due process of the law through the kings courts of justice which are the only proper channels in which the executive power of this limited monarchy can legally flow and be exerted because it is one of the first principles of our constitution that the king can do nothing on earth as he is the minister and vicar of god but that only which he may do by the law  nihil aliud potest rex in terris cum sit dei minister et vicarius nisi id solum quod de jure potest bract lib iii c   and this teaches us how to understand the trite maxim that the king can do no wrong i e he has no legal authority to do wrong  potestas sua juris est et non injuriae bract lib iii c   he has not any peculiar prerogative either to do wrong or to decline from doing right and justice non est ulla regis prerogativa quae ex justitia et equitate quicquam derogat rot parl   hen iv number    but if any king of this limited monarchy should nevertheless wilfully do wrong and presume to rule contrary to the laws and fundamental principles of the ancient constitution he ceases to be the minister and vicar of god and in the eye of the law immediately commences minister diaboli  potestas enim juris solius est dei injuriae vero diaboli et cujus opera fecerit ejus et minister erit fleta lib i cap    p    see also in bracton lib iii cap   p  0  who after reciting the same doctrine concerning the effect of good or bad measures adds igitur dum facit rex justitiam vicarius est regis aeterni minister autem diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam and the consequence must be fatal even to the temporal state of such an one because all legal authority of the sovereign ceases in this realm if the king presumes to rule by will and pleasure instead of law for there is no king where will governs and not law non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas et non lex bract lib i c   the advisers therefore of illegal measures or any measures that require an undue influence in parliament to make them pass are so far from deserving the title of the kings friends that they are really his most dangerous enemies they are traitors whose disloyal councils lead to certain destruction as nothing but righteousness can establish the throne but also his baily that has the sheriffes warrant in that behalf has the same authority etc   inst p      the attack of a castle or place of arms must require disciplined troops and therefore it was certainly necessary that every man so bound by the common law to assist should be trained to arms in order to fulfill his duty and the learned nathaniel bacon in his historical discourse of the uniformity of the government of england  st part p    remarks that the strength consisted of the freemen and though many were bound by tenure to follow their lords to the wars and many were volunteers yet it seems all were bound upon call under peril of fine and were bound to keep arms for the preservation of the kingdom their lords and their own persons and these they might neither pawn nor sell but leave them to descend to their heirs etc  the common law right of the people of england to have arms is also clearly expressed by the great and learned judge bracton one of the most ancient writers of our common law who is justly esteemed of unexceptionable authority  ei qui just possidet licitum erit cum armis contra pacem venientem ut expellat cum armis repellere ut per arma tuitionis et pacis quae sunt justitiae repellat injuriam et vim injustam et arma injuriae etc bract lib iv c   i e  to him who justly possesses it shall be lawful with arms to repel him who comes to expel with arms against the peace that by arms of defense and peace which are of justice he may repel injury and unjust violence and arms of injustice etc  the late unhappy tumults prove that these principles of the english constitution are as necessary to be enforced at present as ever they were for had they not been fatally neglected and disused the abandoned rioters would have been quelled and secured by the neighboring inhabitants of westminster etc in their first attempts or in case they had advanced toward the city if the proper barriers had been reserved the citizens would have had time to get under arms to support their own magistrates in securing the peace of the city for any attack upon the gates or posterns would have justified an immediate discharge of firearms or other weapons against the assailants without waiting for the command of a peaceofficer and as the inhabitants of each city and county are required to make good the damages sustained on such occasions by private individuals it is plain that the inhabitants themselves in their collective capacity do form that proper power from which the law requires the prevention of such damages and the support and defense of the civil magistrates for otherwise the law ought to have directed the damages to be deducted from the last preceding parliamentary grants to the army  if it be alleged that there can be no occasion in these modern times to arm and train the inhabitants of england because there is an ample military force or standing army to preserve the peace yet let it be remembered that the greater and more powerful the standing army is so much more necessary is it that there should be a proper balance to that power to prevent any ill effects from it though there is one bad effect which the balance howsoever perfect and excellent cannot prevent and that is the enormous and ruinous expense of maintaining a large number of men without any civil employment for their support an expense which neither the land nor trade of this realm can possibly bear much longer without public failure  no englishman therefore can be truly loyal who opposes these essential principles of the english law one of the articles against cardinal wolsey    hen viii was for that he did endeavor to subvert antiquissimas leges hujus regni universumque hoc regnum angliae legibus imperialibus subjugare it is fit that those who attempt to subvert the laws should according to the old writ be carried ad goalam de newgate merito beneficium legis amittit qui legem ipsam subvertere intendit mr justice alands notes on fortescue de laudibus legum ang p    whereby the people are required to have arms of defense and peace for mutual as well as private defense for a standing army of regular soldiers is entirely repugnant to the constitution of england and the genius of its inhabitants no english king before charles ii had any other guards than his pensioners and yeomen of the guard first appointed by that great oppressor of his people henry vii save richard ii who with the aid of  000 profligate archers made himself absolute the usurper cromwell it is notorious kept up an army in support of himself and his tyranny and charles ii being connived at in keeping a few additional guards he insensibly increased their number till he left a body of men to his successor great enough to tell the parliament he would be no longer bound by the laws he had sworn to in the year      immediately after the conclusion of the war with france it is well known how far the soldiery against king williams inclination and earnest endeavors were reduced on behalf of the court it was then declared that the army was not designed to be made a part of our constitution but to be kept only for a little time till the circumstances of europe would better permit us to be without them to which it was answered and reasons given to prove that these conspirators against their country were satisfied that their continuance then was an establishment of them for ever and it was farther observed that the very discontents they might create would be made an argument for the continuing of them but if they should be kept from oppressing the people in a little time they would grow habitual to us and almost become a part of our constitution and by degrees we should be brought to believe them not only not dangerous but necessary for every body saw but few understood and those few would never be able to persuade the multitude that there was any danger in those men they had lived quietly with for some years and moreover that without dear bought experience any body may know before hand what will be the natural consequences of a standing army from the day you set them up you set up your masters you put yourselves wholly into their hands and are at their discretion it is the conquest of the nation in the silentest shortest and surest way they are able to dispose of your lives and estates at will and pleasure and what can a foreign conqueror do more if after this we live and possess any thing it is because they let us and how long that shall be neither we nor they themselves know  continued corruption standing armies etc considered      p        standing armies were not unknown indeed to our ancestors in very early times but they were happily opposed by them and declared illegal a remarkable instance of this is related by sir edward coke in his  th rep p     calvins case but with a very erroneous application of the doctrine as there are in many other instances of that particular report for which the chancellor or judges probably who spoke and not the reporter must one day be answerable it appears by bracton lib iii tract   c    fol     that canutus the danish king having settled himself in this kingdom in peace kept notwithstanding for the better continuance thereof great armies within this realm yet bracton was more wise and honorable than to conceive or hint that great armies so kept by the king were proper instruments for the better continuance of peace for he says no such thing this being only a disloyal conceit of some modern judge concerned in the argument of calvins case but to return to the words of the reporter the peers and nobles of england distasting this government by arms and armies and every englishman that has not the same distaste is surely disaffected to the true constitution and laws of his country and may justly be charged with disloyalty for none but freemen ought to be trusted with arms in a free country and not men that are enslaved under martial law in regular armies to yield an implicit active obedience to the word of command whatever it may be without distinction of good or evil odimus accipitrem quia semper vivit in armis wisely and politiquely persuaded the king that they would provide for the safety of him and his people and yet his armies carrying with them many inconveniences should be withdrawn etc this would be a proper language and true policy for a free british parliament to adopt hereupon says the reporter canutus presently withdrew his armies and within a while after he lost his crown etc  here again the judge whoever he was that spoke betrayed a most disloyal prejudice in favor of a government by arms and armies which led him into a notorious falsehood for though the former part of the sentence is true that king canute withdrew his armies yet the latter part that within a while after he lost his crown is totally false and the judge by asserting that groundless circumstance seemed inclined to insinuate that the withdrawing the armies occasioned the supposed loss of the crown which was far from being the case the great and noble canute reaped the benefit of his prudent and generous conformity to the free constitution of this limited monarchy for he enjoyed a long and glorious reign after he sent back his danish soldiers which according to matthew of westminster p  0  was in the year  0   and he held the crown with dignity and glory to the end of his life in the year  0   when he was buried at winchester with royal pomp  regio more ib p  0  and his two sons also who separately succeeded him died likewise kings of england for they lost not the kingdom but by natural deaths and the want of heirs  happy would it have been for england had all succeeding kings been as wise and truly politic as the great canute who feared not to commit the care of his own person and those of his foreign friends that attended him to the free laws and limited constitution of this kingdom  the old english maxim however against a government by arms and armies ought never to be forgotten  odimus accipitrem quia semper vivit in armis   june    0 a general militia acting by a wellregulated rotation is the only safe means of defending a free people a general militia acting by a wellregulated rotation is the only safe means of defending a free people the establishment of standing armies is perhaps the most dangerous of all political expedients and has been fatal to the liberty of every nation upon earth that has adopted it and therefore though the doctrine of necessity is generally pleaded to excuse the measure yet there seems rather a necessity of absolutely rejecting it and of forming the national defense upon some other less dangerous plan  the service of a national militia may be divided into equal proportions of attendance by rotation so as to inculcate and diffuse a sufficient knowledge of arms and military discipline throughout the whole body of a nation or people and thereby supersede the baneful necessity of keeping regular troops or standing armies of mercenaries  whenever the public safety demands the assembling and continuance of a large body of troops in actual service to watch and resist the motions of any powerful invader a regular military roster of service from the whole national militia is the safest and best means of forming and continuing such an army in the field because it would be not only the least burdensome to individuals but also less dangerous to the community at large for if the regularity of rotation were duly observed no man would be so long detained from his ordinary calling and occupation as to lose his civil capacity and way of livelihood at home nor be thereby unwarily drawn into a separate interest from his fellowcitizens which was unhappily the case of the parliaments army in      for after having bravely defended the national liberty for some years this very army became the instrument of a most hateful national bondage under a military tyrant  the nature of a roster is well described by general bland in his treatise of military discipline from p     to     when a great army is formed by several nations in alliance which send into the field each of them a different number of battalions a roster is esteemed the best expedient for regulating and dividing the general service into due proportions amongst them all and general bland has given in p   0 of the abovementioned treatise the form of such a roster general for the detaching of battalions according to that in flanders in   0  he has also given tables of proportion for detaching private men that is for detaching them from the several battalions in the field that the danger and fatigue of the service especially at sieges may be equally divided among them and nearly on the same plan tables might be formed for detaching the individuals of a national militia from the several parishes or districts to which they belong in due proportion to the number of males enrolled in each of them whereby the hardship and inconveniences of military duty for the common safety would be equally divided among the whole nation and of course the time of actual service would be most profitably diminished to each individual whilst the knowledge of arms and discipline would be regularly circulated into all parts of the country and with it also such a sensible perception to each individual of his fellowship or incorporation with the whole national community as would plainly tend to prevent all partial and undue emulation of particular counties or districts against their neighbors for by such provincial jealousies the ancient states of greece were unhappily disunited and their attention withdrawn from that true mutual interest and defense of each other without which none of them could long subsist in freedom whereas if on the contrary they had been inured to the social duty of serving in one common army drawn equally from each confederate state by a proper table of proportion and duly changed by rotation to prevent them from becoming mere soldiers there would have been no just cause to be jealous of each others power as between the athenians and lacedaemonians etc for all successes as well as losses would have been equally divided among them so that no particular state could have acquired by victory any enviable advantages peculiar to itself to incite the jealousy of the rest but every individual in every part would by these means have been led to consider himself not merely as a member of a single petty state or district but with a more enlarged idea of his own social character as a member rather of the whole community of free citizens throughout all greece for the circulation a rotation or general circulation of public duty may be compared to those wheels within wheels which give life vigor and activity to a whole community by enabling it howsoever extensive and scattered with respect to local situation to move and exert itself as one united living body actuated by one spirit like as the hosts or armies of the commonwealth of israel are typified by the cherubim or four living creatures as represented in the standards of the four principal tribes united in one animated system of action moving altogether with wheels or rotations and wings full of eyes within and without  for in a state that is perfectly free and in such only the eyes of the several individuals of which it is composed are permitted to look forward with effect to the true interests of the community at large and may well be considered as the eyes figuratively represented in the whole body of the cherubim and in all their parts their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels full of eyes round about every eye in that great united figurative body of the cherubim helping to enlighten the intention and thereby influence the motion or government of the whole   of the roster would have been a most effectual bond of union to secure the connection and communication of the most distant branches of the confederacy and by preserving the general body of the people in their civil capacity and ordinary occupations it would also have rendered them less liable to be drawn from the common interest of the state at large partially to favor the arbitrary designs of any usurping commander in chief or petty tyrant for no generalofficer had such a confederacy of national union been duly established would have been able to assume more power and authority than what was fairly delegated by the majority of suffrages in one great united general council of chosen citizens from every part  the general body of individuals in such a case indeed submit themselves to serve by rotation the humble station of private soldiers but the time of service being limited and equal to all men in duration it would be no great hardship especially if each freeman that bears arms was allowed his natural right of suffrage in the state his due share of legislative influence to control the commanders and regulate the service  in a nation consisting of six millions of souls which number england is commonly said to contain the number of males capable of bearing arms and who according to natural right are justly entitled also to a share in the legislature would be estimated at a fourth part of that number according to the most general mode of estimation viz   00000 men from which number a roster of actual service from home only for one month each man in the space of a whole year would supply a constant army in the field of    000 men if so many were necessary a continual change every month or every fourteen days of half a battalion at a time out of each district or still in smaller proportions viz a few companies at a time or even by halfcompanies from smaller divisions or parishes would be most advisable that every part of the country might always retain nearly the proportion of eleven parts out of twelve of its own militia as well for the purposes of guarding it as to carry on the ordinary cultivation and other necessary local occupations without interruption persons above the common rank might serve in squadrons of horse if they preferred that kind of service as equites or esquires those men whose time of service approached as being next upon the established roster should be more carefully exercised at home after the hours of labor for one month at least before their time of marching by these means they would be prepared for the service and the very march if properly conducted would add to their discipline the certainty of returning when relieved by companies of their neighbors in so short a time as one month if they lived so long or two months allowing for the march out and home would much reduce the anxiety of parting from their families and friends  it will probably be objected that a national militia which has been exercised only in small bodies is incapable of effectual service against an enemy but for this a remedy may be found let the army be first formed in a separate encampment at such convenient distance from the enemy that they may not be liable to an immediate attack  a central situation must of course be chosen for this camp of discipline where the several companies from the whole nation may be regimented under proper generalofficers and be daily exercised in large bodies for a whole month or six weeks if necessary before they are brought to face the enemy and for this reason it would be expedient to require from each individual i mean the first time he is entered on the roster one month or six weeks attendance more than the generally established proportion of time on the roster which would be only once in his whole lifetime and therefore no great hardship in order to be exercised with a large body of troops in some of the principal and most necessary movements and evolutions for the field and after the month or six weeks training in the camp of discipline an army of    000 men might be marched to the camp or camps of actual service to do duty for the time allotted to each upon the roster against the common enemy and the number might be continually kept up by monthly detachments of battalions from the first camp of discipline in proportion as the time of service allotted to each of the former companies upon the roster should expire the country would also be guarded by the returning disciplined companies dispersed in every part and the knowledge of arms and discipline by the time a single circulation of the roster was completed  viz in one year would be diffused throughout the whole nation which would thereby be enabled afterward to exert itself gloriously upon any sudden emergency for it might afford to bear even the loss of six such capital armies of    000 viz in all   0000 men before it would be necessary to increase the time of service from one month to two months actual service for each disciplined man in a whole year with so small a portion of time employed in military service every man might preserve his ordinary occupation either in trade or husbandry and maintain his rank and situation in life with his family as a free citizen in his own district at all other times when the roster of public service did not demand his personal attendance from home but when by a contrary method a national militia is so long continued in actual service without rotation as to inure the individuals to a neglect and disuse of their ordinary employments in their respective counties and districts they gradually lose their civil capacity and from free citizens are apt to become mere soldiers dependent on their military sold or stipend and the favor of superiors whereby they acquire such a slavish submission to command be it just or unjust that they readily undertake to execute those very measures and designs which they themselves perhaps have previously condemned alleging that a soldier has no right to judge for himself thus indiscriminately applying to the general propriety or impropriety of any military undertaking a principle which properly relates only to the necessary discipline and mode of conducting it in the field after a man has absolutely consented and engaged to serve in it and that a soldier must go say they wherever he is ordered without any demur about the propriety or injustice of the service so that they establish not only a passive but an active obedience to the will of others which makes the profession dishonorable  dishonorable i mean in those who admit this doctrine of unlimited obedience which is derogatory to their natural dignity as men for they give up an indispensible quality of human nature the right of discerning between good and evil which is nothing less than a desertion or apostatising from the duty which every man owes to god and his eternal laws and thereby render themselves and their profession the bane of every state where they are established and a disgrace to human nature  remarks concerning the trained bands of london remarks concerning the trained bands of london the militia or trained bands of london have never been known to misbehave in actual service however despicable they may appear in their annual musters  citizens of london from the most ancient times were required to keep arms in their houses the annual muster is rather a muster of the arms than of the men who would probably go out to actual service if there should be really occasion for them but even the meanest of the men as they now are generally sent out being for the most part substitutes if they were exercised for a few hours three times a week only for one month and restrained from the use of strong liquors during the time of exercise would be found more serviceable if there was any real occasion of public defense than is generally conceived  of this real facts afford the best proof the irregularity of the trained bands and want of discipline were as conspicuous and notorious it seems in the year      as at present for when capt skippon afterward major general was directed by the parliament to attend them as a guard with two companies of the trained bands of london lord clarendons account of that matter is expressed in the following contemptuous terms this man says he meaning skippon marched that day in the head of their tumultuary army to the parliament house bk iv p   0 yet lord clarendon himself makes ample reparation to the trained bands for this contempt when he speaks of their unexpected behavior at the battle of newbery for though he allows their inexperience both of danger and service he expressly attributes to the steadiness of the trained bands the preservation of the parliaments army no troops in the kingdom had at that time been able to withstand the spirited charges of prince ruperts welldisciplined horse till this tumultuary army which seems to be an exact description also of their present musters for the first time compelled them to wheel about  rapin speaks of the brave defense of the infantry on that day in very high terms but without mentioning what particular troops they were so that no reader would suspect that he described the actions of the tumultuary army of the city  after the prince had routed the cavalry of the enemy says rapin meaning the parliaments cavalry he fell upon their infantry which though deprived of the help of the cavalry received him with so much intrepidity that he was repulsed several times without being able ever to penetrate apres avoir mis en deroute la cavalerie des ennemis il alla tomber sur leur infanterie qui bien que denuee du secours de la cavalerie le recut avec tant dintrepidie quil fut repousse plusieurs fois sans quil put jamais la percer rapin tom viii p     but lord clarendon heartily attributes the glory of the day to those whom he before despised as a tumultuary army  the london trained bands says he and auxiliary regiments of whose inexperience of danger or any kind of service beyond the easy practice of their postures in the artillerygarden men had till then too cheap an estimation behaved themselves to wonder and were in truth the preservation of that army that day for they stood as a bulwark and rampire to defend the rest whereby he attributes to them the chief resistance and when their wings of horse were scattered and dispersed kept their ground so steadily that though prince rupert himself led up the choice horse to charge them and endured their storm of small shot he could make no impression upon their stand of pikes but was forced to wheel about of so sovereign benefit and use is that readiness order and dexterity in the use of their arms which has been so much neglected bk vii p      thus the city pikemen are commended as a standard pattern of military discipline viz for their readiness order and dexterity in the use of arms by the very same historian who had entitled them a tumultuary army a very short time before this occasion which extorted his commendation a moderate and sufficient discipline for real service is more easily and sooner acquired than people generally conceive and nothing is wanting to the present establishment of city trained bands but more frequent musters for about an hour or an hour and a half at a time after the hours of labor for if they were allowed this advantage they would be nearly upon the same footing as the militia of new england connecticut etc which lately conquered the welldisciplined army of general burgoyne they would be nearly upon the same footing i say except in one point which is that the new england militia have always maintained the ancient constitutional right of choosing their own officers in the public folkmotes which the learned judge atkins by the best authorities has proved to be the original constitution of our national militia polit tracts p      the present establishment of the county regiments of militia savours too much of a standing army both in discipline and the effect of the service upon the common men who by being absent too long a time from their families and ordinary occupations are apt to become mere soldiers despising their former trades and employments and consequently ceasing to be citizens  nothing surely can be more dangerous to a free state than such an effect as this for the professed soldier generally gives up to superior command command is properly imperium the essence of empire  for the title of imperator or emperor originally signified nothing more than the commander in chief of the army and though this power of command was generally delegated at first by the election and appointment of the people or senate and of course was esteemed subject to their control yet by the usurpations of successful military chiefs when the forces under their command have been detained so long in actual service as to lose their civil capacity and become a standing army of mere soldiers dependent on their sold or military pay instead of their former civil connections and useful occupations it has always been liable to be changed from a limited command to merum imperium or absolute dominion which leopold metastafius a learned roman advocate very properly styles belluina potestas a beastly power a term which most aptly characterizes the enormity and consequent illegality of unlimited monarchy and this use of the term belluina potestas is strictly legal and justifiable because it is the very mark by which the prophets of god have branded all the arbitrary dominations of mankind from the babylonian head of the great and terrible image of tyranny down to its very toes the present divided kingdoms of the earth which still exist in power and must so continue for some little time longer for the punishment and destruction of depraved man until it shall please god in his mercy to break them in pieces by his eternal kingdom which will then become a mountain or earthly establishment of government and fill the whole earth dan ii       for all the said temporal empires and kingdoms are included in the prophetic representation of four great and terrible beasts see dan vii so that the belluina potestas is undeniably attributed to all of them and that we may more clearly demonstrate that the term denotes a power unlimited by law and due popular control it is necessary to remark that the characteristical property of each of these beastly empires is  to do according to his will that is without limitation of law right or other just control in favor of the people such unlimited will at is called absolute i e loosed from all due restraint of the people or other obligation whatsoever this bestial mark of absolute will was the characteristical property of the first beast the babylonian head or winged lion of the chaldees  whom he would nay the proper chaldee word for will both verb and noun he slew and whom he would  he kept alive and whom he would  again he set up and whom he would  once more he put down dan v    so that the will of the monarch was manifestly the only law of that empire and the unhappy effects of such unlimited power even to the monarch himsself is strongly marked in the very next verse but when his heart was lifted up the natural consequence of such undue exaltation an excellent antidote against the evil of royal will or undue exaltation is prescribed in deuteronomy xvii    0 viz that the king shall write out for himself a copy or rather a duplicate  of this law i e those written laws of god which had twice been solemnly read not only in the presence but in the ears or hearing of all the people and had as often been solemnly confirmed at each public reading by the voluntary assent of all the people saying  all that the lord has said will we do exodus xxiv    thus the divine laws became the regular statutes of that nation and it viz the kings own written duplicate of the law shall be with him and be shall read therein all the day of his life that be may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them and the reason of thus limiting the royal will by laws and statutes is assigned in the very next sentence that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right band or to the left which is surely a strict limitation of the regal power a measure highly important to the true interst even of the monarch himself viz to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel and in like manner the kings of all christian nations should be limited by the same statutes excepting only those statutes which were merely ceremonial or temporary and they should be still farther limited by the more perfect statutes of the christian revelation without being allowed the least power of will or prerogative to turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left that the declared purposes of the gospel in behalf of man viz on earth peace good will toward men may be effectually established and that the will of our heavenly father which is always righteousness and peace may be done on earth as it is in heaven for that is the true effect of the approaching kingdoms of god on earth which all christians are taught to promote by their daily prayers but the princes of the world under the influence of our spiritual enemy the dragon which has given his power to the beast do openly oppose the effectual establishment of gods kingdom on earth by impiously claiming to themselves a royal prerogative to make war or peace without the advice and assent of the people or congregation which is manifestly to lift up their hearts above their brethren and of course the earth it once more filled with violence see p   whereby the royal promoters of it are rendered dreadfully obnoxious to the vengeance and retribution of the almighty when his approaching kingdom shall come to destroy the destroyers of the earth   rev xi     but if kings would be contented to govern with legal authority i e authority duly limited by the uninfluenced representation of each nation or people freely and equally elected for every session of each national council and would after the example of king canute magnanimously rely under god on their national hosts of free armed citizens instead of standing armies for the security of their crowns they would stand clear of the heavy judgments denounced against the body of the beast and would have no cause to fear the approaching kingdom of god nor the irresistible stroke by which it will break in pieces the whole image of tyranny and cut off all the horns or crowns of the wicked psa lxxv   and lxxvi    for legal kings are effectually secured by the scripture promises in favor of righteousness  viz that the horns or rather crowns of the righteous shall be exalted psa lxxv   so that they may truly hope to reign with the just when the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high etc dan vii     and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts a notable instance of gods vengeance against the belluina potestas of royal will and pleasure  and his dwelling was with the wild asses etc dan v     0 etc by this very example did the holy prophet reprove a wicked and unbridled descendant of the same monarch just before the total dissolution of his empire as he had also previously warned the royal ancestor himself to break off his sins by righteousness etc which would have effectually restored due limitations to his government and destroyed the baneful belluina potestas which occasioned the warning but the counsel was neglected and of course the monarch was humbled and his empire ruined for then were the wings of the beast of babylon plucked and his dominion taken away dan vii    absolute will was also the essential property of the succeeding empire or the second beast viz the medopersian monarchy described elsewhere under the figure of an impetuous ram which pushed westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but the prophet now adds the principal bestial or brutal mark he did according to his will and became great dan viii   for after the persian monarchs had once acquired the baneful belluina potestas by the establishment of standing armies in every province even the onceboasted laws of the medes and persians became as vague and uncertain as the royal will and pleasure to which they were of course subjected howsoever unchangeable they might have been reputed in the commencement of that empire  neither was the third beast the cruel fourheaded flying leopard of the grecian empire without the same characteristical mark of absolute will though it is not expressly annexed to daniels description of that compound of tyranny in his seventh chapter but in the farther description of the grecian empire chap xi v   the same wilful or unlimited dominion is clearly foretold a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and then follows the mark of the beast  and shall do according to his will  the king mentioned in the   th verse that shall do according to his will and exalt himself and magnify himself above every god is generally understood to denote the fourth and last beast or empire which still exists being that most noxious and tremendous beast with iron teeth described in dan vii    which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue under his feet i e in the most violent and beastlike manner which is plainly to  do according to his will we see then how aptly unlimited command or merum imperium is expressed by the term belluina potestas  the unlimited will of a king is so great an abomination in the eye of the english common law that the exercise of it in this country is declared to be an effectual disqualification or abasement from the regal dignity for there is no king where will governs and not law  non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas et non lex bract lib i c    a king of england ceases to be king when he ceases to be limited by the law for it is a rule of the common law that a king can do nothing i e by virtue of his office on earth while he is the minister and vicar of god except that alone which by law he may  nihil enim potest rex in terris etc nisi id solum quod de jure potest etc see the note in pages    and    and therefore when the law is suspended or set aside which is the highest and most baneful injustice the kings power ceases to be ae jure for in the eye of the law he is esteemed minister diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam so that he and his ministers reduce themselves thereby to the common level of all other bad men and whatsoever power or force in that case they may be able to exert has no better foundation than the temporary power of banditti which may be lawfully and conscientiously resisted by all men  a king of england therefore though he is supreme or sovereign in personal dignity and rank yet he is not so in will and power because in these the law to avoid the belluina potestas of absolute monarchy requires that he should be duly limited by the people a necessary distinction this respecting supremacy of which the unfortunate k cha i seems not to have been aware or he would not with his dying breath have denied the peoples right to a share in the government saying  it is not for having share in government sir that is nothing pertaining to them a subject and a sovereign are clear different things etc  and so they certainly are with respect to personal dignity or rank when compared as individuals and yet the sovereignty or supreme power belongs of right to the people i e to the majority of them or to the majority of their duly elected representatives and therefore we may say with that learned casuist bp tailor in his ductor dubitantium lib iii c rule   p     it is but a weak and useless distinction when we speak of kings and princes by them meaning the supreme power to say that some are absolute some are limited in their power  that is the distinction is weak and useless only when we mean to speak of the supreme power this is clearly the bishops meaning as the following context will show for otherwise the distinction to be made between absolute and limited kings and princes is so far from being weak and useless that it is the necessary and proper criterion between the illegal and legal dominion of kings the limited alone being legal in this kingdom for the bishop adds it is true that some princes are so i e are limited in their power but then says he they are not the supreme power this is directly to the point in question and he adds a farther illustration of it it is a contradiction says he to say that the supreme power is limited or restrained for that which restrains it is superior to it and therefore the other is not supreme that a king ought not to have the supreme power is clearly laid down by the best writers on the english common law and particularly by judge bracton one of the most ancient as well as the most respectable authorities rex sub deo et lege rex habet superiorem deum scilicet item legem per quam factus est rex item curiam suam viz comes barons etc bract lib   c xvi p    lex fraenum est potentiae etc  that such a power of restraint is vested in the law as well as in the legislators of this limited monarchy is clearly proved by mr acherley in his book on free parliaments he argues from the words of the original writs of summons to parliament  that the determining or decisive power demanded by the said writs  ad faciendum ea i e the insuperable and urgent businesses for which the parliament is called is derived from the people and is independent and his inference is good and he gives a remarkable instance of this independent power in the people which is their answer to the pope respecting the banishment of adomar bp of winchester in      ann    hen   viz si dominus rex et regni majores hoc vellent communitas tamen ipsius adomar ingressum in angliam jam nullatenus sustineret that if the king and lords would do this thing meaning if they would revoke the banishment yet the commons would not suffer or bear adomars residence in england and the commons caused their speaker petrus de montford vice totius communitatis to sign and he did sign this answer p    from this example therefore as well as from a great multitude of other instances of the power of the english commons it is manifest that there is no supreme power in england without the concurrence and assent of the people not a general assent once for all to throw the supremacy into other hands but an especial assent for every new circumstance that may be liable to affect their interest for which cause also parliaments ought indispensably to be newly elected every session according to ancient usage i e every year once and more often if need be and that in as equal a proportion of representation as possible because the more equitable in this point it is made the more conducive it will surely be to the happiness and true permanent interest both of king and people  but if on the contrary by the modern innovations of triennial and septennial elections reduction of the right of voting venality of almost depopulated boroughs etc the supreme power should be gradually corrupted it must become a supreme evil to the destruction of good government and peace for in such a corrupted state nothing can thrive under it but standing armies and that which always regularly attends their establishment throughout all the branches of the fourth or roman tyranny i mean the belluina potestas of imperial will and command against which the vengeance of the almighty is clearly denounced so that those persons who yield themselves instruments to promote either the one or the other are guilty of the grossest impiety a free militia therefore is the only just and legal means of internal national defense   that indispensible human right of judging between good and evil which alone constitutes the distinction between men and brutes and through a false notion of military honor the soldier is apt to think that his duty requires an implicit active obedience on all occasions whereby the standing armies of all nations are constantly and regularly the tools of despotism and the bane of all good and limited government  a national militia therefore ought to be constituted upon principles as opposite to those of standing armies as possible and no rules or arrangements whatever that may tend to detach men from their ordinary callings and employments as free citizens ought on any account to be admitted  the citymilitia even upon its present establishment was always respectable when real service was wanted  hints of some general principles which may be useful to military associations hints of some general principles which may be useful to military associations as the sole purpose of military associations is to support the civil magistrate and to join the power of the county when legally summoned by sheriffs etc for common defense it is necessary that each associated company be formed upon principles as opposite to those of standing armies valor and good discipline excepted as can possibly be devised  the freedom and equal natural rights of individuals and the preservation of their civil capacity must therefore be considered as objects of the utmost importance and consideration in order to which the freedom of election in the appointment of officers and a frequent renewal of choice therein are absolutely necessary to be maintained  let the whole corpse of associators in every neighborhood or vicinage divide themselves into small bodies of ten persons each in their respective districts and let each ten or decennary choose from among themselves a tithingman or sergeant to superintend the discipline of the ten and to receive and communicate to them all summonses from the civil magistrate or orders from the committee of association and to transact such other business as the nature of the association may require the power of the sergeants nevertheless to be subject to the control of a majority of the ten who choose them respectively and no other military officers should be appointed except officers of platoons for a single day viz when the corpse is divided into platoons for exercise agreeable to the mode recommended by general bland p    at which time each platoon ought to choose its own leader whose power should cease with that days exercise an experienced person must however be chosen at a previous general meeting to instruct and direct the corpse in the general maneuvers and evolutions of the field who should from time to time be appointed commandingofficer of the day in times of actual service the lord mayor or either of the sheriffs that are present must be considered as the legal commander of the association  as three decennaries or sergeants guards will be the proper complement for a platoon so two platoons or six decennaries being sixty men will be a convenient number for a company and ten such companies a sufficient number for a battalion or ward division as it will be equal to two townships or two county hundreds  there should be within each ward several places appointed for drilling or teaching the common exercise to small parties and also one place more spacious for those that are become expert in handling their arms to be taught the platoon exercise to form themselves into companies to march wheel etc but if a place cannot be found within the ward sufficiently spacious for such a general exercise of the whole body it is probable that two or three places may be found therein sufficient for the exercise of single companies or at least of single platoons which should be appropriated accordingly and none of these places of exercise should be open to the inspection of strangers as it must be irksome to gentlemen to be overlooked before they have acquired some tolerable knowledge of the military discipline one place of general rendezvous should likewise be appointed within each ward for the neighbors to assemble in case of any sudden alarm  to prevent the individuals of the association from being injured in their civil capacity care must be taken that the times of drilling and private exercise be appointed both before and after the usual hours of labor and that an option be given to the learners of attending either at the morning or evening exercise as shall be most convenient to themselves that no man may be induced to neglect or injure his ordinary calling or occupation by which his civil capacity is maintained and for the same reason the times of public exercise in larger bodies should not be more frequent than is absolutely necessary for acquiring a moderate and useful discipline rather than a critical nicety in the military maneuvers which latter would take up more time than men of business can usually spare and which must finally have the bad effect of tiring out many of the most useful members of society and therefore it is not only necessary to restrain the too great frequency of such meetings but also the duration of each meeting that as little time may be lost to the individuals as possible and that those who attend may not incur the necessity of taking any refreshment whatsoever while they are out on exercise or in going or returning which would otherwise occasion many inconveniences too obvious to be mentioned besides an unnecessary expense to individuals which ought certainly to be avoided in large promiscuous societies because all cannot equally afford it but if any man has acquired so depraved an appetite that he cannot endure four or six hours exercise and a general review if properly conducted will not require more time without taking food or liquor he ought to be esteemed totally unqualified for the association till he can cure himself of such an unmanly and disgraceful habit which is entirely inconsistent with the military duty even of a citizen  single decennaries single platoons or even single companies should not be permitted to march into the country with their arms and uniforms by way of exercise or amusement to themselves without an express leave given by a general meeting of the associators nor without due caution to be taken for preserving good order by the attendance of a sufficient number of peaceofficers to prevent any disputes or affrays with strangers lest the indiscretion of a few individuals of the corpse on such an excursion should injure the reputation of the whole body of associators and the third rule given by a very ingenious and learned writer in a tract entitled an inquiry into the legal mode of suppressing riots should be strictly observed that the association should not unnecessarily march through streets or highroads nor make any the least military parade but consider themselves entirely as a part of the civil state and they ought also carefully to observe the caution referred to by his fifth rule respecting the use of arms in suppressing riots viz that it is extremely hazardous for private persons to proceed to those extremities in common cases and that they should not attend to any private person that shall presume to raise the power of the county which is the province of the sheriff undersheriff or magistrate but let them wait for a legal summons from those that have the proper authority before they take their arms to assist in keeping the peace though they have certainly a right to assemble as neighbors without their arms to consult and use all peaceable endeavors to allay or prevent the ill consequences of any sudden commotion that has occasioned an alarm  by the constitution of this kingdom as well as by many express laws still in force apprentices wards and indeed laymen of all ranks and conditions from fifteen to sixty years of age are required to have arms and be duly exercised in the use of them for the national defense see p     it would therefore well become the housekeepers of every ward and particularly those who are members of any wardassociation to encourage their apprentices servants and dependents to learn their military exercise with the common militiaarms belonging to each house at such places in the ward as may be appointed for that purpose the expense of which should first be defrayed by the respective wardassociations until the utility of the measure is rendered obvious to the wards at large that the housekeepers at each wardmote maybe induced to adopt it for by these means the housekeepers might always have a sufficient number of able and wellinstructed substitutes to serve for them in the militia which would thereby be rescued from the opprobrium of incapacity with which it has so frequently of late been charged and the necessity of any new reform of the citymilitia which might be attended with very dangerous consequences to the rights and liberties of citizens would be thereby precluded and if in case of any more tumults or riots an armed citywatch should again be thought necessary these disciplined militiasubstitutes in each ward might be enrolled in a roster for that particular service under the proper militiaofficers and their attendance might be so divided and diminished by a due roster as to be very little burdensome to the individuals enrolled whereby a small stipend to each for the time of his actual attendance would be sufficient to render the service voluntary or volunteers might be invited by rewarding a certain adequate proportion of watchduty with the freedoms of the city and by ordaining that no artificer or journeyman employed in the city be molested as a nonfreeman provided he enters himself a volunteer
