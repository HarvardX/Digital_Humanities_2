every man his own physician  being a complete collection of efficacious and approved remedies for every disease incident to the human body  with plain instructions for their common use  necessary to be had in all families particularly those residing in the country  by john theobald m d author of medulla medicinae  compiled at the command of his royal highness the duke of cumberland  diseases are cured not by eloquence but by remedies so that if a person without any learning be well acquainted with those remedies that have been discovered by practice he will be a much greater physician than one who has cultivated his talent in speaking without experience  celsus the fifth edition improved  london printed and sold by w griffin in fetterlane r withy in cornhill and g kearsly in ludgate street  mdcclxiv  price eighteenpence  preface although publishers of receipts have been always very numerous yet it has so happened that the least able have hitherto undertaken this task as the most easy and likely to answer any mercenary views which seems to have been the reason that more able persons have neglected it as an under part of their profession nevertheless i have persuaded myself that i should perform a work neither entirely void of use nor foreign to the duties of my profession if i made the public partakers of the principal helps against most diseases which i had either learned by long experience or selected from the writings of the most eminent physicians as these receipts are published chiefly for the use of persons residing in the country whose convenience or abilities will not allow of the attendance of a physician or apothecary i have studied plainness in my style and in my directions with regard to the treatment of diseases that i might render this treatise as useful as possible  j theobald  preface to the second edition the favorable reception this work has met with as is sufficiently shown by the remarkable quick sale of the first large impression has induced the editor to support the credit of what is really beneficial to the public and add weight to the receipts to publish the authorities from whence those receipts were taken and to make it still more useful has added the signs of diseases and some plain and concise directions for bleeding he begs leave to remark that although dr theobald has given no more than one receipt for the cure of several disorders yet he has been careful to select such only as upon a long experience were found to be the best and that although receipts are given for diseases which are seldom cured as the apoplexy consumption etc yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of these complaints there is the greatest reason to imagine that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect
