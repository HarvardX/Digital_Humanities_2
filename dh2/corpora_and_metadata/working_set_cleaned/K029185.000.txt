an essay for abridging the study of physic to which is added a dialogue betwixt hygeia mercury and pluto relating to the practice of physic as it is managed by a certain illustrious society as also an epistle from usbek the persian to j  w  d esquire  london printed for j wilford behind the chapter house near st pauls churchyard       prince one shilling  to the antacademic philosophers to the generous despisers of the schools to the deservedlycelebrated j  w  d j  m  r and the rest of the numerous sect of inspired physicians this little work is humbly inscribed by  their most devoted servant and zealous admirer  an essay for abridging the study of physic sic ubi visceribus gravidae telluris imago effecta est hominis foeto consurgit in arvo quodque magis mirum simul edita concutit arma ovid metamorph our university method of studying physic is attended with so many discouragements it is such an expensive tedious difficult way to science that one who has any talent at projecting cannot i think employ it more humanely than in putting the distressed youth upon a shorter and easier road the pride and ill nature perhaps the avarice too of the learned in every science would gladly make a mystery of the art they profess and render it inaccessible but to a few ask a gentleman of the aesculapian tribe what course of education is requisite to the making of a physician he will presently tell you that a young man who would successfully apply himself to the study of medicine must first of all have an understanding capable of instruction and that after he is pretty far advanced in the languages and such other pieces of learning as he imagines to be necessarily previous and introductory to physic he must study every particular branch of that science under able teachers and labor night and day for god knows how many years before he can be supposed fit to practice very modest demands truly this is either the most malicious fetch or the simplest mistake in the world for in reality learning is no more necessary to a physician than to a fiddler and for all this pother i am mistaken too if i cannot lay down a method by the religious and strict observance of which a young man whatever his natural sense be may in two or three years time without any expense either of money or animal spirits worth calculating drop into the world not only a ripe surgeon or physician but physician surgeon and apothecary all in one but before i proceed to communicate my scheme i here solemnly declare that i have not the least pique at the present faculty of physicians nay that i honor that learned society but amicus plato amicus socrates magis amica veritas it were a piece of complaisance unworthy a truly generous and extensivelybenevolent disposition to conceal such means as must evidently make the acquisition of an useful art much easier merely for the sake of indulging the narrow humor of it is present professors who grudge that any should rise to the dignities and privileges of their profession with less pain and charge than themselves have done  well then to begin with the previous qualifications of our student he must be provided by bountiful nature with an inexhaustible fund of assurance that cardinal virtue which without the assistance of any other is sufficient to make a great man a little sense would not be amiss but as this is seldom an ingredient in a constitution where the other predominates and as it is not absolutely necessary we shall not reckon upon it impudence alone will do for it gives such a force to the otherways lightest merit that the address or rather the assault of a man who possesses it to any eminent degree is not to be resisted if besides he can make a shift to read corderius with the help of a dictionary that is to say if he has a quantum sufficit of latin to enable him to understand a recipe and to accent a hard word gracefully he is now fitted to attempt the most arduous parts of the study  as soon therefore as our young man is thus hopefully qualified let him forthwith be bound apprentice for two or three years to an apothecary who presides like a wholesome planet over some countrytown shedding kindly influence for several miles round him his main business during the time of his apprenticeship will be to spread now and then a plaster sometimes to make up an electuary or a mass of pills to administer clysters in great abundance and to manage the nonnaturals of the gaunt hidebound steed upon whose back his master ranges the country like the king of terrors on his pale horse though this last may not appear to be a very liberal office yet as far as it will give him an occasion to become acquainted with the constitution of that generous animal and with the general regimen that suits it best he will find it of mighty advantage to him afterward when he comes to exercise the hippohiatrical function the cultivation of which makes a very considerable article in the practice of medicine in some parts of the country when he is at leisure from these more important duties he may if he pleases glance over some short general system of anatomy i must own indeed this is almost a needless trouble yet i would have him able to tell upon occasion whether the stomach lies in the abdomen or in the thorax and the like if it were only for ornaments sake and to keep him in countenance among those people who have got a notion that some acquaintance with the structure of the human body is necessary to a physician for we must not hope to reform the world all at once when he has thus laid a good foundation in anatomy to which i allow him a month or if his master rides much and the roads are dirty six weeks let him proceed to the practice of physic and surgery a short system for each will be sufficient he will frequently have occasion to practice chemie under his masters eye and thus may gain a competent skill in this branch of the study without the fatigue of reading a botanist he must grow whether he will or not and as for the materia medica and methodus praescribendi he may make himself master of these in this manner as often as a physicians bill comes to his masters shop let him out with his pocketbook slap it down and make it his own according to mr bayess rule of records as he must have frequent access to know against what disease this or that prescription was designed let him therefore devote a page or so in his pocketcompanion to every disease and under each of these let him range the prescriptions adapted thereto thus when he engages in the practice himself whatever disease shall fall in his way he has no more to do but turn over his vade mecum where he will probably find something proper for it with regard to the different stages of diseases the various combinations of symptoms and the like these are subtle trifles that none but your whimsical people give themselves any trouble about in the mean time su receipts as he has not got sufficient intelligence to warrant his reducing under the article of any disease will serve him in good stead  anomalous cases which in all probability will frequently occur to him if by sollowing this course he is not furnished with a complete system of recipes by the time that his apprenticeship is expired let him consult markhams english housewifes skill in physic to be found in the quarto edition of his works where he will meet with receipts that will either help or prove a sovereign cure in every disease i have known very valuable collections of this kind in the hands of some ladies  behold what a bare simple thing is physic when it is showy luxuriances it is fruitless branches are lopped off vain swelling science how much art thou shrunk how is the learning of the eastern and the western schools how are the toils of the ancient sages and those of modern days swallowed up almost at once by a boy and a boy of no great depth neither for now is the grand affair finished and our scholar is perfectly well instructed in every part of his study i shall appeal to himself if he is not if a young man blessed with these natural gifts i have demanded after such a happy education is not conscious of greater abilities than almost any of those you call regular physicians i am much mistaken this very show of merit though he possessed nothing at all of the substance will recommend him prodigiously to the vulgar great and small that is to say to nineteen at least of twenty parts of mankind who are such humane judges of a mans qualifications that they never seek further than his own word for them but always measure his abilities by his pretensions now i say our young doctor may go where he pleases he cannot fail to be by this time a skilful apothecary and for physic and surgery it is strange if he is not equally qualified for practicing either ubique gentium or if he finds his genius more particularly turned to one disease than to the rest he may with considerable emolument both to himself and the public confine his practice to that and may make a good figure as an antidysenteric or antimaniac physician as a vermicide a toothdrawer or a corncutter and if he applies himself to the obstetrical art let him turn over culpeppers midwife enlarged night and day that little book is worth a whole library all that is possible to be known in that art is there treasured up in a small duodecimo blessed yea for ever blessed be the memory of the inimitable author who and who alone had the curious happiness to mix the profound learning of aristotle with the facetious humor of plautus  and now that i may not omit any thing that lies in my power toward the preparing of our doctor for business i shall offer him a few advices for the regulation of his conduct when he comes abroad into the world as soon therefore as he is thus exquisitely accomplished he must think of transplanting himself to some place where he is little known and whether he commence itinerant or fixed physician though i would rather he chused the latter situation as more agreeable to the dignity of his profession i advise him first to make himself a little acquainted with geography that he may not be at a loss to relate what wonders he has seen in foreign countries this will have a mighty charm with the vulgar who have a shrewd notion of things which one would think above their reach and know perfectly well what an amazing influence the foreign air has upon a mans intellectuals how this foreign air operates is not to the present purpose to enquire only it is undeniable that it has a prodigious effect it is not only the most effectual but the easiest way to improvement since in this case a man has no need to exert himself any further than just to condescend in his own mind upon any art or science that he would desire to be master of and he must imbibe it or cease to breathe he is a sponge thrown into water for take me a man that has scarce sense enough to spell his own name and steep him for two or three years in a foreign atmosphere you will bring him out again wringingfull of knowledge though he had done nothing considerable all the time but drank pure quintessential rum or a little sprinkled with water by way of punch in a guineaship or strolled about arrayed in sheeps guts with the ingenious inhabitants of the cape of good hope nay suppose he had passed all the time of his foreign sojourn in a profound sleep he should find himself strongly impregnated with science when he awaked the meanest and most ignorant of the vulgar know this and it is convenient to humor them for it is really no cheat at bottom if one who has received all the erudition which fardistant regions can communicate without stirring a foot from home if such a one i say should take the benefit of being reputed a traveled gentleman  but i had almost forgot to enjoin a very necessary branch of education necessary in some cases though indeed to an ordinary judge it may appear somewhat trifling what i have in view at present is the art of fumisuction and of drinking strong liquor valiantly i would have him apply indefatigably to these in the time of his apprenticeship his more important studies need not cool for it neither and he must have a very slow capacity if after two or three years diligent application he is not as able a practitioner both ways as the most phlegmatic justice in a whole county he will find the advantage of these qualifications if his lot is ordered him in any part of the country where the exercise of such elegant arts is the reigning diversion or business for they will almost infallibly recommend him to the patronage of some jocular squire who every evening assisted by his neverflinching friend the spiritual doctor wraps himself up in a thick night of tobaccosmoak and murders an artificial thirst with repeated draughts of strongbeer if added to this he be a good shot and can roar at a foxchase his fortune is made in spite of hazard  now as soon as our physician begins to lay himself out for business let him assault the general ear with long and loud relations of the mighty exploits he has performed exempli gratia every brook will furnish him with pebbles rugged brown and large enough which after his brethren the other physicians had condemned his patient to undergo the operation of lithotomy he made him discharge by the sole virtue of diuretics in this case the larger that he picks his stones the better only he must take care that they are no larger than the human bladder may be supposed able to contain if he keeps himself within these bounds he cannot overdo things for the greater the wonder be it is so much the more taking let him talk confidently of such feats no matter whether they are possible or not for though miracles they say are ceased the beast with many heads can swallow them with as much alacrity as ever it likes hugely too to be regaled with hard words these work like a spell upon the ignorant hearers and are the sure sign of a great scholard therefore for the inrichment of his phraseology and the edification of the gaping herd i counsel him instead of turning over a dictionary which is but an awkard troublesome way of learning the terms of art to get by heart the latin index to any system of botany where he may have as many oddsounding words at one view as may when judiciously mixed sufficiently darken his expression and give his discourse the air of an oracle  now must he like the carrioncrow smell out his prey and wherever the diseased are there let him be when a physicians prescription comes to his shop i advise him without delay to make a visit to the patient and to let him know that he did not think it proper to make up the medicines which were ordered till he knew his condition himself then after he has felt his pulse viewed his water and asked him a few questions he may proceed in this manner  it is very lucky for you sir that i happened to use this caution for the recipe that came to my hand is quite wide of the purpose so we shall if you please let it alone and i will send you something that will in a little time do you service  this cannot fail to succeed to his wish among the million but where the patient is so obstinate and intractable that all he can utter to his own praise or the disadvantage of the physician is not sufficient to shake him he may have his full revenge both upon the physician and patient through the grace of pharmacy  thus i have delivered the principal rules by which our doctor must direct his conduct the rest i leave to his own discretion  since i wrote this i am informed by several hands that the method i have laid down is generally in every point and has been for some ages practiced through great britain and that the physicians of this kind are distinguished by the name of quacks however i conceive it may not be unacceptable to these gentlemen to present them with a regular draught of their own scheme and it may at the same time be of service to beginners to give them a view of their agenda at once in the mean time i am glad that though i am disappointed of the honor of being the first discoverer of this way i am for that very reason safe from engaging in a quarrel with the physicians which i had almost laid my account with and moreover one of my friends tells me that the more quacks as he calls them the better for the physicians for says he the wrath of heaven and the proper vices of mankind are scarce so productive of diseases as are these quacks who in places where they abound and where the inhabitants for every aching head or scratch of a pin have recourse to their skill keep up a perpetual spring and fall the whole year round but this i take to be mere raillery  another friend of mine who is also a projector and confiders things seriously has a scheme by him for the more advantageous regulation of the civil punishments among other things he proposes that all doctors of this kind whether officinal or errant should be taken up and distributed among the public goals to superintend the health of capital offenders for he disapproves of public executions and that such of these delinquents as escape with life and limb after a years discipline under their respective physicians should be taken into the army for says he they will probably make hardy soldiers he thinks further that for the support of these private officers besides the discarded hangmans fees the country should not grudge a small tax upon every life at least upon the lives of those who used to employ them before the commencement of their new dignity especially since by this means they are secured from the most mortal dangers they were exposed to  but for all this i shall not lose conceit of my scheme till i have better reason for i have some cause to suspect that the gentlemen who talk so unfavourably of these sons of poean are not altogether free of prejudice  a dialogue relating to the practice of physic as it is managed by a certain illustrious society di quibus imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes et chaos et phlegethon loca nocte tacentia late sit mihi fas audita loqui sit numine vestro pandere res alta terra and caligine mersas virg she was the heathen goddess of health hygeia mercury pluto hygeia well mercury now that we are arrived at plutos palace pray tell me what is my business here you came to me with a distracted hurry in your looks and desired me to follow you with all speed which i did implicitly enough expecting to learn from you on the road upon what strange emergency my presence was necessary in hell but you plied your wings so eagerly that though i dont use to saunter in my motions i could not come within hearing of you all the way but now that you have recovered breath and since pluto with whom it seems i am to have affairs is taking a nap pray tell me what are his demands upon me   mercury a nap quotha would he were well out on it the fatigue of this bout has it seems done more for him than all the virtues of my rod but if he had one grain of mortality in him he had slept his last before this   hyg you amaze me nay then some strange revolution must be near when the gods themselves grow sick i should not have thought it so prodigious neither to have heard that venus was under a salivation or that bacchus was sitting cushioned up with the gout or raving in a fever but pluto that regular temperate soberliving god and of a good firm constitution too pluto sick it is impossible mercury youre arch sure this must be one of your bites but i am not so credulous as you imagine   merc well you will know by and by whether i jest or not it is not long since i thought as little of sickness as you do and pluto as little as either of us and let me tell you if you had the same cause to be sick that he has i question much if that clean alert constitution of yours and all the firmness of your animal economy could preserve you from these disorders which we have hitherto imagined were only incident to mortals   hyg but prithee mercury if i may believe youre in earnest tell me how came the infernal jupiter by this indisposition   merc why you shall hear  did you observe what a pickle he was in two or three nights ago at our last merrymaking   hyg i left the company just as they seemed to have reached a reasonable degree of mirth for you know i seldom sit longer upon these occasions than the first bottle is emptied   merc true but pluto does not always confine himself to such rules the nectar you remember was of the right generous kind which he plied as long as drinking was good and when all the rest were for going he and silenus who had got into a corner by themselves and were grown vastly loving and facetious laid their heads together for another bottle though he had enough in all conscience before well he was at last prevailed upon to rise and he staggered home as drunk as twenty beggars roaring and singing sonnets to proserpine like a bacchanal all the way as he went while the inhabitants of the infernal regions were so tickled in their spleens to see their king on such a merry pin that they fell all a capering and dancing round him and he reeled and gambold as fast as the best of em in short you would have split your sides had you seen this odd scene of pleasantry i saw all that passed by the light of the torches for though he was affronted at my offering to conduct him home as if he were drunk forsooth yet i thought it was proper to follow him at a distance and accordingly did not lose sight of him the whole way   hyg your description diverts me extremely pluto is not often in such a frolicksome vein but pray how did his nectar digest with him i hope that did not grumble in his guts   merc no hang it that would not have touched him neither this was only the prelude to the tragedy no sooner was he got home than he calls for a fresh bottle and would needs make every body drink that was near him laughing and talking and singing with all the gaiety imaginable and smacking and kissing all about him as he was playing a thousand anticks that shook the whole palace with laughter up comes there a brazenfaced son of a wh  of a pillgiving quack and    hyg begging your pardon these are they that my sick votaries every day curse so heartily in their prayers to me but i could never yet perfectly learn what they are   merc rot em i dont want to know any more about them than i do already  but to my tale this precious rascal finding pluto in a very affable tune comes up to him and with a deal of affected concern in his countenance accosts him in this manner   dread sir i take it to be indispensably incumbent upon all subjects to exert their several capacities in the service of their lawful sovereigns my profession is physic and after he had told a thousand lies concerning his education and what cures he had performed my concern says he for your majestys welfare obliges me to take the liberty to tell you that i am afraid you have drunk more tonight than is consistent with your health your eyes look red your pulse here he fumbled about plutos wrist strikes much too fast and from the present plenitude of your vascular system i can easily prognosticate by the rules of my art that if you dont purge off your crapula your majesty must unavoidably within the space of a few hours be seized with an ephemerous fever or a febris ardens or perhaps drop headlong into an apoplexy but these misfortunes may easily be prevented by taking two or three of my pilulae catholicae which i invented and always prepare my self and which scarce ever fail to succeed in this or any other intention  there they are with that he pulled out a box as full of plagues as pandoras and presenting pluto with two of his pills  your majesty will please to swallow these says he and i shall insure you from all the bad consequences of this nights work i am confident if your majesty once knew the inestimable virtues of these my pills your majesty would never go without some of them about you afterward good gods what simpletons does drink make of us pluto without reflecting upon the absurdity of this speech or once dreaming of what he was a doing takes the confounded pills and tosses them over with great alacrity and indeed they soon cured him of his drunkenness or at least of his mirth for they had not been an hour in his stomach till he grew monstrous sick and fell a vomiting and scouring most enormously he did so roar and curse and toss and tumble and run hobbling and crouching up and down with his guts in his arms screwing his face sweating like a horse and looking as pale as ashes that but for his immortality one would not imagine he could have lived in that condition two hours the villain of an empirick was sent to who when he heard how matters went with his majesty had the impudence to say he liked him so much the better that the medicine operated well and that he would but just stay till he made up something to alleviate the stimulus if there was occasion for it and give him ease and then would follow but the sorry scoundrel thought fit to sneak off and he has not been heard of since i suppose he sculks in some blind corner or other but he cannot long lie hid from the punishment he deserves so richly in the mean time pluto has continued for these two days in as bad a way as when his physic first began to work and yet sick as he was he would not for a long time consent to the taking of any measures which might divulge an affair that was so little to his honor but he was forced to yield to necessity at last and dispatched me in great haste to find you out and though he is just now asleep it seems i am afraid there is still work enough left for you for considering what he has suffered and how miserably ill he was but lately when i left him i am apt to suspect that his present rest is merely owing to his weakness and you know much better than i how deceitful these truces sometimes prove   hyg well i shall do what lies in my power for him though i must own i am not very sorry that he smarts for his folly neither  but pray mercury can you tell me what sort of people these quacks are for though they practice physic it seems and pretend to have some interest with me i have no correspondence with them   merc no i dont imagine you have i shall tell you in as few words as possible all that i know about them you remember that in former times none were allowed to practice physic but those that were found duly qualified and had prepared themselves by a long course of study for that important employment but now there is not a poor peasant or mechanic but if he has two sons one of them must be a doctor as they call them with a vengeance though it were in spite of both nature and education and what wise method do you think they fall upon to accomplish this great work a very short one you will say they have no notion of education themselves and they are not able to bear the expenses of introducing their sons regularly to the knowledge of the art but instead of this they place a raw unlettered lad for two or three years under the care of some apothecary who perhaps does not know a great deal more than his apprentice here he fancies he learns not only to prepare and compound medicines but by perusing and commonplacing the physicians bills how to apply them too forsooth and so at last by a happy delusion he thinks himself not only an apothecary but a physician thus what by his own proper fund of ignorance what by his masters improving it he comes out at last a doubly greater fool than he entered but in the mean time as ignorance and want of sense give him assurance and the lowness of his education preserves him at liberty from the combersome shackles of honor and honesty if he has but slight enough to save himself from transportation or the gibbet he is sure to make a livelihood though never so many should suffer for it others have fallen upon a yet easier way of scaling the heights of physic by setting up upon something that they call a nostrum left them in a legacy by their grandmother by which they pretend infallibly to cure some one or perhaps all diseases and this whether it is insignificant or dangerous they administer the same way in all circumstances and in the same dose to persons of all ages sexes and constitutions   hyg a hopeful education i will swear well i dont wonder that those fools who venture their lives in the hands of such bunglers load them with such imprecations at last   merc these wretches however have for some time been in great favor with pluto and in return for their contributing so considerably to the peopling of his dominions they have had the honor to lodge in the same quarter with alexander caesar and the rest of the noble tribe of manbutchers but of late years they have sent down such numerous colonies that it would have puzzled pluto to account for so many swarms at a time when he heard nothing by any advices from the upper world either of famine or pestilence or very hot wars if it were not that of all the myriads that daily descend to hell there is scarce one of six but what lays the blame of his untimely fate upon the quacks so that at last he begun to consider them with another eye and to remit of his indulgence toward them as dreading they would at this rate in a short time quite destroy the brood of mankind and so cut off all future supplies to his realms but now this affair i presume will complete their disgrace and entirely ruin them with pluto they have for a long time played their pills drops and potions here upon the poor wretches that are miserable enough besides but there was never any ear given to their complaints for it was suspected to be all mere fetch and knavery and that they were only sick to get the rigor and wholesome discipline of our infernal regions a little abated and but the other day one of these miscreants as he was passing by tantalus who was crying out of thirst after his old rate stopped and told him that symptom was entirely owing to the redundant choler in his blood and that he could give him a potion that would purge it off to his great relief poor tantalus who was glad to drink any thing made but one draught of his potion and poured a thousand blessings upon his pretended benefactor but it proved a bitter draught to him for it handled him so unmercifully and instead of having his thirst quenched by it he called out at last so pitifully for drink and swooned away so often that he was obliged to be taken out of his tub and now that his great rage of sickness is abated they are even fain to cocker him up with broths and jellies to fill his empty vessels again such things as these passed without being much taken notice of and for the most part without being credited but i shall wonder if these varlets are not called to a severe account now that the gods themselves cannot live for them for you must know that just about the time that pluto took his physic honest old charon got his dose too   hyg no sure how in the name of wonder came charon so tractable and complaisant i hope his austerity was not mellowed by a bottle too   merc no faith he was as sober as i am just now but you shall hear how it happened one of these poisonmongers who wanted a cast over but had not a farthing to pay his fare bethought himself of a sly expedient he takes his seat just by the old waterman and begins to make his court by complimenting him upon his vigorous constitution and the greenness of his old age but at the same time could not help observing that his skin disgraced them for you know he is not very nice about his linnens and does not go into a bath perhaps once in a century and that he had contracted something of a scorbutic taint by having lived so long upon the water but if he would accept of some doses of his pulvis scelotyrbicus and now and then make use of the warm bath he might soon become as sleek and pure as a snake that has just cast his slough charon at first made him surly enough answers and was like to have grown very rough but the insinuating rascal plied him so with positive remonstrances that the simple old dotard began at last to imagine that his skin really itched he told him that what he said might be true enough but that he had not leisure to take physic the unconscionable knave replied that the medicine which he had to offer him was an alterative and acted insensibly so that he needed not lose a moments business nor so much as change his diet for it well not to tire you with a long tale charon takes the powders in lieu of fare which was all that the rascal wanted and one dose has wrought him so heartily that if they were to cure him of a leprosy i suppose cerberus may take the rest for him he was obliged to crawl out of his boat into a hut by the rivers side where he lies cursing and blaspheming at a hideous rate and is so peevish and in such a nasty pickle that no body cares to go near him since this misfortune happened to him i have been obliged to perform his office but to secure my self from having a pill or powder crammed down my throat too not a rag of a quack comes into the boat as long as i am master they make a deal of pother for admittance but i even let them strole about the wrong side of the lake till charon is ready to take care of them himself and if he does not take care of them with a vengeance as soon as he gets upon his stumps again i shall say his choler is purged off effectually there is as good as ten or a dozen of them already and they are become so bold that if i did not keep them at a distance by brushing their jackets for them when they advance too near i believe they would think of storming the boat but i expect good sport when they come under charons discipline it will delight one to see how he will tear and lay about him and how the poor scoundrels will scamper up and down as if they walked upon hot iron   hyg yes i presume they will stand in need of more skill than their own to heal themselves  but i wish pluto would make and end of his nap for i shall be obliged to be going presently   merc so shall i i will step into his chamber and see if he is yet awake  o i hear him groaning and stretching himself upon the bed you may come in hygeia   hyg how is it with you now pluto mercy on me you look pitifully   pluto o hygeia what have i suffered since i saw you   hyg well i hope you shall not suffer much longer and if you were once set to rights again i presume you will not tamper any more with these unlucky ministers of the fatal sisters   pluto a pestilence on them but what must i do for i find i shall soon be as bad as ever   hyg why you must send for some skilful physician you have hippocrates celsus sydenham and i dont know how many here that are an honor to their great father aesculapius and for the good offices they have done mankind deserve the immortal fame and complete happiness they now enjoy you must have recourse to their help for without natures means and theirs i never do any thing   pluto their help i never could endure them for my empire might still have remained an unpeopled desert for them and i have often been angry with minos and rhadamanth for allotting them the same habitations with solon lycurgus socrates cicero brutus and the other public benefactors of mankind i little thought ever to have dealings of this kind with them but i have reason to lay aside my old grudges now   merc well i expect you will judge more favorably of them hereafter  but in the mean time pluto as there is nothing so cursed but what brings some good along with it i humbly think this accident might be improved to a profitable use you know ixions wheel is falling to pieces the furies scourges are worn so light and limber that they are become mere childrens play in short all the instruments of hell are going to wrack now to save the expense of repairing them which will make a great gap in your fund what if all that pompous apparatus and this variety of tortures were laid aside and the medicines of these quacks which come cheap enough for all their exorbitant bills made use of in their stead and administered once twice or thrice a week in proportion to the offense habit and constitution of the criminals and pro ratione virium and operationis   tantalus blast me all the gods if i take potion more  i will drink phlegethon first  let me into my tub again  oh    hyg so tantalus you have got a quick ear pluto will perhaps excuse you if you speak him fair but pray mercury let us hear the rest of your scheme with plutos leave it may perhaps divert him   merc well in the mean time that the furies may not lie out of business nor want an employment suitable to their dispositions i would propose that they should have the pleasure to administer these pills potions etc and in short to perform the office of the quacks   hyg and pray what will you make of the quacks themselves what uncommon torments are you preparing for them   merc as for them that they may still be occupied in something analogous to their former trade let it be their business to take care of the kennels sewers and commonshores nor think it below them to be the scavengers of hell   hyg by jupiter a good contrivance pluto what do you say to this   merc  ye gods pluto is as bad as ever how he heaves how he sweats how he is convulsed as if his whole frame were disjointed i must make dispatch and send hither hippocrates and some of the rest of the physicians and then to the oar again do you hygeia stay here in the mean time   hyg i shall fare you well mercury and make haste   advertisement the following letter was found in the streets where it had probably been dropped by mr w  d this accident has in all likelihood deprived those impartial records of fame the london evening post and daily advertiser of the honor of ushering it into the world but that it may not be entirely lost neither to the public nor that illustrious person to whom it does justice i take the

but now rosy health smiles again upon me and my years look green in a new spring for which i thank thy spiritgiving hand and shall ever celebrate thy immortal name with praises lofty as imaus sweet smelling as the spicy vales of arabia hail enormous mass of pilular merit thou mighty possessor of the universal remedy the pill of strength the drop of energy the arcanum of the wise the philosophers stone such as never rose from the secret furnace of mysterious vaunting paracelsus for not the golden pill of day disperses influence more vivifying than thine terrestrial and of mineral birth thou for whom the great o glorious task wield their deputed pens and to whom the judges of the earth do justice thou who compressest the glands of the paralytic eye and administrest to the wretched the sweet relief of tears for thrice wretched they to whom this comfort is denied in a word thou great earthly mover of the obedient microcosm all hail and may i join to thee him next in name who daily thunders almost with equal force on my astounded ear him the vindictive scourge of worms him greater than the flower of english chivalry the boast of ancient time st george him conspicuous with the spoils of many a vanquished monster and to whom contending monarchs justled from the middle of the sheets of fame diurnally give place and let my upright heart bestow upon your whole illustrious brotherhood their due share of incense alla forbid that i should pass them in stupid silence for neither is their renown unknown to me o all ye who can count you innumerable and bright as the stars ye who without the help of vain science and uncramped by stiff education have gained the proud heights of physic ye worthies of emetic renown ye whose skilful hands weed the too luxuriant animal kingdom ye whose pills and potions purge the world let me stand astonished at your power and bid my voracious appetite of wonders riot eternally on your miraculous might for you command and destruction opens wide her devouring jaws the wrathful pestilence waits your tremendous nod you teach the imprisoned aphrodisiack bane to rage and the great ones of the earth tremble they tremble yea and melt in fearful sweats at your power that power the liberal gift of auspicious nature the envy and astonishment of the learned o unbought erudition more to be valued far than the mountains of ophir teeming with gold or the massy pearls of the orient  o when will come these golden days when physicians shall be all of one sect when hippocrates when galen when boerhaave shall be no more when spontaneous knowledge shall spring from the uncultivated soil when the grief of reading and tedious application shall cease when the universal smoke of blazing libraries shall ascend and wrap the happy day in a more glorious night and when the professors of the healing art shall with one mind entirely resign themselves to enlightening nature and like you o sole inspired physicians trust to inspiration alone even then when a new gothic inundation shall overwhelm the earth and the last footsteps of abhorred learning shall melt away happy oh infinitely happy they whom kind nature locks up in the dark womb of time to sally forth with impetuous eagerness into the enjoyment of these blissful days oh too happy already if they could but know their happiness for even we the present generation of mortals we thank heaven taste the sweets of these delicious days taste and envy the sleeping seeds of our late posterity yes in you we taste these joys o godlike deliverers from mortal woes from the bondage of the flesh and from all the sorrows and infirmities that flesh is heir to o that i could wield the irresistible bolts of demosthenian eloquence oh for the tongues of ten thousand seraphims to sing your praises and hush with conscious shame the mistuned spheres for sure no mortal not all the mortals that have sprung from the loins of the first man with all that shall precede the last crush of this system joined in full concert could warble elogiums worthy you let me not therefore violate the sacred theme nor touch your divine names with my fleshly lips lest a wrathful cancer should consume them or a commissioned palsy revenge you on my profane tongue and yet  but whither do these raptures hurry me transported by the inspiring subject i have unawares swelled my letter of acknowledgment to thee with an encomium upon the society of which thou justly claimest to be the head and now before i lay down my pen i must tell thee that smit with an absolute curiosity i design a visit this winter to thy amazing country the land of wonders where besides the almost incredible feats of thy astonishing fraternity a thousand other prodigies worthy if fame says true of eternal admiration grow for i hear of things and manners marvelous scarce utterable by mortal tongues and not to be believed without the vouchers of ones proper eyes alla preserve thee sage j  s  ah  from paris  the end
