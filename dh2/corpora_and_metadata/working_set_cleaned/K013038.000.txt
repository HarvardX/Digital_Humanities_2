the shakspeare gallery etc  erratum p  0 l   for oerblaned read oerblanchd  the shakspeare gallery a poem by mr jerningham  london printed for j robson new bondstreet  mdccxci  to the right honorable john boydell lord mayor of the city of london this poem is inscribed by his obedient humble servant  edwd jerningham  advertisement the following poem does not pass any judgment upon the pictures that are now exhibited in the gallery but attempts to point out new subjects for future exhibitions and in the delineation of new subjects attention is paid to the principle laid down by our great painter in his notes to the translation of fresnoy by mr mason that palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment as the painter speaks to the eye  the encouragement that is now so liberally extended to painting will soon decide the question whether or no our painters are adequate to the task they are called upon to perform macklins exhibition is also a splendid and arduous undertaking it is another lyceum in which riyal artists may contend for fame and emolument  shakspeare gallery etc as mused the prophet near mild chebars stream ezekiel chap  th  and prayed his god to dart the enlightning gleam abruptdescending from his airy height a form angelic rushed upon his sight with smiling lip he cheered the hallowed sire and bad his soul to heavens best gift aspire then with strong hand he grasped his silver hair and swift conveyed him through the yielding air along the unwinged region of the sky the dread mysterious deep abyss on high there inspiration her bright cloud withdrew and poured her visions on his daring view then on his rapturekindled eye arose those forms of splendour those terrific shows with which he peopled his celestial dream and swelled his proud magnificence of theme to englands leading bard thus genius came envelopd in a robe of holy flame and bore him with a whirlwinds rapid force beyond the solar road and starry course from which far towering and tremendous height while now he hovers with suspended flight the poet viewed as on a spacious plain of human passions the long shadowy train as flings the noonsun his clear beams from high on the dim tribes he darts his radiant eye twas then the favored bard received the lore whose mystic veil was never removed before that revelation to his instinct given that ray from god the energy of heaven to his illumined sight was then consigned the deep recesses of the human mind the evervarying path of tortuous art and the dark passage to the tyrants heart the umbrageous winding of the thorny road that leads to quickeyd jealousys abode the gathering storms that over resentment roll the swelling waves that toss the fearful soul the calm that breathes around the infants rest the rugged cavern of the murdrers breast the dread materials by the furies brought with which are forged despairs tempestuous thought the shaft that mingling pleasure with the pain bathes in the blood that warms the lovers vein oh thou the imperial genius of our land take a fresh garland from thy countrys hand triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim and stamp a newborn era on thy fame too long as with the iron power of fate has custom bolted the historic gate enlightened boydell bursts the opposing bar on their rude hinge the ponderous portals jar while the rapt arts salute with loud acclaim this rich accession to their rising name genius of painting thy bright car ascend bid glowing energy thy steps attend triumphant ride through the unrifled land and seize thy plunder with victorious hand thou too who favorst the promethean toil genius of sculpture share the sacred spoil let fancy lift thy blazing urn on high whose flame thy bold hand ravished from the sky and on its side with flowerets breathing round let the immortal name of banks be found see the altorelievo in the front of the gallery which does honor to modern statuary  often have we heard the pure of taste complain of mawkish portraitures eternal reign of exhibitions which the art disgrace and pall the eye with many a vacant face let miniature erect her fairy school and mid her gewgaws unmolested rule let her bright dome each pleased narcissus seek to her let beauty hold her summer cheek in fond allusion to the month of may let her the youthful brides gay form display let her delineate on her ivory plane the nuptial simper of the happy swain from these we turn to scenes of higher aim where eaglegenius soars to nobler game where fancy reason taste in one conjoined unfold the workings of the impassioned mind now to the laurelld academic band to every artists emulative hand munificence upholds her sacred prize and bids the daring reach it from the skies while expectation lifts the thought on high methinks i view with a prophetic eye in solemn state ascend that splendid dome where the proud arts shall find an equal home where at the opening of some glorious day the english mind its treasures shall display while they whose taste is swayed by rigors rule shall mark the wonders of the albion school another gallery is to be erected for the purpose of receiving the whole collection when completed  if time

drew the bold creations he held forth to view as from their grave shall burst the numerous host and on these walls a new existence boast here shall be seen in all its charms arrayed the impressive figure of veronas maid juliet  closed in the dreary vault where sleep the dead wrapped in the nightdress of the funeral bed she breaks abruptly from her iron trance and sends around a terrorrolling glance a mournful solitary lamp shall throw a sickly glimmering over the house of woe and shall the wretched paris give to view stretched on te ground with mien of ghastly hue then shall a deeper spectacle display and hang over romeo with reluctant ray disclosing his wan lips devoid of breath and faintrosd cheek still beautiful in death then shall the beam with weakened effort shed a fading glory on the friars head she too shall ornament the pictured scene the destined victim of italian spleen imogen  see the base wretch perform his treacherous part with all the subtlety of finished art behold him bending over the sleeping maid her holy form to his research betrayed eager some secret notice to retai with ravenous aim he lifts the slender veil and leering marks by natures hand impressed the mole cinquespotted on her snowy breast whose scattered drops to the rapt eye excel the crimson spots within the cowslips bell here too as patient as the meekeyd dove shall stand the maid who never told her love viola  who to her coy and fearful bosom true as the unseen worm that pales the blossoms hue still let concealment on her beauty prey like snow dissolving silently away beneath

predestinations darkling edicts taught and breathed its solemn whispers on the mind with dust overspread and to neglect consigned yet then the distant scenery imparts a dire remembrance of his former arts the bright sun fading in his full career the wild stars madly starting from their sphere the stormencumberd sky the swelling main the uprooted cedars stretching over the plain the mountain loosened by convulsive throe with ruin rushing to the vale below and the pale wretch reversing natures doom abruptly rising from the rifted tomb what glowing artist with bold hand shall claim to draw
