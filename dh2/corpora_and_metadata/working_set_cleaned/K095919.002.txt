the fair hibernian  vol ii  the fair hibernian  what ignorance shall think or malice say to me are trifles  if the knowing few who can see faults but can see beauties too applaud that genius which themselves partake in two volumes volume the second  london printed by john crowder for g g j and j robinson paternoster row mdcclxxxix  the fair hibernian to mrs chetwynd  ireland granvillepark i have just met the most vexatious disappointment i ever experienced it puts me out of all manner of patience i am totally exhausted already with dissembling a cheerfulness in which my heart cannot take the least share and concealing a melancholy that almost overwhelms me i had comforted myself with the hopes of a speedy release from this insupportable restraint next week was fixed for our departure but mrs domville has taken it into her head to desire lady lucys attendance on an approaching occasion so that we shall probably be detained above a month  sure of all the longings peculiar to her situation this is one of the most unreasonable and the most provoking how can lady lucy who has never been in a similar situation be of any service to her but it is i that am unreasonable yes and illnatured too  what can be more soothing than the presence of such a friend in the hours of sickness and danger  lady lucy though desirous of being with her sister would on my account have declined staying but i could not think of taking any advantage of her very obliging consideration for me after the civilities i have received from every branch of the domville family i could not avoid paying them so slight  or to speak more truly what must have appeared to them so slight  a compliment without an unpardonable degree of rudeness and ingratitude i was obliged to promise not to let my uncle come for me or mr domville would have insisted on leaving me with you and coming back again for lady lucy  distressing kindness  all the linfield family leave this place tomorrow lady linfield i believe because she does not love the country which at this season is astonishing lady lucy goes pour remplir les fonctions de sa charge aupres de madame domville the gentlemen must attend their ladies  the duke and lady carysbrook  whose kindness frequently reminds me of another and dearer aunt  insist upon my residing at granvillepark while i stay in england which i willingly consented to lord and lady linfield profess  and i have reason to think with sincerity  that this is a point they would not have yielded to any body but my grandfather  i like this arrangement much better than returning to london for several reasons which you will easily guess  one of them and not the weakest is that i shall be removed from lady mary webster who was teazingly importunate with me to tell her who miss ormsbys intended husband was she said it was but an act of justice of common humanity to let him know her character neither justice nor humanity dictated the resolve  twas malice and revenge for imaginary wrongs what ruin a young ladys reputation and happiness on slight very slight suspicions i would not be concerned in it though ever so indirectly for millions let souls like lady marys stoop to such actions  if i would barely let her know his name she solemnly protested mine should never be brought into question she would keep her word i doubt not she could have no temptation to break it but i have been taught to adhere to what i think right from much higher motives than the fear of censure or even than the hope of praise  i believe i have acted properly yet i own to you madam i am far from being easy i am tortured with solicitude for sir edwards happiness i cannot suppress my fears although i know they spring only from too creative an imagination and alas too tender a heart i should hate myself if a want of candor to miss ormsby had any share in forming them but this cruel subject  how came i to touch on it begin with what i will i insensibly fall into it this is greatly trespassing on your indulgence my generous friend  let us talk of something else  in my last i attempted a description of this fine place i deferred giving you any account of its inhabitants till i should be able to judge of them with more accuracy and certainty than i could pretend to do from first impressions for to penetrate immediately into peoples characters belongs only to those who are blessed with a great deal of natural sagacity joined to a thorough knowledge of the world  i have formed an opinion of the sedley family on a short acquaintance which i fancy a long one would not induce me to change i have studied them  both my uncle and you compliment me with penetration  commencons  the duke of granville is far from being unamiable in his private character he is an affectionate careful and indulgent parent readily forgiving slight faults though  as my poor mother had too good reason to know  absolutely inexorable with regard to great ones he is a warm friend a kind master a generous landlord and a liberal benefactor to the poor his excessive pride does not appear in his deportment to people that are extremely his inferiors to them he is generally mild and sometimes even condescending to his equals  by equals you may suppose i cannot exactly mean such only as boast a title birth and fortune great as his own i use that term with respect to him to signify all those who have a decided right to keep the first company to such  he is very polite and easy but he is most forbiddingly haughty to persons in genteel middling life which  par parenthese and by your leave ambition  i take to be the happiest state in the world inferiors of this class his grace cannot suffer for a moment to forget their distance at his own table only  and there they are seldom invited  he relaxes a little and treats them with a moderate degree of complaisance in mixed company he preserves an air of reserved stateliness softened however by goodbreeding of which he has a large share he is certainly vindictive but not often so to those whom he has not once loved his public character is not only good but great unsuspectedly disinterested unquestionably impartial a firm supporter of the just prerogatives of the crown and a zealous asserter of the liberties of the subject  lady carysbrook is a sweet worthy woman amiable in every relation of life adored in her own family and respected and beloved by every body that has the happiness to know her in a word did i speak of her to any other person i should say  she is like my aunt chetwynd  during the nine years she has been a widow she has resided entirely with the duke  her eldest child lord carysbrook is now on his travels so i can say nothing more of him than that if he merits the fine thing his sisters say of him he is worthy of such a mother  lady alicia sedley is turned of eighteen middlesized has a very good person and an exceedingly graceful air her face is not beautiful yet wonderfully pleasing the body charms because the soul is seen  that soul is fraught with every gentle endearing virtue that can adorn her sex  she has all that touching softness that dear complacency that i love in mrs wentworth  lady fanny is two years younger the prettiest little creature imaginable  extremely lively indeed even to giddiness though she is by no means deficient in good sense her vivacity makes her much more shewy and entertaining in a large company than her sisters diffidence will allow her to be but in a family circle or a teteatete lady alicia shines most  robert sedley is about thirteen and remarkable tall and manly for that age he is in all respects the finest boy i ever saw i hope you will not think me partial in this decision when i tell you he is my lover  he pays me compliments with an elegance of expression that is really surprising in such a child if i stand he flies to reach me a chair at the teatable he will attend me himself if there were ever so many servants in the room when we walk he gathers flowers makes them in a bouquet puts them to his lips or breast and presents them to me with an air  quand on parle du loup on en voit la queue  robert is at my elbow i must walk  so fine a day  every body in the garden  i bid you a hasty farewell my dear aunt for though i have made the best bargain i could i assure you i am obliged to give the monkey two kisses to purchase time enough to subscribe myself  your valeria obryen  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage o i am dying louisa  my brother is in a fever for the love of heaven come to me  hold  i forgot your situation  do not by any means think of coming but tell lord methuen his friend is ill  dangerously ill  i thank you for your information and counsel but i am not able to take the least step in the affair at present terrified and distracted as i am with apprehensions for a life of ten thousand times greater moment to me than my own  my own frivolous comparison  life has long since lost its value to me i regard it not as a blessing for which i ought to be thankful  and o forgive me heaven if this be ingratitude  but rather as a misfortune which it is my duty to bear with resignation  how forcibly does edwards situation call to my remembrance a hapless wanderer from his friends and country  from his imprudent innocent wretched wife  suffering amongst strangers all that the united pains of mind and body could inflict perhaps he wanted care  his poor harriet was not permitted to attend him he had no sister no wife no tender female friend to sooth his dying pillow  torturing retrospect  unavailing sorrow would that i could forget the past and look only forward  and i fear it is with too much impatience i do look forward  to that happy period when my glad spirit will be allowed to shake off the bonds of its earthly captivity and seek my henry in the regions of bliss  there i trust we shall meet  alas i cannot form an idea of a heaven without him  my friend my much esteemed friend pardon these fruitless and involuntary lamentations it is peculiarly ungenerous to trouble you with them  i again entreat you forgive me i never had less command over myself than at present i feel as if some great misfortune threatened me gracious and omnipotent being spare my brother to me  o spare my brother  and if it be thy pleasure that i should be depressed by a heavier weight of misery condescend  in mercy condescend  to adopt some other mode of chastisement  presumptuous prayer  adieu  i am blinded with tears  harriet wentworth  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage i have been about half an hour here and late as it is dispatch stephen to let you know our dear marchmont is not worse but alas i dare not so far flatter myself or you as to say he is better something must be done if the cause is not removed how shall the effects cease allons donc un coup de desespoir  i shall go to jephsonlodge tomorrow if the girl has a spark of generosity i shall blow it to a flame or perhaps it would be better to address myself to the father or to lady conway  heaven direct me i know not what to do i wish the perturbation of my spirits had allowed me to consult with you before i left poplarhill such is the excess of mrs wentworths affliction i dont know how to speak to her about any thing  but i am keeping the man and saying nothing to the purpose  let our prayers for our much loved friend ascend together to the throne of mercy  o may they be heard  yours most tenderly methuen  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage i am inexpressibly alarmed  sir edwards fever is increased i cannot help thinking he is in great danger though doctor howard says he will do well i have a high opinion of this gentlemans skill in his profession but alas he knows not sir edwards case his mind is still more feverish than his body  the unfavourable symptoms that have appeared this morning i with severe compunction impute to my own imprudence last night having with extreme difficulty prevailed on mrs wentworth  whose delicate constitution unfits her for the office of a nurse  to retire to rest i took my place by my dear friends bed he lay very quiet i endeavored to suppress a cough for fear of disturbing him he perceived it and spoke to me i thought you had been asleep said i  asleep my dear methuen said he calmly i expect my next sleep to be my last make every person leave the room i wish to speak with you  i ordered away his valet de chamber and nursetender and begging him not to exert his voice or talk on any subject that might discompose him desired to know what he would say to me  why should you give me this caution  of what consequence would it be were i to shorten my life by a few worthless hours  for gods sake my dear edward do not give way to this despondency your life is not in any danger  i am sorry answered he you should think it necessary to talk to me in this manner i do not fear death it is an object of terror only to the vicious or the weak or at least to the happy i trust you will not class me with either of the two first mentioned and you cannot assign me a place amongst the last  death is pleasing to me when i consider it as the only means by which i can avoid fulfilling my fatal engagement do not think me ungenerous in allowing myself to talk thus miss ormsby deserves a better husband  but ah i have no heart to give her the too lovely valeria  for her only would i live and it is for her i die yes methuen i am persuaded i am on my deathbed and while i have strength and reason sufficient i would wish to settle my affairs  his words his manner pierced my inmost soul i threw myself on my knees i would have spoken but could not command utterance he pressed one of my hands in his  my dear augustus my tender faithful friend i did not expect less affection from you but i looked for more firmness i see i afflict you  two or three words more and i have done i want to have my will drawn as speedily as possible mrs wentworth is richer than she wishes to be monsieur de villemar will make ample provision for miss marchmont  i therefore think myself at liberty to dispose of my fortune and am determined to give myself the satisfaction of leaving the marchmont estate to miss obryen i have considered the matter maturely and do not think it can any way hurt her character to accept it my other little estate and my house in london i must present to your arthur hold methuen seeing my lips move this is a very trifling testimony of my friendship and i am going to exact an important one of yours and your ladys  take care of my poor sister i leave her under your protection console her let her not feel that she has lost a brother  i dare not think on what she will suffer dear unfortunate harriet  his eyes filled with tears he raised them to heaven  merciful god support and comfort her  we were seasonably interrupted by doctor howard he felt his patients pulse and reprimanded me in a whisper for my indiscretion  i retired to a corner of the room and gave vent to my insuppressible sorrow sir edwards valet came over to me  mmmy lord said he stammering is my dear master   he was not able to finish his question i squeezed the honest fellows hand and shook my head he burst into tears and turned away from me if such is the grief of his servant what can what ought i to feel his sister too  i am convinced she could not survive him a week  but a ray of hope my louisa breaks through the thick gloom that surrounds me  if miss ormsby is not the meanest and basest of her sex my visit to her must have the desired effect i have just ordered my chaise and will step in and see my friend once more before i go  farewell my dearest love i shall write to you again when i return  methuen  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage o louisa this man is bent on his own destruction  solicitous for ruin  as soon as i had sent off my messenger to you i went to his chamber and having staid there for some time wished the doctor good morning as i was going out edward unfortunately overheard me and almost throwing himself out of bed eagerly cried where are you going my lord unprepared to answer this sudden question i only replied that i should be back in a few hours he made a motion with his hand to me to draw nearer to him i obeyed dear methuen said he grasping my hand and speaking in a low voice i know that nothing could tempt you to leave me in this extremity but the hope of being of service to me tell me were you not this moment going to some of the ormsby family or to miss obryen  your silence convinces me you were but i entreat you  pardon me if i say i command you  to do no such thing do you imagine i could meanly barter my honor for my life  you ought to have known me better you shall not stir from this spot till you have sworn to me to relinquish a project which nothing but the excess of your friendship to me could excuse your forming  twas in vain for me to contend  and now dear louisa how shall i support myself unable to assist my friend  almost hopeless of his recovery  and should he recover it will be only to be miserable for the rest of his days this is too heavy a tax upon my happiness  great as it is it will not bear it  he has mentioned his will to me this morning again i have sent for the lawyer heaven knows i am very ill able to give the necessary directions  i am mistaken in my opinion of miss obryen if this rich legacy will afford her any satisfaction and i am sure i would much rather my son should never have an estate than obtain one in this manner i express myself imperfectly i would give  pardon me if i hurt your maternal tenderness  but by the powers that made me i would give the sweet boys life itself to save my friend  philips name need not be mentioned in the will as he has lived but a short time with sir edward but i swear by the faithful tears i saw him shed he shall never be obliged to serve another master    let us talk no more of sorrow of wills or death  i have happy surprising news for you just now a servant brought a letter for sir edward which he insisted upon delivering into his own hand but being repeatedly assured he could have no access to him consented to leave it with mrs wentworth as i thought the letter must be of importance and probably required an immediate answer i persuaded her to open it a liberty which certainly nothing but her brothers condition could warrant  read the following and by your own astonishment judge of ours  to sir edward marchmont bart  hermitage doverstreet although i am a total stranger to you sir i feel myself interested in your welfare by a kind of fellowship in distress and am glad it is in my power to save you from a connection which could yield you nothing but infamy and woe  miss ormsby is a mean artful and wicked woman who basely betrays your confidence and love and meditates the deepest wound upon your honor but her own letter will characterize her better than i can do should a blind passion induce you to question its authenticity i am ready to inform you by what means it came into my possession  i am with great respect etc mary webster   in this letter was enclosed one from miss ormsby to lady conway of which i send you a transcript  what a specious jilt is that vile ormsby  what a finished hypocrite she has thoroughly attained what is the very masterpiece of cunning  the art of hiding itself my surprise at her discovered baseness can only be equalled by my indignation to what a creature was marchmont about to unite himself and was it to gratify a lowminded ambition and to be a convenient cloak to a most infamously criminal amor that my invaluable friend would have sacrificed a tender and violent passion for as deserving and lovely a woman as lives i cannot think of it with patience i reflect on his danger and deliverance with the same mixed sensation of uneasy joy and halfextinguished fear with which a man looks back on a precipice from the brink of which he has just escaped  i think these letters should be instantly  though very cautiously  communicated to sir edward i fear the emotions they may excite may hurt him i will consult with doctor howard i will tell him every thing no regard is due to the character of that creature how i execrate her thank god thank god my friend has escaped her honor now permits  commands him to break with her yet should this discovery come too late  my joy would be extravagant did not this dreadful apprehension temper it but i trust that supreme justice will not suffer him to die a martyr to the nobleness of his own sentiments louisa he will live  he will be happy  my heart is filled with trembling gladness  with what contemptuous pity do i read the latter part of miss ormsbys letter it is very expressive of the secret tortures that must ever wait on the most prosperous wickedness what despicable lines are these  heighho  how melancholy the stillness of the night makes one the family are all asleep i hate silence i wish i slept in one of the street rooms  poor wretch louisa my sensible my chaste my alladorable louisa could you have had a notion of clamorous voices and rattling carriage wheels being preferred to silence and contemplation  how effectually do people destroy their own peace of mind when by a vicious conduct they subject themselves to the low necessity of deceiving others thereby doing much more harm to themselves than ever the deceit can do to any body else miss ormsby though she thinks her crimes beyond the possibility of discovery and her schemes beyond the reach of disappointment dreads  she knows not what starts at her own shadow and finds nameless terrors in the gloom and silence of the night had sir edward become the dupe of her artifices and discovered too late that he had lost both happiness and honor though to preserve the latter he nobly resigned the former yet conscious integrity would still have supported his honest soul and a thousand bright reflections would have broken the impending cloud of woe  if all be not right within how vainly do we endeavor to enjoy what we call pleasure  how poorly do we shrink from the lightest touch of mental pain  almighty virtue it is to thee we owe our zest for pleasure and our balm for woe our felicity depends almost entirely on the rectitude of our own hearts then while we are daily complaining of the miseries of life what do we but tacitly reproach ourselves the sting of misfortune indeed is sharp but if it be not poisoned by the hand of vice the wound it gives may easily be healed let a man put on the armor of righteousness and the arrows of misfortune will drop at his feet but if he will go forth to battle naked and defenseless he must bear the punishment justly due to his rashness and obstinacy  my beloved you will excuse me if my reflections have wandered from my subject for their seriousness i do not apologize i know you would not think yourself obliged to me if i did  my courier is ready and i hasten to conclude that i may not withold this interesting intelligence from you a moment hope with me that this very fortunate incident will produce all the good effects it seems to promise  yours for ever methuen  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage doctor howard and i held a consultation yesterday evening  perhaps my dear you did not before know that i was one of the faculty  he thought it expedient that my medicine should be administered immediately wanting however the consummate skill of the physician and the happy selfconfidence of the empiric i deliberated in anxious fearfulness often did i hold out to my patient the cup of joy and as often drew back my hand and withheld the hazardous recipe i watched by him for several hours in the most uneasy state of mind possible to be imagined about twelve oclock he awoke a good deal refreshed from a sleep of near three hours the first he has had since his illness he pulled back the curtain  my dear augustus why will you sacrifice your health to me in this manner for gods sake go to bed where is my sister  sure she is not up too  i answered no which by the by was false  the doctor looked at me with meaning and took philip out of the room  i drew my chair close to the bed and feeling his pulse  you are better my dear marchmont  are you turned physician said he with a faint smile  yes and with gods help will do more for you than doctor howard has been able to do  i observe you use the quacks prudent proviso  with gods help  dont put the quack upon me sir  rearing up my head as proudly as if it had been adorned by the huge faculty wig  i would have you to know i pretend to be a physician of more eminence than howard himself he applies his remedies only to the body  i heal the mind  he looked at me wistfully sure my lord you have not  but it is impossible after the solemn promise you made me  i will not clear myself from this half accusation as i think you must have too favorable an opinion of me to suppose me capable of breaking my word but could no hand except mine think you loose your heavy chains  he replied with a look of calm despair yes the hand of death  and that i hope   hush for mercys sake as i hope to be merry for the rest of my days you have almost broken my heart already  how strangely you talk where is the sensibility the tenderness that distinguishes my friend  totally exhausted and now i am resolved to be gay and you shall be so too why man i have news for you will set you on your legs in three days time  i cannot conceive said he sighing that you should have any thing to tell me capable of reconciling me to life  would not happiness reconcile you to it  happiness alas it is flown for ever  you are mistaken it flew away indeed but you have overtaken it and i doubt not will shortly be able to clip its wings  if you have really any agreeable intelligence for me i entreat you tell it without all this gaiety which excuse me if i say is a little illtimed  by no means so ought the messenger of joy to wear the livery of sorrow i have two letters here  taking them from my pocket  i wish i dare read them to you  but you will be all emotion raise your fever and howard will come in just now and shake his big wig at me  what letters are they  you shall know presently but first let me ask you  have you fortitude enough to bear the loss of your mistress  my valeria cried he with extreme eagerness  not your valeria but miss ormsby you have lost her for ever  is the poor girl dead demanded he much surprised  no she is dead to you though  then said he hastily i hope somebody has run away with her  very loverlike upon my word observed i laughing  dear methuen do not trifle with my impatience  i read the letters to him first telling him their contents that i might not surprise him the generosity that peculiarly marks his character appeared in its sull luster  he called miss ormsbys letter to her sister a forgery until he had compared it with her handwriting which put the matter out of doubt he framed excuses for her said that webster was undoubtedly some artful lowminded fellow who by the force of personal allurements and perhaps by too frequent opportunities of conversing with her might have stolen into her heart when she was young and inexperienced and whilst immature reason yet wanted strength to hold the reins of passion had taken a base advantage of her weakness and love he added that large allowances were to be made for her renewing her connexions with her lover though married  her reputation being absolutely in his power her love for him violent and a second breach of chastity much more difficult to withstand than the first the consciousness of worth was extinct and modesty and pride the two great safeguards of female honor weakened with regard to him perhaps wholly subdued notwithstanding these effusions of humanity he was overjoyed enraptured at his unexpected deliverance though too severe to himself and too indulgent to others he blamed himself for being so what a wretch i am cried he to rejoice at an incident so full of horror i might say with the devil in milton  evil be thou my good  i forbore to answer him lest the length of our conversation should fatigue him too much he lay silent and quiet a good while but the agitation of his mind was easily discernible in his speaking countenance at length giving a spring as by the impulse of sudden passion he tossed the bed clothes off his shoulders and catching fast hold of both my hands  o methuen if my valeria  he wanted breath to proceed i entreated him to be composed and endeavored to make him sensible that his recovery depended entirely on himself  although i was obliged to leave his thoughts at full liberty on this subject i was determined to fetter his tongue and ringing the bell soon brought in the attentive philip and a little after him the doctor  sir edward peremptorily insisted on my taking some rest giving at the same time a like command to his valet but the affectionate creature protesting  i believe with much less truth than good nature  that he had been in bed great part of the day he was permitted to stay and i reluctantly withdrew but i could not think of sleep till i had given you this recital  bon soir ma chere louise ou pour mieuxdire bon jour for it is three oclock  heaven be praised he is somewhat better this morning the doctor says his disorder has taken a favorable turn it is observed that physicians generally make the worst of their patients distemper in order to give the greater opinion of their skill in curing it  this goodnatured son of galen au contraire has been all along endeavoring to persuade us that sir edward was in a less dangerous way than he really was i believe mrs wentworth would have been by this time as ill as her brother if howard had not kept up her spirits by the most confident assurances of his recovery however he now agrees with me in thinking the most unhappy consequences might have ensued from the vexation of his mind my sanguine hopes of him said he arose from my ignorance of the original cause of his illness i should have thought it strange if four and twenty and a sound constitution could not have overcome such a fever but as he has so lively an imagination and was absolutely determined to die there is no saying what might have happened but now my lord added he with a benevolent smile that i may reasonably presume i have his imagination on my side and that he is wise enough to be determinedto live my life for his he will be able to visit his mistress before this day three weeks  i shall always think myself obliged to this good man for the constant attendance he has paid here to which i am convinced he was prompted more by a sincere esteem for his patient than by any view to interest  marchmont wanted to consult with his sister and me on the most proper way of breaking off the treaty with mr ormsby without injuring the young lady we both advised him not to perplex himself with the affair at present the family has already been informed of his severe indisposition  nothing more need be done till he is well  he then begged mrs wentworth or me to write a line of acknowledgment to lady mary webster carefully avoiding therein to make unnecessary reflections on miss ormsby i said if he pleased i would go to lady mary as i was very curious to know how she got miss ormsbys letter my proposal was readily assented to accordingly i go to london this evening sleep at my own house there tonight wait on her ladyship in the morning and return to hermitage to dinner  ever your faithful methuen  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill london i have discharged my commission a merveilles ecoutez  i passed the evening with my worthy friend dean domville we were quite en famille no company but lady lucy domville and myself i enquired of her ladyship for the hibernian beauty she smiled at the epithet i wish said she lady enmore heard you it would delight her when miss obryen went to france they at first called her by way of distinction la belle angloise but lady enmore with a kind of national pride insisted upon its being changed into  irlandoise  i asked what stay miss obryen made in england  i really cannot exactly say my lord she replied she and i go together my stay depends on my sister looking archly at mrs domville and my fair friend has now gotten a nursery of her own  i heard she was at granvillepark said i i hope none of that family is indisposed  they are very well she answered but her countrywoman and mine lady mary webster is extremely ill she requested i would write to miss obryen to come to her which i did yesterday evening i had a note from her this morning she tells me the duke of granville will not suffer her to leave him but the whole family will come to town this evening on purpose to give her an opportunity of attending lady mary  i was agreeably surprised to find lady lucy knew this lady and threw out some questions concerning her as indirectly as i could though i dare say notwithstanding my caution she thought me very impertinently curious the information i drew from her is in substance as follows  lady mary webster is daughter to the late earl enmore whose title became extinct at his death he left every thing to his wife except her own fortune of ten thousand pounds which was settled on lady mary  lady enmore took her daughter and miss obryen to france with her last summer a little time after the latter came over here lady mary left france  entirely against her mothers approbation and consent  with mr webster a man destitute of birth fortune or character who must have married her said lady lucy only with interested views as her manners and conversation are not engaging and her person ugly even to deformity her mother has not yet received her into favor and i suppose never will i fancy added she lady enmore will make miss obryen her heir for she is excessively fond of her i wish heartily that she may though i am sure valeria herself does not wish it  lady mary is much obliged to your ladyship said i  o my lord putting up her lip if you knew what a disagreeable creature it is  and so said the dean because the one is handsome and the other ugly   it is not that brother interrupted she but if you were as well acquainted with the nobleness of my friends mind as i am i am certain you would join with me in wishing her as much distinguished by fortune as she is by birth understanding beauty and accomplishments  we all joined in her just panegyric the dean did so in the following words  i esteem miss obryen as much as i admire her and yet if i were a single man i should be very sorry to be her lover  why so demanded mrs domville i dont think she has any thing of the insolence of a beauty  still he replied i could not bear the consciousness of inferiority the fear of being thought presumptuous the despair of gaining her and the mortification of seeing her surrounded by more deserving lovers  however said lady lucy your anxieties would be of short duration valeria is too generous to trifle in these cases but you would have a bad chance of succeeding i can tell you to my knowledge she has refused great matches indeed it cannot be expected that we beauties  affecting to look grave  should be as easily won as other women the language of admiration when seldom heard and only from one or two particular persons affects the heart wonderfully but those to whom every mouth has addressed it from their very cradles become at length totally insensible to it  this conversation naturally threw me into reflections on my friends affairs and excited a fear that miss obryen might not countenance his addresses this very disagreeable apprehension threw a gloom over my mind and probably over my behavior though my friends were too polite to let me see they took notice of it when i left the deans and got into my own solitary house and still more solitary bed my thoughts reverted to this subject after considering the matter a good while i determined to call on the young beauty in the morning be she as obdurate as she may thought i surely she will not be able to refuse the finest fellow in england who is actually and literally dying for her the more i ruminated on my project the more i approved it i could say more in his favor than he could well do himself i could represent his connection with the unworthy ormsby more to his advantage than he could allow himself to do  au pis aller my interposition could do no hurt if it did not forward his suit at least it could not retard it or be any way detrimental to him  accordingly i went to the duke of granvilles this morning and desired to know if i might have the honor to see miss obryen i was shown into a parlour and sent up my name she came down immediately  out of breath  evidently trembling  quite discomposed  je nen augur ai pas mal i determined to conquer her heart  dont be alarmed louisa only to conquer it for marchmont  par un coup de main i approached her with a dejected air  it is on a very melancholy occasion dear miss obryen that i give you this trouble the blush that confusion had spread over her face on her entrance vanished she became quite pale i led her to a seat and cruelly resolved to pursue my advantage you will pardon me madam if i enter abruptly into the occasion of my visit she bowed her head sir edward marchmont resumed i loves you to distraction he did so from the first moment he beheld you an engagement into which he had been very artfully drawn obliged him to conceal his passion the restraint has thrown him into a violent fever  he is dying  she fainted i caught her in my arms and pulled the bell with violence a servant came in and seeing her condition ran up stairs without waiting for any orders in a moment the room was filled the duke lady carysbrook her two daughters and a number of servants of both sexes flew to her assistance i carried her to a window  granville snatched her from me and supported her himself he gazed on her with tenderness and concern and glancing on me a regard of mingled scorn anger and curiosity  who the devil are you sir  what is the matter with her  what have you done to her i made no answer to these uncivil and peremptory interrogatories but employed myself in throwing up the sash and internally cursing my wellmeant stratagem  lady carysbrook administered drops cold water etc with a countenance full of anxiety  lady alicia sedley wept and held one of her cousins snowy hands pressed in both her own of scarce inferior whiteness  lady fanny seemed frightened out of her wits ran up and down the room jostled the servants spilt a basin of water and broke a bottle of hartshorn  at last the lovely cause of all this bustle opened her fine eyes fixed them languishingly on me and held out her hand i kissed it with ardour i loved her for her sensibility i loved her still more because my friend was the object of that sensibility the duke looked at me again  bless me exclaimed he pray are you not lord methuen i bowed my answer i am afraid my lord said he i have treated you with indignity i beseech you to excuse me i really did not recollect your face and my granddaughters fit surprised and frightened me so much i was not master of my temper  i assured him there was no occasion for apologies and begged that when the young lady was sufficiently recovered i might be permitted to speak a few words to her on a subject that was not likely to discompose her if he pleased it should be in presence of one of the ladies  he nodded a doubtful assent and ordered the servants to retire  the first use she made of her returning senses was to thank his grace with the utmost sweetness for his attention to her he kissed her placed her on a chair and sat down by her his arm enclosing her elegant waist he whispered to her i suppose to ask if she chose to converse with me for i heard her answer yes my lord if it be agreeable to you he then requested i would be kind enough to spend the day with him lady carysbrook seconded the invitation i thanked them but said it was out of my power as i was indispensibly obliged to leave town immediately to attend the sick room of a dear friend  after a few compliments on both sides he wished me a good morning and desiring the young ladies to take care of their cousin took lady carysbrook out with him  lady alicia took her grandfathers seat i placed myself on the other side of miss obryen and was preparing to tell her edwards true situation when she turned to me with a deep sigh what can i do my lord  what would you have me do your friend is engaged but tell him said she laying her trembling hand on my arm tell him though i cannot be his he shall never have the mortification of seeing me anothers her vermillion lips grew pale and quivered as she spoke a flood of tears prevented her fainting again she leaned on the gentle alicias bosom  admire louisa her extraordinary her delicate and disinterested offer  dont you love this girl  charming woman cried i with transport justly most justly does lady lucy domville call you generous and nobleminded permit me thus and i put one knee to the ground to express edwards obligations to you  lady fanny started up and caught hold of me  rise for pitys sake i have a mortal aversion to all tragedy scenes i arose secretly despising her levity but the tears that sparkled in her pretty eyes half recovered my good opinion she drew a chair and sitting down beside me with a familiar and not unpleasing air  now explain this matter to me my lord i understand no more of it than this  a gentleman you call edward loves valeria and is engaged she promises because she cannot marry him not to marry any body else it is very unjust in my opinion both of you and the gentleman and excuse me  shaking the powder out of her hair  very like the dog in the manger to exact such a sacrifice from her and very romantic in her to make it to live single  shaking her head again  to die an old maid    fie fanny said her sister is this a subject for raillery  with a view to spare miss obryen i addressed myself to lady fanny it would make me so unhappy madam said i that you should think my conduct censurable that i must beg your attention while i fully explain the whole affair  i presume you have seen sir edward marchmont  yes in public but i am not acquainted with him he is delightfully handsome and i have heard him very advantageously spoken of one might have compassion enough to marry him but not to take a vow of celibacy for his sake  nor would he i answered desire any woman to make him such a sacrifice as you just now properly called it  but proceed my lord you were going to tell me something  before miss obryen came to england sir edward marchmont made proposals of marriage to a young lady of seeming worth solely induced thereto by the belief that she loved him though as well formed to feel as to inspire the tenderest of all passions he had a strange  and as he has since found illgrounded opinion of the insensibility of his heart  mistaken gratitude taught him to give a faint preference to the lady in question and that was all he thought himself capable of doing he saw miss obryen  the discernment that made him so nice in his choice and had hitherto secured him from the sex now only enabled him the better to discover her exquisite merit a novice in love he attributed his new feelings to just admiration and deserved friendship till his affections were too far gone ever to be recalled  lady fanny repeated the following lines of a song  les coeurs a lamour rebels tot ou tard sentent ses feux   i hope you will experience the truth of the observation said lady alicia for your impertinent interruption pray go on my lord  i continued  honor that refinement of aggregated virtues which never held a more unlimited sway than in sir edwards breast directed him to choose a life of misery rather than take the smallest step to free himself from an engagement which the lady gave him every reason to suppose was necessary to her happiness at length the wedding day was fixed and the violence of conflicting passions increased the near and certain prospect of complete wretchedness could not shake his resolution but it brought on a fever actuated by despair he shunned not  he courted death and the continued perturbation of his mind added hourly strength to his disorder till heaven itself  i will say so  interposed the injured wife of a man to whom my friends intended bride had shown unbounded favor sent him a letter written by her and addressed to her sister  miss obryen will be pleased to read these letters while i tell you their contents you will excuse my suppressing names as marchmont would not forgive my exposing the young lady  la belle irlandoise took the papers with an air of confusion and surprise and went over to a window when i perceived she had done reading them i approached her  amazing absolutely amazing said she in a low voice as she gave me back the papers but can your lordship be certain that letter was really written by miss ormsby  i assured her there was not the least room to doubt it the similarity of her behavior to edwards on the same occasion struck me  lady alicia joined us you will excuse us said she to miss obryen if we leave you it is time to dress you know we have some visits to make before dinner without waiting for an answer from her she turned to me  our acquaintance my lord has commenced rather whimsically yet i flatter myself it will be durable and i shall ever remember this day with particular complacency be assured your company must always give the highest pleasure to every individual of this family and your friends  you understand me  smiling may be certain of the best welcome in our power to give  i made a suitable return to her considerate politeness and she retired with her sister  i then begged miss obryens forgiveness for the alarm i had occasioned her heartily telling her my motives for it  in short said i i feared that accustomed only to refuse a common plea would not suffice to move you yet i told you no more than would have been true two days ago now thank god he is recovering and i trust will soon be out of danger  she sighed gently as i concluded my lord said she you compliment me too highly on the side of beauty but allow me to say you do me not justice in other respects  why should you suppose me hardhearted never did i hear a sigh to which the sigh of sympathy did not unbidden rise nor saw a tear i answered not with tears believe me i am above coquetry and would neither basely excite a vain expectation nor ungenerously delay a favor i meant to grant  here louisa here is the language of a noble heart this girl is worthy of my friend  i conversed with her above an hour with all the ease of friendship i spoke of miss ormsby without scrupling to censure her as she deserves her beautiful rival forbore to pass any judgment on her in which she certainly was extremely right as it did not belong to virtue to excuse nor to the delicacy of her own situation to condemn her  she treated lady marys misconduct with much more tenderness than lady lucy had done said though she might be blamed for her imprudent marriage she was greatly to be pitied in its event it was hard she should not find a friend in him to whom she sacrificed all her friends  i asked what was her ladyships disorder  she could not tell as lady lucy had not particularly informed her and she had not yet seen her it being very late when she came to town the preceding evening but she believed her in the last stage of a consumption  i told her of my message which i requested her to deliver for me as i supposed i could not be permitted to see lady mary she promised to do so and likewise to indulge the curiosity i expressed with regard to miss ormsbys letter if it should be in her power  i took my leave with reluctance though well satisfied you may believe with my success how shall i rejoice my friends heart how does my own already rejoice in the anticipation of his happiness  i must conclude for my dinner waits it will be the most uncomfortable meal i ever sat down to for i am quite alone i believe i should go to my servants table if i did not think my presence would be a disagreeable restraint on them  in order to have time to write to you i sent to let mrs wentworth know i could not be with her till evening  i hope to return to you in a few days in the mean time continue to write to me and always tell me how you are you mention your own health as slightly as if it was not the most important subject to me you could possibly speak on but i hear from the servants that you are quite well god preserve you my angel  embrace your bold boy for me  methuen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london i pay such close attendance to the unhappy lady mary that i have scarcely a moment to myself otherwise i should be much to blame for being four days silent as i think  i flatter myself  you must be impatient and uneasy to hear how sir edward does praised be god he is better  i enclose you letters i received from him and my affectionate friend mrs wentworth the day after i saw lord methuen  no excuse me i send mrs wentworths letter and a copy of her brothers  dont laugh at me dear aunt  i am sure you will admire the delicacy of his style how few men situated as he is  for doubtless lord methuen told him every thing  would express himself thus delicately  with such timid respect  i have written to him and not without tenderness since i reproved him for endangering his health by writing to me and forbad him the use of his pen till he is well enough to leave his bed  i believe i need not vindicate my behahaviour throughout this assair to you i know you are no friend to coquetry indeed wherefore should not i certain that i possess his affections and unconscious of offense entirely conside in him who conducted himself with such nice honor toward a woman he did not love and still wishes and studies to promote her happiness after receiving the grossest injury and affront it was possible for her to offer him  i think madam i never was so oddly encompassed with pleasures and sorrows as i am at present  one copious source of pleasure i need not point out another which i derive from the extreme kindness of my grandfather he will always have me call him so and his family is likewise sufficiently obvious i am extremely happy too that my wishes for miss marchmont are answered she tells me that the amiable marquis de st clair has declared himself her lover she has imposed on him a probation of two months in his particular circumstances it was both delicate and prudent to do so i question not however he will find means to persuade her to shorten the time she writes to me with that warm and cordial friendship which subsisted between us before our little rivalry and which i feared of late was in a great measure extinguished on her side she was unjust but i blamed human nature  not miss marchmont and with a secret satisfaction repeated those very fine lines  ne vous informez point de leur reconnoissance il est grand il est beau de fair des ingrats   in seeking leonoras advantage i found my own the path of rectitude i have ever experienced leads to felicity  o may i always tread it i endeavored to secure her happiness and heaven took care of mine so much for my pleasures  you may be sure i mean my lately acquired ones as i do not mention my dear uncle or you  my sorrows are  first an anxious solicitude a thousand tender fears for sir edwards health secondly and lastly  how few people could so easily reckon up their sorrows  a sincere affliction on lady marys account her chief physician took me aside yesterday and honestly told me his attendance was quite unnecessary the lady was beyond the power of medicine might linger out a few weeks but never could recover i begged of him to continue his visits notwithstanding and asked if he did not think it expedient she should be informed of her danger he shook his head and said she was very despondent already but as there were absolutely no hopes i might do as i pleased i have a poor opinion of the efficacy of a repentance extorted only through the fear of death and imagine that a dying person is far from being capable of properly settling even worldly affairs for as the soul in its embodied state must have the expression of its powers modified by the nature of the organs through which it acts it is clear that any disorder in the nice mechanism of the body must affect the action of the soul yet though every body confesses the necessity of preparing for an event which cannot be prevented  unhappily there are but too many who love to postpone all consideration of it therefore i think it extremely wrong in a bystander to conceal the certain approach of death it is cruelty at least it is very illjudged compassion it is not probable that either spiritual or temporal concerns will be advantageously settled at this very awful period when the vigor both of mind and body is broken but if it be possible they can be settled at all people should have a chance given them for doing it with the permission of lady marys physician i undertook the most painful and melancholy office i ever executed she seemed greatly alarmed though she said she expected it on the whole however she behaved with fortitude called death a refuge from calamities worse than death calamities which she had brought on herself she mentioned her mother with tenderness lamented her alienation from her and severely lamented her own disobedience which she considered as the cause of her subsequent misfortunes having thereby incurred the displeasure of the almighty  she appeared altogether in a frame of mind very suitable to her state  i ventured to ask if she chose to see mr webster her placidity was no more  she bit her lips  called him a villain who had basely betrayed and ungratefully sacrificed her loaded miss ormsby with execrations  not to say curses i shuddered but as i perceived her passions were just then too strong to combat i did not attempt however i have since taken occasion to drop a few gentle hints on the necessity of forgiving injuries  i suppose her unworthy husband and his  i must add unworthy  mistress are still at jephsonlodge both of them i believe are as yet ignorant of the discovery that has been made apropos  you are desirous i presume to know how lady mary came by the important letter that has done so much harm to herself and so much good to some others  lady conway who it seems is extremely giddy and careless left her cabinet open her maid searched it out of curiosity found that letter amongst other papers which having read she mischievously brought to lady mary who you may imagine handsomely rewarded this fatal service    lady lucy domville has just been with me she hears from her mother that lady enmore is returned to ireland i request you will immediately inform her of her daughters situation i am sure her forgiveness  for i make no doubt of her granting it  will be very soothing to lady mary if she holds to her purposes her heart is not so good as i have hitherto thought it tell her i say so i know by her answer to my pleadings for lady mary she is displeased with me but i am certain she loves and  allow me to add  respects me and would be very sorry i should not think well of her she says i am the most sophistical reasoner she ever knew my arguments might not have been quite convincing but i heartily wish she had allowed herself to be persuaded by them for i am sure the remembrance of her severity to her daughter will give her pain as long as she lives  i have another commission for you madam  my uncle suspects something particular from your concealing my letters from him contrary to your wonted custom i entreat you will tell him every thing and dear dear aunt dispose him to think favorably of sir edward  to my great satisfaction he is already approved by the duke who is well acquainted with his character he took an opportunity of throwing out some oblique hints with regard to lord methuens visit i blushed  looked out of the window  then on the ground  counted my fingers  at last told him i thought it contrary to my duty to keep any thing of importance from his knowledge and taking his hand though without daring to raise my eyes to his face  dear sir said i will you excuse my speaking and lady alicia shall tell you all his eyes glistened at what he called my sweet simplicity he pressed me close to his breast giving me the most flattering and endearing appellations  the dear old man sends every day to enquire about sir edward today when the servant returned his grace read the card aloud as usual the little wicked lady fanny said with an air of gravity you dont know my lord what a vile irish tone miss obryen has in reading though you dont perceive it in her speaking  only make her read that card  i dont know in what tone i might have read it but i am afraid my voice would have been none of the steadiest i suppose i looked a little foolish for lady alicia who cannot bear to see any body suffer the slightest pain for a moment immediately said  come valeria is it not time for us to go to lady mary you may believe i willingly complied you must know madam she often accompanies me to see my unfortunate patient  her gentle heart is open to every distress  lady carysbrook wanted to send her own maid  who is an elderly woman and has lived with her a long time  to take care of poor lady mary who has nobody about her that can be supposed any way attached to her i refused the offer as i knew it would be inconvenint to my aunt to want her and the nursetender seems very careful and orderly i have however placed my eleanor with her who is extremely goodnatured and will do every thing she can for her for my sake  lady alicia comes to propose our spending an hour with lady mary before supper she desired me to give her love to you  i smiled  she repeated her request and says she will love good people whether they are personally known to her or not  she may safely for every good person must love her  adieu my best and dearest friend adieu  valeria obryen  to miss ormsby  jephsonlodge london i have told you a thousand times that webster would be your ruin  but i forget it is you that are to scold me  my vile carelessness we must fix on some plan  to qualify you for it i shall give you a detail of very disagreeable particulars my father and sir james went yesterday morning to see sir edward marchmont which they would have done sooner had they been certain his fever was not epidemical they were received with frozen civility by lord methuen mrs wentworth did not appear his lordship said sir edward was better but not well enough to see them and coldly thanked them in his name for the honor of their visit he had not the politeness to ask either for you or me but said slightly he hoped mrs ormsby was well my father professed much concern that the honor which had been intended his family had been so disagreeably deferred the insolent peer took no manner of notice of this but with a wonderful sang froid resumed a political subject he had before introduced he made them take wine and some refreshments but did not ask them to stay to dinner though it was pretty late my father is monstrously huffed but sir james seems to think nothing about the matter  he you know is one of those dull easy mortals whom it is difficult to vex and impossible to please  i was to spend the evening at mrs hiltons rout and took it into my head that some rings i seldom wear on account of their slightness would look well enough amongst my others but having sought them in vain i was obliged to go without them  i disengaged myself from the cardtable after playing one pool of quadrille in order to flirt with frank preston as we chatted together an officer came up to him perhaps to take a nearer view of me well bathurst said my beau give an account of yourself where were you rambling today i called at your lodgings and they told me you had gone out of town the smart widow to be sure   no upon my honor i did not see the lady you hinted at these three days i confess however i was at the house of a rich handsome young widow but i went there to see her brother sir edward marchmont  i pricked up my ears  how is he asked preston is he able to see company  he keeps his room still returned the other and i suppose admits only particular friends  now hannah it is plain he saw major bathurst though he was denied to our gentlemen and if there was not  to borrow my eloquent sir jamess phrase  something extraordinary in the wind it is to be imagined he would have considered your father and brotherinlaw as his particular friends but you have not heard the worst yet i can tell you this morning  lord knows how i came to be so careful  i renewed my search for the rings but without effect the uneasiness my suivante discovered while i ransacked my drawers etc for them induced me to suspect she had stolen them i called to mind having forgotten my keys on my toilette about ten days ago when i dined at my fathers and being alarmed for the safety of a little cabinet wherein i keep things of most value  as jewels money papers  i ran to see if the enemy had carried their depredations so far i missed besides the rings ten or twelve guineas some gold pocketpieces my grandfathers picture and that of the reverend gentlewoman his wife as to the pictures if the wench had been contentented with taking them i should not have cared a farthing though they were set in gold which i presume was the reason of her stealing them it could not be for their extraordinary beauty i am certain  how proud my poor grandfather would have been had somebody in the spirit of prophecy foretold what was to befall his picture in the latter days little did he think that a fair oue would venture her neck to possess herself of it i will answer for it no woman went such lengths in his favor during his life the lord send harris a husband as old and as ugly to punish her for her dishonesty  but i was going to say that though willing to indulge my maid with the pictures i did not much relish the loss of the rest i was frightened lest the creature had had the curiosity to look at my letters there were some from  you may guess who  no harm in a little flirtation hannah  i found these in a place by themselves and they did not appear to have been touched i presently missed the letter you wrote to me the night before you went to jephsonlodge i dont exactly remember its contents but i am sure they were of a nature not to bear my lady harriss inspection after tumbling up and down for it a great while to no purpose i called her up and abruptly charged her with robbing me threatening to send her to jail she denied the fact and said if i had lost any thing there were other servants in the house as liable to be suspected for the theft as she accordingly i assembled the female part of my family and began a general examination they unanimously avowed their innocence one of them offered to give her oath she had not been in the room which was echoed by all the rest except one of the chambermaids who said she had been in the room but would swear she had stolen nothing harris frowned at her it instantly struck me this girl knew something of the affair and thinking as she is a young country simpleton she would be easily wrought upon i took her into another room and there protested i should send her to jail that moment if she did not tell me the whole truth she fell upon her knees cried bitterly made strong protestation of honesty and so forth and begging me to have mercy on her confessed that she had gone into my chamber by accident that evening and saw mrs harris reading a letter standing at my cabinet which was open her laughing over it it seems excited deborahs curiosity which the other gratified by reading it to her i questioned her concerning it and from the confusion of her answers had the satisfaction to find she did not rightly comprehend it she affirmed she did not know of my maids taking any thing but that letter i eagerly asked what had been done with it she hesitated i placed the formidable jail before her eyes once more she acknowledged that harris had told her in confidence that she had disposed of it to a lady who had given her a great deal of money for it  what was the ladys name she did not remember it was it lady mary webster it was i was beside myself with rage only think what a malicious action it was in the treacherous wretch i forced her keys from her and in a little box in one of her drawers found the pocketpieces rings and pictures i demanded my money she said i owed her as much wages which i believe was true so after venting my rage on her as far as impotent words could do it i turned her away and very merciful i was to let her come off so easily  what is now to be done hannah i am convinced lady mary  she is certainly capable of it  has done you some ill office with sir edward perhaps sent him the very letter you know lord methuen and he are prodigiously intimate what was known to one would not long be a secret to the other and without his lordship had some good reason for it i cannot believe he would have treated my father and sir james as he did for he is confessedly exceedingly wellbred  can you think on any scheme whereby to extricate yourself from this terrible dilemma you may depend on my bearing any part in it you please to allot me  could we contrive to disavow the letter and make the whole appear the effect of lady marys malice and groundless jealousy she will soon be out of a condition to contradict us she is given over  there is consolation for you  i dont know what part to recommend to you i think it is well worth your while to go great lengths to secure a husband of marchmonts consequence but do not advance a step without being sure of your ground he is penetrating and take my word for it has not passion enough for you to blind him his demure sister i suppose would be consulted and women find out womens artifices much more easily than men do i dread too lord methuens cool judgment  if you think he is irrecoverably lost  and not to flatter you i fear he is  all you can do is to invent some plausible story to deceive my father and throw yourself on sir edwards generosity to countenance it for if he discovers your intrigue with webster you are utterly undone and i dont see how he can well avoid discovering it as he will be under the necessity of making a sufficient apology for breaking off a match which was on the point of being concluded o that horrid fever nothing ever was so mal a propos had it seized him one week later you would have been lady marchmont a separation would have been the worst that could have happened and that is often a very desirable thing  i suppose poor mr webster is piteously grieved for his ladys illness i hope you are humane enough to endeavor to comfort him it is really melancholy that such a beautiful woman should be cut off in the bloom of life  happen what may it is my advice to you never think of taking webster for better for worse ambition and prudence  though they seldom give the same counsel  equally oppose it he is meanly born and enter nous our blood wants a little refining on one side at least his wifes fortune  you know he has nothing else  will not entitle him to yours and depend on it he would soon run through both besides as you can never expect that my father will consent to your making such an alliance you must wait till his death which is probably a distant event add to all this webster will not have any respect for you or confidence in you after the experience he has had of your character  excuse this free remark be guided by me set your cap at some sober leadenpated fellow with a good estate over whom your beauty will secure you an easy dominion retain webster since he is so agreeable to you and if you conduct yourself with common prudence you have such a gentle innocent sanctified appearance you will never be suspected  o ciel what a letter is here the longest i ever wrote i expect you to thank me for it it puts me in mind of my boardingschool correspondence with burton when i    bid him still adieu yet added more let me know what you intend to do that i may have my lesson  my compliments to bab jephson tell her her wicked eyes have done a world of mischief amongst the beaux  pierced poor hammonds heart through and through seriously he professes himself violently smitten with her she need not doubt his veracity for every acre of his estate is mortgaged and no lover is so passionate as he  who burns for love and money too these young widows have great attractions cupid never misses his mark when he takes his stand upon a widows jointure land   heighho for a crape fan to ogle the fellows through  emily conway  to miss ormsby  jephsonlodge madam hermitage the uncommon nature of the subject whereon i am obliged to trouble you will i hope be a competent excuse for me if i should seem wanting in that delicacy and respect which is due from my sex to yours i will not fatigue you with any other preface but this necessary one  a letter of yours to lady conway was sent to me by a person with whom i have no manner of connection i see by it that i am not so happy as to possess your affection i must therefore beg leave to decline the honor to which i had aspired  as i know not in what way it would be most agreeable to you i should declare my intentions to mr ormsby i request you will take the conduct of that matter on yourself i rely on your having the kindness to represent my procedure as little to my disadvantage as circumstances may admit  i enclose you your letter madam as i cannot think of retaining it and imagine it will be more to your satisfaction to destroy it yourself than if i were to do so  what it may have suffered before it came to me i am ignorant of and cannot be answerable for but since that period assure yourself nothing has happened to it that need give you uneasiness though i confess it has passed through a greater number of hands than i could wish  when it arrived here i was so dangerously ill that mrs wentworth and lord methuen would not deliver it but with a freedom their friendship fully authorized they opened it my lord judged it proper that a thing of such importance should be made known to me and apprehending that the agitation of mind it would excite might have bad consequences he consulted with my physician an indiscretion of which nothing but the excess of his fears for me could have made him guilty i have since exacted a promise of secrecy from doctor howard and it is my opinion you may very confidently depend on it the letter has not been seen by any other than the persons i have mentioned except a young lady of distinguished honor and unequalled generosity  with the sincerest good wishes for your future happiness  i am madam etc etc edward marchmont  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london ah madam lady enmores maternal tenderness rekindles too late her unfortunate daughter cannot be made sensible of her pardon and affection she is totally deprived of recollection and reason she neither eats nor speaks nor moves  knows nobody and takes not the least notice of any thing that is done about her in short she appears bereft of every faculty of mind and body she is not dead but i can scarcely say she is alive  i am extremely glad lady enmore did not come here though sorry it was indisposition that prevented her let her by no means think of undertaking the journey  her presence can avail nothing for lady mary has every help and all the attendance that could be procured for her and her situation is by much too shocking for the eye of a parent to behold  i directed lady marys maid to write to her master  the following is his answer word for word   i cannot go to town take care of your lady and call in a physician if it should be necessary  frederic webster   soon will this insolent and cruel wretch enjoy the fortune of her whom he has murdered without the heavy encumbrance of a hated wife perhaps i am too severe in saying he has murdered her as she had strong symptoms of a decay long before they were married that he has shortened her life however by some months  or it may be years  is a circumstance that will not admit of doubt the poor creature i fear cannot hold out much longer i ought not to have said i fear for in her dreadful state it is rather the part of humanity to wish to hasten than retard her death  i am so much fatigued and dispirited that i really am not able to write to lady enmore you say she is in your neighborhood  you will please to bear her these sorrowful tidings the soothing gentleness of your manners admirably fits you to perform these sorts of melancholy offices and i know the goodness of your heart ever leads you to seek them  i thank you ten thousand times for the warmth of your congratulations on a certain subject they are just such as i expected from the kindest friend and best natured woman in the world my dear uncle too  and did he weep over my letters  as i read yours i took his picture from my bosom and pressed it to my lips shedding on it soft tears of affection and gratitude how many of his unfeeling sex would have sneered at the girls folly and made a sport of her sufferings but he happily unites female delicacy of sentiment and tenderness of heart to manly firmness and intrepidity  i am delighted with your account of sir francis obryen he is worthy of the noble name he bears my uncle was quite right  as he always is  in declining his very generous offer with regard to me as to the jewels i see no necessity for my accepting any and wish i might be excused but as he is so earnest and you seem to think there would be a disobliging formality in my continuing to refuse them i shall take a few rings or pins or something not exceeding the value of one hundred pounds  i cannot answer your question concerning the chevalier du mornai i never heard of him before the last letter i received from my uncle if your mentioning mrs wentworths name in so slight a manner was really the cause of his disorder there must certainly be something extraordinary in the affair i suppose by obryens immediately retiring with him he is in his confidence i agree with you in thinking he must be a lover of mrs wentworths  possibly he may have seen her at paris where she has spent several months his attachment could hardly have commenced since her widowhood as during that period she has lived in almost a monastic seclusion from the world if our conjectures are well founded he is highly deserving of pity and esteem for so constant and unfortunate a passion i will ask harriet about him the next time i see her i am not afraid of giving her any disturbance  du mornai may love her but she i am convinced never did nor ever will love any other than the man whom she has lost for ever  i had a billet yesterday from the charming invalid he begged i would permit him to wait on me this day but as i had secret information from mrs wentworth that his health was not sufficiently reestablished i thought proper to curb his impatience and have put off his visit till next week  i should write to you two hours longer my dear aunt if i had time but it is near our breakfast hour and i must scribble a few lines to mon petit soupirant at granvillepark this is acting en coquette i think to correspond with two lovers at a time  robert says he languishes to see me  by my absence the trees have lost their verdure the birds their melody  in short the fair face of summer never was so deformed before not even by the iron hand of hoary winter  may each returning season bring health and peace to my maternal friend  valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london will you madam permit alicia sedley to address a few lines to you for your niece who is at present engaged in the very difficult task of informing lady enmore of her daughters death valeria and i have sat together this hour weeping over the remembrance of the sad scene we have been so recently witnesses of and lamenting the hard fate of this most unhappy woman  miss obryen my mother and i spent some part of this morning with lady mary without perceiving any alteration in her as we sat at dinner a message came from miss obryens maid  who has attended her ladyship since we came to town  informing us that she was much better within the last half hour had spoken several times and for the most part very rationally impatient to behold this happy change my cousin and i drove to doverstreet the moment we could disengage ourselves from the table on approaching the bed our too sanguine hopes immediately subsided the wildness of her eyes was the only visible alteration in the deathlike appearance our patient had so long worn she would have stretched out her hand to valeria but could not from extreme weakness it is as you told me said she i am just going  what shall we do valeria whispered i in great terror had we not better dispatch a messenger to mr bailly  my grandfathers domestic chaplain madam who had before administered the sacrament and frequently read prayers to her ladyship we instantly sent to him and to her two physicians  miss obryen then placed herself on a chair that stood at the head of the bed and drawing back the curtain a little was going to speak when lady mary cried out  my mother too  my own mother to refuse ever to see me and even  the remainder of the sentence was so inarticulately pronounced i could not understand it  your mother has entirely forgiven you  she charged me to assure   lady mary without attending to her exclaimed  webster you cruel treacherous villain  and immediately afterward  hannah ormsby hannah ormsby may everlasting curses   valeria with her usual presence of mind prevented her finishing this horrid imprecation  instantly rising and assuming a tone of authority that was quite necessary to restrain her fury  what are you doing said she do you know that a few minutes hence you may be called to account for your sins  and dare you add this black one to their catalogue is this obeying his precepts who taught us to love and pray for our enemies pardon those that have injured you if you would be pardoned yourself your earthly parent has forgiven you  in like manner may your heavenly father pardon all your transgressions so saying she knelt and with that air of humility which becomes the creature when addressing the creator  joined to a dignity and solemnity that must have commanded the reverence of any person who had the least remains of reason  she prayed aloud i was inexpressibly awed and knelt likewise as did the women that were in the room a faint but fearful shriek issued from the bed we all started up except miss obryen i flew to her  terrified lest the unfortunate lady in her madness should attempt to hurt her in my fright i forgot her debility the first look i gave at her almost petrified me with horror nothing can be conceived more frightful than the quick and wild rollings of her sunk eyes and the dreadful distortions of her ghastly face i am amazed my lovely friend had the courage to remain so near her she shrunk not from the bedside but continued to kneel by her  now gazing on her with fastfalling tears of compassion then raising her eyes and clasped hands to heaven her lips moved tremblingly as in fervent prayer perceiving i could scarcely stand and that i supported myself by holding the curtain she arose and insisted upon my allowing her eleanor to attend me home i refused to leave her during this friendly contest mr bailly arrived and one of the physicians who declared his patient to be in the last agonies and led us both into another room in about an hour after they told us she was dead as soon as we had a little recovered from this shock miss obryen with the assistance of lady marys maid locked all the apartments which it was not necessary for the convenience of the servants should remain open and leaving the keys in her ladyships dressing room and locking the door and setting a seal on it she enclosed the key in a letter she made the waitingwoman write to mr webster and which she sent to him by one of our footmen before we quitted the melancholy house  i shall now dismiss a subject so little calculated to please either the imagination or the heart if my being so circumstantial has been tedious and disagreeable it is valeria by whose desire i was so that must be blamed for it  i cannot conclude without expressing the earnest desire i have to be ranked amongst the happy number you honor with your acquaintance i would aspire to more  to your friendship miss obryen paints your character in colors so engagingly amiable it is impossible not to love you and nothing you know is more natural than to seek a return of affection however destitute one may be of any just claim to it  i hope my grandfathers present fondness for valeria  which from the steadiness of his temper and her uncommon merit i am persuaded must endure  will obliterate the remembrance of past unkindnessess and extinguish the animosity that has so long  and i may add so causelessly  subsisted between the obryen and sedley families  assure mr chetwynd of my respect  i am madam with the most perfect esteem your obedient etc alicia sedley  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage no more of your soft reproaches my lovely louisa i fly to you i shall be in my chaise tomorrow as soon as phoebus ascends his chariot and before he takes his nights draught of seawater  a potation i shall not much envy him  i expect to drink a social cup of tea with my angel and when the god reposes himself on thetiss bosom  my charming louisa  but i have done allow me some merit in thus breaking off my bold parallel  as i would not have the shadow of a frown remain on that dear brow when we meet i must repeat to you the cause of my stay at hermitage  edward by means of his vigorous constitution and great flow of animal spirits has i thank god recovered as fast as it was reasonable to expect he could from so violent a fit of illness but his brisk and sanguine temper ill brooked such slow advances to health ever since my conference with miss obryen he has imagined himself quite well and would hardly submit to be treated en malade he wanted to go to london before we thought it safe for him to leave his room as soon as he was permitted to take the air he renewed his resolution and persisted in it with a degree of obstinacy not natural to him he attributed his sisters opposition to the timidity of her sex and the apprehensiveness of her temper increased by her excessive affection for him she observed that he paid more regard to my remonstrances and begged me not to leave him till he was perfectly recovered ill would it have suited my friendship for them both not to have complied with her desire  i have told you all this before my love and yet you almost blame me for staying from you i thank you for this petulance i would not have you unmoved by my absence however necessary i am too fond to be always reasonable myself and i cannot suffer you to be a bit wiser in this respect than i am your general superiority i behold not without jealousy  yet with pride and with pleasure when i hear a man declare  and many such declarations have i heard  that he would not marry a lady of distinguished talents i regard him as a conceited blockhead no matter whether a learned or an illiterate one a man of understanding would assuredly prefer a sensible and agreeable companion to a silly or an insipid one he that would choose the reverse is a puppy and never intends to treat his wife with that respect which her station and even her sex entitles her to and which he ought to pay for his own sake if incapable of being actuated by a more generous motive puffed up with the imagined superiority of his own sex  and at the same time aukwardly conscious that he does not himself possess it  he would fear to have a wifes understanding set in contrast to his own shallowness blinded or misled by vanity he either does not or will not perceive how much it is in a sensible womans power to supply her husbands deficiencies he sees not that the connection is so close the union of interests so perfect that the merit of one party must reflect luster on the other  our education gives us a certain superiority over the fair sex but they on the other hand possess a superiority of a much higher nature  the noble superiority of virtue in some things they are above us in others on a level with us in others again sweetly inferior on the whole then my dear louisa balancing one qualification against another i am of opinion that there is nearly an equality of merit between the sexes and i am very sure that he will never find happiness in matrimony  that is in its native soil  who will not consider his wife as his equal his companion and his friend love soon languishes and dies away when it is not supported and cherished by friendship and though a mutual regard can certainly subsist between persons of very different capacities yet equality though constituted  and perhaps it would be best it should be constituted  by different qualities is indispensibly necessary to true and consummate friendship the warmest the tenderest the most delightful and the most durable affection is the delicious melange of love and friendship they strengthen each other love enlivens friendship and friendship refines love happy the man who has judiciously chosen his lifes companion  who finds the mistress and the friend united in a word  for i cannot suppress the fond boast  thrice happy methuen  it is with inexpressible pleasure i reflect on my dear marchmonts being soon to enter on a state of felicity similar to my own his affairs are in the best train imaginable he wrote to miss obryen some days ago to obtain permission to visit her i immediately protested against his rashness in venturing abroad so soon mrs wentworth with the most tender and earnest importunity besought him not to go but my sweet sister cried he pulling her on his knee i must go how can you have the cruelty thus to compel me to contradict you oh if you knew the half of what i feel  putting her hand to his heart as to methuen i will not listen to him because i am sure if he were in my circumstances he would act just as i do what a tardy wretch miss obryen might think me  a frostyspirited fellow as i remember lady conway once called me besides i dont expose myself to any danger i am perfectly well look at me harriet  have i the least appearance of a sick man except this vile robe de chamber  a compromise edward said i you may go to town provided you wear that robe de chamber  o not for a thousand pounds  and so you will throw it off said mrs wentworth almost crying and i know what will be the consequence  you will get cold and relapse my dear brother putting her arms round his neck why will you be so obstinate  he looked so much distressed that i pitied him and winking significantly at his sister gave it as my opinion that he might go if he would wear two waistcoats two pair of stockings and something extraordinary about his neck he was charmed with my expedient and ran up stairs to write  ah my lord said mrs wentworth why did you interpose he was just going to consent  i thoroughly satisfied her by explaining my intention which was that she should secretly write to miss obryen to forbid his coming accordingly our hasty lover was politely and  both as to the intention and the manner  kindly repulsed she desired him to wait till the end of this week  no disputing her sovereign will  he was obliged to submit  the ardently wishedfor time draws near he sent yesterday to let the duke of granville know he should do himself the honor to wait on him tomorrow his grace returned a very polite card requesting the favor of his company to dinner  you will suppose the invitation very agreeable so in fact it was yet he will not accept it but prefers dining at his own house are you not amazed but the cause is still more surprising than the effect  mrs wentworth accompanies him her fear that he will not take sufficient care of himself is her sole motive for going nothing i believe but the passionate and wellmerited love she bears him could have induced the lovely recluse ever again to visit the gay metropolis i wish she could contrive to shake off a little of her melancholy there but i only wish i do not in the least expect it never did i see so deep and fixed a sorrow  such calm despair how am i pained my louisa when i behold this amiable young creature a prey to neverending grief and consider that my fatal imprudence was  in a great measure if not solely  the cause of her sufferings yet how far is her noble mind from resenting the involuntary injury  from disclaiming the friendship that has undone her  o blind misjudging wentworth how could you suspect such an angelic woman and where did your imagination find the colors that drew me such a villain for your own heart  yes unfortunate man my honored and muchlamented foe your own heart  was good and generous and as much as mine above such wickedness but why my love do i thus unnecessarily distress you by calling to your remembrance an event that has occasioned so much affliction to us both  i will write no more for this subject has made me sad and i do not wish to make you so if i had sufficient command over myself i should never make you the partner of my griefs but my heart is so open to you that it communicates all its feelings without distinction or reserve joy is not joy till i have shared it with you and sorrow loses its name when you become my comforter say by what generous art is it you thus in sweet partition augment all my joys and steal my every sorrow  thou dear source of all my happiness  farewell tomorrow i shall clasp you to a heart that beats but for you  methuen  to lord methuen  poplarhill london human bliss is never without alloy says the moralist the observation is just i subscribe to it with a sigh doubtless this is a right disposition of things were it otherwise we should be apt to place our affections wholly on the happiness of this world without reflecting on its immense disproportion to that of heaven and god knows this is what we are but too much inclined to do already  mavelous you exclaim a sermon instead of the gay flights i expected from him what the deuce sets the fellow a preaching  why my dear methuen i should this moment be the happiest man in the world if i could wrap myself up in my own enjoyments without suffering for the afflictions of others how abominably i express myself what a nonsensical supposition no the man who feels not for the distresses of others cannot be happy himself  and god forbid that he could  selfish happiness  there is no such thing i cannot even frame an idea of it and great poignant as the anguish is with which my heart mourns my lovely sisters woe i would not barter the dear painful sympathy  i will not say for insensibility i would not barter it  for happiness  my spirits are at present in a pretty exact equilibrium though inclining i believe to melancholy for if on the one side i am powerfully elated by my flattering reception at the duke of granvilles on the other i am strongly depressed by what i have seen my poor harriet suffer this day t was above three years you know since she had been in london before when she left this city it was to attend the deathbed of a loved and honored parent a consideration which alone would have been but too affecting to so feeling a mind but here she last saw her adored illfated husband this was too much for her to support i endeavored all the way to divert her thoughts as much as possible from dwelling on such melancholy subjects she was in tolerable spirits till we came near town her cheerfulness then gradually subsided i forced her to taste some wine i had ordered into the chaise on purpose to give her and caused the postillion to drive faster hoping that the quick motion would in some degree enliven her or at least serve to disturb her reflections at length the tears she had no longer power to suppress gushed from her sweet eyes i put my arms round her and laid her lovely face on my breast without attempting to comfort her otherwise than by joining my tears to here is i was several times apprehensive of her fainting  i made bernard take a great round about to avoid driving through the street in which my brother wentworth had resided at last the carriage stopped at my door and i supported or rather carried the dear mourner into a parlour  i knew not what to say to her a melancholy speech might have increased her sorrow and i felt that a sprightly one would have insulted it i judged it best to strive to keep her from thinking at all i brought her up stairs made her walk up and down the dining room with drawing room etc  asked her opinion of this or that piece of painting or furniture i neither expected nor waited for an answer  all i wanted was to hurry the dear creature a little  will you think me a phlegmatic lover my dear friend when i own to you that thus employed i almost forgot my engagement harriet reminded me of it i was extremely unwilling to leave her and feigning a headache would have sent an apology but she saw through my little deception and insisted on my going in such a manner as showed me she would be distressed by my persisting to stay with her  i went  as i enquired for the duke i was shown into his study he received me not only with civility but kindness we had chatted together above ten minutes before i could find courage enough to  hope miss obryen was well not that there was any thing in the dukes deportment or quality that intimidated me he does not appear to me that haughty man you think him and if he were his arrogance would be much apter to inspire me with contempt than awe i have been used to converse with men of rank and though i should think myself highly blameable if wanting in due respect to them  i should despise myself were i suffer that respect to degenerate into an awkward and uneasy fear i do not consider myself so far beneath even a duke that it need at all dazzle my eyes to look up to him there a is point of elevation which places a man on a certain degree of equality with any rank below that of a sovereign prince in short my backwardness to pay this necessary compliment to my charming girl arose entirely from the difficulty i find in pronouncing her name you smile  you examine the construction of the syllables obryen  obryen  a very easy name yes methuen very easy to you perhaps but the most difficult in the world to me at last however i contrived to stammer out this formidable name his grace thanked me replied she was very well and rising said he would conduct me up stairs  i must introduce you to my family sir edward i have two other granddaughters that i am very proud of i assure you though i dont tell you they are as handsome as miss obryen there is not an old fellow in england added he smiling can boast three such granddaughters you are quite in the right thought i if the two i have not seen be any way equal to her i have  o how my heart fluttered as i walked up stairs but why need i take your lordship any further your imagination will present you with the interview you will easily fancy me introduced to the agreeable lady carysbrook and her two daughters whom by the way i should have thought fine women had they chosen their company a little more judiciously but they need not be ashamed to yield to the superiority of the loveliest creature in the universe you will imagine my low obsequious bow to the divine mistress of my foul instead of the rapturous embrace my panting heart would have dictated but with this bow i entreat you connect not the attitude of hudibrass nor the compliment with which he opens his speech  madam i do as is my duty honor the shadow of your shoetie   you will imagine too the rose usurping the lilys place on the most beautiful face the most seducing bosom that ever the fairproportioning hand of nature formed her fine black eyes halfraised sparkling through their long silken lashes whilst her harmonious voice in sweetly trembling accents expressed her pleasure at my recovery  half an hour had elapsed in general conversation on indifferent subjects when a number of visitors came in a circumstance that pleased me as i have remarked people usually fall into parties in large companies and i had already in imagination placed myself on the sofa between lady fanny sedley and miss obryen the timidity inseparable from a love like mine still withheld me when a smart military figure put an end to my deliberation by seizing the object of it i am ashamed to tell you how much this disappointment vexed me and you may believe my chagrin was in no small degree increased when i saw the captain determined to draw every advantage from his post laying close siege to my little fortress i arose leaned over the back of the sofa and sighed that sigh passed not unheard nor unpitied  she turned to me instantly with a look of expressive sweetness  shall we make room for you sir edward then offering a pair of scissars to the captain she said with an air half pleasant half contemptuous  here sir will you cut the cotton of lady fannys knotting  her ladyship laughing praised her cousins judgment in the employment she had chosen for him protesting that nothing could better suit his delicate white fingers his vanity interpreted this piece of irony into a compliment and bowing with a selfsatisfied air he moved nearer to lady fanny while i to my unspeakable pleasure sat down between him and miss obryen i began a most delicious and interesting tete a tete with her which however he had so far his revenge of me as to interrupt every moment  pray ladies were you at drury lane last night said he  no sir  bless me you had the greatest loss  the elegant colonel bibton sat in one of the front boxes you have seen him i suppose madam to miss obryen  never sir  then you have a great pleasure to come he is a perfect adonis  looking sideways into a large pierglass  the finest eyes  surveying himself again  the whitest teeth too  stealing another look  miss obryen smiling repeated the following lines from waller  and when she would anothers praise indite is by her glass instructed how to write   lady fanny pointed her satire more directly and severely  if yonder officer could speak said she pointing to the glass he would certainly tell us captain wilson is much handsomer this colonel bibton  a half coxcomb would have been out of countenance but on our little warriors    brow shame was ashamed to sit vanity was his weapon offensive and defensive his sword and shield and did not more surely expose him to the attacks of derision than effectually preserve him from being wounded by them he was so completely stupefied by conceit that the raillery of the ladies instead of hurting slattered him  pardonez moi mesdames bowing affectedly very inferior indeed to colonel bibton in which probably he spoke the truth though he neither believed it himself nor intended we should he then with a very bad grace pronounced some disqualifying speeches in which by the way vain people always abound we punished him  and i think very properly  by not contradicting him  i am not very certain whether his behavior should be attributed to stupidity or assurance most likely indeed it was the result of both it would be equally unjust and illnatured to call impudence the companion of dullness but i may fairly assert that an impudent fellow is generally deficient in understanding and must of necessity be entirely devoid of that delicate mental feeling we call sentiment  the captain soon became tired of undervaluing himself to so little purpose and by way of changing the subject asked lady fanny what use she made of her knotting she replied it would answer for several purposes  leaning a little forward and looking with an archness not to be described full in my charming valerias face she added i design this to trim miss obryens weddinggown  surely her ladyship did here in some measure sacrifice both her delicacy and goodnature to her vivacity i pitied my blushing fair but her distress was of too delicate a nature to admit of consolation from me i could only increase her consusion by appearing to observe it i turned away my admiring eyes and began to talk to wilson however inattentive i might seem to the incident i felt it  augustus how bewitchingly handsome she looked  how lovely are those effusions of modesty how little did women of fashion know their own interest when they banished blushes from the beau monde  the recollection of my dear sisters situation obliged me to tear myself from my charmers side i whispered to her my intention and its motive i leave you said i surrounded with admirers   for by this time two or three gentlemen had gathered round her with such an air of attention of interest that my fond jealous heart regarded them as rivals  i leave you surrounded with admirers  o promise me that you will not listen to any of them when i go away  how can i make you such a promise demanded she with a smile i looked at her with beseeching fondness  she had the goodness to add  my ear may listen but my heart shall not  the duke followed me to the door and in an obliging manner expressed his regret at my declining to spend the day with him  i must be paid with interest said he for relinquishing that claim i shall expect to see you often and without ceremony come to us en ami i thanked him in suitable terms and took my leave  on my return home i had the satisfaction to see harriet had assumed an air of tranquillity but alas her swollen eyes told me it was bought with many tears  here is philip come in for the third time to undress me i have not the conscience to keep him waiting any longer i told him to go to bed before but he would not ever since my indisposition it is he that is master not i i must not do this nor wear that  but a moment ago he had the assurance to tell me he would complain to mrs wentworth of my sitting up so late upon my word i am finely documented between my sister and my servant dont you think i shall be handsomely tutored by the time i come into miss obryens hands if the dear creature has a mind to tyrannize i shall have my lesson of obedience pat  i have really a great regard for this goodnatured officious philip and consider myself highly indebted to him for his affectionate behavior the care he took of me during my illness shall neither be forgotten nor unrewarded that illness i shall always remember with peculiar satisfaction and thankfulness as it was made the instrument to deliver me from a connection which i can never think of without horror  o this tormenting valet of mine   adieu my love to lady methuen  comment se port elle i would have you translate port literally again adieu my loved and faithful friend  edward marchmont  to lord methuen  poplarhill london how does the thick smoaky air of london agree with me you ask  surprizingly well i am quite recovered within the few days i have passed here however i believe i owe much more to the society than to the air of the place i am every day at the duke of granvilles and every day with delight read my welcome in my valerias sparkling eyes i am really in danger of becoming the vainest coxcomb alive  to be distinguished by such an angelic creature  a woman so superior to all other women  o she is   all that wish can claim chaste passion clasp and rapture name   to be preferred to such a number of rivals  many of them my superiors  apropos  jealous fellow as you call me i was right with respect to lord wardour the duke told me yesterday that his lordship had requested permission to pay his addresses to miss obryen heavens how coldly some men can act in these affairs i should never have thought of asking such a permission i told the duke so he said smiling then i ought in justice to have preferred lord wardours suit to yours to own the truth however i believe my influence had i been inclined so to exert it would have signified very little valeria is extremely gentle but i am mistaken if she be not at the same time extremely steady  i took advantage of our being on this subject to hint a desire to know if i was to receive miss obryen from his grace or mr chetwynd after a pause during which he appeared disturbed he replied  to deal frankly with you sir edward i have no title to an authority over her though she is my granddaughter mr chetwynd has been a father to her as such she regards him to him therefore you are to apply valerias mother as you must have heard married against my consent my resentment  and in that perhaps i was to blame  descended to her it was my fixed resolution to consider her as a stranger to my blood i saw her  heard her  and my resolution vanished she is an irresistible creature  i am sure if my looks were true to my heart they gave a full assent to his observation  i suppose my dear sir continued the duke you know that sir william obryen died in debt and left his daughter   enough my lord cried i with impatience i would not choose to receive a fortune with her  and yet you should receive one answered he had not sir william like the haughty man he was made it the condition of his last blessing to his daughter that she should never receive any thing from me the restriction however extends not to her children   i had actually the grace to redden at the mention of children he laughed at me but quickly resuming his gravity went on to tell me that he would settle an estate in nottinghamshire worth about a thousand a year on her eldest son and twenty thousand pounds on her younger children that he would appoint me trustee and put me into possession on my marriage  dont think me too romantic augustus when i tell you i am almost vexed to find she will bring me a fortune but perhaps she will not think proper to accept her grandfathers offer for my own part i see little or no difference between his giving her a fortune in this manner and the more usual one it is in this light i have represented the matter to mr chetwynd i should be very glad to know her own opinion but it would be altogether indelicate to speak to her on the subject  i am to have the honor to accompany the dukes family to granvillepark tomorrow it is no small addition to my satisfaction that my sister is to be of the party it was with difficulty she was prevailed on to go the dear romantic creature loves to indulge her sorrows in retirement and seems to think there would be a sort of impiety in enjoying any of the pleasures of that world of which her henry is no longer an inhabitant lady carysbrook and lady alicia sedley have quite won my heart by their attention to her they appear to compassionate her exceedingly although they are ignorant of the peculiar nature of her misfortunes and with the rest of the world believe mr wentworths quarrel with you arose from a political dispute  the granville family pass this day at the duke of avons my divine valeria and lady alicia have promised mrs wentworth to sup with her it grows late i begin to fear something may have happened to prevent their coming i sicken at the thought i shall see her tomorrow to be sure but i expected to see her tonight and i cannot bear to be disappointed my watch lies by me on the table  i look more on it than on my paper  how soon do you think methuen i may expect an answer from mr chetwynd i sent my letter to him by express have i do you imagine any room to dread his disapprobation perhaps he is ambitious he may have promised his interest to some competitor of higher rank or larger fortune and her gratitude and affection to him may  away with these apprehensions  the thought of losing her is death to me  ah  she is come  mrs wentworth desires your company in the drawing room sir  by jupiter the fellow has electrified me  edward marchmont  to lord methuen  poplarhill granvillepark when i carried off my mistress in triumph from all the young noblesse and beaux of london i sittle thought what a formidable rival i was to encounter in the country certainly nothing less than a duel can decide the contest remember i engage you for my second  imagine if you can what must have been my astonishment confusion jealousy and rage when on our arrival here the other day a young gentleman flew into my valerias open arms hung round her snowy neck and imprinted a hundred kisses on her enchanting lips  hold master sedley cried i do not quite smother her i entreat you  pray sir demanded he turning about with great quickness are you most careful of the lady or jealous of me  my sweet valeria again embracing her i cannot tell you how much i longed to see you shut your eyes a moment if you please  she did so yes you are every bit as handsome as you were before you went to town  could not you see that she was handsome asked his mother unless she shut her eyes  i saw it very plainly madam i am not quite blind i assure you but her eyes are so bright they dazzle mine and i could not see if she was entirely and exactly as beautiful now as when she went away  upon my word robert said the duke you have early applied yourself to learn the important art of complimenting  i think said mrs wentworth he is already as good a proficient as some who seem to have made that art the chief study of their lives  a future mignon de couchette whispered i to lady carysbrook who stood smiling at her sons gallantry  the little busy impertinent rogue has some way or other found out my attachment to miss obryen and you can have no notion how troublesome he contrives to make himself to me he is continually interrupting our conversations placing himself between us and snatching from me the pleasure of rendering her many of those little trifling nameless services which are so delightful to an enamoured heart to perform    my sister has just now surprised me exceedingly  she has received letters from france which inform her that miss marchmont is going to be married to the marquis de st clair  the very man whose suit to miss obryen she so earnestly forwarded it is really very extraordinary i must go and talk to harriet about it    she has annihilated me this st clair  this happy st clair  was the favored lover of miss obryen sacrificed to her friendship for miss marchmont did she love him then  perhaps she still loves him  the supposition distracts me it is  it must be false have i not reason to flatter myself i hold a place in her affections  and if st clair was ever dear to her could she have forgotten him in so short a time or rather could she  generous as she is  have resigned him to another  could she on my sisters account have destroyed at once his happiness and her own  are the rights of friendship more tender more sacred than those of love  my friend i am disturbed  extremely disturbed i cannot content myself with the second place in her heart no not in any sense the second place i would be loved first and best she is my first love and the eye that pierces the inmost recesses of the soul only sees how dear she is to mine  with what an excess of passion i dote on her  she walks at this moment under my window  she looks up  that look invites my attendance  i will go to you my angel  o that i could tell her the anxiety of my mind  but that i never will  i must not  dare not do it might distress her and that i would not do for worlds it might lead to a confirmation of my suspicions and that too i could not bear  write to me augustus tell me that she does not love st clair  that i only am dear to her  that you saw her weep  faint for me recall that gay dream which charmed my senses o must all my bright hopes be thus clouded in an instant  it is insupportable  edward marchmont  to miss obryen  granvillepark poplarhill will my dear miss obryen allow me once more to trouble her on sir edward marchmonts account  read his letter which i enclose  i do not think it a breach of trust to communicate it without his knowledge to a person who has a much dearer interest in his heart than i can boast of  you need not be told that my motive for acting in this manner is to give you an opportunity of relieving my friend from an uneasiness that a very refined mind only could feel from such a cause nature wrought marchmonts soul almost too delicate to bear the finishing touches of love  that masterpolisher of the mind has refined his to a nicety there is a part of the world  and that not the smallest part  to whom that nicety would appear unaccountable if not censurable or ridiculous but if miss obryen does not both understand and approve it i have greatly mistaken her character  i am convinced you do not at present  and i am strongly inclined to believe you never did  entertain any sentiments for the marquis de st clair that can interfere with the wishes of the gentleman you now favor whatever may be the case my procedure can occasion you no embarrassment as i give you my honor my writing to you shall ever be a profound secret unless you choose to divulge it  i will not apologize for this or any other trouble my attachment to sir edward has prompted me to give you i hope you think the cause of sufficient importance to excuse the effects besides i shall soon have a sort of claim to your friendship which believe me i shall consider as one of the highest advantages i derive from sir edwards  i am madam with the truest respect and  permit me to add  affection  your very obedient servant methuen  to lord methuen  poplarhill granvillepark methuen i thank you a thousand times she loves me  me only i am happy beyond expression  last night when i retired to my apartment i had no inclination to go to bed so dismissed my servant and extinguished the candles preferring the fairer light of cynthia who shone full into my windows it came into my head to take a walk in the garden my chamber opens to a gallery from which there is a staircase that leads into it i feared the door would be locked at that time of night but had the satisfaction to find it open i strayed up and down the walks for some time wrapped in a pleasing reverie i admired the moonbeams shooting through the trees and playing tremblingly over the water at length i became weary of the folitary scene and casting a wistful eye toward the house sighed to myself  what a paradise if she was here i went into a little arbor to indulge my contemplations but was soon roused by the noise of passing feet they stopped and i presently heard my valeria say let us go in here harriet if you are not afraid of taking cold  my heart beat as if it would have forced itself a passage through my breast to meet her  harriet came in first dont be frightened sister said i she screamed notwithstanding  what is the matter demanded her lovely companion rushing in  nothing my soul answered i eagerly pressing her hand to my breast  indeed brother you startled me exceedingly why in the name of wonder are you not in bed  may he not ask the same question in his turn said miss obryen  he may replied mrs wentworth and i will leave you to answer it for i am afraid of sitting here you will find me on yonder gravel walk  we will go with you cried miss obryen hastily  we will not whispered i harriet went away without minding her  i drew her to the seat  my bold yet trembling arm encircling her are you afraid of being alone with me asked i  with a softened voice she answered  no indeed sir edward i am not and i am glad i have met you for i could not find an opportunity the whole evening of conversing with you on a subject  on a subject that i dont know how to introduce  i was very desirous to know what subject she meant but wished first to familiarize her to me as i may say by a little longer conversation that she might speak with more ease and freedom well said i you may first tell me as my sister desired what kept you up so late  because i could not sleep while you suffered any anxiety on my account  you have no cause to be uneasy sir edward believe me i neither do nor ever did love the marquis de st clair  heavens madam exclaimed i in the utmost surprise how could you find out i was uneasy i did not hint the matter even to my sister nor to any person but a friend who is not used to betray me  lord methuen has written to me said she but do not call this betraying you it deserves a very different epithet it is fit that ordinary minds should in dull safety run the circle custom has marked out but when a person unites such a heart as lord methuens to such a head  he is above rules and must be allowed to move a little eccentrically  you did not need her pretty apology my dear augustus i immediately discerned the whole force of this tour dami  tell me my life cried i tell me sincerely did you never love st clair  never upon my honor i will conceal nothing from you sir edward  i had a tender friendship for him  a friendship you will allow me still to retain had not our better stars divided us i cannot absolutely assert that his charms and merit might not in time have made some impression on me as my affections were entirely disengaged and i liked him better than any man i then knew  i can never never thank you sufficiently my valeria for this kindness  this condescension  this amiable ingenuity now thou most angelic woman straining her to my beating heart complete my bliss  say o deign to say that you love your adoring marchmont  imagine with what rapture i listened while in halfformed accents she pronounced my happiness i kissed  but half repulsed yet unreproved with ecstasy i kissed  her balmy lips wild with transport i leaned my forehead on her bosom  the softest fairest bosom that ever heaved to the emotions of a feeling heart  she sprang from me  come says she mrs wentworth will get cold  both her own health and my sisters were too precious to me to suffer me to endanger them by seeking to detain her  i attended them to the foot of the stairs but would have forborne entering the house with them lest if any of the servants were still up and should chance to see us they might make impertinent observations on the incident but neither of the ladies would allow me to stay out any longer  i went to bed but my thoughts were so much engaged i was not able  nor indeed willing  to sleep till daybreak then the soft god strewed his poppies over my pillow and my delighted fancy flew back to the charming night again i beheld my valerias matchless form while the moon shone resplendent over our heads and not a zephyr breathed upon the trees  it was near eleven before philip could find in his heart that was his phrase to awaken me  one would think the fellow knew my dreams  i found all the family assembled in the parlour except the duke who usually breakfasts in his own apartment my lovely fellowrakes had just made their appearance the rest of the ladies had been down stairs a good while upon which lady fanny  who i think always finds something unlucky to say  remarked that one would imagine we three had been sitting up together a conscious blush overspread the finest features in the world  fanny said lady carysbrook it must be confessed you are the farthest from envy of any woman breathing or you would not take such delight in heightening miss obryens beauty  i dont at all deserve your ladyships compliment returned she for i am far from thinking a blush the least improvement to any body  i dont know said mrs wentworth whether it may or may not be an advantage to the complexion i admire it as the sign of a quick and delicate sensibility  lady fanny briskly replied and i  excuse me mrs wentworth  dislike it as a sign of rustic simplicity  thank you for that my dear said miss obryen bowing and smiling  nay upon my honor i neither did nor could mean to reflect on you your goodbreeding cannot be questioned i assure you i have often wondered how you could contrive to unite so much ease to so much modesty one would imagine that a person of your qualifications who had constantly frequented polite company would be inclined rather to err on the side of assurance than bashfulness  lady alicia was of opinion that there were many occasions on which a blush was beautiful and becoming but said she would readily condemn what the french called a mauvaise honte  if your ladyship chooses to adopt the french expression said i i would humbly counsel you not to allow it the same latitude the french do limit its signification as much as possible or your opinion perhaps may  though i am convinced your conduct never will  encroach on the borders of modesty allow me to say that bashfulness  or if you please mauvaise honte  is in your sex much more amiable and engaging than the least tendency to the opposite quality  you speak very justly sir said lady carysbrook modesty is certainly a womans chief ornament and even an excess of it is at least pardonable men indeed require some assurance   o an infinity madam interrupted i gaily for if we dont show ourselves the ladies will never be at the pains to draw us out but for us  we do not love to have a womans perfections too obvious there is a pleasure in the search after them we do not willingly forego it is an universal maxim amongst you ladies that men do not much prize what they obtain very easily you do not judge amiss we love a little difficulty  but you mistake the matter widely when you make a mean and despicable coquetry the source of our difficulties  a man must in that case either give up the pursuit or his reason it is sweet retiring modesty that prompts us to follow  modesty the most distinguishing and lovely characteristic of your charming sex that must ever enhance your value to us  i would by all means said lady fanny have a woman modest yet i think every body must allow that bashfulness often makes one appear in a very disadvantageous light  do not think so i answered  though bashfulness may sometimes obscure the full glare of your charms the effect is as agreeable as shade to the light of a fine picture or i might better compare it to  the gauze with which you cover your bosoms  looking archly at here is  and you know very well that though we love to draw aside the veil ourselves we should be highly disgusted if you attempted to do it for us she colored and called me impertinent you ought to thank me said i for you never looked handsomer in your life if you are wise you will not quarrel with blushes to tell you a secret lady fanny  there is no man that does not feel a certain sensation of mingled admiration and love at the blush of a fine woman  i must this moment bid you adieu and attend the young ladies who are going to take an airing on horseback  edward marchmont  to sir edward marchmont bart  england chetwynd villa sir edward you have as much romance as a girl of fifteen and i like you for it i do love the romantic their hearts are warmed by the fire of their imaginations let cold unerring reason hold unresisted sway in the becalmed breast of the philosopher  passion generous passion must animate the heart of that man i could wish to call my friend the virtues require a warm soil  i never knew them flourish in a cold bosom if the heart does not burn at twenty i shiver to think what a frozen lump it will become at forty if there be a young fellow in the world that could write coolly about such a girl as valeria he deserves to be hanged or i would burn the rascal and supply the want of inward by outward heat  i am a romantic fellow myself indeed you might have guessed as much  we are seldom forward to praise a qualification that we do not possess  or at least that we do not imagine we possess  ourselves i married a woman whose fortune was much superior to mine but i loved her with the most disinterested tenderness  had the wealth of the indies been mine i should have laid it at her feet  my wife is a generous romantic woman who gave me her hand with ten thousand pounds when i had nothing but a curacy and some uncertain expectations of church preferment which i have since partly realized  i give you this sketch of our characters to induce you the more readily to accede to our opinion with respect to the dukes proposal we do no think there can be any sufficient reason to oppose his doing justice to his late most amiable daughter in the persons of her grandchildren we do not think that if sir william obryen himself was alive he would object to it when he on his deathbed became sensible that his extravagance had ruined his child he feared she might have recourse to the duke of granvilles protection and no wonder that his pride was so severely wounded at the thought of leaving her dependent on a man who had always treated him with such unjust contempt but here the case is widely different and the duke has little cause to triumph in being permitted to settle on sir williams grandchildren what his daughter would not accept and  i thank god  does not need  allow me to tell you sir that i exceedingly approve your naming a jointure rather than offering me carte blanch as a person of ordinary generosity would have done very sensible you must have been that i neither could nor would have demanded so large a jointure i admire likewise the delicacy wherewith you hint your knowledge of miss obryens not having a fortune in that however you are mistaken  lady enmore  who is now at my house and whose paternal affection for valeria gives her a right to know every thing that concerns her  insists on presenting her with five thousand pounds on the approaching occasion and will secure to her the possession of a very considerable estate at her decease mrs chetwynd and i must likewise give her five thousand pounds at present and which ever of us is the survivor will certainly leave the remainder of our fortune to her  i am not yet so much of an old man as not to know what must be your present impatience i promise you shall meet no unnecessary delays on my part mrs chetwynd and i are every day in anxious expectation of miss obryens return  i presume you have not employed your time so ill as not to have already obtained permission to escort her my dear sir edward we shall receive you as our friend  as our son  it would give me particular pleasure if mrs wentworth could be prevailed on to favor us with her company i need not say how much mrs chetwynd desires it as she is herself writing to mrs wentworth on that subject  now since i am so ready to give you my valeria  the noblest gift that could possibly be presented to any man  i hope you will not so ill requite my generosity as to snatch her from me immediately  dont be alarmed i am not going to raise any obstacles to delay your union but i must insist on your staying three or four months afterward this is a point that i will not  i mean that i cannot  give up for it is already almost a year since i have seen my darling girl and i imagine you must know the value of her society too well to wonder that i prize it as one of the first blessings of my life  i was just going to conclude when casting my eye over the paper it struck me that i ought first to make some apology for this letter which is certainly the most unceremonious that ever was written on such a subject  not a word of the honor of your alliance and so forth the truth is my best excuse  i already love you and affection with me ever banishes ceremony though i hope not politeness and attention  i am with equal respect and esteem yours charles chetwynd  to lord methuen  poplarhill granvillepark vous vous trompez mon ami i am not at all jealous of lord osmore far from doing me any injury he has really been of essential service to me my valeria before received my attentions with complacency and discouraged those of others but ever since his lordship came to granvillepark she has treated me with a preference so marked as to keep all other lovers  even the aspiring osmore himself  at a distance  i was very near quarrelling with lady fanny sedley this evening  as i was walking with her and miss obryen i was pouring out my grateful heart in acknowledgments to the latter for her generous and considerate behavior with respect to lord osmore lady fanny interrupted me by saying something peevishly i declare marchmont you are the stupidest fellow i ever knew i shall absolutely die with ennui for heavens sake do you think this conversation can be any entertainment to me  pardon me said i smiling i am very inconsiderate i protest i never thought of asking myself the question whether it was or was not this you will say was not a very polite speech but nobody thinks of treating lady fanny with much ceremony people that say free things  especially if they are as goodhumoured as she is  will always have free things said to them she really is not bold but her unguarded vivacity destroys all dignity of character now my valeria with all the ease even of a parisian education preserves in her sprightliest moments a delicate reserve that at once inspires respect and tenderness  but i wander  rude creature said lady fanny in reply to me lord osmore would not have spoken to me in this manner for the world and yet i believe he is as fond of miss obryen and as indifferent to me as you can be  my charming girl said with some warmth lord osmores politeness differs from sir edwards more in kind than in degree  the one is acquired by education and perfected by habit the other evidently flows originally from the heart and is but methodized  if i may so express it  by an acquaintance with the polite world  you make nice distinctions replied her ladyship but for my part if i find a person polite i shall never trouble my head to enquire whether it be the result of nature or education say what you will against lord osmore he is a man quite to my taste and positively i am monstrously angry with you for using him so cruelly as you do  indeed lady fanny said i gravely i am not at all obliged to you for this  dont mind the madcap said miss obryen  vain wretch do i depreciate you by praising osmore  not in the least your ladyship mistakes me entirely you are extremely welcome to praise him but not to recommend him to valerias favor  i did not do so  you complain of that cruelty to him which is certainly kindness to me and vice versa kindness to him would be cruelty to me  not at all she might be kind enough to you both  o madam if that be your way of thinking  i stopped suddenly i believe i was going to say something too expressive of the contempt i at that moment felt for her  my dear fanny said miss obryen you are not a coquette both your understanding and your heart are too good to suffer you to be one why then do you thus allow your ungoverned sprightliness to lead you to affect a character so contemptible detestable as affectation is there may be some sense in endeavoring to appear possessed of any praiseworthy quality though there would be much more in striving really to acquire it  but what can be more wretchedly silly than to affect to be unamiable  how charming it is i exclaimed to hear such language flowing from the rosy lips of youth and beauty may reason and virtue added i affectionately kissing her hand ever have such an advocate  now cried lady fanny to be even with you both for this fine lecture i shall in my turn find fault with you valeria  find fault with her how  where  what  ha ha ha i dare say you do not think she has any faults at all  i do not upon my honor i replied with emphasis  why to be just she has less than most people or conceals them better yet i could point you out a capital one and that is in her conduct to lord osmore and yourself if she dislikes him she ought to refuse him without letting him see it is for you he is refused by acting as she does she puts herself more in your power than is consistent with prudence  i was excessively hurt my dear valeria saw that i was and with a look of tender confidence she laid her hand on mine that little action that sweet look spoke more forcibly than words  her ladyship resumed her discourse  if any thing should happen to prevent your union it would be an irreparable disadvantage to miss obryen to have thus publicly favored you  what disadvantage can it be to her to be known to have some consideration for a man who loves her almost to idolatry should your cruel supposition be realized yet she would have no mortification to fear on that account  i would publish my passion for her to the world  devote my life to her  very fine but suppose she chose to marry some other gentleman  how would he   ah no more said miss obryen i cannot bear to hear you talk thus  indeed valeria replied the provoking creature sir edward himself would value you more if you treated him with a prudent reserve  this is past enduring madam  how can you pretend to know my mind i assure you if any thing could lessen miss obryen in my esteem or induce me knowingly to forget here is it would be her changing that endcaring frankness wherewith she at present honors me for that meanly suspicious prudence you would inculcate as she has never i flatter myself had the least reason to doubt my sincerity and honor a reserved behavior to me could be dictated only by a very cold heart and a cold heart i am sure never was a good one believe me i should despise myself were i ungenerous enough to attempt to take a liberty with any lady which i should think the worse of her for suffering  and her i love is the last woman on earth i could think of with indelicacy  still said she i must insist on it ladies and gentlemen do not enter into these engagements on equal terms  one would think said my valeria you were talking of the dispositions for a battle  no madam but she is striving to make dispositions for a battle i thank her for it  really child addressing herself to miss obryen you ought to consider that if your uncle chetwynd should withhold his consent or   or what demanded i angrily  or if sir edward should forsake you you may probably be obliged to lead apes whereas he can get a wife when he pleases  whatever said i are your ladyships designs happily for me you have avowed fentiments so opposite to the delicacy and nobleness of miss obryens that i am not at all afraid you will be able to prevail against me  valeria said she i will be affronted with you these seven years to come if you dont revenge me for this cutting rebuke  show him my advice has some effect on you  excuse me my dear so far from interfering in your behalf i must tell you that i think his reproof almost as just as it is severe when lady fanny acts up to her character she will find no person more ready to defend her interests than i but when she chooses to sink so much beneath it she is no longer the lady fanny that i love  this said i is the best solution of personal identity i ever heard  and remember lady fanny whenever you act thus perversely i shall consider you as a different person  on that footing answered she let our dispute end  i shall be myself again as i see we are near the house for i give you my word all i said was only for the sake of taking part in the conversation which otherwise you would not have permitted me to do when i have the misfortune to fall into the company of lovers i always quarrel with them or set them a quarrelling with one another  it is the only way a third person can avoid being totally insignificant  well are we friends sir edward  no i will not forgive you this week and i will complain of you to lady alicia the moment we go in  fort bien monsieur then i shall look on you as my declared enemy this whole week and accordingly play you all the mischievous tricks i can think of  no no let us be friends i am half afraid of you since i find you can be so spiteful i would not for any consideration be at enmity with you while lord osmore stays  oh cried she it is the most delightful thing imaginable to have two lovers they keep each other in such excellent order when a man has no rival he assumes so many saucy or negligent airs there is no bearing him if ever i have one over and cannot get a fellow for him i will certainly discard him i would rather go barefooted than walk with one shoe  we shook hands in token of perfect amity but the moment we returned to the drawing room the little urchin found means to set me down to piquet with the duke i told her in a whisper i considered this as an absolute breach of our newmade treaty of peace with all my heart returned she you may begin hostilities as soon as you dare  when i was released from the cardtable i stepped up to lord osmore and begging him to humor whatever i should say to lady fanny i went over to her and in a low voice entreated her to walk to the other end of the room with me quite unsuspicious of my design she complied and i lead her directly to osmore you see my lord i keep my promise with you in giving you an opportunity to thank this lady for the very favorable sentiments i have this evening been so fortunate as to discover she entertains for you she looked quite surprised and confounded  i have not words said osmore to express the sense i have of your ladyships goodness  indeed my lord i  i  the deuce take you marchmont  be not displeased madam i was too much the friend of both parties to conceal a secret that was so necessary to your happiness and so conducive to his lordships to have mutually known  i declare i could beat you cried she in a violent pet  i answered with profound gravity i should be miserable if i thought your ladyship was really offended at my officious zeal  and i said osmore shall be the most unhappy of men should she have the cruelty to doubt   i assure you my lord interrupted she this is all a jest of sir edwards for which i promise him shaking her head threateningly at me i will be sufficiently revenged  she will be as good as her word i dare say  madam replied i i understand you perfectly nobody is quicker at taking a hint  but be persuaded i have served you without any view to interest i dont desire the least return upon my honor  that i believe indeed but if i make you not an ample one  i give you leave to make a similar declaration for me to every gentleman of my acquaintance  generous creature  most generous echoed his lordship i am overpowed with gratitude  i have not language  this kind partiality was as little expected as deserved  sure said she it is not possible you can believe any thing this abominable malicious wretch has told you my lord i must let you know how this matter comes about   i comprehend your meaning exactly said i you would have me leave you with him i am gone  bowing  stay she cried you are mighty penetrating tonight  stay when i desire you  madam i obey the reiterated command with pleasure i easily see why it is given  you would have me spare your blushes by making this delicate explanation for you  my lord as we walked together this evening   be silent you vile provoking animal   your lordships name being accidentally mentioned she   o there is no stopping the wretch dont listen to him osmore go away i entreat you  i dare not disobey your ladyship and leaving her was bending his steps to the upper end of the room where was metal more attractive  la belle obryen at work with lady alicia  now said i to lady fanny this action is more against you than any thing i could have told him  o come back my lord exclaimed she quite frightened  he obeyed  ah cried i how weak are our resolutions when the heart is in a certain situation  you will set me mad said she flying away from us over to the workingtable where she received no better consolation than being heartily laughed at  every body enjoys a joke against lady fanny the little chit is so very apt to be merry at other peoples expense that she has as many enemies as a minister of state  but do i intend to go to bed tonight it is just three oclock  always yours edward marchmont i forgot to tell you that your friend dean domvilles lady is safely delivered of a fine boy to the great joy  as the newspapers will inform you  of that noble family  which by the bye might soon be extinct on the part of the two elder brothers    to miss obryen  england chetwynd villa so mrs wentworth denies all knowledge of the chevalier du mornai  strange  that he knows her too well i am sufficiently convinced  something that happened this morning increases my curiosity and surprise  sir francis obryen and the chevalier breakfasted here the conversation turned on mrs hervey  i believe you remember seeing her at the earl of melmonts  she lost her husband about three months ago her grief was so extravagant as to put her friends in fear of her attempting to destroy herself however she changed her mind and was last week married to a mr walsh a man every way her inferior  sir francis made many gay observations on her conduct and in his usual lively way went on to say that women never lament the loss of the husband but the want of a husband  i hope said mr chetwynd it will soon be in my power to introduce you to a lady in whose favor you will be obliged to give up that notion what do you think francis of a beautiful widow of two and twenty with an immense fortune devoting herself to solitude and celibacy  faith sir it is very extraordinary so much so that i am sure it cannot last long  you said that you expected the lady here  yes very soon  then uncle tapping him on the knee she is the very woman for me  you do not know her said i or you would respect her sorrows  your pardon madam i have done only  her name  harriet wentworth  a chocolate cup dropped from du mornais hand upon the floor and faintly exclaiming my god he fell back in his chair he remained for some minutes insensible as soon as he recovered he made some excuses  awkwardly enough i thought  for the trouble he supposed he had given said that his health was bad and he was subject to these sudden fits  yes thought i when mrs wentworth is spoken of  certainly my dear valeria this is a most mysterious and perplexing affair i feel extremely for the poor chevalier i am persuaded he is deeply unhappy on a nearer acquaintance i find him exceedingly amiable his abord is so very cold that it almost freezes one but by degrees the reserve wears off and allows you to pay due esteem to his worth  he speaks english remarkably well for a foreigner indeed quite as well as a native he generally preserves a thoughtful and gloomy silence but when he chooses to talk his conversation  though always grave  is uncommonly sensible and entertaining  dont you think it was something extraordinary in him to cry out my god should he not rather have said mon dieu in a sudden and violent agitation of the mind it is most natural and customary to use ones own language  i cannot get this man out of my head but i would not have you mention him to mrs wentworth any more lest it might prevent her coming here and i earnestly wish to see her  the moment i received yours i wrote to lady alicia her desire of accompanying you is extremely obliging and the ready acquiescence of the duke and lady carysbrook is very flattering both to you and us  hasten your return my lovely child i long mightily to know your sir edward mr chetwynd is charmed with his letter which he justly calls a noble one  lord melmonts coach coming up the avenue  adieu ma tres chere amie je vous embrasse  caroline chetwynd  to lord methuen  poplarhill granvillepark lord osmore left us this morning the precipitance of his departure was i believe partly occasioned by a whimsical little incident i will recount to you  chancing to rise this morning earlier than usual i intended to take a ramble before breakfast but finding it rained i changed my mind and the door of the breakfastparlour standing open  i stroled in my valeria alone  standing at a window writing carelessly with a pencil on the margin of a newspaper  i stole behind her  she had written valeria obryen and under it valeria marchmont  i caught the betwitching charmer in my arms oh sir edward then hastily and in extreme confusion she would have effaced the pretty scribble i pulled her away embracing her with transport she hid her lovely blushing face on my shoulder i pressed my lips to her forehead  and in that very moment who should enter the room but lord osmore as the devil or his evil genius would have it what a sight for him it pains me to reflect on what he must have suffered at the time however i felt only for my valeria  i gave her a pretense to retire by saying aloud tell me you forgive me and i will not detain you any longer  i thank you said she in a low voice and hurried away  assuming an air of unconcern i said your lordship is an early riser this morning  so are you sir i perceive i believe we rise early from a very different cause  you are too happy i am too miserable to sleep  i did not choose to understand this speech seriously to answer it with raillery was repugnant to my feelings  i was silent and he malheureusement walked over to the window at which miss obryen had stood he instantly saw my name joined to hers and retreated two steps with a look of surprise and anguish  let me take away my impertinent scribble said i putting the paper in my pocket i wish i had been wise enough to do so before she saw it  he made some indistinct apology of letters to write  and left me  i amused myself with a book till the family assembled to breakfast when lord osmore declared he must return to london immediately on business of importance accordingly he took his conge and i have now no declared rival except master robert of whom i should be extremely jealous if he was ten years older  a letter from ireland  how my heart beats    with fearful impatience i broke its seal  from mr chetwynd  fully answerable to my warmest wishes  i must seek my fairest  edward marchmont  to lord methu n  poplarhill marchmonthouse i have this moment been favored with yours and am surprised you should think me capable of treating you with so much neglect no be assured my dear augustus i had not the least intention of leaving england without seeing you  as you say i must have a great deal of courage to venture to attend my hibernian belle to ireland if one of her countrymen does not blow my brains out or run me through the body i shall have a worse opinion of the gallantry of the nation than i have hitherto entertained and yet after all the fine women those tall irishmen have carried away from us it would ill suit their characteristical generosity to grudge an englishman one beauty  i write this from marchmonthouse where i am at present employed in making some alterations and arrangements which will render this fine old seat more worthy of its future mistress i am almost certain the little improvements i am making will please her for during our sweet intercourse of unreserved friendship at the dukes i studied her taste and found it  which most agreeably flattered me  perfectly similar to my own  i must tell you some news i have heard from good authority since i came down here  miss ormsby my old flame  though lord knows she never warmed me much  is going to be married to sir peter ball a poor city knight who i suppose is very glad there should be a mutual participation of his title and her fortune i think knights are quite her game yet i would fain think we are not easier taken in than any other set of men you see she is determined to be a lady at any rate and that as sir peter is considerably on the wrong side of fifty must i presume be her principal inducement to wed him i am afraid it would not be very uncharitable to conjecture by his age that mr webster is not to lose any thing by the match  vieillards qui deviendrez maris mettez bien vos lunettes poor sir peter whenever i call to mind some late occurrences i find myself exceedingly inclined to compassionate any man i think in danger of acteons fate a propos  pray my lord is it not a little surprising that the goddess of chastity and ladies who are not heaven knows very famous for that virtue  should have fixed upon the same mode of punishing our hapless sex  i have another piece of intelligence to communicate you perceive i am quite a newsmonger today  sir james conway has let his estate here to mr domville who ever since his marriage has been fluctuating between ireland france and england i find he intends to settle here so i shall exchange a very undesirable neighbor for a very agreeable one  the two days i have been obliged to spend here have appeared to me insufferably tedious the day is undoubtedly three times as long here as at granvillepark  i go to london tomorrow where i expect to discharge as much business in one day as would take me up four at another time then away to granvillepark  which has more charms for me at present than any other place in the world from that i shall go to poplarhill i believe my sister will accompany me as i am sure she is desirous to see lady methuen before our excursion to ireland which is fixed for next week i was afraid she would not have consented to undertake this little voyage but her gentle temper could not withstand mrs chetwynds pressing invitation which was equally friendly and polite joined to miss obryens persuasive eloquence and my earnest solicitations  it would have thrown a shade of regret over my joys to have left this sweet melancholy creature unprotected and alone  if my love for my valeria could admit of any heightening it would receive it from her tenderness to this dear unfortunate fister who hangs about my heart in a manner i cannot describe how closely does pity tie the band of friendship  tell my dear lady methuen i long to see whether your daughter or arthur has grown most since i was at poplarhill there was then i remember a powerful emulation between them though their ambition was somewhat differently directed she aiming entirely at bulk and he chiefly at height  o methuen how opposite is my present situation to that in which i last visited your amiable family crooked and thorny was my path to happiness but i have arrived at it praised be the hand that led me may the same mighty and merciful hand pour its best blessings on the head of that dear friend whose feeling and generous heart equally participates my afflictions and my joys  edward marchmont  to lord methuen  england chetwynd villa this is my third letter from ireland you see you are getting deep into debt i warn you you will find me a most merciless creditor my first from dublin i presume you have received by this time  the ladies are perfectly recovered of their little fatigue and we are all as well and as happy as possible at chetwyndvilla  our agreeable fellow  travelers mr domville and lady lucy are still at lord melmonts house in dublin but are tomorrow expected at firdale a seat of his lordships within six or seven miles of this place  i am charmed with my future relations  they already treat me as their friend  as their son  with mrs chetwynd i am almost as much in love as with her beautiful niece she is still extremely agreeable in her person though i suppose she must be about forty her understanding is very good and her conversation and manners evidently show a perfect knowledge of the grand monde but what principally attracts me is the affectionate sensibility of her heart which is easily discernible to the most superficial observer there is a tenderness  an air of interest in her behavior to any person in distress that is unspeakably pleasing and amiable i have seen tears in her eyes as she surveyed my sister to whom her whole behavior  as indeed that of every individual of this family  is assiduously attentive and obliging  mr chetwynd is a sensible and most worthy man his temper is warm even to enthusiasm the fire of the man is catching  i frequently feel my heart glow as i converse with him  from this warmth of disposition proceed most of his virtues and all his faults here i may justly apply a line of that character so admirably drawn by goldsmith   even his failings lean to virtues side he can hardly behave with common civility to a man he despises he would scorn to take off his hat to a scoundrel though he lolled in a coach adorned by a coronet  but he would kneel in the dirt to kiss the hand of an honest man in rags  do not figure to yourself a sour cynic snarling at the world  no man is more ready to overlook any errors that do not flow from the depravity of the mind he is polite frank hospitable sprightly and goodhumoured enjoying the world freely but enjoying it with reason and innocence and quarrelling as much with the meanness as with the sinfulness of vice in short i never yet knew a heart every way so totally uncorrupted by fiveandforty years commerce with the world  such are the parents of my valeria  for it is in that light she considers them and most gladly shall i render them the duty and affection of a son they absolutely dote on their niece  how should they do otherwise  they treat her in such a manner that i am seriously surprised she is not as vain as she is lovely and perhaps it was well for her she did not lose her real parents till her mind had acquired sufficient solidity to resist the attacks of vanity yet she was but seventeen when she came under the guardianship of mr chetwynd and his lady  a most dangerous period in life to a woman of her uncommon beauty she has now lived with them near four years  and is it not amazing that their incessant flattery their unbounded indulgence joined to the universal admiration has not quite turned her head yet is she not the most modest the most unassuming of women can i ever enough admire the excellence of her judgment the steadiness of her mind  it has been observed that wherever nature is lavish of personal beauties she is extremely sparing of mental ones  or perhaps we might as well say that the former have a natural tendency to destroy the latter by laying open the youthful mind to the destructive the almost resistless power of vanity  and how very rarely do we see united as in miss obryen  every grace every charm of person and mind there is none like her  nature full of grace made only one and having made her swore in pity to mankind to make no more   and that one  o my exulting heart  that most perfect work of nature was made for me  philip to dress my hair for dinner  i fancy your are not displeased with him for the interruption    congratulate me augustus  my happiness is fixed at the distance of a fortnight  fourteen tedious days  is not the charmer cruel to delay my bliss so long yet i assure you if mr chetwynd had not been warmly my friend she would have put me off a whole month    sir francis obryen  cousingerman to the loveliest of women  dined here today i like him much he is an agreeable elegant fellow of two or three and twenty a great favorite of his uncle chetwynds which is a powerful recommendation to me  i regretted that he did not bring the chevalier du mornai with him  i suppose you recollect what i told you i had heard from my valeria concerning that gentleman  mr chetwynd asked for the chevalier  sir francis replied that he hoped he was well he had been at cork these ten days  lady enmore  did not i tell you in my last she was at chetwyndvilla  repeated with some surprise at cork what could have carried him to such a distance  eighty miles hence is it not  thereabouts answered mr chetwynd pray sir francis has the chevalier any acquaintance there  none sir  he went to see the place  it surprises me exceedingly my lord that such a man as sir francis appears to be should allow his friend  a stranger and a foreigner  to travel alone but perhaps he went with a party however it is certainly no concern of mine and rather impertinent in me to trouble my head about the matter  o i must throw away my pen  i cannot write in this room  what is worse i cannot sleep in it  yet there is but one in the house i would exchange it for  the very one which by its vicinity puts it out of my power to rest in this the partition wall is so thick i cannot hear the least noise  but the very idea of her being in the next room  come sweet morpheus bear away that cruel partition  observe my inconsistency  i tell you first i cannot sleep then immediately begin to invoke the god of dreams  i give you leave to laugh at me since the hibernian air has such an effect on me already in a short time you may expect to hear me sing  since the first time i saw her i took no repose but sleep half the day etc after all i am not so very inconsistent for what are a lovers thoughts but waking dreams  not very clear however that it is morpheus inspires those waking dreams  adieu it is time for me to go to bed  you see i am almost dreaming already  edward marchmont  to the chevalier du mornai  cork obryen castle heavens my dear du mornai leave ireland  as you prize my friendship do not think of it why this sudden resolve and why so soon revoke your promise of spending the winter with me you do not care to see her  well she will not follow you to cork i warrant but i will as soon as i possibly can which will be in a day or two in the mean time seek amusement banish thought banish care i hope you find the families to whom my letters introduced you agreeable when i join you we will take a tour through some parts of this island and i will show you whatever it produces most worthy your observation  i have been to pay mes devoirs to miss obryen an amazing fine woman  i wish you could see her unmeaning wish with all her attractions she would be an uninteresting object to you  i take it strongly into my head that she is the cause of sir edward marchmonts visit to ireland for i dont think he knew either my uncle or aunt chetwynd before he came and his whole behavior to her is most tenderly and respectfully assiduous his eyes follow her with a fond  nay a jealous attention they languish as she retires and sparkle at her approach  enter nous if i did not absolutely despair of supplanting such a man as this sir edward i should find myself exceedingly inclined to feel something more than friendship for this beautiful relation  there is another young lady at chetwyndvilla  besides one i will not mention to you  who is assez jolie and very pleasing her name is sedley daughter to the late lord carysbrook the same relation to miss obryen on her mothers side that i am on her fathers  shall i or shall i not say any thing of  by what name shall i call her to you  pale but extremely lovely  an air of touching sadness  dressed in doleful black   a venus rising from a sea of jet o woman  woman thou art deceitful who could look in mrs wentworths face and not pronounce that tender sorrow the result of suffering innocence rather than repenting guilt  but enough on a subject i ought not to have introduced at all  adieu mon cher chevalier amusez vous soyez gai  francis obryen  to sir francis obryen bart  obryencastle cork pale sad in mourning  o sir francis how this description melts my soul  but fool  fool that i am it is not for the wretched henry she is pale sad or in mourning for him even the mockery of woe is by this time laid aside if she be melancholy it is because perhaps she is forsaken by  his name shall not stain my paper  pardon my weakness i cannot write  i cannot think on any other subject in vain does my reason recall the insufferable wrongs she has done me and time that should have effaced my love has only lulled my resentment to sleep  o cruel harriet false ungrateful woman to what endless  to what unspeakable misery have you doomed a man who while he thought you innocent would have shed his hearts dearest drops for you nay by heaven i would do so at this moment  i am almost ashamed to confess to you i have been so weak as to write to her in my feigned character i have disguised my hand  vain caution i have doubtless no place in her remembrance  i told her  that i had seen her at paris with lady marchmont that i there imbibed for her a passion which marked my future days with woe  i had been married by my father when i was extremely young to a woman for whom i never had the least affection this unfortunate engagement put it out of my power to declare my love for her respecting her virtue   her virtue  o twas profaning the facred name  yet she has more perfections and fewer faults than many who have not her frailty  but of what account are a womans virtues if chastity be not amongst the number it is that which brightens and refines all the rest without it every other virtue under the sun cannot render a woman amiable and with it she can hardly ever be thoroughly contemptible   i said  that respecting her virtue i shunned her sight and determined to impose on myself an eternal silence about a year after this my wife died and resolving to go immediately to england i waited on monsieur de villemar and requested he would favor me with a recommendatory letter to sir george marchmont he informed me miss marchmont was already married  this dreadful and unexpected stroke was near depriving me of my existence i quitted my friends and country rambled over most part of europe hopeless of happiness and wholly regardless of life  at rome i contracted a friendship with sir francis obryen by whose solicitations i was induced to come to ireland heaven directing my steps for here i learned she was again free  i concluded with earnestly entreating permission to throw myself at her feet  such in brief was the purport of an address every way calculated to sooth the vanity of her sex it agrees very well with the disorder the mention of her fatal name excited in me and of which i doubt not she has been informed  the real agitation of my mind and the mixture of truth contained in this fiction  gives i think an air of sincerity to the whole  you will ask me why i wrote  i cannot tell you i had no sort of purpose to answer by it i was actuated by an impulse i could not resist if she rejects du mornai it will not be for me he is rejected but for the cursed murderer of my peace and honor if she grants the permission i affect so much to desire  do not think i could be so meanly irresolute as to make myself known to her  i do not wish to upbraid her  alas i could not upbraid her  her presence would be more dreadful to me than mine could be to her  i acknowledge with shame i acknowledge i love her still yet do me the justice to believe that no consideration could induce me to renew my connexions with her no my friend lovely as she is i should    scorn the person where i doubt the heart and could i  which i never could  depend on the stability of that heart  yet the delicacy of my love is mortally wounded  i never could be happy  i am inexpressibly impatient for an answer to my illjudged and unnecessary letter although that answer of whatsoever nature it may be cannot in any degree alleviate or even alter my misery  pity me dear obryen pity and despise me not you have never felt the allsubduing power of love you know not to what various inconsistencies it prompts us  great then will be your candor if you can excuse the weakness of your unfortunate friend  i should entreat you not to come here if i did not know by experience how impossible it is to dissuade you from any thing that is goodnatured come my dear sir francis but expect not that i can join you in parties either of pleasure or improvement  i have no taste for pleasure and to what purpose should i seek to improve my mind there is none i wish to please the world is to me a desert  you must not insist on the performance of my promise when i gave it i could not foresee its consequences i cannot remain in a place where there is a probability  a bare possibility  of again seeing her i must for ever love and will for ever shun  in whatsoever place or circumstances i may drag on the remains of a hated existence  be assured i shall always conserve the liveliest remembrance of your generous friendship  du mornai  to the chevalier du mornai  cork obryencastle my heart is penetrated with your distress my dear chevalier you shall not go  i cannot support the thought of your rambling about the world a joyless friendless unconnected being perhaps wanting even the necessaries of life and can i be happy while you are miserable can i riot in abundance while you want no du mornai you know not my honest heart if you think i can  the world you say is to you a desert  you cannot therefore have a particular liking to any place then why not fix your residence in ireland the only obstacle will soon be removed she is but on a visit  and this preference is due to my affection though not to my merit  you shall never go we will live together we will have but one house one purse one heart if my vivacity is disagreeable to you  i can and will suppress it i will be serious melancholy  any thing to please and sooth you  it was not my intention to make you this proposal until time had rendered  as i flattered myself it would  my friendship and society dearer to you that you might of consequence be the less able to reject an offer i so passionately wish you to accept but your precipitance of necessity hurries me  if you deny me  i shall think you one of the proudest and most hardhearted of men if you comply  i swear to you my dear chevalier i shall consider your condescending to be indebted to me as the highest obligation that can possibly be conferred on me  for gods sake du mornai let me hear no more apologies for your feelings  i more than excuse  i admire    the graceful weakness of your heart in me behold not a cold unfeeling censor but a warm and sympathetic friend and yet my friend allow me gently to observe that love or honor must be conquered  the first i fear is unconquerable the last i dare not advise you to combat i do not presume to offer my counsel in a case so very delicate i shall never recommend to my friend  no nor to my enemy  a conduct which i think i ought not to pursue myself and on the other hand i shall never take upon me to censure any man for acting as i might perhaps myself do in his circumstances  i am sure it was hard for my business to prosper within the last fortnight for i have cursed by the hour every thing that has kept me from you the affair which you know principally detained me is yet unfinished but that and every thing shall give way to friendship nothing shall prevent my going to cork tomorrow  francis obryen  to the chevalier du mornai  cork chetwyndvilla i am pained monsieur to be obliged to convey to you my sisters sentiments to well have i known the agonizing pangs of hopeless love not to feel the deepest compassion for any man condemned to bear them i respect i love and i lament the noble constancy of your unfortunate passion would to heaven it was in my power in any degree to soften the wound my unwilling hand must give if the manner of a refusal can console  be consoled chevalier  mrs wentworth rejects but she insults you not she refuses you steadily but it is with gratitude it is with tears  she cannot love her heart was buried in the grave of her husband a husband who as her brother i would say deserved her not but as a man  bound to allow for the frailties incident to humanity  i can pardon his errors and grieve for his misfortunes  you merit mrs wentworths friendship  but let the confidence she allows me to repose in you evince that she withholds it not  the enclosed i may call a history of her misfortunes it was written by miss obryen for mrs chetwynd i need only add to it that by the prudence of my most amiable friend lord metheun  these melancholy transactions were kept from the public knowledge the world  ever prone to look on the dark side of things  would not have believed that a woman so perfectly innocent could be so very unfortunate i do not pretend to acquit her wholly of the charge of imprudence but very slight was the fault and such as a woman of a less unsuspecting heart with half her understanding might have avoided the fault i repeat was trivial and the punishment severe indeed  whilst the fair mourner weeps incessant for her henry  you chevalier i am persuaded will drop a generous tear to the misfortunes of both  i think so highly of your delicacy and imagine you must have so good an opinion of mrs wentworths that after you have read these papers i will not suppose it necessary to tell you that you must not expect time can make any change in your favor  i am monsieur with the greatest esteem your most obedient etc edward marchmont  to lord methuen  england chetwynd villa gracious heaven my dear friend what an amazing tale have i to unsold  should i tell you that harry wentworth lives  will you not believe that i rave or that i mock you yet i have received a letter from him within this half hour it is impossible to describe the emotion the perusal of it gave me with what aftonishment what tumultuous joy  joy checked by doubt  did i regard it my head grew dizzy and my behavior i believe was absolutely frantic by an impulse almost involuntary i flew to the dear partner of my soul  her soothing softness has in some degree composed my agitated spirits yet still my heart beats strangely and my blood seems to circulate in an unusual way  i was in my own chamber when the letter was brought to me and having heard miss obryen enter here is without reflecting on the boldness and impropriety of such an intrusion   the carriage waits  imagine with what impatience i go to embrace my longlost brother  i shall request my valeria to add a few lines and seal this  she knows that i have already told you every thing relative to this pretended frenchmans addresses to my sister    i esteem myself singularly fortunate to have at once an opportunity of testifying my sense of the favors i have received from lord methuen conveying pleasure to him and obliging sir edward marchmont  your lordship will lose by the change of your correspondent  but it would be unpardonable to tire you with tedious apologies instead of entering immediately on a subject so interesting to you where am i to take it up let me see  at my own room door i think  i had just sat down to write to miss marchmont when i heard a hasty tap at my door come in sir said i supposing it was my uncle and rising i walked toward the door  i was extremely surprised to see it opened by sir edward he clasped me in his arms without speaking a word he was in violent disorder and changed color every instant my god cried i what is the matter  you are ill  o sit here  i led him to a large elbowchair as i spoke he sat down and placed me beside him saying with great emotion o valeria my sister  he laid an open letter on my lap and burst into tears  i cannot express how much he frightened me  harriet had gone out a little before to take the air with lady enmore  an overturned carriage and broken limbs were the first ideas that rose in my mind  i grasped his hand in speechless terror  i have discomposed you my love said he how could i be so thoughtless but how at such a moment could i be otherwise  you shall not see this yet he would have taken away mr wentworths letter  i snatched it eagerly  what a sudden transition from affliction to joy  but my lord it will be a great deal more to the purpose to give you some account of the letter itself than to attempt to tell the effect it had either on myself or on sir edward  it is written in a style i cannot do justice to irregular elevated warm and pathetic after most passionately lamenting the pain his unworthy suspicions occasioned to his harriet  severely condemning himself for giving way to thoughts so injurious to her  earnestly begging his brothers forgiveness  and generously praising the candor of the writer of the little narrative sir edward so fortunately sent to him  he proceeds to applaud your lordships behavior in your unhappy duel he says you in the gentlest though most intrepid manner ineffectually demanded what cause of offense you had given and refused to fight until provoked by the most opprobrious language  when you fell bleeding and senseless to the ground he thought you dead yet still animated by a furious resentment he was going to stab you through the heart but every feeling of the man and the gentleman rising against so base an action he threw away the bloody sword with horror and precipitately quitted the place  he embarked on board a merchant ship bound to cadiz taking with him bills on that city to the amount of about two thousand pounds this sum he thought would be sufficient for a year or two and his melancholy imagination naturally enough suggested that he could not survive his misfortunes beyond that time  he was received with all the friendship he expected by don juan dalmagro to whom he disclosed the secret cause of his voluntary exile the jealous haughty vindictive temper of the spaniard highly approved his conduct and confirmed him in his resolution of estranging himself for ever from england  sir edwards enquiry embarrassed them very much neither were willing to acknowledge the truth both scorned a lie and don juans politeness rejected the idea of leaving the letter unanswered an accident at length determined them and induced them to adopt as wild a scheme as ever a romantic brain suggested truth they relunctantly obliged to give way to a supposed necessity  mr wentworths servant was thrown from his horse and died in a few days after of his bruises and a fever which was their consequence during his illness he expressed so strong a concern at the thought of being buried in a foreign country that his master humanely promised that if he died he would be at the expense of having him conveyed to england the sequel is easily imagined  mr wentworth to put a final stop to the enquiries of his friends thought fit to make the corpse pass for his own and dictated to don juan that letter which drew so many tears from the fairest eyes in england this strange deceit was not easily detected the body of a person dying in such circumstances would be expected to be altered and disfigured and this man though unlike him in bulk and complexion was about his age nearly of the same stature had some resemblance in his features and hair of the same color  some time after this from a restlessness of disposition he left cadiz and as he himself phrased it when he wrote in his assumed character to mrs wentworth  rambled over most part of europe hopeless of happiness and wholly regardless of life  passing one night through the streets of rome he saw a young gentleman leaning his back against a wall defending himself with great bravery against three men our generous unfortunate immediately drew his sword in aid of the person who fought so unequal a combat  the dastardly assassins were soon put to flight  mr obryen  for you will guess it was he  thanked his deliverer in the warmest terms  you owe me nothing returned mr wentworth gravely i am happy to have assisted to preserve your life and only wish i had been fortunate enough to have lost my own  ah signior i fear you are unhappy if by my fortune my friendship my life itself i can render you any service freely command me  my misfortunes are not of a nature to admit of remedy at present however i think of nothing but your safety allow me to attend you  such an incident as this naturally led to an intimacy between them obryen was of a temper too grateful and generous not to seek to return so great an obligation but the reserve of the man he wished to oblige put it out of his power to do more than endeavor to divert a melancholy of which he knew not the cause though mr wentworths mind was soured by misfortune he could not long be insensible to such attention  the most perfect friendship was quickly founded on the strong basis of mutual worth and mutual gratitude the fullest confidence soon succeeded they became inseparable companions visited several places in italy together and when sir john obryens death called home his son he found means to persuade his friend to accompany him though not without much difficulty and after repeatedly urging the improbability of his being known under the disguise of a frenchman in a kingdom where he had never been especially as his perfect knowledge of the french nation and language gave him no room to apprehend suspicion  you know all the rest my lord  i have only to tell you that mr wentworth and sir francis obryen left cork immediately on the receipt of sir edwards letter and late last night returned to obryen castle where sir edward is now gone  i presume he will return tonight as the distance is not more than eight miles  it is well mrs wentworth happened to be abroad this morning  our excessive joy might have betrayed more than it would be proper for her yet to know i dread the consequences of a full discovery  but we must be cautious and hope the best  i will bid you adieu and return to my letter to miss marchmont  now what a joyful letter  how peculiarly happy am i to be able to convey pleasure to three such persons as your lordship lady methuen and miss marchmont to give happiness is certainly to feel it in a very superior degree then am not i highly favored by fortune in having such an addition made to my own happiness  make my affectionate compliments acceptable to lady methuen  i have the honor to be your lordships obliged and attached friend valeria obryen  to the right honorable lady methuen  england chetwyndvilla o my dear lady methuen my heart is strangely agitated they tell me that my henry lives is it  can it be possible  there is here  i mean in this neighborhood  a gentleman who professes to entertain for me a passion i as little desire as deserve i always disliked second marriages i thought they betrayed a want of delicacy  but ever since i have been a widow i have abhorred them i have almost thought them criminal i blush that any man should love me i do not somehow think myself at liberty  i am sure at least my heart is not free  to receive addresses of this nature they even strike me with a kind of horror i pity du mornai and yet inconsistently hate him unjust and ungenerous that i am to hate a man only because i have done him an injury  i however allowed my brother to impart to him the circumstances that attended the loss of my husband o my friend i blot the last sentence with my tears no woman ever loved a husband more tenderly more ardently nor more delicately than i did and yet my unjust my cruel  but still dear evertobelamented henry could think me false alas  my bursting heart  he dying thought me so ye powers that i should live to have my virtue suspected and that too by the man whom next to heaven i esteemed and loved  i am writing in the most incoherent manner  i meant to have told you that my brother has been to visit monsieur du mornai the morning after he returned he told me  after many pauses hints and much circumlocution  that the chevalier was of opinion that mr wentworth is still alive and had only made use of an artifice  which might he said be easily managed  to induce us to believe him dead to my infinite surprise my brother himself and all my friends here agree in thinking this conjecture founded on probability they say a great deal in support of this opinion  they particularly urge the congruity of such a procedure in mr wentworth with his abrupt departure from england and earnest request to my father and brother never to make any enquiry after him  what louisa do you think of all this for my part i know not what to believe i am perplexed and anxious beyond measure i am a thousand times more miserable than ever  can sir edward do you imagine have heard any thing concerning mr wentworth which he fears to impart to me immediately i know his tender consideration for me  but from what quarter should he receive such intelligence it is however extremely unlikely that this chevalier du mornai should have so much more penetration than every body else  i distract myself with conjectures  my soul is on the rack    yes louisa edward certainly knows something which he chooses not to communicate i have told him that he does  he did not deny it but squeezing my hand said if i conceal any thing from my dear harriet i trust she is no stranger to the motive of that concealment i should have importuned him had not the entrance of lady alicia sedley put an end to our conversation i like not to talk on this subject before her or lady enmore though i find my brother has made them acquainted with all my affairs was it right my dear lady methuen to make them my confidants without my leave this behavior is not consonant to his usual delicacy  it must mean something  write to me immediately my friend tell me do you think it possible that my henry lives  why will not they tell me all they know there is no bearing this torturing suspense  lady enmore is obliged to go to dublin for a few days  the wedding is deferred till her return a compliment to which her generous friendship for miss obryen certainly entitles her yet i fancy sir edward paid it with reluctance  i am interrupted by mrs chetwynd i am not allowed to be a moment alone however mrs chetwynd can never be an intruder to me i love her from my soul and could with pleasure join edward and valeria when they call her mother as they both frequently do  farewell  most truly yours harriet wentworth  to lord methuen  england chetwyndvilla i am this moment honored with your lordships very polite letter some people cannot bear encouragement  see what an encroacher i am i no sooner learn that you tolerate one letter than i commence another however it is at sir edwards desire not that the saucy fellow has yet a right to command me but as my day of power will  alas  be very short it is politic to use it generously in order to set him a good example  now my lord prepare yourself to read one of the longest letters that ever was written  your friend has told you all the artifices we have been obliged to use with his sister during the last fortnight we were tortured to behold the disquietude occasioned by the suspense we excited yet none of us dared to speak out mr wentworth has if possible suffered more than her  his impatience to behold her could have been checked only by his fears  when i arose yesterday morning i sent as usual to enquire how mrs wentworth had passed the night her woman came to me and told me she feared her lady would absolutely destroy herself by giving way to so violent an anxiety that she had been up the greatest part of the night one time throwing herself on her bed or walking slowly about the room she silently wept then moving with a quicker pace she beat her breast and threw out many expressions denoting the severest anguish of mind  i went to her chamber immediately i met sir edward at the door i have been with poor harriet said he  indeed he had no need to tell me so i saw by his tearful eyes where he had been  what shall i do added he my heart bleeds for her  have you told her nothing more asked i than she knew before  i have not i was several times going to speak but had not the courage o valeria should i tell her all perhaps  he stopped  it was as a feeling writer says a perhaps not to be borne  in my opinion sir edward said i no hazard can be greater than that of suffering her to remain much longer in her present state of mind it is four days since you told her that du mornai saw mr wenworth in italy since the time she believed him dead consequently she has now accustomed herself to think him alive  it is time she should know more and more she shall know if you give me leave  i do  yet my dear creature consider  i will not be discouraged cried i abruptly quitting him  i found his sister as i expected in tears i sat down by her i must scold you harriet i am angry with you  what have i done  you have been careless of your health you have sat up almost all night  i could not sleep it is impossible for me to rest either by day or night  and why impossible are you not most unreasonable while you were entirely without hope you combated your afflictions you were calm though unhappy now when you know certainly that mr wentworth lives you abandon yourself to grief  i know he did live but oh cried she weeping afresh how do i know that he lives still in what part of the world am i to seek him  you will know all in time  has not your brother written to his friends in italy  yes yes he has written  i knew the time he would have gone but i am unreasonable pardon me  i cannot pardon you the tears i had with much difficulty restrained before fell from my eyes in spite of me i understand your hint very well added i but i swear to you my cruel friend were matters situated as you suppose i should be the first to persuade him to go if leaving me was an obstacle i would go with him  forgive me i knew not what i said  i did not intend to wrong either his friendship or yours but what did you say valeria if matters were as i suppose  what meant my friend  i am afraid to tell you you can bear nothing with equanimity but despair  for gods sake if you know any thing of my husband do not hide it from me o my friend  my sister throwing her arms round my neck  if you know any thing of my henry do not hide it from me  what would you that i should tell you  is he living where is he  mark me then harriet  he undoubtedly is living and in perfect health  she sunk down on her knees and silently raised her hands and eyes to heaven with a look of transport and gratitude unutterable i did not attempt to move her from a position that so well became her situation but hastily mixing some salvolatile with water i gave her a glass of it she drank it almost mechanically and thinking she would choose to be alone i left the room  knowing how uneasy sir edward would be till he saw me i flew to the breakfastparlour  he met me at the door with open arms and looks of anxious enquiry i recounted my proceedings and had the pleasure to receive his approbation  my aunt observing that she should not be left long alone i was returning to her apartment when i met her in the hall she affectionately embraced and thanked me but valeria you only half answered my question  where is he  i cannot tell you  good god she exclaimed with the most disappointed air you cannot tell  how then do you know if he is living  you misunderstand me i did not mean that i could not but  excuse me  that i would not as yet inform you let me see you easy and cheerful till after dinner and upon my honor i will then tell you in what princes dominions he is  were i treated thus said she by any person of whose goodnature i could entertain the least doubt i should unavoidably accuse them of playing with my misery  you would be most unjust if you thought so of me be assured my harriet if i did not fear to overpower you with joy i should with rapture gratify you  your motive is kind indeed returned she but the conduct resulting from it is most cruel  my uncle hearing us in the hall came out and took us both into the parlour  the dear sufferer made visible efforts to appear cheerful till the expiration of the stated time  as soon as the servants were withdrawn after dinner she turned to me as i sat by her  now valeria have i not been patient do i not deserve to be pitied  sir edward left his seat and leaned on the back of her chair  his intelligent countenance speaking what he felt for her  her expression filled my eyes with tears  indeed harriet said i you do  ask your question  where is he demanded she eagerly  he is in the dominions of the king of   dare i guess england  you are right  o merciful heaven cried she clasping her hands together is he then in england this is expected happiness indeed well might you fear to overpower me with joy o valeria falling on my bosom  are you sure my henry is in england  the sweet extravagant creature proposed setting out for dublin instantly that she might be ready to embrace the first opportunity of returning to england  sure said my uncle you would not go till you have seen the chevalier du mornai  twas entirely by his means you have recovered mr wentworth  your thanks are certainly due to him  well sir i will write them i would not see him on any account  pardon me madam he replied i believe you ought  she did not contend with him but addressed herself to my aunt favor me with your advice my dear mrs chetwynd i will follow it implicitly think you not there would be an indelicacy in my receiving a visit from him should i not be wanting in what i owe mr wentworth  i saw my aunt was perplexed for an answer and particularly as she could not but approve her refusing to see her imaginary lover  to disembarrass her i said that i thought mrs wentworth judged perfectly right with regard to monsieur but indeed harriet added i i cannot so readily approve of your going to england it is certainly mr wentworths business to come to you and he will do so the moment he obtains your permission for lord methuen has explained to him every thing he unhappily misunderstood  and is he then convinced   of my innocence she would have said but delicacy and tears joined to break the sentence  my excellent valeria whispered sir edward tenderly and he had the assurance to kiss my cheek but why do i tell you this i forget i am not writing to my aunt chetwynd  your brother resumed i will write to him immediately not a word my dear harriet for she was opening her lips to speak  you must not write a line to him  i must i must wherefore should i wear the appearance of a resentment i do not feel you speak from the feelings of a single woman  i would act from those of a wife  i do not want you said i to resent an error that brought its own punishment with it yet for reasons you will yourself approve when you come to consider the matter dispassionately  i entreat you leave it to sir edward to write  and i my dearest sister request that you will allow yourself to be directed in this affair by miss obryens counsel  i will tell my brother that you wished to write he put his arms round her  tears trembled in his fine eyes  i know my gentle sister our conduct has a strange and even a barbarous appearance to you but i beseech you to rely on our friendship  in a short time you will be convinced of the propriety of our measures  i thought it would not be amiss to endeavor to give the conversation a gayer turn  go to your place sir edward said i and take your wine as soon as the servants have dined i will call for the coach for be it known to you ladies and gentlemen we are all to drink tea with lady melmont this evening  with all my heart cried my uncle  i shall go and write my letter then said sir edward  very well said i you have nothing else to do for you are as well dressed as possible so are you sir mrs wentworth and mrs chetwynd you are quite elegant now do you three go and take a turn in the garden till the carriage is ready  lady alicia i dont like your cap it does not become you you must change it  how am i going to the glass  passablement bien but i must mend my hair a little  lady alicia you shall dress at lord uvedons  mr melmont for me if the fine miss stanley be there still  sir edward shall have his choice of her or lady anne melmont  were there ever such airs said my aunt smiling  upon my word madam cried lady alicia i think she takes a great deal too much upon her  i think so too said mr chetwynd but as it must be confessed her commands are very reasonable we had better submit allons mesdames presenting one hand to mrs wentworth and the other to my aunt we were ordered to walk in the garden they obeyed with a very good grace and we three ran up stairs to our several employments  on our way to firdale mrs wentworth pressed to know the occasion of her husbands return to england  how he came to an eclaircissement with lord methuen etc  as i could not refuse to satisfy a curiosity so very natural and reasonable i was obliged to acknowledge how far i had deceived her and fairly discovered to her the whole truth only concealing his being at obryencastle as i imagined it would too much discompose her to know he was so near her so as i had already been compelled to tell her so many lies i easily stretched my conscience a little further and said he was at cork  her boundless joy was expressed more by tears than words  she leaned upon my shoulder for near a quarter of an hour without speaking then suddenly raising her head she cried dear valeria may i depend on what you tell me now i could not forbear to smile at her wellgrounded doubts of my veracity and maliciously drew in my aunt and lady alicia to confirm my falsehood by appealing to them for the truth of what i said  how soon asked mrs wentworth her eyes flashing fire  how soon may i expect to see him  courage my fair friend replied mrs chetwynd he will certainly be with you tomorrow evening  a lively red overspread her lovely face but instantly gave way to a deathlike paleness  we let down the coach windows for air which with the application of lady alicias eau de luce prevented her fainting and happily she was quite recovered by the time we reached firdale  our gentlemen who rode arrived some time before us a very fortunate circumstance for almost the first persons they saw as they entered the drawing room were our quondam chevalier and sir francis obryen the former took an opportunity of whispering to his brother an earnest enquiry for his harriet sir francis guessing their subject joined them well sir edward said he when shall i see my friend happy  he answered very soon  soon let it be returned he unless you would choose to have him become a mere statue he is little different from one at present except the not being quite so passive the poor fellow is conscious he is but bad company for you cannot conceive any thing more difficult than to get him to stir from home  how my dear obryen cried mr wentworth will not you preserve some consistency in your censures you upbraid me now with total suspension of my faculties  yet how often do you talk to me of the unreasonable effervescence of my passions  why replied sir francis you are sometimes passionate to madness but more generally quite exanimate in short though it sounds a little harshly i am sure if your affairs continue much longer in the same train you must necessarily become either a madman or a fool  a terrible alternative said sir edward  lord uvedon seeing our carriage at a distance came up to mr wentworth saying i fancy sir you would do well to retire until mrs wentworth can be prepared to see you this counsel being strongly enforced by every person present he cast a wishful look toward the carriage and heaving a deep sigh suffered lord uvedon to conduct him to another room  some explanation is necessary here as your lordship will be surprised at the melmont familys appearing to be so well acquainted with the situation of our friends  as mr wentworths happy reconciliation with his lady obliged him to drop the name of du mornai and reassume his own to avoid an unpleasingly mysterious appearance it was requisite that some reasons should be given for the change to sir franciss acquaintance who first knew him in his french character all his english friends thinking him dead to them a still clearer explanation was necessary accordingly he has fabricated a tale that he designs should satisfy both  his delicacy for his harriet not allowing him to let the world know he had suspected her  your supposed coffeehouse dispute your consequent duel his subsequent flight to cadiz and believing you killed  all stands as it was  as nobody knew his address all the letters written to him miscarried so that he still remained in his error and being struck with a remorse so violent as in some degree to disorder his reason for having murdered upon a frivolous quarrel a man of worth and honor and his brothers friend he determined to exclude himself for ever from the society of his wife his friends  in short to resign every thing he held valuable knowing how averse his relations would be to this resolution he concealed himself from them until his dying servants wish to mix with his native dust suggested to him a method of freeing himself from their opposition  the lenient hand of time healing in a good measure both his head and heart he began to repent of the part he had acted and hearing by accident from sir francis obryen that lord methuen was still alive he suddenly resolved to return to his country  i dont know if your lordship will think this story probable but i believe you will agree with me in thinking that the truth of it will not be questioned every body of sense and experience knows that things frequently happen in real life which a judicious author would not introduce into a fictitious story it is a very just though trite observation that  probability is not always on the side of truth  when the two gentlemen left the room lady melmont said it would be proper for some of the ladies to drink tea with them which lady lucy domville and miss stanley did on our enquiring for them lady anne said that her sister was with miss stanley who was confined to her chamber by a cold lady melmont told my aunt in a low voice how matters really stood sir edward gave me the like information at the same time telling me that he thought it would be highly imprudent to venture to let her know he was in the house i thought so at first myself but when i considered the uneasy and unsettled state of mind in which she must remain while this important affair depended i could not help thinking it would be most advisable to put a speedy period to her anxieties knowing how difficult it would be to bring him over to my opinion i pretended to assent to his but secretly resolved to be guided by my own his love for his sister makes him act in direct opposition to the native fire of his character rendering him as timid as deliberate as nature made him bold and decisive  after tea lady anne saying she would go to miss stanley and send lady lucy to us i begged leave to attend her my aunt joined in the same request from a desire to see mr wentworth for whom she has a great friendship we found him leaning on a sofa in a posture of deep thoughtfulness he saluted mrs chetwynd very cordially and bowing low to me said with great gallantry such beauty can belong only to miss obryen  when we were seated he said directing himself to my aunt o madam will the dear treasure i threw away in my folly never be restored to me again  it shall be restored to you immediately replied i with some spirit  what do you mean my dear asked my aunt  i mean to elude sir edwards caution and this very evening to reunite this deserving pair  he arose and pressing one of my hands between both his said then madam i shall say that my harriet was first given me by hymen and the second time by an angel  i returned to the drawing room with lady lucy  we found lady melmont lady alicia my uncle and mr domville just sitting down to quadrille the rest of the company was going to make another table but sir francis protesting it was a sin to waste such a fine evening at cards lord melmont proposed a walk to which we all agreed  as we walked i secretly begged sir francis would draw off sir edward telling him my motive for the request he warmly approved my design and promised to take away all the gentlemen if he could  sir edward said he have you seen my lords canal improvements being answered in the negative he proposed going to view them your friend said he had no objection if it were agreeable to the ladies mrs wentworth would have complied but lady lucy and i had our own reasons for opposing it  let us go however said obryen  no no replied sir edward well take another opportunity  sir francis added he with a smile i should not have suspected you for such a proposition  lord melmont did not give up the point so easily being extremely fond as obryen well knew of having his improvements admired he seconded the motion so strenuously that sir edward could not civilly withhold his consent any longer  sir francis perceiving that mr melmont meant to attach himself to our party took hold of his arm saying come along melmont deuce take me if you or any man living shall quietly enjoy a blessing i choose to resign  serviteur mesdames we shall return in a moment kissing his hand to us with his usual air of graceful sprightliness  saucy fellows said lady lucy when they left us well take care they shall not come my friends shall we go in  i assented saying since we are forsaken by one set of beaux we must only have recourse to another  they are too busy with their cards to mind you said mrs wentworth  i answered that i did not mean the gentlemen of the card party  who then she demanded carelessly i presume lord uvedon is not at home  he is and i wish to heaven i dare bring you to the place he is in  what is your reason for such a wish asked she with some surprise  cannot you guess does sir franciss being here suggest nothing to you  o valeria is my henry here  he is  be composed  she trembled violently and there was a wildness in her looks which froze my blood my goodnatured friend alarmed at her disorder gently reproved my precipitance and supported her by holding one arm while i held the other i was exceedingly agitated myself and really stood in need of the assistance i endeavored to give her  o god support me said she in a voice hardly articulate  we placed her on a gardenchair neither of us was able to refrain from weeping  tears are softly infectious  she wept likewise which considerably relieved her starting up she cried come my dear valeria will you not conduct me to my henry  i will said i again taking hold of her arm and pressing her hand to my breast but my dearest harriet summon all your courage  should you suffer by my conduct edward will never forgive me promise me that you will not faint  she replied with an amiable simplicity indeed i will not if i can help it with trembling steps she hasted toward the house leaning on lady lucy and me  i took her into a small parlour adjoining that in which mr wentworth was begging lady lucy would direct him to us he came instantly accompanied by my aunt only he flew to her his arms involuntarily extended to embrace her but as if impelled by a sudden recollection of his injurious conduct he threw himself on his knees at her feet passionately kissing her hand and the tears falling fast down his face he cried o harriet forgive me she sunk from my arms almost lifeless into his faintly murmuring my henry  they remained several minutes in a close embrace without speech or motion  o my lord what must have been their feelings  at length he gently raising her said my dear my injured wife say that you forgive  say that you love me she was not able to reply  i thought i saw her just expiring and kneeling by her i exclaimed in the most frantic manner o harriet speak live  edward dear edward forgive me my beloved aunt inexpressibly terrified at my behavior raised me from the ground and weeping folded me to her fond heart  my child  my darling child said the tenderest of parents be not alarmed  she will recover presently  mr wentworth with a distracted air cried revive my only love let me not lose my dearer life in you  oh thou injured angel what a barbarian have i been to thee  had she continued much longer insensible i dont know what might have been the consequence  opening her lovely eyes she gazed on her husband with a tenderness not to be described  my soul my hearts treasure speak to me said he kissing her with eager transport  in the most melting accents she replied my dear henry  enraptured to hear again the sound of that soft voice i sprung from my aunt and again threw myself by her on the floor my lovely sister said the sweet creature  mr wentworth in the same affectionate tone kindly repeated and my lovely sister putting one arm round my waist he lifted us both saying to me with an air of politeness and sincerity miss obryen i have obligations to you that words cannot repay  my aunt observing that mrs wentworths spirits were weak and exhausted called for sir franciss chaise and stepped up to lady melmont requesting she would let them go unnoticed to which her ladyship consented on the obliging condition that the rest of the family should stay to sup with her  my aunt mrs wentworth and her happy henry were just departed when the gentlemen returned obryen danced up to me  what have you done since my fair cousin  sent them home together  are you serious his eyes sparkling with pleasure  serious upon my honor and you must sleep at chetwyndvilla for they have taken your carriage  you shall have your choice of the two vacant seats in our coach  do what you please with me said he  lord uvedon overhearing him said with a pretty affected sigh alas obryen how many of our sex are there with whom that lady does what she pleases  faith replied my gay relation she does what she pleases with both sexes as sir edward marchmont may know to his cost  sir edward bowing to me with his accustomed grace said miss obryens power over my sex no man can be more sensible of than myself but i confess i do not perceive how any influence she may have over the ladies can affect me  it affects you very nearly answered sir francis for she has disposed of your sister without your knowledge and mon petit chevalier is gone off with her  your dear friends susceptible heart was too much overjoyed to be restrained by the laws of cold propriety from discovering its emotions  the presence of so large a company did not prevent his expressing the acknowledgments he generously imagined due to me in terms but too flatteringly particular  what an unconscionable letter have i written was i not in the right to prepare you for a long one i assure you it has furnished me with constant employment for two days  or nights rather i have not the confidence to expect you can read it tout de suite but as sir edward tells me he has amply experienced your patience i am not without hopes that you will be able to get through it in some little time  lady methuen has my most ardent wishes for her safety  i hope her ladyship is not jealous of our correspondence  do you know that sir edward has the impertinence to declare that he is though i write merely in compliance with his own request the unreasonable creature he urges however that i comply with pleasure which certainly cannot be controverted mr wentworth who was present said that if there could be any excuse for causeless jealousy lord methuens engaging qualities would form one  one word for you my lord and two for himself but seriously he speaks of you in the justest that is to say in the highest terms and you may be assured that a sincere and lively esteem now holds the place of the enmity he formerly bore you he mentions your answer to his letter with great encomiums on your politeness candor and generosity  noble minds betrayed by some fatal mistake or inadvertency may undesigningly injure but they are ever sure to make all the amends in their power to the person they have wronged  i am my lord with every possible sentiment of esteem and friendship yours valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  chetwyndvilla dear madam obryen castle i am infinitely sorry it is not in my power to return to chetwyndvilla today  when i came home last night i found a letter from my mother wherein she complains very much of her health i cannot dispense with visiting her immediately and am just on the wing for dublin  the little box that accompanies this i did not get out of the jewellers hands till late last night though the things have been bespoken these two months i thought the rascal would never let me have them i shall be much indebted to you if you will take the trouble to order miss obryens woman to leave them on her ladys toillette  i know what my dear sagacious uncle will think of my journey to town but it is no such matter i assure you i own there have lately been overtures made to me from that quarter through lady obryen she approves them but i do not i hate these sober formal patchedup familymatches to think of my going expressly to pay my addresses to a woman i never saw  and whose temper and character  whose very face  i know only on report from the opinion of others ridiculous detestable no i will judge for myself choose for myself and if ever i marry a woman that does not wait till i ask her  may i be a cuckold in the honeymoon  i am astonished that gentlemen have not more pride  more delicacy  for their female relations had i a sister or a daughter she might die an old maid sooner than i would offer her to any man i could not endure to have a saucy coxcomb exult  even in thought  at having rejected her  one word a loreille  lady anne melmont  amiable elegant accomplished sensible and unaffected of a noble and worthy family with a respectable fortune  it will do aunt but  mum  tell my dear wentworth i have not time for a line at present but shall write to him from dublin  i hope i shall be able to prevail on my mother to return with me to obryencastle the country air agrees best with her besides she must come and pay her respects to lady marchmont  adieu my dear madam i kiss your hands  francis obryen  to sir francis obryen bart  dublin chetwynd villa i am extremely glad you found lady obryen so much better than you expected though i confess i am not a little angry with her for contriving to be indisposed so very mal a propos you have missed a wedding my friend  yesterday mr chetwynd joined the hands of the loveliest pair i ever beheld  we had no company but the ladies of the melmont family lady alicia sedley and lady anne melmont were bridemaids your admired lady anne looked more than usually pretty i regretted that you were not present what an opportunity to say soft things  i took care however that she should think of you  dear lady anne whispered i what would sir francis obryen give to be here now she was silent blushed looked down and opened and shut her fan with the sweetest confusion imaginable how easy to read the language of an ingenuous heart  twould be vain for me to attempt to mention the bride your own lively imagination will scarcely be able to do her justice  judge then if my pen can  triumphant beauty never looks so gay as on the morning of a nuptial day this observation is rather quaintly expressed but i think you would with me have subscribed to its justness had you seen your charming cousin yesterday morning her fine complexion heightened by pleasure and modesty again improving the rouge of joy  i wonder not at the ardour of my brothers passion for her i acknowledge that i never saw a woman who in person mind and manners would appear so completely and engagingly beautiful to an unprejudiced man but my fond eye discovers more attractions in another  my gentle harriet is to me a hundred times more lovely  sir edward calls himself the happiest of men but surely the cup of happiness must have a higher flavor to me who have drunk so deeply of its bitter reverse yet perhaps his assertion may be just for he feels not as i do the pang of having injured her he loves  i look back on my past conduct with amazement  how could i suspect her the most delicate  the most virtuous of women  pure as the winter stream when ice embossed whitens its course even to myself reserved though fond  never never can i make her sufficient amends for what she has suffered for me yet the dear too generous girl thinks herself recompensed for years of heartrending anguish only by the return of that affection and confidence i never had a right to withdraw  i propose to myself a very singular gratification on my return to england  it is to visit my own superb monument  you will chide me if i pursue this subject i remember when you were here you told me that  even my happiness was melancholy true it is  refined and exquisite joy almost touches sorrow  i had a letter from england by last post from a proud old fellow who is my relation  he supposes i shall immediately have my servants body removed from the vault of my ancestors  did you ever hear any thing so ridiculous  honest faithful fellow let thy ashes mix with theirs and welcome  all this happy family wish for you my dear obryen i am impatient to see you i long to have you better acquainted with my harriet i am sure you will admire her fear not my jealousy  o trust me i am cured of that  i have already prepared her to love you as you deserve  adieu my friend  the friend of my adversity i will not wound your delicacy by acknowledging how much i owe you  henry wentworth  to lord methuen  england chetwyndvilla kissing with glowing lips the whitest hand in the world  i had just sworn that my felicity could not admit of increase when your letter arrived to contradict me  my dear augustus you have considerably augmented my happiness both lady marchmont and i inexpressibly rejoice at your loved louisas safety  my valeria and mr wentworth request the honor of being sponsors however i need not have spoken for my brother he is writing to you himself  i presume your little girl will be named after the late mrs sidney  i shall take it as a particular favor if you will add my wifes pretty romantic name  your lordship may think it is with an air of no small importance i write  my wife  on the day i wrote to you last  o day the fairest sure that ever rose  i was so much out of my senses that i dont know what i may or may not have said but i think i could not have omitted telling you that we have prevailed on mr and mrs chetwynd to live with us i am delighted beyond measure at their compliance every day renders me more sensible of their inestimable worth and more attached to their society i doubt if their charming niece herself can love them better than i do  my little french sister is married  madame la marquise de st claire nothing less  the marquis has promised me a visit in england next spring i long extremely to see them both my valeria and lady enmore have very much prepossessed me in their favor  lady enmore purposes spending much of her time with us i like this lady very well  she is exceedingly fond of my valeria is generous welltempered and agreeable has a great deal of good sense and some knowledge of the world  yet still i cannot give her such a place in my affection as mrs chetwynd holds  her mind is not sufficiently above the common class the friend of my heart  and more particularly if that friend be a woman  must be exquisitely refined must breath the very soul of sentiment  i wish to heaven you could transport yourself to chetwyndvilla for five or six hours  i should not ask to keep you longer from lady methuen at present i am impatient to have you acquainted with my uncle and aunt chetwynd i know you will be charmed with them what pleasure too would it give your generous heart to behold my brother and sister wentworths happiness  besides i want to show you my angel lady marchmont  with pride i give her that name  is if possible more lovely than miss obryen was  beauty and worth in her alike contend to charm the fancy and to fix the mind in her my wife my mistress and my friend i taste the joys of sense and reason joined my boundless and unutterable love gains hourly strength nay each moment she is dearer than the last  methuen i shall for ever join with you in heart and voice to condemn the unfeeling libertine who stupidly calls matrimony the bane of happiness and love  sir francis obryen sent my valeria some very fine diamonds a few days before our marriage i hope he will soon give me an opportunity of acknowledging the favor by a similar present to his wife  he has been here these two days but returns to dublin tomorrow in order to escort his mother to obryencastle  he is a most engaging fellow  wentworth and he are exceedingly attached to each other if methuen was not my friend i should almost envy my brother  obryen has a vast deal of sensibility though apparently gay and inconsiderate when he looks round on this family his expressive eyes seem to speak the goodnatured language of a french writer quil est doux de voir des beureux  happy the man whose clear mind unsullied by selfishness or envy shines with the reflected light of others joys  i just cast my eye out of the window which commands a view of the garden  the divine lady marchmont tete a tete with sir francis  what a form what movements  the sportive zephyrs play through her auburn ringlets and artfully steal fragrance from her bosom while they pretend to add unnecessary freshness to her cheek  she leans on obryens arm  she smiles  ah the happy fellow i will supplant him in a moment  edward marchmont  finis
