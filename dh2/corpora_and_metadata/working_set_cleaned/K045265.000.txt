southern main blessed with indulgent skys and kindly rain a princess lived of origin divine of bloom celestial and imperial line in that sweet season when the mounting sun prepares with joy his radiant course to run led by the graces and the dancing hours and wakes to life the various race of flowers the lovely queen forsook her shining court for rural scenes and healthful sylvan sport it so befell that as in cheerful talk her nymphs and she purfud their evening walk on the green margin of the oozy deep they found a graceful youth dissolved in sleep his charms the queen surveyed with fond delight and hung enamored over the pleasing sight by her command the youth was strait conveyed and sleeping softly in her palace laid now ruddy morning purpled over the skies and beamy light unsealed the strangers eyes who cried aloud ye gods unfold this scene where am i what can all these wonders mean scarce had he spoke when with officious care attendant nymphs a fragrant bath prepare he rose he bathed and on his lovely head ambrosial sweets and precious oil they shed to deck his polished limbs a robe they brought in all the various dies of beauty wrought then led him to the queen who on a throne of burnished gold and beamy diamonds shone but o what wonder selzd her beauteous guest what love what ecstasy his soul possessed entranced he stood and on his faltring tongue imperfect words and half formed accents hung nor less the queen the blooming youth admired nor less delight and love her soul inspired o stranger said the queen if hither driven by adverse winds or sent a guest from heaven to me the wretched never sue in vain this fruitful isle with joy approves my reign then speak thy wishes and thy wants declare and no denial shall attend thy prayer she paused and blushed the youth his silence broke and kneeling thus the charming queen bespoke o goddess for a form so bright as thine speaks thee descended of celestial line low at your feet a prostrate king behold whose faithless subjects sold his life for gold i fly a cruel tyrants lawless hand and storms have drove my vessel on your strand but why do i complain of fortunes frowns or what are titles honors sceptres crowns to this sweet moment whilst in fond amaze on such transporting excellence i gaze such symetry of shape so fair a face such finished elegance such perfect grace hear then my only wish and o approve the ardent prayer which supplicates thy love from neptune know o prince my birth i claim replies the queen and lucidas my name this island these attendant nymphs he gave the fairhaird daughters of the azure wave but he whose fortune gains me for a bride must have his constancy severely tried one day each moon am i compelled to go to my great fathers watery realms below where coral groves celestial red display and blazing dimonds emulate the day in this short absence if your love endures my heart and empire are for ever yours and hoary neptune to reward your truth shall crown you with immortal bloom and youth but instant death will on your falsehood wait nor can my tenderness prevent your fate twice twenty times in wedlocks sacred band my royal father joined my plighted hand twice twenty noble youths alas are dead who in my absence stained the nuptial bed your virtues prince may claim a nobler throne but mine is yielded on these terms alone delightful terms replied the raptured youth accept my constancy my endless truth perfidious faithless men enraged he cried they merited the fate by which they died accept a heart incapable of change thy beauty shall forbid desire to range no other form shall to my eye seem fair no other voice attract my listening ear no charms but thine shall ever my soul approve so aid thy votry potent god of love now loud applauses through the palace ring the duteous subjects hail their godlike king to feastful mirth they dedicate the day whilst tuneful voices chant the nuptial lay lovedittiedairs hymnd by the vocal quire sweetly attemperd to the warbling wire but when the sun descending sought the main and lowbrowd night assumed her silent reign they to the marriage bed conveyed the bride and laid the raptured bridegroom by her side now rose the morn and with auspicious ray dispelled the dewy mists and gave the day when lucida with anxious cares oppressed thus waked her sleeping lord from downy rest soul of my soul and monarch of my heart this day she cried this fatal day we part yet if your love uninjurd you retain we soon shall meet in happiness again to part no more but rolling years employ in circling bliss and neverfading joy alas my boding soul is lost in woe and from my eyes the tears unbidden flow joy of my life dismiss those needless fears replied the king and stay those precious tears should lovely venus leave her native sky and at my feet imploring fondness lie even she the radiant queen of soft desires should disappointed burn with hopeless fires the heart of man the queens experience knew perjured and false yet wished to find him true she sighed retiring and in regal state the king conducts her to the palace gate where sacred neptunes crystal chariot stands the wondrous work of his celestial hands six harnessed swans the bright machine convey swift through the air or pathless watery way the birds with eaglespeed the air divide and plunge the goddess in the sounding tide slow to the court the pensive king returns and sighs in secret and in silence mourns so in the grove sad philomel complains in mournful accents and melodious strains her plaintive woes fill the resounding lawn from starryvesper to the rosy dawn the king to mitigate his tender pain seeks the apartment of the virgin train with sportive mirth sad absence to beguile and bid the melancholy moments smile but there deserted lonely rooms he found and solitary silence reigned around he called aloud when lo a hag appears bending beneath deformity and years who said my liege explain your sacred will with joy your sovereign purpose i fulfill my will detested wretch avoid my sight and hide that hideous shape in endless night what does thy queen oerrun with rude distrust resolve by force to keep a husband just you wrong replied the hag your royal wife whose care is love and love to guard your life the race of mortals are by nature frail and strong temptations with the best prevail be that my care he said be thine to send the virgin train let them my will attend the beldam fled the cheerful nymphs advance and tread to measured airs the mazy dance the raptured prince with greedy eye surveys the bloomy maids and covets still to gaze no more recals the image of his spouse how false is man nor recollects his vows with wild inconstancy for all he burns and every nymph subdues his soul by turns at length a maid superior to the rest arrayed in smiles in virgin beauty dressed received his passion and returned his love and softly wooed him to the silent grove enclosed in deepest shade of fullgrown wood within the grove a spacious grotto stood where forty youths in marble seemed to mourn each youth reclining on a funeral urn thither the nymph directs the monarchs way he treads her footsteps joyful to obey there fired with passion clasped her to his breast and thus the transport of his soul expressed delightful beauty decked with every charm high fancy paints or glowing love can form i sigh i gaze i tremble i adore such lovely looks never blessed my eyes before here under covert of the embowring shade for loves delights and tender transports made no busy eye our raptures to detect no envious tongue to censure or direct here yield to love and tenderly employ the silent season in extatick joy with arms enclaspd his treasure to retain he sighed and strove but strove and sighed in vain she rushed indignant from his fond embrace whilst rage with blushes paints her virgin face yet still he sues with suppliant hands and eyes whilst she to magic charms for vengeance flies a limpid fountain murmured through the cave she filled her palm with the translucent wave and sprinkling cried receive false man in time the just reward of thy detested crime thy changeful sex in perfidy delight despise perfection and fair virtue slight false fickle base tyrannick and unkind whose hearts nor vows can chain nor honor bind mad to possess by passion blindly led and then as mad to stain the nuptial bed whose roving souls no excellence no age no form no rank no beauty can engage slaves to the bad to the deserving worst sick of your twentieth love as of your first these statues which this hallowed grot adorn like thee were lovers and like thee forsworn whose faithless hearts no kindness could secure nor for a day preserve their passion pure whom neither love nor beauty could restrain nor fear of endless infamy and pain now feel the force of heavens avenging hand and here inanimate for ever stand she spoke  amazed the listening monarch stood and icy horror froze his ebbing blood thick shades of death upon his eyelids creep and closed them fast in everlasting sleep no sense of life no motion he retains but fixed a dreadful monument remains a statue now and if revived once more would prove no doubt as constant as before finis
