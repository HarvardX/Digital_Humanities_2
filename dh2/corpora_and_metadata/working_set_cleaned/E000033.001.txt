despite having been influential and highly regarded shortly after their deaths indeed benjamin franklins proclivity to attribute fordyces works to francis hutcheson  may be said to have foreshadowed fordyces historical fate of being dismissed as a lesser francis hutcheson despite his confusion franklin thought highly of fordyces works purchasing the second volume of fordyces anonymously authored dialogues concerning educationlondon      and      soon after it became available and identifying the dialogues as among the works most influential upon his own proposals relating to the education of  youth in pennsilvania october      franklin was by no means alone among americans in his admiration for fordyces thought dr samuel johnson president of kings college now columbia university was likewise impressed  nor was it only the earlier work of fordyce that received high praise fordyces the elements of moral philosophy circulated widely as a unit of robert dodsleys x the preceptor london       both in britain and in america soon after its separate publication fordyces the elements of moral philosophy london      was introduced into the curriculum of the american universities where it became a standard text at harvard university and one of the most widely used texts in american universities in the second half of the eighteenth century  the elements of moral philosophy was successful not only in america but in europe as well within three years of its publication it had been translated into french and german and only six years after his death fordyce was described in germany as a celebrated author  fordyces celebrity status however quickly achieved was likewise quickly lost david fordyce was born at broadford near aberdeen scotland in      the second son of george fordyce a frequent provost of aberdeen and elizabeth brown fordyce david fordyce was one of their twenty children among whom were the touted pulpiteer james famously attacked by mary wollstonecraft in a vindication of the rights of  women the highly esteemed physician william and the infamous rogue banker alexander elizabeth fordyce was a relative probably the niece of thomas blackwell the elder minister and principal of marischal college aberdeen blackwell left his church in paisley in   00 to pastor a congregation in aberdeen in      he was selected for the chair of divinity at marischal college following a purge of jacobite sympathizers on the faculty in      blackwell became principal of the college as well a position he held from      to      during which time david fordyce was himself a student at marischal david fordyce entered marischal college in      and received his xi master of arts degree in      after which he studied divinity with james chalmers who had succeeded blackwell in the chair of divinity fordyce was then licensed to preach however he was unable to secure a patron and thus received no call to serve a congregation a lifelong disappointment for him the next several years of his life are something of a mystery his father died in      and fordyce was then home for a time to comfort his mother  in the mid   0s david fordyce spent some time in glasgow where he heard francis hutcheson lecture and where he developed a friendship with william craig then a student at glasgow university and later a moderate minister of the wynd church glasgow back in aberdeen and writing to craig in august of      from his mothers home in eggie fordyce complained of intellectual loneliness i have none here with whom i can enter into the depths of philosophy or from whom by a friendly communication of sentiments i can receive or strike out new lights  but if stimulating conversation was not to be had in aberdeen he could at least engage craig in the philosophical dialogue he was missing thus fordyce suggested to craig that his mentor francis hutcheson had failed to attend sufficiently to the authority and dignity of conscience a far greater defect of hutchesons moral theory than of the theory of lord shaftesbury fordyce argued their philosophical conversations continued at least another four months with fordyce writing a lengthy missive to craig in december of      objecting that craig overplayed the role of benevolence and underplayed xii other principles in our nature which must be taken into our account of moral approbation for example trust gratitude and piety traits of character themselves worthy of respect independent of their relation to benevolence  by the late    0s fordyce had established connections with philip doddridge preacher and master of the dissenting academy at northampton england and john aiken doddridges young protégé aiken doddridges first student in his academy at kibworth had received his master of arts degree from kings college aberdeen in      and then moved to northampton to assist doddridge doddridge himself had been awarded the doctor of divinity degree from the aberdeen colleges in      so by the mid   0s there was a warm relationship between doddridge and the english dissenters and the aberdeen colleges fordyce was a welcome visitor to doddridges community it is unclear how much time fordyce spent with doddridge in northampton but fordyce did visit him and observe his teaching and the workings of the academy in northampton during a sojourn in england in the mid to late    0s philip doddridge was impressed with and supportive of fordyce in a letter describing him as an excellent scholar and professing that he had never met a young person who had made deeper and juster reflections of human nature  he made generous introductions of fordyce to his friends in london including the anglican cleric william warburton whose first volume of the divine legation of moses london      had recently been published and the nonconformist minister at st albans the reverend samuel clark warburton was initially quite taken with fordyce assuring doddridge young fordyce has great merit and will make a figure in the world  do honor to professor blackwell whom i have a great esteem for 0 however warburton never the easiest of men to get along with xiii was later to complain to doddridge that he had been abused by fordyce after which doddridge quickly intervened to allay the ill will that had arisen between the two   the young fordyce enjoyed his time in london listening to the debates in parliament and mixing with the coffeeshop society as a result of doddridges influence fordyce served from september of      to november of      as something of an interim minister at newport pagnell buckinghamshire after which he became the private tutor and chaplain for the family of john hopkins of bretons near romford essex fordyce lived with the hopkins family for about a year and a half the spring of      brought another change of circumstances for fordyce leaving his position with the hopkins family he traveled to france returning to scotland at the end of june for rambles in the south and north of his homeland by early fall of      he was in place as an assistant minister to george wishart at the tron kirk high street edinburgh and was pleased with his place fordyce assessed wishart brother of the principal of the university of edinburgh william wishart as one of the most eloquent preachers and worthiest men we have in this country   this position too lasted for little more than a season in june of      fordyce returned to aberdeen and in september of that year he took up his position as regent at marischal college at marischal college fordyce had the usual duties of a regent during the        school year his responsibilities were for the tertians or thirdyear students with lectures on natural philosophy fordyce saw this group of students through their final year        with lectures on moral philosophy his complete rotation with a class of students began in the        school year with the semis or secondyear students xiv when he lectured on civil and natural history this class he would see through their final three years of education at marischal fordyce did not find his teaching labors light or entirely to his liking in june of      he wrote to doddridge reaffirming his desire to serve as minister and commenting on his duties as regent i wish the business was confined as you seem to think it is to the teaching of moral philosophy since that province would sute my taste most but the professors of philosophy in our university have a larger sphere assigned them being obliged to go the round of all the sciences logics metaphysics pneumatics ethics strictly so called  the principles of the law of nature and nations with natural and experimental philosophy which last is to be my task next winter i had last winter besides my public class a private one to which i read lectures on morals politics  history upon that plan of which i showed you a small part when in england i believe i shall have a great deal of pleasure in inspiring the minds of the youth with just  manly principles of religion  virtue  doubt not but i shall reap advantage myself by the practice of teaching   fordyce remained at marischal as a regent until his death in september of      in    0 he had secured a leave of absence from the college in order to travel in france italy and other parts of europe in february of      he wrote playfully to his mother that he had been enjoying carnival and while in rome had seen the pretender as well as the pope although he had not yet had the opportunity to kiss the popes hand he closed his letter pray keep warm drink heartily  keep merry till i come home  we shall laugh till our sides crack   but that reunion was not to be in september of      fordyce set sail from amsterdam on his voyage home aboard the hopewell of leith when a storm overtook the ship david fordyce was one of the passengers lost at sea fordyces eight years as a regent at marischal were prosperous at xv least in literary terms the first volume of his dialogues concerning education anonymously authored was published in london in      a second volume also anonymous followed in      fordyce had begun work on the dialogues perhaps as early as      in october of that year he sent to doddridge an essay on human nature of which he said i believe you will find some of the passions considered in a light that is not quite so common  connexions in human nature seized that i have not seen traced elsewhere some difficulties attempted to be explained that have not before been as i know of at all considered an endeavour to distinguish some powers of the mind that have been confounded  to explain some beautiful allegories and maxims of antiquity particularly the grand rule of the heathen moralists that of living according to nature it was the work of some years therefore you may expect a difference in the style  compositions several repetitions a deal of rubbish an intolerable luxury of fancy  language   fordyce went on to suggest that he could probably reduce the essay by as much as onethird an assessment with which many readers of the dialogues would have no quarrel with the success of the first volume of his dialogues concerning education fordyce made ready his second volume about this same time the london poet and bookseller robert dodsley sensing a need for a text that would equip young men to ably and virtuously fulfill the duties of their respective stations of life began collecting material for a new textbook the preceptor perhaps due to the success in england of fordyces own dialogues dodsley contracted with fordyce to write the essay on moral philosophy for his textbook fordyce presented dodsley with the elements of moral philosophy which was published as section   of the preceptor the preceptor met with great success for dodsley had secured talented xvi authors for his project including dr samuel johnson   one of those impressed by dodsleys preceptor was william smellie editor and compiler of the first edition of the encyclopaedia britannica edinburgh      who used a generous selection of fordyces preceptor  work on moral philosophy as the article moral philosophy or morals for the encyclopedia fordyces essay remained a major entry in the encyclopedia well into the nineteenth century smellies judgment of the value of fordyces essay was anticipated shortly after its publication by a review of the elements in the monthly review of may      there william rose described the essay as the most entertaining and useful compendium of moral philosophy in our own or perhaps in any other language   fordyces the elements of moral philosophy was thus available in three forms in the third quarter of the eighteenth century—as section   of dodsleys preceptor as a treatise published posthumously by robert and john dodsley in      and as an article in the encyclopaedia britannica few essays of eighteenthcentury moral philosophy can be said to have circulated so widely several other works written by fordyce were published posthumously chief among them his theodorus a dialogue concerning the art of preaching london      and the temple of virtue london      both edited by his brother james xvii note on the texts this edition of the elements of moral philosophy is based on the      edition of robert and john dodsley the first publication of the elements as an independent work few alterations have been made to the text and those only to correct printers errors in addition notes have been added to clarify fordyces references fordyce followed the not uncommon eighteenthcentury practice of providing emphasis by placing material in quotation marks we have not altered that practice we also include a brief account of the nature progress and origin of philosophy delivered by the late mr david fordyce p p marish col abdn to his scholars before they begun their philosophical course anno       with a few advices of the late mr

likely the prolegomenon to the lectures on moral philosophy that fordyce delivered to his magistrands or senior students during the        school year minor changes have been made in the text in order to facilitate comprehensibility most frequently these changes consist of the removal of commas or the addition of some other punctuation more significant interventions in the text are indicated by angle brackets ie 〈 〉 notes of correction and amplification have been added to both texts as well identifying the sources upon which fordyce drew and the figures he esteemed most highly fordyces own

incurred over my years of working on david fordyce only a few of those debts can here be acknowledged the eighteenthcentury scottish studies society and richard b sher have provided genial and encouraging venues for my explorations norman fiering who initially sparked my interest in fordyce assisted me on this project with some difficult references as did edward v george gilbert meilaender puzzled with me over fordyces handwriting as well as some greek and latin phrases above all i am grateful for the interest that m a stewart has shown in my work on fordyce and the errors from which he has rescued me and to the general editor of this series knud haakonssen whose vast knowledge is equaled by his attentiveness and generosity finally appreciation is extended to colin a mclaren former

extensive views which they have taken of the various subjects of human enquiry partition of knowledge a great philosopher has laid it out into three general provinces history poetry and philosophy which he refers to three several powers of the mind memory imagination and reason memory stores up facts or ideas which are the materials of knowledge imagination ranges and combines them into different assemblages or pictures reason observes their differences connections and mutual relations and argues concerning them philosophy in general the last is the proper business of philosophy which has been defined the knowledge of whatever exists  or the science of things human and divine  according to this definition its object comprehends the universe or whole of things it traces whatever can be known by man concerning the deity and his works their natures powers operations and connections   division of philosophy therefore to give our definition more precision philosophy may be defined the knowledge of the universe or of nature and of its powers operations and connections with just reasonings deduced from thence natural  natural philosophy investigates the properties and operations of body or matter moral  moral philosophy contemplates human nature its moral powers and connections and from these deduces the laws of action and is defined more strictly the science of manners or duty which it traces from mans nature and condition and shews to terminate in his happiness therefore it is called ethics disciplina morum in fewer words it is the knowledge of our duty and felicity or the art of being virtuous and happy how an art it is denominated an art as it contains a system of rules for becoming virtuous and happy whoever practises these rules by so doing attains an habitual power and facility of becoming virtuous and happy it is likewise called a science how a science  as it deduces those rules from the principles and connections of our nature and proves that the observance of them is productive of our happiness its object it is an art and a science of the highest dignity importance and use its object is mans duty or his conduct in the several moral capacities and connections which he sustains its office  its office is to direct that conduct to shew whence our obligations arise and where they terminate its use or end its end  is the attainment of happiness and the means it employs are rules for the right conduct of our moral powers its means the standard of other arts and sciences as every art and science is more or less valuable as it contributes more or less to our happiness this moral art or science which unfolds our duty and happiness must be a proper canon or standard by which the dignity and importance of every other art or science are to be ascertaind it is therefore preeminent above all others it is that masterart that masterscience which weighs their respective merits adjusts their rank in the scale of science prescribes their measures and superintends their efficacy and application in human life therefore moral philosophy has been honoured with the glorious epithets of the   directress of life the mistress of manners the inventress of laws and culture the guide to virtue and happiness without some degree of which man were a savage and his life a scene of barbarity and wretchedness having thus settled the subject and end of the science the elements of which we are attempting to discover and sufficiently distinguished it from all others it seems proper next to fix the method of prosecuting it the method  moral philosophy has this in common with natural philosophy that it appeals to nature or fact depends on observation and builds its reasonings on plain uncontroverted experiments or upon the fullest induction of particulars of which the subject will admit we must observe in both these sciences quid faciat  ferat natura how nature is affected and what her conduct is in such and such circumstances or in other words we must collect the phaenomena or appearances of nature in any given instance trace these to some general principles or laws of operation and then apply these principles or laws to the explaining of other phaenomena therefore moral philosophy enquires not how man might have been but how he is constituted not into what principles or dispositions his actions may be artfully resolved but from what principles and dispositions they actually flow not what he may by education habit or foreign influence come to be or do but what by his nature or original constituent principles he is formed to be and do we discover the office use or destination of any work whether natural or artificial by observing its structure the parts of which it consists their connection or joint action it is thus we understand the office and use of a watch a plant an eye or hand it is the same with a living creature of the rational or brute kind therefore to determine the office duty or destination of man or in other words what his business is or what conduct he is obliged to pursue we must inspect his constitution take every part to pieces examine their mutual relations one to the other and the common effort or tendency of the whole   section i of man and his connections in giving a rude sketch or history in miniature of man we must remember that he rises from small beginnings unfolds his faculties and dispositions by degrees as the purposes of life require their appearance advances slowly thro different stages to maturity and when he has reached it gradually declines till he sinks into the grave let us accompany him in his progress through these successive stages and mark the principles which actuate and the fortunes which attend him in each that we may have a full view of him in each mans infant state man is born a weak helpless delicate creature unprovided with food cloathing and whatever else is necessary for subsistence or defence and yet exposed as the infant is to numberless wants and dangers he is utterly incapable of supplying the former or securing himself against the latter but though thus feeble and exposed he finds immediate and sure resources in the affection and care of his parents who refuse no labours and forego no dangers to nurse and rear up the tender babe by these powerful instincts as by some mighty chain does nature link the parent to the child and form the strongest moral connection on his part before the child has the least apprehension of it hunger and thirst with all the sensations that accompany or are connected with them explain themselves by a language strongly expressive and irresistibly moving as the several senses bring in notices and informations of surrounding objects we may perceive in the young spectator early signs of a growing wonder and admiration bright objects and striking sounds are beheld and heard with a sort of commotion and   surprize but without resting on any he eagerly passes on from object to object still pleased with whatever is most new thus the love of novelty is formed and the passion of wonder kept awake by degrees he becomes acquainted with the most familiar objects his parents his brethren and those of the family who are most conversant with him he contracts a fondness for them is uneasy when they are gone and charmed to see them again those feelings become the foundation of a moral attachment on his side and by this reciprocal sympathy he forms the domestic alliance with his parents brethren and other members of the family hence he becomes interested in their concerns and feels joy or grief hope or fear on their account as well as his own as his affections now point beyond himself to others he is denominated a good or ill creature as he stands well or ill affected to them these then are the first links of the moral chain the early rudiments or outlines of his character his first rude essays towards agency freedom manhood his childhood when he begins to make excursions from the nursery and extend his acquaintance abroad he forms a little circle of companions engages with them in play or in quest of adventures and leads or is led by them as his genius is more or less aspiring though this is properly the season in which appetite and passion have the ascendant yet his imagination and intellectual powers open apace and as the various images of things pass before the mental eye he forms a variety of tastes relishes some things and dislikes others as his parents companions and a thousand other circumstances lead him to combine agreeable or disagreeable sets of ideas or represent to him objects in alluring or odious lights as his views are enlarged his active and social powers expand themselves in proportion the love of action of imitation and of praise emulation docility a passion for command and fondness of change his passions are quick variable and pliant to every impression his attachments and disgusts quickly succeed each other he compares things distinguishes actions judges of characters and loves or hates them as they appear well or ill affected to himself or to those he holds dear   mean while he soon grows sensible of the consequences of his own actions as they attract applause or bring contempt he triumphs in the former and is ashamed of the latter wants to hide them and blushes when they are discovered by means of these powers he becomes a fit subject of culture the moral tie is drawn closer he feels that he is accountable for his conduct to others as well as to himself and thus is gradually ripening for society and action his youth as man advances from childhood to youth his passions as well as perceptions take a more extensive range new senses of pleasure invite him to new pursuits he grows sensible to the attractions of beauty feels a peculiar sympathy with the sex and forms a more tender kind of attachment than he has yet experienced this becomes the cement of a new moral relation and gives a softer turn to his passions and behaviour in this turbulent period he enters more deeply into a relish of friendship company exercises and diversions the love of truth of imitation and of design grows upon him and as his connections spread among his neighbours fellowcitizens and countrymen his thirst of praise emulation and social affections grow more intense and active mean while it is impossible for him to have lived thus long without having become sensible of those more august signatures of order wisdom and goodness which are stamped on the visible creation and of those strong suggestions within himself of a parentmind the source of all intelligence and beauty and object as well as source of that activity and those aspirations which sometimes rouze his inmost frame and carry him out of himself to an allmighty and allgoverning power hence arise those sentiments of reverence and those affections of gratitude resignation and love which link the soul with the author of nature and form that most sublime and godlike of all connections his manhood man having now reached his prime either new passions succeed or the old set are wound up to an higher pitch for growing more sensible of his connection with the public and that particular community to which he more immediately belongs and taking withal a larger prospect of human life and its various wants and enjoyments he forms  0 more intimate friendships grasps at power courts honour lays down cooler plans of interest and becomes more attentive to the concerns of society he enters into familyconnections and indulges those charities which arise from thence the reigning passions of this period powerfully prompt him to provide for the decays of life and in it compassion and gratitude exert their influence in urging the man now in full vigour to requite the affection and care of his parents by supplying their wants and alleviating their infirmities old age at length human life verges downwards and old age creeps on apace with its anxiety love of ease interestedness fearfulness foresight and love of offspring the experience of the aged is formed to direct and their coolness to temper the heat of youth the former teaches them to look back on past follies and the latter to look forward into the consequences of things and provide against the worst thus every age has its peculiar genius and set of passions corresponding to that period and most conducive to the prosperity of the rest and thus are the wants of one period supplied by the capacities of another and the weaknesses of one age tally to the passions of another passions of every age besides these there are other passions and affections of a less ambulatory nature not peculiar to one period but belonging to every age and acting more or less in every breast throughout life such are selflove benevolence love of life honour shame hope fear desire aversion joy sorrow anger and the like the two first are affections of a cooler strain one pointing to the good of the individual the other to that of the species joy and sorrow hope and fear seem to be only modifications or exertions of the same original affections of love and hatred desire and aversion arising from the different circumstances or position    of the object desired or abhorred as it is present or absent from these likewise arise other secondary or occasional passions which depend as to their existence and several degrees upon the original affections being gratified or disappointed as anger complacence confidence jealousy love hatred dejection exultation contentment disgust which do not form leading passions but rather hold of them their joint effects by these simple but powerful springs whether periodical or fixed the life of man weak and indigent as he is is preserved and secured and the creature is prompted to a constant round of action even to supply his own numerous and everreturning wants and to guard against the various dangers and evils to which he is obnoxious by these links men are connected with each other formed into families drawn into particular communities and all united as by a common league into one system or body whose members feel and sympathize one with another by this admirable adjustment of the constitution of man to his state and the gradual evolution of his powers order is maintained society upheld and human life filled with that variety of passion and action which at once enliven and diversify it the directing power this is a short sketch of the principal movements of the human mind yet these movements are not the whole of man they impel to action but do not direct it they need a regulator to guide their motions to measure and apply their forces and accordingly they have one that naturally superintends and directs their action we are conscious of a principle within us which examines compares and weighs things notes the differences observes the forces and foresees the consequences of affections and actions by this power we look back on past times and forward into futurity gather experiences estimate the real and comparative value of objects lay out schemes contrive means to execute them and settle the whole order and oeconomy of life this power we commonly distinguish by the name of reason or reflection the business of which is not to suggest any original notices or sensations but to canvass range and make deductions from them    the judging or approving powers we are intimately conscious of another principle within us which approves of certain sentiments passions and actions and disapproves of their contraries in consequence of the decisions of this inward judge we denominate some actions and principles of conduct right honest good and others wrong dishonest ill the former excite our esteem moral complacence and affection immediately and originally of themselves without regard to their consequences and whether they affect our interest or not the latter do as naturally and necessarily call forth our contempt scorn and aversion that power by which we perceive this difference in affections and actions and feel a consequent relish or dislike is commonly called conscience or the moral sense whether such a power belongs to human nature or not must be referred to every ones experience of what passes within himself these powers different from affections these two powers of reason and conscience are evidently principles different in nature and kind from the passions and affections for the passions are mere force or power blind impulses acting violently and without choice and ultimately tending each to their respective objects without regard to the interest of others or of the whole system whereas the directing and judging powers distinguish and ascertain the different forces mutual proportions and relations which the passions bear to each other and to the whole recognize their several degrees of merit and judge of the whole temper and conduct as they respect either the individual or the species and are capable of directing or restraining the blind impulses of passion in a due consistency one with the other and a regular subordination to the whole system—let this difference be remembered division of the passions this is some account of the constituent principles of our nature which according to their different mixtures degrees and proportions mould our character and sway our conduct in life in reviewing that large train of affections which fill up the different stages of human life we perceive this obvious distinction among them that some of them respect the good of the individual and others carry us beyond ourselves to the good of the species or kind the former have therefore    been called private and the latter public affections of the first sort are love of life of pleasure of power and the like of the last are compassion gratitude friendship natural affection and the like of the private passions some respect merely the security and defence of the creature such as resentment and fear whereas others aim at some positive advantage or good as wealth ease fame defensive passions  the former sort therefore because of this difference of objects may be termed defensive passions these answer to our dangers and prompt us to avoid them if we can or boldly to encounter them when we cannot private or appetitive passions the other classes of private passions which pursue private positive good may be called appetitive however we shall still retain the name of private in contradistinction to the defensive passions man has a great variety of wants to supply and is capable of many enjoyments according to the several periods of his life and the different situations in which he is placed to these therefore a suitable train of private passions correspond which engage him in the pursuit of whatever is necessary for his subsistence or welfare public passions our public or social affections are adapted to the several social connections and relations which we bear to others by making us sensible of their dangers and interesting us in their wants and so prompting us to secure them against one and supply the other the appeal whether this historic draught of man and of that groupe of figures and connections with which he is environed be just or not is a matter not so much of reasoning as common sense and common experience therefore let every one consult his experience of what he feels within and his knowledge of what is transacted abroad in the little or the great world in which he lives and by that experience and that knowledge let the picture be acknowledged just or pronounced the contrary    for to that experience and to that knowledge and to these alone the designer appeals this is the first step then to discover the duty and destination of man the having analyzed the principles of which he is composed it is necessary in the next place to consider in what order proportion and measure of those inward principles virtue or a sound moral temper and right conduct consists that we may discover whence moral obligation arises    section ii of duty or moral obligation the measure of powers it is by the end or design of any power or movement that we must direct its motions and estimate the degree of force necessary to its just action if it want the force requisite for the obtaining its end we call it defective if it has too much so as to be carried beyond it we say it is overcharged and in either case it is imperfect and illcontrived if it has just enough to reach the scope we esteem it right and as it should be let us apply this reasoning to the passions measure of the defensive passions the defence and security of the individual being the aim of the defensive passions that security and defence must be the measure of their strength or indulgence if they are so weak as to prove insufficient for that end or if they carry us beyond it ie raise unnecessary commotions or continue longer than is needful they are unfit to answer their original design and therefore are in an unsound and unnatural state the exercise of fear or of resentment has nothing desirable in it nor can we give way to either without painful sensations without a certain degree of them we are naked and exposed with too high a proportion of them we are miserable and often injurious to others thus cowardice or timidity which is the excess of fear instead of saving us in danger gives it too formidable an appearance makes us incapable of attending to the best means of preservation and disarms us of courage our natural armour foolhardiness which is a want of a due measure of fear leads us heedlesly into danger and lulls us into a pernicious security revenge ie excessive resentment by the violence of its commotion    robs us of that presence of mind which is often the best guard against injury and inclines us to pursue the aggressor with more severity than selfdefence requires pusillanimity or the want of a just indignation against wrong leaves us quite unguarded and sinks the mind into a passive enervating tameness therefore to keep the defensive passions duly proportiond to our dangers is their natural pitch and tenour measure of the private passions the private passions lead us to pursue some positive species of private good that good therefore which is the object and end of each must be the measure of their respective force and direct their operation if they are too weak or sluggish to engage us in the pursuit of their several objects they are evidently deficient but if they defeat their end by their impetuosity then are they strained beyond the just tone of nature thus vanity or an excessive passion for applause betrays into such meannesses and such little arts of popularity as makes us forfeit the honour we so anxiously court on the other hand a total indifference about the esteem of mankind removes a strong guard and spur to virtue and lays the mind open to the most abandoned prosecutions therefore to keep our private passions and desires proportioned to our wants is the just measure and pitch of this class of affections comparative force the defensive and private passions do all agree in general in their tendency or conduciveness to the interest or good of the individual therefore when there is a collision of interest as may sometimes happen that aggregate of good or happiness which is composed of the particular goods to which they respectively tend must be the common standard by which their comparative degrees of strength are to be measured that is to say if any of them in the degree in which they prevail are incompatible with the greatest aggregate of good or most extensive interest of the individual then are they unequal and disproportionate for in judging of a particular system or constitution of powers we call that the supreme or principal end in which the aims of the several parts or powers coincide and to which they are subordinate and reckon them in due proportion to each other and right with regard to    the whole when they maintain that subordination or subserviency therefore to proportion our defensive and private passions in such measure to our dangers and wants as best to secure the individual and obtain the greatest aggregate of private good or happiness is their just balance or comparative standard in case of competition measure of the public affections in like manner as the public or social affections point at the good of others that good must be the measure of their force when a particular social affection as gratitude or friendship which belongs to a particular social connection viz that of a benefactor or of a friend is too feeble to make us act the grateful or friendly part that affection being insufficient to answer its end is defective and unsound if on the other hand a particular passion of this class counteract or defeat the interest it is designed to promote by its violence or disproportion then is that passion excessive and irregular thus natural affection if it degenerates into a passionate fondness not only hinders the parents from judging coolly of the interest of their offspring but often leads them into a most partial and pernicious indulgence collision of social affections as every kind affection points at the good of its particular object it is possible there may be a collision of interests or goods thus the regard due to a friend may interfere with that which we owe to a community in such a competition of interests it is evident that the greatest is to be chosen and that is the greatest interest which contains the greatest sum or aggregate of public good greatest in quantity as well as duration this then is the common standard by which the respective forces and subordinations of the social affections must be adjusted therefore we conclude that this class of affections are sound and regular when they prompt us to pursue the interest of individuals in an entire consistency with the public good or in other words when they are duly proportioned to the dangers and wants of others and to the various relations in which we stand to individuals or to society thus we have found by an induction of particulars the natural pitch or tenour of the different orders of affection considered apart by themselves now as the virtue or perfection of every creature lies in following    its nature or acting suitably to the just proportion and harmony of its several powers therefore the virtue of a creature endowd with such affections as man must consist in observing or acting agreeably to their natural pitch and tenour let this suffice at least for its first rude sketch balance of affection but as there are no independent affections in the fabric of the mind no passion that stands by itself without some relation to the rest we cannot pronounce of any one considered apart that it is either too strong or too weak its strength and just proportion must be measured not only by its subserviency to its own immediate end but by the respect it bears to the whole system of affection therefore we say a passion is too strong not only when it defeats its own end but when it impairs the force of other passions which are equally necessary to form a temper of mind suited to a certain oeconomy or state and too weak not merely on account of its insufficiency to answer its end but because it cannot sustain its part or office in the balance of the whole system thus the love of life may be too strong when it takes from the regard due to ones country and will not allow one bravely to encounter dangers or even death on its account again the love of fame may be too weak when it throws down the fences which render virtue more secure or weakens the incentives which make it more active and publicspirited limits of private affections if it be asked how far may the affections towards private good or happiness be indulged one limit was before fixed for the particular indulgences of each viz their subordination to the common aggregate of good to the private system in these therefore a due regard is always supposed to be had to health reputation fortune the freedom of action the unimpaird exercise of reason the calm enjoyment of ones self which are all private goods another limit now results from the balance of affection just named viz the security and happiness of others or to express it more generally a private affection may be safely indulged when by that indulgence we do not violate the obligations which result from our higher relations or public connections a just    respect therefore being had to these boundaries which nature has fixed in the breast of every man what should limit our pursuits of private happiness is nature sullen and penurious or does the god of nature envy the happiness of his offspring collision of interests whether there is ever a real collision of interests between the public and private system of affections or the ends which each class has in view will be afterwards considered but where there is no collision there is little or no danger of carrying either but especially the public affections to excess provided both kinds are kept subordinate to a discreet and cool selflove and to a calm and universal benevolence which principles stand as guards at the head of each system result this then is the conduct of the passions considered as particular and separate forces carrying us out to their respective ends and this is their balance or oeconomy considered as compound powers or powers mutually related acting in conjunction towards a common end and consequently as forming a system or whole subordination of powers now whatever adjusts or maintains this balance whatever in the human constitution is formed for directing the passions so as to keep them from defeating their own end or interfering with each other must be a principle of a superior nature to them and ought to direct their measures and govern their proportions but it was found that reason or reflection is such a principle which points out the tendency of our passions weighs their influence upon private and public happiness and shews the best means of attaining either it having been likewise found that there is another directing or controuling principle which we call conscience or the moral sense which by a native kind of authority judges of affections and actions pronouncing some just and good and others unjust and ill it follows that the passions which are mere impulses or blind forces are principles inferior and subordinate to this judging faculty therefore if we would follow the order of nature ie observe the mutual respects and the subordination which the different parts of the human constitution bear to  0 one another the passions ought to be subjected to the direction and authority of the leading or controuling principles in what it consists we conclude therefore from this induction that the constitution or just oeconomy of human nature consists in a regular subordination of the passions and affections to the authority of conscience and the direction of reason oeconomy of nature or right temper that subordination is regular when the proportion formerly mentioned is maintained that is to say when the defensive passions are kept proportioned to our dangers when the private passions are proportioned to our wants and when the public affections are adapted to our public connections and proportioned to the wants and dangers of others this last branch is expressed somewhat differently from the two former in order to include that most important relation in which we stand and those indispensible laws of duty which we owe to the great author of our nature who being supremely perfect and happy has no wants to supply and is obnoxious to no possibility of change human virtue and perfection but the natural state or the sound and vigorous constitution of any creature or the just oeconomy of its powers we call its health and perfection and the acting agreeably to these its virtue or goodness therefore the health and perfection of man must lie in the aforesaid supremacy of conscience and reason and in the subordination of the passions to their authority and direction and his virtue or goodness must consist in acting agreeably to that order or oeconomy how conformable to reason that such an oeconomy of the mind and such a conduct of its powers and passions will stand the test of reason cannot admit of any dispute for upon a fair examination into the consequences of things or the relations and aptitudes of means to ends reason evidently demonstrates and experience confirms it that to have our defensive passions duly proportioned to our dangers is the surest way to avoid or get    clear of them and obtain the security we seek after—to proportion our private passions to our wants is the best means to supply them—and to adapt our public affections to our social relations and the good of others is the most effectual method of fulfilling one and procuring the other in this sense therefore virtue may be said to be a conduct conformable to reason as reason discovers an apparent aptitude in such an order and oeconomy of powers and passions to answer the end for which they are naturally formed connection between affections and ends not the idea of moral obligation if the idea of moral obligation is to be deduced merely from this aptitude or connection between certain passions or a certain order and balance of passions and certain ends obtained or to be obtained by them then is reason or reflection which perceives that aptitude or connection the proper judge of moral obligation and on this supposition it may be defined as hath been done by some the connection between the action and the motive for the end is the motive or the final cause and the affection is the action or its immediate natural cause a man from mere selflove may be induced to fulfil that obligation which is founded on the connection between the defensive passions and their ends or the private passions and their ends because in that case his own interest will prompt him to indulge them in the due proportion required but if he has no affections which point beyond himself no principle but selflove or some subtle modification of it what shall interest him in the happiness of others where there is no connection between it and his own or what sense can he have of moral obligation to promote it upon this scheme therefore without public or social affection there could be no motive and consequently no moral obligation to a beneficent disinterested conduct but if the mere connection between certain passions or a certain order of passions and certain ends are what constitutes or gives us the idea of moral obligation then why may not the appositeness of any temper or conduct nay of any piece of machinery to obtain its end form an equally strict moral obligation for the connection and aptitude are as strong and invariable in the latter instances as in the former but as this is confounding the most obvious differences of    things we must trace the idea of moral obligation to another and a more natural source idea of it from experience let us appeal therefore to our inmost sense and experience how we stand affected to those different sets of passions in the just measure and balance of which we found a right temper to consist for this is entirely a matter of experience in which we must examine as in any other natural enquiry what are the genuine feelings and operations of nature and what affections or symptoms of them appear in the given instance why the defensive passions approvd the defensive passions as anger and fear give us rather pain than pleasure yet we cannot help feeling them when provoked by injury or exposed to harm we account the creature imperfect that wants them because they are necessary to his defence nay we should in some measure condemn ourselves did we want the necessary degree of resentment and caution but if our resentment exceeds the wrong received or our caution the evil dreaded we then blame ourselves for having overacted our part therefore while we are in danger to be totally destitute of them we reckon a blameable defect and to feel them in a just ie necessary measure we approve as suited to the nature and condition of such a creature as man but our security obtained to continue to indulge them we not only disapprove as hurtful but condemn as unmanly unbecoming and meanspirited nor will such a conduct afford any selfapproving joy when we coolly reflect upon it why the private with regard to the private passions such as love of life pleasure ease and the like as these aim at private good and are necessary to the perfection and happiness of the individual we should reckon any creature defective and even blameable that was destitute of them thus we condemn the man who imprudently ruins his fortune impairs his health or exposes his life we not only pity him as an unfortunate creature but feel a kind of moral indignation and contempt of him for having made himself such on the other hand though a discreet selfregard does not attract our esteem and veneration yet we approve    of it in some degree in an higher and different degree from what we would regard a wellcontrived machine as necessary to form a finishd creature nay to complete the virtuous character and as exactly suited to our present indigent state there are some passions respecting private good towards which we feel higher degrees of approbation as the love of knowledge of action of honour and the like we esteem them as marks of an ingenuous mind and cannot help thinking the character in which they are wanting remarkably stupid and in some degree immoral why the public with regard to the social affections as compassion natural affection friendship benevolence and the like we approve admire and love them in ourselves and in all in whom we discover them with an esteem and approbation if not different in kind yet surely far superior in degree to what we feel towards the other passions these we reckon necessary just and excellently fitted to our structure and state and the creature which wants them we call defective ill constituted a kind of abortion but the public affections we esteem as selfworthy originally and eternally amiable we approve and congratulate ourselves in proportion as we indulge them and reckon those deserving of our esteem and friendship who do so distinction between vehement and calm affections but among the social affections we make an obvious and constant distinction viz between those particular passions which urge us with a sudden violence and uneasy kind of sensation to pursue the good of their respective objects as pity natural affection and the like and those calm dispassionate affections and desires which prompt us more steddily and uniformly to promote the happiness of others the former we generally call passions to distinguish them from the other sort which go more commonly by the name of affections or calm desires the first kind we approve indeed and delight in but we feel still higher degrees of approbation and moral complacence towards the last and towards all limitations of the particular instincts by the principle of universal benevolence the more objects the calm affections take in and the worthier these are their dignity rises in proportion and with    this our approbation keeps an exact pace a character on the other hand which is quite divested of these public affections which feels no love for the species but instead of it entertains malice rancour and illwill we reckon totally immoral and unnatural such then are the sentiments and dispositions we feel when these several orders of affections pass before the mental eye moral obligation therefore that state in which we feel ourselves moved in the manner above described towards those affections and passions as they come under the minds review and in which we are instantaneously and independently of our choice or volition prompted to a correspondent conduct we call a state of moral obligation let us suppose for instance a parent a friend a benefactor reduced to a condition of the utmost indigence and distress and that it is in our power to give them immediate relief to what conduct are we obliged what duty does nature dictate and require in such a case attend to nature and nature will tell will tell with a voice irresistibly audible and commanding to the human heart with an authority which no man can silence without being selfcondemned and which no man can elude but at his peril that immediate relief ought to be given again let a friend a neighbour or even a stranger have lodged a deposit in our hands and after some time reclaim it no sooner do these ideas of the confidence reposed in us and of property not transferred but deposited occur than we immediately and unavoidably feel and recognize the obligation to restore it in both these cases we should condemn and even loath ourselves if we acted otherwise as having done or omitted doing what we ought not as having acted beneath the dignity of our nature—contrary to our most intimate sense of right and wrong—we should accuse ourselves as guilty of ingratitude injustice and inhumanity—and be conscious of deserving the censure and therefore dread the resentment of all rational beings—but in complying with the obligation we feel joy and selfapprobation—are conscious of an inviolable harmony between our nature and duty—and think ourselves entitled to the applause of every impartial spectator of our conduct moral obligation to    describe therefore what we cannot perhaps define a state of moral obligation is that state in which a creature endued with such senses powers and affections as man would condemn himself and think he deserved the condemnation of all others should he refuse to fulfil it but would approve himself and expect the approbation of all others upon complying with it moral agent and we call him a moral agent who is in such a state or is subject to moral obligation therefore as mans structure and connections often subject him to such a state of moral obligation we conclude that he is a moral agent but as man may sometimes act without knowing what he does as in cases of frenzy or disease or in many natural functions or knowing what he does he may act without choice or affection as in cases of necessity or compulsion therefore to denominate an action moral moral action good and bad  ie approveable or blameable it must be done knowingly and willingly or from affection and choice a morally good action then is to fulfil a moral obligation knowingly and willingly and a morally bad action or an immoral action is to violate a moral obligation knowingly and willingly the proposed brevity of the enquiry will not admit of entering into the minuter distinctions of actions moral character and temper good and bad as not an action but a series of actions constitute a character as not an affection but a series of affections constitute a temper and as we denominate things by the gross a fortiori or by the qualities which chiefly prevail in them therefore we call that a morally good character in which a series of morally good actions prevail and that a morally good temper in which a series of morally good affections have the ascendant a bad character and bad temper are the reverse but where the abovementioned order or proportion of passions is maintained there a series of morally good affections and actions will prevail therefore to maintain that order and proportion is to have a morally good temper and character but a morally good temper and character is moral rectitude integrity virtue or the completion of duty    how we come by the idea of moral obligation if it be asked after all how we come by the idea of moral obligation or duty we may answer that we come by it in the same way as by our other original and primary perceptions we receive them all from nature or the great author of nature for this idea of moral obligation is not a creature of the mind or dependent on any previous act of volition but arises on certain occasions or when certain other ideas are presented to the mind as necessarily instantaneously and unavoidably as pain does upon too near an approach to the fire or pleasure from the fruition of any good it does not for instance depend on our choice whether we shall feel the obligation to succour a distressed parent or to restore a deposit entrusted to us when it is recalled we cannot call this a compound idea made up of one or more simple ideas we may indeed nay we must have some ideas antecedent to it eg that of a parent—in distress—of a child—able to relieve—of the relation of one to the other—of a trust—of right c but none of these ideas constitute the perception of obligation this is an idea quite distinct from and something superadded to the ideas of the correlatives or the relation subsisting between them these indeed by a law of our nature are the occasion of suggesting it but they are as totally different from it as colours are from sounds by sense or reflection we perceive the correlatives our memory recals the favours or deposit we received the various circumstances of the case are matters of fact or experience but some delicate inward organ or power or call it what we please does by a certain instantaneous sympathy antecedent to the cool deductions of reason and independent of previous instruction art or volition perceive the moral harmony the living irresistible charms of moral obligation which immediately interests the correspondent passions and prompts us to fulfil its awful dictates the use of reason in moral cases we need not apprehend any danger from the quickness of its decisions nor be frightened because it looks like instinct and has been called so would we approve one for deliberating long or reasoning the matter much at leisure whether he should relieve a distressd parent feed a starving neighbour or restore the trust committed to him should we not suspect the reasoner of knavery or of very weak affections    to virtue we employ reason and worthily employ it in examining the condition relations and other circumstances of the agent or patient or of those with whom either of them are connected or in other words the state of the case and in complicated cases where the circumstances are many it may require no small attention to find the true state of the case but when the relations of the agent or patient and the circumstances of the action are obvious or come out such after a fair trial we should scarce approve him who demurs on the obligation to that conduct which the case suggests thus suppose one to deposit with us a sword which he comes afterwards to reclaim but in such circumstances suppose of frenzy or melancholy as gives us good ground to suspect that he will use it to the hurt of others or of himself in such a case it belongs to reason or prudence coolly to weigh every circumstance the condition of the proprietor the consequences of restoring the deposit and the like nor should we on this supposition condemn the hesitating about the restoring it but let the proprietor return to himself the obligation to restitution being now apparent we should justly suspect the demurrer of something criminal or knavish instinct considered as to that objection against this original perception of moral obligation taken from its being an instinct or necessary determination of our nature are not the perceptions or determinations of reason equally necessary does not every intuitive perception or judgment necessarily extort our assent when the agreement or disagreement of the ideas which are compared is perceived instinct indeed has been considered as something relative merely to bodily sense and appetite a mere brutal sensation or impulse in which the mind or our sublimer powers have no part and therefore it is a term that has been thought obnoxious to great exceptions in morals but is a moral power of perception or a moral determination the worse for being interwoven with the very frame and constitution of our nature for being instantaneous uniform and steddy in its operations or decision why should such a divine instinct be thought less rational less suitable to the dignity of the mind than those intuitive perceptions which are conversant about abstract    truths and arise necessarily and instantaneously from the obvious relations of things and if reason with all its sagacity may sometimes err nay often does why should any other power of perception be thought infallible or be condemned as brutal and irrational if it is not pleasure not the idea of obligation from what has been said it is evident that it is not the pleasures or agreeable sensations which accompany the exercise of the several affections nor those consequent to the actions that constitute moral obligation or excite in us the idea of it that pleasure is posterior to the idea of obligation and frequently we are obliged and acknowledge ourselves under an obligation to such affections and actions as are attended with pain as in the trials of virtue where we are obliged to sacrifice private to public good or a present pleasure to a future interest we have pleasure in serving an aged parent but it is neither the perception nor prospect of that pleasure which gives us the idea of obligation to that conduct therefore when we use these terms obligation duty ought and the like they stand for a simple idea an original uncompounded feeling or perception of the human mind as much as any idea whatsoever and can no more be defined than any other simple idea and this perception is not a creature of the mind but a ray emanating directly from the father of lights a fair genuine stamp of his hand who impressed every vital and original energy on the mind or if we chuse rather to say who ordained those laws of perception by which moral forms attract and charm us with an irresistible power but because the learned dexterity of human wit has so marvellously puzzled a plain and obvious subject we shall consider some of those ingenious theories by which moralists have deduced and explained moral obligation    section iii various hypotheses concerning moral obligation from the induction which has been made we shall be able to judge with more advantage of the different hypotheses which have been contrived to deduce the origin of moral obligation the scheme of hobbes hobbes who saw mankind in an unfavourable attitude involved in all the distraction and misery of a civil war seems to have taken too narrow and partial a view of our nature and has therefore drawn it in a very odious and uncomfortable light next to the desire of selfpreservation he makes the governing passions in man the love of glory and of power and from these by an arbitrary unnatural and unsupported hypothesis contrary to common experience and common language he attempts to deduce all the other passions which inflame the minds and influence the manners of men all men says he are by nature equal that is to say according to his own explanation the weakest can do as much mischief as the strongest all desire and have an equal right to the same things and want to excel each other in power and honour but as it is impossible for all to possess the same things or to obtain a preeminence in power and honour hence must arise mutual contests a natural passion to invade the property and level the power and character of each other and to raise and secure  0 themselves against the attempts of others this state of things in which every man having a right to every thing has likewise a right to prevent his neighbour by force or fraud he tells us must naturally produce a state of war and mutual carnage in such a state he adds nothing can be called unjust or unlawful for he who has a right to the end has also a right to the only means of obtaining or securing it which according to him are force or fraud and this state he calls the state of nature—but our shrewd philosopher subjoins that men being aware that such a state must terminate in their own destruction agreed to surrender their private unlimited right into the hands of the majority or such as the majority should appoint and to subject themselves for the future to common laws or to common judges or magistrates in consequence of this surrender and of this mutual compact or agreement they are secured against mutual hostilities and bound or obliged to a peaceable and good behaviour so that it is no longer lawful or just the good man means safe or prudent to invade and encroach on another for this would be contrary to compact and a violation of his promise and faith—therefore as there could be no injustice previous to this compact so the compact and it alone must be the origin of justice the foundation of duty and moral obligation this is our subtle philosophers scheme but one may ask him what obligation is a man under to keep his promise or stand to his compact if there be no obligation no moral tie distinct from that promise and that compact independent of and previous to both if there is none they must prove a mere rope of sand and men are left as loose and unsociable as ever as much barbarians and wolves as before their union but if there is a distinct and previous obligation to fidelity honour and a regard to ones engagements then right and wrong justice and injustice are antecedent to    compact—perhaps he will tell us that the necessity of the case or a regard to our own safety which is included in that of the public obliges us to adhere to our engagements we may be compelled or punished for breach of faith by those to whom we transfer our rights force or superior strength of the majority to controul or punish the refractory is no doubt the true origin of the obligation if he will speak out and selflove is its only judge and measure and if this be all then what obligation is a man under to gratitude charity friendship and all those duties of humanity which fall not under the cognizance or controul of law what obligations to private veracity honesty and fidelity when a man may be a knave with safety that scheme therefore which sets us loose from such obligations and involves us in such absurdities must be itself both absurd and wicked that state of nature which it supposes as its foundation is a mere chimera a vision of his own brain which from the condition and nature of the creature the growth of a family the rise of a tribe or clan we have no reason to believe ever subsisted therefore the superstructure which he has raised on that foundation is fictitious and chimerical hobbes took it for granted that all men were knaves or fools and wanted to dress up a system of government agreeable to the corrupt taste of the reigning powers and to the genius of a most dissolute court a government contrived to make a small part of mankind tyrants and all the rest slaves he measured virtue by mere utility and while he pretends to be the first that discovered this connection and gave the only true reason for the practice of honesty he seems to have misunderstood or wilfully overlooked its true nature and its inseparable connection with the perfection and happiness of the individual scheme of conformity to the divine will another set of moralists establish morals upon the will or positive appointment of the deity and call virtue a conformity to that will or appointment all obligation they say supposes one who obliges or who has a right to prescribe and can reward the obedient and punish the disobedient this can be none but our creator his will therefore is our law which we are bound to obey and this they tell us is only    sufficient to bind or oblige such imperfect and corrupt creatures as we are who are but feebly moved with a sense of the beauty and excellency of virtue and strongly swayed by passion or views of interest that virtue or such a conduct of the passions as hath been above described is agreeable to the will of god is evident beyond dispute as that conduct or scheme of duty is pointed out to us by our inward structure and as that inward structure is the effect of the will or appointment of the deity whatever therefore is agreeable or correspondent to our inward structure must likewise be agreeable or correspond to the will of god so that all the indications or sanctions of our duty which are declared or enforced by our structure are and may be considered as indications or sanctions of the will of our creator if these indications through inattention to or abuse of the structure prove insufficient to declare or if these sanctions through the weakness or wickedness of men prove insufficient to enforce obedience to the divine will and the deity is pleased to superadd new indications or new sanctions these additional indications and sanctions cannot and are not supposed by the assertors of this scheme to add any new duty or any new moral obligation but only a new and clearer promulgation of our duty or a new and stronger sanction or motive from interest to perform that duty and to fulfil that obligation to which we were bound before it makes no difference as to the matter of obligation after what mannar the will of our creator is enforced or declared to us whether by word or writ or by certain inward notices and determinations of our own minds arising according to a necessary law of our nature—by whichever of these ways we suppose the divine will intimated to us the first question that naturally occurs to us is why we are obliged to obey the divine will if it be answered that he is our superior and can reward or punish us as we are obedient or refractory this is resting obligation upon the foot of interest if we say that he is our creator and benefactor and we ought to obey our creator and be grateful to our benefactor this refers the obligation to an inward sense or perception that obedience is due to ones creator gratitude to ones benefactor upon what other principle but this can we connect those relations and that obedience and gratitude unless we recur to    the principle of selfinterest just now mentioned if the scheme of duty and moral obligation be thought to rest on too slight a foundation when built on moral perception and the affections of our nature because these are found insufficient to bind or rather compel men to their duty we fear the same objection will militate against this scheme since all the declarations and sanctions of the divine will have not hitherto had their due effect in producing a thorough and universal reformation when some speak of the will of god as the rule of duty they do not certainly mean a blind arbitrary principle of action but such a principle as is directed by reason and governed by wisdom or a regard to certain ends in preference to others unless we suppose some principle in the deity analogous to our sense of the obligation some antecedent affection or determination of his nature to prefer some ends before others we cannot assign any sufficient or indeed any possible reason why he should will one thing more than another or have any election at all whatever therefore is the ground of his choice or will must be the ground of obligation and not the choice or will itself—that this is so appears plainly from the common distinction which divines and philosophers make between moral and positive commands and duties the former they think obligatory antecedent to will or at least to any declaration of it the latter obligatory only in consequence of a positive appointment of the divine will but what foundation can there be for this distinction if all duty and all obligation be equally the result of mere will scheme of truth of the natures and reasons of things a more refined tribe of philosophers have attempted to lay the foundation of morals much deeper and on a more large and firm bottom viz the natures and reasons the truth and fitnesses of things senses and affections they tell us are vague and precarious and though they are not yet irrational principles of action and consequently very improper foundations on which to rest the eternal and immutable obligations of morality therefore they talk much of the abstract natures and reasons of things of eternal differences unalterable relations fitnesses and unfitnesses resulting from those relations and from    these eternal reasons differences relations and their consequent fitnesses they suppose moral obligation to arise a conduct agreeable to them or in other words a conformity to truth they call virtue and the reverse they call vice we perceive the nature of things by different organs or senses and our reason acts upon them when so perceived and investigates those relations which subsist between them or traces what is true what is false what may be affirmed and what denied concerning them thus by sense or experience we perceive the nature or character of a benefactor and of a beneficiary if one may so express it and upon comparing them together a third idea is suggested to us which we call the relation between the benefactor and beneficiary we likewise perceive the foundation of that relation some benefit received but are any of these ideas that which we understand by the moral duty or obligation the idea of gratitude due to the benefactor from the beneficiary this is evidently a distinct perception obvious to some sense organ or power of perception but not the result of reasoning suppose farther the benefactor in prison for a small debt and the beneficiary in affluence reason may suggest to the latter that a little share of his wealth bestowed    on the former will make a considerable change in his state to the better but will reason mere reason without some degree of affection prompt him to such a wellplaced charity or will the perception of his relation to his benefactor and of the benefit received lead him to approve such a conduct unless we suppose a sense or feeling quite different from that perception of the intervening relation and of the ground of that relation we might therefore perceive all the possible reasons relations and differences of things and yet be totally indifferent to this or that conduct unless we were endued with some sense or affection by which we approved and loved one or disapproved and disliked the other conduct reason may perceive a fitness or aptitude to a certain end but without some sense or affection we cannot propose or indeed have any idea of an end and without an end we cannot conceive any inducement to action—therefore before we can understand the natures reasons and fitnesses of things which are said to be the foundation of morals we must know what natures are meant to what ends they are fitted and from what principles or affections they are prompted to act otherwise we cannot judge of the duty required or of the conduct becoming that being whom we suppose under moral obligation but let the natures be once given and the relations which subsist among them be ascertained we can then determine what conduct will be obligatory to such natures and adapted to their condition and oeconomy and to the same natures placed in the same relations the same conduct will be eternally and invariably proper and obligatory to call morality a conformity to truth gives no idea no characteristic of it but what seems equally applicable to vice for whatever propositions are predicable of virtue as that it flows from good affection or is agreeable to the order of our nature—tends to produce happiness—is beheld with approbation and the like the contrary propositions are equally true and may be equally predicated of vice what is truth but the conformity of propositions to the nature or existence and reality of things and has not vice its nature its existence its adjuncts and consequences as much as virtue and are not propositions conformable to them true propositions and therefore is not a    conduct suited to or significative of such true propositions a true conduct or a conduct conformable to truth could we understand a watchmaker a painter or a statuary talking of their respective arts should they tell us that a watch a picture or statue were good when they were true or done according to truth and that their art lay in adjusting them to truth would they not speak more intelligibly and more to the purpose if they should explain to us their end or use and in order to that shew us their parts both together and separately the bearings and proportions of those parts and their reference to that end is not such a detail likewise necessary to understand human nature its duty and end will the truth the abstract natures and reasons the eternal relations and fitnesses of things form such a detail but suppose it could yet what degrees of virtue or vice does truth admit truth is a simple uniform invariable thing incapable of intension or remission but virtue and vice admit of almost infinite degrees and variations and therefore cannot consist of or be founded upon a thing which admits of none for such as is the foundation such must the superstructure be objection against the scheme in section   but it is said that to deduce moral obligation from the constitution of our nature and an inward sense is to render it exceedingly precarious and mutable because man might have been differently constituted so as to approve of treachery malice cruelty and then another or a quite contrary train of duties would have been required or obligatory the answer that human nature might have been otherwise constituted than it is is perhaps true but that it could have been better constituted considering its present state and circumstances may be justly questioned under his government who does every thing in number weight and measure and who has poured wisdom and beauty over all his works the little sketch that hath been given of our nature shews that it is admirably adapted to our present condition and the various connections we sustain we could not have subsisted or at least not have subsisted so well in such a condition nor maintained such connections    without that successive train of powers and passions with which we are endued without them or with a contrary set we must have been miserable and he who ordained the condition and settled the connections must likewise have ordained that conduct of powers and that balance of passions which is exactly proportioned to that condition and to those connections such an order of creatures being supposed and such a condition with such connections being given such a conduct as has been traced out must be eternally and invariably obligatory to such creature so placed and so connected had man been a different creature and placed in different circumstances a spider for instance or an hound a different set of duties would have then become him the web the vigilance the rapacious conduct of the former the sagacity the love of game and swiftness of the latter and the satisfaction of appetite the propagation and love of offspring common to both would have fulfilled the destinations of his nature and been his proper business and oeconomy but as man is not only a sensible an active and a social but a rational a political and a religious creature he has a nobler part to act and more numerous and more important obligations to fulfil and if afterwards in any future period of his duration he shall be advanced to a superior station and take in wider connections the sphere of his duty and the number and weight of his obligations must increase in proportion had a creature therefore situated and connected as man been formed with dispositions to approve of treachery malice or cruelty such a temper or constitution would have been evidently destructive of his happiness now if we imagine the deity prefers some ends to others suppose the happiness of his creatures to their misery he must likewise prefer the means most adapted to those ends therefore supposing the deity necessarily wise and good he could not have implanted in us such dispositions or in other words could not have annexed feelings of approbation to a conduct so incongruous to our state and so subversive of our happiness consequently amidst the infinite variety of possible constitutions vice could never have been approveable and of course not obligatory—therefore the scheme of human nature above proposed rests on the same foundation as the divine wisdom and goodness    and the scheme of moral obligation erected upon it must be equally immutable and immortal and that the deity is wise and good supremely and universally so nature cries aloud through all her works another objection but it is farther objected against this scheme that mankind differ strangely in their moral sentiments some approving treachery revenge and cruelty nay whole nations theft the exposition of infants and many other crimes of as black a dye therefore the moral sense recommended as the judge of morals is either not universal or a very uncertain and fallacious rule the answer as to that diversity of opinion or rather of practice concerning moral obligation we can no more conclude from thence that the internal perception or moral sense of right and wrong is not an universal or certain standard or rule of judging in morals than we can infer from the different opinions concerning the merit of the same performances that there is no standard in painting no certain and uncontroverted principle of the art in the last men appeal from particular tastes manners and customs to nature as the supreme standard and acknowledge that the perfection of the art lies in the just imitation of it but from a diversity in organs in capacity in education from favour prejudice and a thousand other circumstances they differ in applying the rule to particular instances the same thing holds in morals men admit the rule in general and appeal to our common nature and to common sense nay seldom differ or judge wrong in impartial cases when at any time they misapply or deviate from the received standard a fair and satisfying account may be given of their variations we have heard of states which have allowed theft and the exposition of lame or deformed children but in those states there was hardly any property all things were common and to train up a hardy shifting sagacious youth was thought far preferable to the security of any private property the exposition of their children was esteemed the sacrifice of private social affection to the love of the public we need not doubt but they loved their children but as such children were accounted useless and even hurtful to a commonwealth formed entirely    upon a warlike plan they reckoned it gallant to prefer the public to the strongest and most endearing private interest so that their mistake lay in supposing a real competition between those interests not in disavowing or divesting themselves of parental affection a mistake into which they would not have fallen had they enjoyed a more natural refined and extensive system of policy in some countries they put their aged decrepit parents to death but is it because they condemn or want natural affection no but they think it the best proof of their affection to deliver them from the miseries of old age which they do not believe can be counterbalanced by all its enjoyments in short neither cruelty nor ingratitude nor any action under an immoral form are ever approved men reason wrong only about the tendency the consequences materials and other circumstances of the action it may appear in different lights or with different sides according to the different views and opinions of the consequences which the moral spectator or actor has or according to his passions habits and other circumstances but still the general rule is recognized the moral quality or species is admired and the deviation from the rule condemned and disliked thus inhumanity is condemned by all yet persecution for the sake of religious opinions is approved and even practised by some under the notion of compassion to the souls of the sufferers or to those of others who they think can only be thus secured against the infection of heresy or under the form of zeal for the honour of god a divine principle to which they are persuaded whatever is human ought to stoop though to every large and wellinformed mind such a conduct must appear most barbarous and inhuman with how pious a name soever it may be sanctified—no man approves malice but to hate a wicked character or to resent an injury are deemed equally conducive to private security and to public good and appear to the actors even in their most outrageous sallies a noble contempt of vice or a generous indignation against wrong the highwayman condemns injustice and resents the pilfering knavery of a brother of the trade but to excuse himself he says necessity has no law an honest fellow must not starve he has tried the way of industry but in vain the prime law of selfpreservation must be obeyed—from these and the like  0 topics it appears no hard matter to account for the diversity of opinions concerning moral obligation viz from mistakes about the tendency of actions the nature of happiness or of public or private good from the partial connections men have formed from false opinions of religions and the will of god and from violent passions which make them misapply the rule or not attend to the moral quality as they ought therefore by separating what is foreign and appealing to the true standard of nature as ascertained above and by observing the reasons of those variations which we find sometimes among individuals we plainly recognize the stability of the rule of moral obligation and discern the universality of the sense and the variations instead of being exceptions against either rather concur in confirming one and demonstrating the other conclusion from the whole we may conclude that the nature the reasons and the relations of things would never have suggested to us this simple idea of moral obligation without a proper sense susceptible of it it is interwoven with the very frame and constitution of our nature and by it we are in the strictest sense a law to ourselves nor is it left to us to trace out this law by the cool or slow deductions of reason far less is this law the result of subtile and metaphysical enquiries into the abstract natures and relations of things we need not ascend to heaven to bring it down from thence nor descend into the depths to seek it there it is within us ever present with us ever active and incumbent on the mind and engraven on the heart in the fair and large signatures of conscience natural affection compassion gratitude and universal benevolence    section iv the final causes of our moral facultiesof perception and affection the survey proposed we have now taken a general prospect of man and of his moral powers and connections and on these erected a scheme of duty or moral obligation which seems to be confirmed by experience consonant to reason and approved by his most inward and most sacred senses it may be proper in the next place to take a more particular view of the final causes of those delicate springs by which he is impelled to action and of those clogs by which he is restrained from it—by this detail we shall be able to judge of their aptitude to answer their end in a creature endued with his capacities subject to his wants exposed to his dangers and susceptible of his enjoyments and from thence we shall be in a condition to pronounce concerning the end of his whole structure its harmony with his state and consequently its subserviency to answer the great and benevolent intentions of its author inward anatomy of the system of the mind in the anatomy of this inward and more elaborate subject it will not be necessary to pursue every little fibre nor to mark the nicer complications and various branchings of the more minute parts it shall suffice to lay open the larger vessels and stronger muscling of this divine piece of workmanship and to trace their office and use in the disposition of the whole the supreme being has seen fit to blend in the whole of things a prodigious variety of discordant and contrary principles light and    darkness pleasure and pain good and evil there are multifarious natures higher and lower and many intermediate ones between the widedistant extremes these are differently situated variously adjusted and subjected to each other and all of them subordinate to the order and perfection of the whole we may suppose man placed as in a center amidst those innumerable orders of beings by his outward frame drawn to the material system and by his inward connected with the intellectual or moral and of course affected by the laws which govern both or affected by that good and that ill which result from those laws in this infinite variety of relations with which he is surrounded and of contingencies to which he is liable he feels strong attractions to the good and violent repulsions or aversions to the ill but as good and ill are often blended and wonderfully complicated one with the other as they sometimes immediately produce and run up into each other and at other times lie at great distances yet by means of intervening links introduce one another and as these effects are often brought about in consequence of hidden relations and general laws of the energy of which he is an incompetent judge it is easy for him to mistake good for evil and evil for good and consequently he may be frequently attracted by such things as are destructive or repelled by such as are salutary thus by the tender and complicated frame of his body he is subjected to a great variety of ills to sickness cold heat fatigue and innumerable wants yet his knowledge is so narrow withal and his reason so weak that in many cases he cannot judge in the way of investigation or reasoning of the connections of those effects with their respective causes or of the various latent energies of natural things he is therefore informed of this connection by the experience of certain senses or organs of perception which by a mechanical instantaneous motion feel the good and the ill receiving pleasure from one and pain from the other by these without any reasoning he is taught to attract or chuse what tends to his welfare and to repel and avoid what tends to his ruin thus by his senses of taste and smell or by the pleasure he receives from certain kinds of food he is admonished which agree with his constitution and by an opposite sense of pain he is informed which sorts disagree or are destructive of it but is    not by means of these instructed in the inward natures and constitutions of things use of appetites and passions some of those senses are armed with strong degrees of uneasiness or pain in order to urge him to seek after such objects as are suited to them and these respect his more immediate and pressing wants as the sense of hunger thirst cold and the like which by their painful importunities compel him to provide food drink raiment shelter those instincts by which we are thus prompted with some kind of commotion or violence to attract and pursue good or to repel and avoid ill we call appetites and passions by our senses then we are informed of what is good or ill to the private system or the individual and by our private appetites and passions we are impelled to one and restrained from the other mans outward state in consequence of this machinery and the great train of wants to which our nature subjects us we are engaged in a continued series of occupations which often require much application of thought or great bodily labour or both the necessaries of life food cloaths shelter and the like must be provided conveniencies must be acquired to render life still more easy and comfortable in order to obtain these arts industry manufactures and trade are necessary and to secure to us the peaceable enjoyment of their fruits civil government policy and laws must be contrived and the various business of public life carried on thus while man is concerned and busied in making provision or obtaining security for himself he is by degrees engaged in connections with a family friends neighbours a community or a commonwealth hence arise new wants new interests new cares and new employments the passions of one man interfere with those of another interests are opposed competitions arise contrary courses are taken disappointments happen distinctions are made and parties formed this opens a vast scene of distraction and embarrassment and introduces a mighty train of good and ill both public and private yet amidst all this confusion and hurry plans of action must be laid consequences foreseen or guarded against inconveniencies    provided for and frequently particular resolutions must be taken and schemes executed without reasoning or delay provisions for it now what provision has the author of our nature made for this necessitous condition how has he fitted the actor man for playing his part in this perplexed and busy scene he has admonished the individual of private good and private ill by peculiar senses and urged him by keen instincts to pursue the former and repel the latter but what provision what security has the deity made for the community the public who or what shall answer for his good behaviour to it by public senses and passions our supreme parent watchful for the whole has not left himself without a witness here neither and hath made nothing imperfect but all things are double one against another he has not left man to be informed only by the cool notices of reason of good or ill the happiness or misery of his fellowcreatures he has made him sensible of their good and happiness but especially of their ill and misery by an immediate sympathy or quick feeling of pleasure and of pain pity the latter we call pity or compassion for the former though every one who is not quite divested of humanity feels it in some degree we have not got a name unless we call it congratulation congratulation  or joyful sympathy or that goodhumour which arises on seeing others pleased or happy both these feelings have been called in general the public or common sense κ ιν νοημο κυνη  by which we feel for others and are interested in their concerns as really though perhaps less sensibly than in our own resentment when we see our fellowcreatures unhappy through the fault or injury    of others we feel resentment or indignation against the unjust causers of that misery if we are conscious that it has happened through our fault or injurious conduct we feel shame and both these classes of senses and passions regarding misery and wrong are armed with such sharp sensations of pain as not only prove a powerful guard and security to the species or public system against those ills it may but serve also to lessen or remove those ills it does suffer compassion draws us out of ourselves to bear a part of the misfortunes of others powerfully solicits us in their favour melts us at a sight of their distress and makes us in some degree unhappy till they are relieved from it it is peculiarly well adapted to the condition of human life because as an eminent moralist observes it is much more and oftener in our power to do mischief than good and to prevent or lessen misery than to communicate positive happiness and therefore it is an admirable restraint upon the more selfish passions or those violent impulses that carry us to the hurt of others public affections there are other particular instincts or passions which interest us in the concerns of others even while we are most busy about our own and which are strongly attractive of good and repulsive of ill to them such are natural affection friendship love gratitude desire of fame love of society of ones country and others that might be named now as the private appetites and passions were found to be armed with strong sensations of desire and uneasiness to prompt man the more effectually to sustain labours and encounter dangers in pursuit of those goods that are necessary to the preservation and welfare of the individual and to avoid those ills which tend to his destruction in like manner it was necessary that this other class of desires and affections should be prompted with as quick sensations of pain not only to counteract the strength of their antagonists but to engage us in a virtuous activity for    our relations families friends neighbours country indeed our sense of right and wrong will admonish us that it is our duty and reason and experience farther assure us that it is both our interest and best security to promote the happiness of others but that sense that reason and that experience would frequently prove but weak and ineffectual prompters to such a conduct especially in cases of danger and hardship and amidst all the importunities of nature and that constant hurry in which the private passions involve us without the aid of those particular kind affections which mark out to us particular spheres of duty and with an agreeable violence engage and fix us down to them contrast or balance of passions it is evident therefore that these two classes of affection the private and public are set one against the other and designed to controul and limit each others influence and thereby to produce a just balance in the whole in general the violent sensations of pain or uneasiness which accompany hunger thirst and the other private appetites or too great fatigue of mind as well as of body prevent the individual from running to great excesses in the exercise of the higher functions of the mind as too intense thought in the search of truth violent application to business of any kind and different degrees of romantic heroism on the other hand the finer senses of perception and those generous desires and affections which are connected with them the love of action of imitation of truth honour public virtue and the like are wisely placed in the opposite scale in order to prevent us from sinking into the dregs of the animal life and debasing the dignity of man below the condition of brutes so that by the mutual reaction of those opposite powers the bad effects are prevented that would naturally result from their acting singly and apart and the good effects are produced which each are severally formed to produce    contrast or balance of public and private passions the same wholesome opposition appears likewise in the particular counterworkings of the private and public affections one against the other thus compassion is adapted to counterpoise the love of ease of pleasure and of life and to disarm or to set bounds to resentment and resentment of injury done to ourselves or to our friends who are dearer than ourselves prevents an effeminate compassion or consternation and gives us a noble contempt of labour pain and death natural affection friendship love of ones country nay zeal for any particular virtue are frequently more than a match for the whole train of selfish passions on the other hand without that intimate overruling passion of self love and those private desires which are connected with it the social and tender instincts of the human heart would degenerate into the wildest dotage the most torturing anxiety and downright frenzy contrasts among those of the same classes but not only are the different orders or classes of affection checks one upon another but passions of the same classes are mutual clogs thus how many are withheld from the violent outrages of resentment by fear and how easily is fear controuled in its turn while mighty wrongs awaken a mighty resentment the private passions often interfere and therefore moderate the violence of each other and a calm selflove is placed at their head to direct influence and controul their particular attractions and repulsions the public affections restrain one the other and all of them are put under the controul of a calm dispassionate benevolence which ought in like manner to direct and limit their particular motions—thus most part if not all the passions have a twofold aspect and serve a twofold end in one view they may be considered as powers impelling mankind to a certain course with a force proportioned to the apprehended moment of the good they aim at in another view they appear as weights balancing the action of the powers and controuling the violence of their impulses by means of these powers and weights a natural poise is settled in the human breast by its allwise author by which the creature is kept tolerably steady and regular in his course amidst that variety of stages through which he must pass    particular perceptions or instincts of approbation but this is not all the provision which god has made for the hurry and perplexity of the scene in which man is destined to act amidst those infinite attractions and repulsions towards private and public good and ill mankind either cannot often foresee the consequences or tendencies of all their actions towards one or other of these especially where those tendencies are intricate and point different ways or those consequences remote and complicated or though by careful and cool enquiry and a due improvement of their rational powers they might find them out yet distracted as they are with business amused with trifles dissipated by pleasure and disturbed by passion they either have or can find no leisure to attend to those consequences or to examine how far this or that conduct is productive of private or public good on the whole therefore were it left entirely to the slow and sober deductions of reason to trace those tendencies and make out those consequences it is evident that in many particular instances the business of life must stand still and many important occasions of action be lost or perhaps the grossest blunders be committed on this account the deity besides that general approbation which we bestow on every degree of kind affection has moreover implanted in man many particular perceptions or determinations to approve of certain qualities or actions which in effect tend to the advantage of society and are connected with private good though he does not always see that tendency nor mind that connection and these perceptions or determinations do without reasoning point out and antecedent to views of interest prompt to a conduct beneficial to the public and useful to the private system such is that sense of candour and veracity that abhorrence of fraud and falshood that sense of fidelity justice gratitude greatness of mind fortitude clemency decorum and that disapprobation of knavery injustice ingratitude meanness of spirit cowardice cruelty and indecorum which are natural to the human mind the former of those dispositions and the actions flowing from them are approved and those of the latter kind disapproved by us even abstracted from the view of their tendency or conduciveness to the happiness or misery of others or of ourselves in one we discern a beauty a superior excellency a congruity to the dignity of man in the other a deformity a littleness a debasement of human nature    others of an inferior order there are other principles also connected with the good of society or the happiness and perfection of the individual though that connection is not immediately apparent which we behold with real complacency and approbation though perhaps inferior in degree if not in kind such as gravity modesty simplicity of deportment temperance prudent oeconomy and we feel some degree of contempt and dislike where they are wanting or where the opposite qualities prevail these and the like perceptions or feelings are either different modifications of the moral sense or subordinate to it and plainly serve the same important purpose being expeditious monitors in the several emergencies of a various and distracted life of what is right what is wrong what is to be pursued and what avoided and by the pleasant or painful consciousness which attends them exerting their influence as powerful prompters to a suitable conduct their general tendencies from a slight inspection of the abovenamed principles it is evident they all carry a friendly aspect to society and the individual and have a more immediate or a more remote tendency to promote the perfection or good of both this tendency cannot be always foreseen and would be often mistaken or seldom attended by a weak busy shortsighted creature like man both rash and variable in his opinions a dupe to his own passions or to the designs of others liable to sickness to want and to error principles therefore which are so nearly linked with private security and public good by directing him without operose reasoning where to find one and how to promote the other and by prompting him to a conduct conducive to both are admirably adapted to the exigencies of his present state and wisely calculated to obtain the ends of universal benevolence passions fitted to a state of trial it were easy by considering the subject in another light to shew in a curious detail of particulars how wonderfully the inside of man or that astonishing train of moral powers and affections with which he is endued is fitted to the several stages of that progressive and probationary state through which he is destined to pass as our faculties are narrow and limited and rise from very small and imperfect beginnings they must be improved by exercise by attention and repeated trials and  0 this holds true not only of our intellectual but of our moral and active powers the former are liable to errors in speculation the latter to blunders in practice and both often terminate in misfortunes and pains and those errors and blunders are generally owing to our passions or to our too forward and warm admiration of those partial goods they naturally pursue or to our fear of those partial ills they naturally repel those misfortunes therefore lead us back to consider where our misconduct lay and whence our errors flowed and consequently are salutary pieces of trial which tend to enlarge our views to correct and refine our passions and consequently improve both our intellectual and moral powers—our passions then are the rude materials of our virtue which heaven has given us to work up to refine and polish into an harmonious and divine piece of workmanship they furnish out the whole machinery the calms and storms the lights and shades of human life they shew mankind in every attitude and variety of character and give virtue both its struggles and its triumphs to conduct them well in every state is merit to abuse or misapply them is demerit by them we prove what we are and by the habits to which they give birth we take our form and character for the successive stages of our life or any future period of our existence to a progressive state the different sets of senses powers and passions which unfold themselves in those successive stages are both necessary and adapted to that rising and progressive state enlarging views and growing connections require new passions and new habits and thus the mind by these continually expanding and finding a progressive exercise rises to higher improvements and pushes forward to maturity and perfection—but on this we cannot insist harmony of our structure and state in this beautiful oeconomy and harmony of our structure both outward and inward with that state we may at once discern the great lines of our duty traced out in the fairest and brightest characters and contemplate with admiration a more august and marvellous scene of divine wisdom and goodness laid in the human breast than we shall perhaps find in the whole compass of nature    result what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals in what oeconomy virtue consists from this detail it appears that man by his original frame is made for a temperate compassionate benevolent active and progressive state he is strongly attractive of the good and repulsive of the ills which befall others as well as himself he feels the highest approbation and moral complacence in those affections and in those actions which immediately and directly respect the good of others and the highest disapprobation and abhorrence of the contrary besides these he has many particular perceptions or instincts of approbation which though perhaps not of the same kind with the others yet are accompanied with correspondent degrees of affection proportioned to their respective tendencies to the public good therefore by acting agreeably to these principles man acts agreeably to his structure and fulfils the benevolent intentions of its author but we call a thing good when it answers its end and a creature good when he acts in a conformity to his constitution consequently man must be denominated good or virtuous when he acts suitably to the principles and destination of his nature and where his virtue lies there also is his rectitude his dignity and perfection to be found and this coincides with the account of virtue formerly given but presents it in another attitude or sets it in a light something different       book ii section i the principal distinctions of duty or virtue we have now considered the constitution and connections of man and on these erected a general system of duty or moral obligation consonant to reason approved by his most sacred and intimate sense suitable to his mixed condition and confirmed by the experience of mankind we have also traced the final causes of his moral faculties and affections to those noble purposes they answer both with regard to the private and the public system general division of duty from this induction it is evident that there is one order or class of duties which man owes to himself another to society and a third to god duties to ones self the duties he owes to himself are founded chiefly on the defensive and private passions which prompt him to pursue whatever tends to private good or happiness and to avoid or ward off whatever tends to private ill or misery among the various goods which allure and solicit him and the various ills which attack or threaten him to be intelligent and accurate in selecting one and rejecting the other or in preferring the most excellent goods and avoiding the most terrible ills when there is a competition among either and to be discreet in using the best means to attain the goods and avoid the ills is what we call prudence    this in our inward frame corresponds to sagacity or a quickness of sense in our outward—to proportion our defensive passions to our dangers we call fortitude which always implies a just mixture of calm resentment and animosity and wellgoverned caution and this firmness of mind answers to the strength and muscling of the body—and duly to adjust our private passions to our wants or to the respective moment of the good we affect or pursue we call temperance which does therefore always imply in this large sense of the word a just balance or command of the passions and answers to the health and sound temperament of the body duties to society the second class of duties arises from the public or social affections the just harmony or proportion of which to the dangers and wants of others and to the several relations we bear commonly goes by the name of justice this includes the whole of our duty to society to its parent and the general polity of nature particularly gratitude friendship sincerity natural affection benevolence and the other social virtues this being the noblest temper and fairest complexion of the soul corresponds to the beauty and fine proportion of the person the virtues comprehended under the former class especially prudence and fortitude may likewise be transferred to this and according to the various circumstances in which they are placed and the more confined or more extensive sphere in which they operate may be denominated private oeconomical or civil prudence fortitude c these direct our conduct with regard to the wants and dangers of those lesser or greater circles with which we are connected    duties to god the third class of duties respects the deity and arises also from the public affections and the several glorious relations which he sustains to us as our creator benefactor lawgiver judge c method we chose to consider this set of duties in the last place because though prior in dignity and excellency they seem to be last in order of time as thinking it the most simple and easy method to follow the gradual progress of nature as it takes its rise from individuals and spreads through the social system and still ascends upwards till at length it stretches to its allmighty parent and head and so terminates in those duties which are highest and best piety the duties resulting from these relations are reverence gratitude love resignation dependence obedience worship praise which according to the model of our finite capacities must maintain some sort of proportion to the grandeur and perfection of the object whom we venerate love and obey this proportion or harmony is expressed by the general name of piety or devotion which is always stronger or weaker according to the greater or less apprehended excellency of its object this sublime principle of virtue is the enlivening soul which animates the moral system and that cement which binds and sustains the other duties which man owes to himself and to society from hence as will appear afterwards they derive not only the firmest support but their highest relief and lustre divisions of conscience this then is the general temper and constitution of virtue and these are the principal lines or divisions of duty to those good dispositions which respect the several objects of our duty and to all actions which flow from such disposition the mind gives its sanction or testimony and this sanction or judgment concerning the moral quality or the goodness of actions or dispositions moralists call conscience when it judges of an action that is to be performed it is called an antecedent conscience and when it passes sentence on an action which is performed it is called a subsequent conscience goodness of an action  the tendency of an action to produce happiness or its external conformity    to a law is termed its material goodness material  but the good dispositions from which an action proceeds or its conformity to law in every respect constitutes its formal goodness formal natural and moral some moralists of no mean figure reckon it necessary to constitute the formal goodness of an action that we reflect on the action with moral complacency and approbation for mere affection or a good temper whether it respects others or ourselves they call natural or instinctive goodness of which the brutes are equally capable with man but when that affection or temper is viewed with approbation and made the object of a new affection this they say constitutes moral goodness or virtue in the strict sense of the word and is the characteristic of moral or rational agents  whether approbation is necessary to complete the idea of virtue it must be acknowledged that men may be partially good ie may indulge some kind affections and some kind actions and yet may be vitious or immoral on the whole thus a man may be affectionate to his child and injurious to his neighbour or compassionate to his neighbour and cruel to his country or zealous for his country yet inhuman to mankind it must also be acknowledged that to make every degree and act of good affection the frequent object of our attention—to reflect on these with moral approbation and delight—to be convinced on a full and impartial review that virtue is most amiable in itself and attended with the most happy consequences is sometimes a great support to virtue in many instances necessary to complete the virtuous character and always of use to give uniformity and stability to virtuous principles especially amidst the numberless trials to which they are exposed in this mixed scene of human life yet    how many of our fellowcreatures do we esteem and love who perhaps never coolly reflected on the beauty or fair proportions of virtue or turned it into a subject of their moral approbation and complacency philosophers or contemplative men may very laudably amuse themselves with such charming theories and often do contemplate every the minutest trace of virtue about themselves with a parental fondness and admiration and by those amiable images reflected from themselves they may perhaps be more confirmed in the esteem of whatever is honest and praiseworthy however it is not generally among this recluse set of men that we expect to find the highest flights of virtue but rather among men of action and business who through the prevalence of a natural good temper or from generous affections to their friends their country and mankind are truly and transcendently good whatever that quality is which we approve in any action and count worthy our esteem and which excites an esteem and love of the agent we call the virtue merit or formal goodness of that action and if actions invested with such a quality have the ascendant in a character we call that character virtuous or good now it is certain that those qualities or principles mentioned above especially those of the public and benevolent kind how simple how instinctive soever are viewed with approbation and love the very nature of that principle we call conscience which approves these benevolent affections and whatever is done through their influence intimates that virtue or merit is present in the mind before conscience is exercised and that its office is only to observe it there or to applaud it for if virtue is something that deserves our esteem and love then it must exist before conscience is exerted or gives its testimony therefore to say that the testimony of conscience is necessary to the being or form of a virtuous action is in plain terms to affirm that virtue is not virtue till it is reflected on and approved as virtue the proper business of reason in forming the virtuous character is to guide the several affections of the mind to their several objects and to direct us to that conduct or to those measures of action which are the most proper means of acquiring them thus with respect to benevolence which is the virtue of a character or a principal ingredient of merit its proper object is the    public good the business of reason then is to inform us wherein consists the greatest public good what conduct and which actions are the most effectual means of promoting it after all the motions of the mind are so quick and imperceptible and so complicated with each other that perhaps seldom do any indulge the virtuous or good affections without an approving consciousness and certainly the more that virtue is contemplated with admiration and love the more firm and inflexible will the spectator be in his attachment to it divisions of conscience when the mind is ignorant or uncertain about the moment of an action or its tendency to private or public good or when there are several circumstances in the case some of which being doubtful render the mind dubious concerning the morality of the action this is called a doubtful or scrupulous conscience if it mistakes concerning these it is called an erroneous conscience if the error or ignorance is involuntary or invincible the action proceeding from that error or from that ignorance is reckoned innocent or not imputable if the error or ignorance is supine or affected ie the effect of negligence or of affectation and wilful inadvertence the conduct flowing from such error or such ignorance is criminal and imputable not to follow ones conscience though erroneous and illinformed is criminal as it is the guide of life and to counteract it shews a depraved and incorrigible spirit yet to follow an erroneous conscience is likewise criminal if that error which misled the conscience was the effect of inattention or of any criminal passion how conscience is to be rectified if it be asked how an erroneous conscience shall be rectified since it is supposed to be the only guide of life and judge of morals we answer in the very same way that we would rectify reason if at any time it should judge wrong as it often does viz by giving it proper and sufficient    materials for judging right ie by enquiring into the whole state of the case the relations connections and several obligations of the actor the consequences and other circumstances of the action or the surplusage of private or public good which results or is likely to result from the action or from the omission of it if those circumstances are fairly and fully stated the conscience will be just and impartial in its decision for by a necessary law of our nature it approves and is well affected to the moral form and if it seems to approve of vice or immorality it is always under the notion or mask of some virtue so that strictly speaking it is not conscience which errs for its sentence is always conformable to the view of the case which lies before it and is just upon the supposition that the case is truly such as it is represented to it all the fault is to be imputed to the agent who neglects to be better informed or who through weakness or wickedness hastens to pass sentence from an imperfect evidence thus he who persecutes another for the sake of conscience or a mistake in religious opinion does not approve of injustice or cruelty any more than his mistaken neighbour who suffers by it but thinking the severity he uses conformable to the divine will or salutary to the patient or at least to the society of the faithful whose interest he reckons far preferable not only to the interest of so small a part but to all the vast remainder of mankind and thinking withal that severity is the only means of securing that highest interest he passes a sentence as just and consequential from those principles as a physician who to save the whole body orders the amputation of a gangrened limb thinking that the only remedy perhaps in the latter case an able practitioner might have accomplished the cure by a less dangerous operation and in the former a better casuist or a greater master in spiritual medicine might have contrived a cure full as sure and much more innocent having now given the general divisions of duty or virtue which exhibit its different faces and attitudes as it stands directed to its respective objects let us next descend into particulars and mark its most minute features and proportions as they appear in the detail of human life  0 section ii of mans duty to himself of the nature of good and the chief good divisions of good every creature by the constitution of his nature is determined to love himself to pursue whatever tends to his preservation and happiness and to avoid whatever tends to his hurt and misery being endued with sense and perception he must necessarily receive pleasure from some objects and pain from others those objects which give pleasure are called good and those which give pain evil to the former he feels that attraction or motion we call desire or love to the latter that impulse we call aversion or hatred to objects which suggest neither pleasure nor pain and are apprehended of no use to procure one or ward off the other we feel neither desire nor aversion and such objects are called indifferent those objects which do not of themselves procure pleasure or pain but are the means of procuring either we call useful or noxious towards them we are affected in a subordinate manner or with an indirect or reflective rather than a direct and immediate affection all the original and particular affections of our nature lead us out to and ultimately rest in the first kind of objects viz those which give immediate pleasure and which we therefore call good directly so the calm affection of selflove alone is conversant about such objects as are only consequentially good or merely useful to ourselves moral good but besides those sorts of objects which we call good merely and solely as they give pleasure or are means of procuring it there is an higher and nobler species of good towards which we feel that peculiar    movement we call approbation or moral complacency and which we therefore denominate moral good such are our affections and the consequent actions to them the perception of this is as has been already observed quite distinct in kind from the perception of the other species and though it may be connected with pleasure or advantage by the benevolent constitution of nature yet it constitutes a good independent of that pleasure and that advantage and far superior not in degree only but in dignity to both the other viz the natural good consists in obtaining those pleasures which are adapted to the peculiar senses and passions susceptible of them and is as various as are those senses and passions this viz the moral good lies in the right conduct of the several senses and passions or their just proportion and accommodation to their respective objects and relations and this is of a more simple and invariable kind human happiness by our several senses we are capable of a great variety of pleasing sensations these constitute distinct ends or objects ultimately pursuable for their own sake to these ends or ultimate objects correspond peculiar appetites or affections which prompt the mind to pursue them when these are attained there it rests and looks no farther whatever therefore is pursuable not on its own account but as subservient or necessary to the attainment of something else that is intrinsically valuable or for its own sake be that value ever so great or ever so small we call a mean and not an end so that ends and not means constitute the materials or the very essence of our happiness consequently happiness ie human happiness cannot be one simple uniform thing in creatures constituted as we are with such various senses of pleasure or such different capacities of enjoyment now the same principle or law of our nature which determines us to pursue any one end or species of good prompts us to pursue every other end or species of good of which we are susceptible or to which our maker has adapted an original propension but amidst the great multiplicity of ends or goods which form the various ingredients of our happiness we perceive an evident gradation or subordination suited to that gradation of senses powers and passions which prevails in our mixed and various    constitution and to that ascending series of connections which open upon us in the different stages of our progressive state gradation of goods thus the goods of the body or of the external senses seem to hold the lowest rank in this gradation or scale of goods these we have in common with the brutes and tho many men are brutish enough to pursue the goods of the body with a more than brutal fury yet when at any time they come in competition with goods of an higher order the unanimous verdict of mankind by giving the last the preference condemns the first to the meanest place goods consisting in exterior social connections as fame fortune power civil authority seem to succeed next and are chiefly valuable as the means of procuring natural or moral good but principally the latter goods of the intellect are still superior as taste knowledge memory judgment c the highest are moral goods of the mind directly and ultimately regarding ourselves as command of the appetites and passions prudence fortitude benevolence c these are the great objects of our pursuit and the principal ingredients of our happiness let us consider each of them as they rise one above the other in this natural series or scale and touch briefly on our obligations to pursue them the brevity of this work will not permit us minutely to weigh the real or comparative moment of the different kinds of goods which offer themselves to the mind or to scrutinize the particular pleasures of which we are susceptible either as to intenseness or duration and the enjoyment of which depends on accidents rather than our attention and industry we shall therefore confine ourselves to the consideration of such goods as lie properly within our own sphere and being the objects of our attention and care fall within the verge of duty goods of the body those of the body are health strength agility hardiness and patience of change neatness and decency good health good health and a regular easy flow of spirits are in themselves sweet natural enjoyments a great fund of pleasure and indeed the proper seasoning which gives a flavour and poignancy to every other pleasure    the want of health unfits us for most duties of life and is especially an enemy to the social and human affections as it generally renders the unhappy sufferer peevish and sullen disgusted at the allotments of providence and consequently apt to entertain suspicious and gloomy sentiments of its author it obstructs the free exercise and full improvement of our reason makes us a burthen to our friends and useless to society whereas the uninterrupted enjoyment of good health is a constant source of good humour and good humour is a great friend to openness and benignity of heart enables us to encounter the various ills and disappointments of life with more courage or to sustain them with more patience and in short conduces much if we are otherwise duly qualified to our acting our part in every exigency of life with more firmness consistency and dignity therefore it imports us much to preserve and improve an habit or enjoyment without which every other external entertainment is tasteless and most other advantages of little avail how preserved  and this is best done by a strict temperance in diet and regimen by regular exercise and by keeping the mind serene and unruffled by violent passions and unsubdued by intense and constant labours which greatly impair and gradually destroy the strongest constitutions strength agility c strength agility hardiness and patience of change suppose health and are unattainable without it but they imply something more and are necessary to guard it to give us the perfect use of life and limbs and to secure us against many otherwise unavoidable ills the exercise of the necessary manual and of most of the elegant arts of life depends on strength and agility of body personal dangers private and public dangers the demands of our friends our families and country require them they are necessary in war and ornamental in peace fit for the employments of a country and a town life and they exalt the entertainments and diversions of both how attained  they are chiefly obtained by moderate and regular exercise patience of change few are so much raised above want and dependence or so exempted from business and care as not to be often exposed to inequalities and    changes of diet exercise air climate and other irregularities now what can be so effectual to secure one against the mischiefs arising from such unavoidable alterations as hardiness and a certain versatility of constitution which can bear extraordinary labours and submit to great changes without any sensible uneasiness or bad consequences how attained  this is best attained not by an overgreat delicacy and minute attention to forms or by an invariable regularity in diet hours and way of living but rather by a bold and discreet latitude of regimen besides deviations from established rules and forms of living if kept within the bounds of sobriety and reason are friendly to thought and original sentiment animate the dull scene of ordinary life and business and agreeably stir the passions which stagnate or breed ill humour in the calms of life neatness decency c neatness cleanliness and decency to which we may add dignity of countenance and demeanour seem to have something refined and moral in them at least we generally esteem them indications of an orderly genteel and wellgoverned mind conscious of inward worth or the respect due to ones nature whereas nastiness slovenliness aukwardness and indecency are shrewd symptoms of something mean careless and deficient and betray a mind untaught illiberal unconscious of what is due to ones self or to others how much cleanliness conduces to health needs hardly be mentioned and how necessary it is to maintain ones character and rank in life and to render us agreeable to others as well as to ourselves is as evident—there are certain motions airs and gestures which become the human countenance and form in which we perceive a comeliness openness simplicity gracefulness and there are others which to our sense of decorum appear uncomely affected disingenuous and aukward quite unsuitable to the native dignity of our face and form the first are in themselves the most easy natural and commodious give one boldness and presence of mind a modest assurance an address both awful and alluring they bespeak candour and greatness of mind raise the most agreeable prejudices in ones favour render society engaging command respect and often love and give weight and authority both in conversation    and business in fine they are the colouring of virtue which shews it to the greatest advantage in whomsoever it is and not only imitate but in some measure supply it where it is wanting whereas the last viz rudeness affectation indecorum and the like have all the contrary effects they are burthensome to ones self a dishonour to our nature and a nusance in society how attained  the former qualities or goods are best attained by a liberal education by preserving a just sense of the dignity of our nature by keeping the best and politest company but above all by acquiring those virtuous and ennobling habits of mind which are decency in perfection which will give an air of unaffected grandeur and spread a lustre truly engaging over the whole form and deportment goods of exterior social connections we are next to consider those goods which consist in exterior social connections as fame fortune civil authority power fame the first has a twofold aspect as a good pleasant in itself or gratifying to an original passion and then as expedient or useful towards a farther end honour from the wise and good on account of a virtuous conduct is regaling to a good man for then his heart reechoes to the grateful sound there are few quite indifferent even to the commendation of the vulgar tho we cannot approve that conduct which proceeds entirely from this principle and not from good affection or love of the conduct itself yet as it is often a guard and additional motive to virtue in creatures imperfect as we are and often distracted by interfering passions it might be dangerous to suppress it altogether however wise it may be to restrain it within due bounds and however laudable to use it only as a scaffolding to our virtue which may be taken down when that glorious structure is finished but hardly till then to pursue fame for itself is innocent to regard it only as an auxiliary to virtue is noble to seek it chiefly as an engine of public usefulness is still more noble and highly praiseworthy for tho the opinion and breath of men are transparent and fading things often obtained without merit and lost without cause yet as our business is with men and as our capacity of serving them is generally increased in proportion    to their esteem of us therefore sound and wellestablished moral applause may and will be modestly not ostentatiously sought after by the good not indeed as a solitary refined sort of luxury but as a public and proper instrument to serve and bless mankind at the same time they will learn to despise that reputation which is founded on rank fortune and any other circumstances or accomplishments that are foreign to real merit or to useful services done to others and think that praise of little avail which is purchased without desert and bestowed without judgment fortune power c fortune power and civil authority or whatever is called influence and weight among mankind are goods of the second division that is valuable or pursuable only as they are useful or as means to a farther end viz the procuring or preserving the immediate objects of enjoyment or happiness to ourselves or others therefore to love such goods on their own account and to pursue them as ends not the means of enjoyment must be highly preposterous and absurd there can be no measure no limit to such pursuit all must be whim caprice extravagance accordingly such appetites unlike all the natural ones are increased by possession and whetted by enjoyment they are always precarious and never without fears because the object lies without ones self they are seldom without sorrow and vexation because no accession of wealth or power can satisfy them but if those goods are considered only as the materials or means of private or public happiness then the same obligations which bind us to pursue the latter bind us likewise to pursue the former how far pursuable  we may and no doubt we ought to seek such a measure of wealth as is necessary to supply all our real wants to raise us above servile dependence and to provide us with such conveniences as are suited to our rank and condition in life to be regardless of this measure of wealth is to expose ourselves to all the temptations of poverty and corruption to forfeit our natural independency and freedom to degrade and consequently to render the rank we hold and the character we sustain in society useless if not contemptible when these important ends are secured we ought not to murmur or repine that we possess no more yet we are not secluded    by any obligation moral or divine from seeking more in order to give us that happiest and most godlike of all powers the power of doing good a supine indolence in this respect is both absurd and criminal absurd as it robs us of an inexhausted fund of the most refined and durable enjoyments and criminal as it renders us so far useless to the society to which we belong avarice  that pursuit of wealth which goes beyond the former end viz the obtaining the necessaries or such conveniencies of life as in the estimation of reason not of vanity or passion are suited to our rank and condition and yet is not directed to the latter viz the doing good is what we call avarice and that pursuit of power ambition  which after securing ones self ie attained the proper independence and liberty of a rational social creature is not directed to the good of others is what we call ambition or the lust of power to what extent the strict measures of virtue will allow us to pursue either wealth or power and civil authority is not perhaps possible precisely to determine that must be left to prudence and the peculiar character condition and other circumstances of each man only thus far a limit may be set that the pursuit of either must encroach upon no other duty or obligation which we owe to ourselves to society or to its parent and head the same reasoning is to be applied to power as to wealth it is only valuable as an instrument of our own security and of the free enjoyment of those original goods it may and often does administer to us and as an engine of more extensive happiness to our friends our country and mankind in this degree it may and unless a greater good forbids it ought to be sought after and when it is either offered to us or may be obtained consistently with a good conscience it would be criminal to decline it and a selfish indolence to neglect the necessary means of acquiring it how fame and power are attained now the best and indeed the only way to obtain a solid and lasting fame is an uniform inflexible course of virtue the employing ones ability and wealth in supplying the wants and using ones power in promoting or securing the happiness the rights and liberties of mankind joined to an universal affability and politeness of manners and surely one will not mistake the matter much who thinks the same    course conducive to the acquiring greater accessions both of wealth and power especially if he adds to those qualifications a vigorous industry a constant attention to the characters and wants of men to the conjunctures of times and continually varying genius of affairs and a steddy intrepid honesty that will neither yield to the allurements nor be overawed with the terrors of that corrupt and corrupting scene in which we live we have sometimes heard indeed of other ways and means as fraud dissimulation servility and prostitution and the like ignoble arts by which the men of the world as they are called shrewd politicians and men of address amass wealth and procure power but as we want rather to form a man of virtue an honest contented happy man we leave to the men of the world their own ways and permit them unenvied and unimitated by us to reap the fruit of their doings goods of the intellect the next species of objects in the scale of good are the goods of the intellect as knowledge memory judgment taste sagacity docility and whatever else we call intellectual virtues let us consider them a little and the means as well as obligations to improve them their moment as man is a rational creature capable of knowing the differences of things and actions—as he not only sees and feels what is present but remembers what is past and often foresees what is future—as he advances from small beginnings by slow degrees and with much labour and difficulty to knowledge and experience—as his opinions sway his passions—as passions influence his conduct—and as his conduct draws consequences after it which extend not only to the present but to the future time and therefore is the principal source of his happiness or misery it is evident that he is formed for intellectual improvements and that it must be of the utmost consequence for him to improve and cultivate his intellectual powers on which those opinions those passions and that conduct depend    the pleasures they give but besides the future consequences and moment of improving our intellectual powers their immediate exercise on their proper objects yields the most rational and refined pleasures knowledge and a right taste in the arts of imitation and design as poetry painting sculpture music architecture afford not only an innocent but a most sensible and sublime entertainment by these the understanding is instructed in ancient and modern life the history of men and things the energies and effects of the passions the consequences of virtue and vice by these the imagination is at once entertained and nourished with the beauties of nature and art lighted up and spread out with the novelty grandeur and harmony of the universe and in fine the passions are agreeably rouzed and suitably engaged with the greatest and most interesting objects that can fill the human mind he who has a taste formed to these ingenious delights and plenty of materials to gratify it can never want the most agreeable exercise and entertainment nor once have reason to make that fashionable complaint of the tediousness of time nor can he want a proper subject for the discipline and improvement of his heart for being daily conversant with beauty order and design knowledge and taste  in inferior subjects he bids fair for growing in due time an admirer of what is fair and wellproportioned in the conduct of life and the order of society which is only order and design exerted in their highest subjects he will learn to transfer the numbers of poetry to the harmony of the mind and of wellgoverned passions and from admiring the virtues of others in moral paintings come to approve and imitate them himself therefore to cultivate a true and correct taste must be both our interest and our duty when the circumstances of our station give leisure and opportunity for it and when the doing it is not inconsistent with our higher obligations or engagements to society and mankind how attained it is best attained by reading the best books where good sense has more the ascendant than learning and which retain more to practice than to  0 speculation by studying the best models ie those which profess to imitate nature most and approach the nearest to it and by conversing with men of the most refined taste and the greatest experience in life moment of intellectual goods as to the other intellectual goods what a fund of entertainment must it be to investigate the truth and various relations of things to trace the operations of nature to general laws to explain by these its manifold phaenomena to understand that order by which the universe is upheld and that oeconomy by which it is governed to be acquainted with the human mind the connections subordinations and uses of its powers and to mark their energy in life how agreeable to the ingenious enquirer to observe the manifold relations and combinations of individual minds in society to discern the causes why they flourish or decay and from thence to ascend through the vast scale of beings to that general mind which presides over all and operates unseen in every system and in every age through the whole compass and progression of nature devoted to such entertainments as these the contemplative have abandoned every other pleasure retired from the body so to speak and sequesterd themselves from social intercourse for these the busy have often preferred to the hurry and din of life the calm retreats of contemplation for these when once they come to taste them even the gay and voluptuous have thrown up the lawless pursuits of sense and appetite and acknowledged these mental enjoyments to be the most refined and indeed the only luxury besides by a just and large knowledge of nature we recognize the perfections of its author and thus piety and all those pious affections which depend on just sentiments of his character are awakened and confirmed and a thousand superstitious fears that arise from partial views of his nature and works will of course be excluded an extensive prospect of human life and of the periods and revolutions of human things will conduce much to the giving a certain greatness of mind and a noble contempt of those little competitions about power honour and wealth which disturb and divide the bulk of mankind and to promote a calm indurance of those inconveniencies and ills that are the common appendages    of humanity add to all that a just knowledge of human nature and of those hinges upon which the business and fortunes of men turn will prevent our thinking either too highly or too meanly of our fellowcreatures give no small scope to the exercise of friendship confidence and goodwill and at the same time brace the mind with a proper caution and distrust those nerves of prudence and give a greater mastery in the conduct of private as well as public life therefore by cultivating our intellectual abilities we shall best promote and secure our interest and be qualified for acting our part in society with more honour to ourselves as well as advantage to mankind consequently to improve them to the utmost of our power is our duty they are talents committed to us by the almighty head of society and we are accountable to him for the use of them but be it remembered withal that how engaging soever the muses and graces are they are chiefly valuable as they are handmaids to usher in and set off the moral virtues from whose service if they are ever divorced they become retainers to the meaner passions panders to vice and convert men if we may use the expression into a refined sort of savages how attained the intellectual virtues are best improved by accurate and impartial observation extensive reading and unconfined converse with men of all characters especially with those who to private study have joined the widest acquaintance with the world and greatest practice in affairs but above all by being much in the world and having large dealings with mankind such opportunities contribute much to divest one of prejudices and a servile attachment to crude systems to open ones views and to give that experience on which the most useful because the most practical knowledge is built and from which the surest maxims for the conduct of life are deduced moral goods the highest goods which enter into the composition of human happiness are moral goods of the mind directly and ultimately regarding ourselves as command of the appetites and passions prudence and caution magnanimity fortitude humility love of virtue love of god    resignation and the like these sublime goods are goods by way of eminence goods recommended and enforced by the most intimate and awful sense and consciousness of our nature goods that constitute the quintessence the very temper of happiness that form and complexion of soul which renders us approveable and lovely in the sight of god goods in fine which are the elements of all our future perfection and felicity their moment most of the other goods we have considered depend partly on ourselves and partly on accidents which we can neither foresee nor prevent and result from causes which we cannot influence or alter they are such goods as we may possess today and lose tomorrow and which require a felicity of constitution and talents to attain them in full vigour and perfection and a felicity of conjunctures to secure the possession of them therefore did our happiness depend altogether or chiefly on such transitory and precarious possessions it were itself most precarious and the highest folly to be anxious about it—but though creatures constituted as we are cannot be indifferent about such goods and must suffer in some degree and consequently have our happiness incomplete without them yet they weigh but little in the scale when compared with moral goods by the benevolent constitution of our nature these are placed within the sphere of our activity so that no man can be destitute of them unless he is first wanting to himself some of the wisest and best of mankind have wanted most of the former goods and all the external kind and felt most of the opposite ills such at least as arise from without yet by possessing the latter viz the moral goods have declared they were happy and to the conviction of the most impartial observers have appeared happy the worst of men have been surrounded with every outward good and advantage of fortune and have possessed great parts yet for want of moral rectitude have been and have confessed themselves notoriously and exquisitely miserable the exercise of virtue has supported its votaries and made them exult in the midst of tortures almost intolerable nay how often has some false form or shadow of it sustained    even the greatest villains and bigots under the same pressures but no external goods no goods of fortune have been able to alleviate the agonies or expel the fears of a guilty mind conscious of the deserved hatred and reproach of mankind and the just displeasure of almighty god the other senses and capacities of enjoyment are gratified when they obtain their respective objects and the happiness of the corresponding passions depends on their success in their several pursuits thus the love of honour of pleasure of power and the like are satisfied only when they obtain the desired honour pleasure or power when they fail of attaining these they are disappointed and disappointment gives disgust but moral good is of so singular and sublime a nature that when the mind is in pursuit of it though it should prove unsuccessful in its aims it can rest in the conduct without repining without being dejected at the ill success nay the pleasure attending the consciousness of upright aims and generous efforts absorbs the disappointment and makes inferior ends disappear as of no amount in the great aggregate or surplusage of good that remains so that though human happiness in the present state consists of many separate and little rivulets which must often be left dry in the perpetual flux and reflux of human things yet the main stream with which those lesser ones do generally communicate flows from within from the heart of man and if this be sound and clear rolls on through life with a strong and equal current yet as many small articles make up a pretty large sum and as those inferior goods which enter into the account health fame fortune and the like are often even after our utmost care unattainable or at least precarious it is evidently of the utmost consequence to be prepared against the want or loss of them by having our desires moderate and our passions under due command    and let it be remembered that it is not only of great importance to our ease and security against ill but one of the highest improvements of virtue to contemn those things the contempt of which is truly great and heroic and to place our happiness chiefly in those virtuous exercises and affections which arise from a pure and welldisposed mind an happiness which no condition of life can exclude no change of fortune interrupt or destroy this will arm and fortify the mind against the want of those inferior goods and against those pains which result to the generality of mankind from the contrary evils the mixed condition of human life requires particular virtues as the present condition of human life is wonderfully chequered with good and ill and as no height of station no affluence of fortune can absolutely insure the good or secure against the ill it is evident that a great part of the comfort and serenity of life must lie in having our minds duly affected with regard to both ie rightly attempered to the loss of one and the sufferance of the other for it is certain that outward calamities derive their chief malignity and pressure from the inward dispositions with which we receive them by managing these right we may greatly abate that malignity and pressure and consequently diminish the number and weaken the moment of the ills of life if we should not have it in our power to obtain a large share of its goods there are particularly three virtues which go to the forming this right temper towards ill and which are of singular efficacy if not totally to remove yet wonderfully to alleviate the calamities of life these are fortitude or patience humility and resignation let us consider them a little and the effects they produce fortitude fortitude is that calm and steddy habit of mind which either moderates our fears and enables us bravely to encounter the prospect of ill or renders the mind serene and invincible under its immediate pressure it lies equally distant from rashness and cowardice and though it does not hinder us from feeling yet prevents our complaining or shrinking under the stroke it always includes a generous contempt of or at least a noble superiority to those precarious goods of which we    can insure neither the possession nor continuance the man therefore who possesses this virtue in this ample sense of it stands upon an eminence and sees human things below him the tempest indeed may reach him but he stands secure and collected against it upon the basis of conscious virtue which the severest storms can seldom shake and never overthrow humility humility is another virtue of high rank and dignity though often mistaken by proud mortals for meanness and pusillanimity it is opposed to pride which commonly includes in it a false or overrated estimation of our own merit an ascription of it to ourselves as its only and original cause an undue comparison of ourselves with others and in consequence of that supposed superiority an arrogant preference of ourselves and a supercilious contempt of them humility on the other hand seems to denote that modest and ingenuous temper of mind which arises from a just and equal estimate of our own advantages compared with those of others and from a sense of our deriving all originally from the author of our being its ordinary attendants are mildness a gentle forbearance and an easy unassuming humanity with regard to the imperfections and faults of others virtues rare indeed but of the fairest complexion the proper offspring of so lovely a parent the best ornaments of such imperfect creatures as we are precious in the sight of god and which sweetly allure the hearts of men—this virtue was not altogether unknown to the more sober moralists among the ancients who place submissio animi among the train of virtues but it is taught in its highest perfection and enforced by the greatest examples and the strongest motives in the christian religion which recommends and exalts this as well as every other moral and divine virtue beyond every other system of religion and philosophy that ever appeared in the world and teaches us throughout the whole of it to refer every virtue and every endowment to their original source the father of lights from whom descends every good and perfect gift humility is a virtue which highly adorns the character in which it resides and sets off every other virtue it is an admirable ingredient of a contented mind and an excellent security against many    of those ills in life which are most sensibly felt by people of a delicate nature to be persuaded of this we need only remember how many of our uneasinesses arise from the mortifications of our pride—how almost every ill we suffer and all the opposition we meet with is aggravated and sharpened by the reflection on our imaginary merit or how little we deserved those ills and how much we were entitled to the opposite goods whereas a sober sense of what we are and whose we are and a consciousness how far short our virtue is of that standard of perfection to which we ought to aspire will blunt the edge of injuries and affronts and make us sit down contented with our share of the goods and easy under the ills of life which this quicksighted unassuming virtue will teach us often to trace to our own misconduct and consequently to interpret as the just and wholesome correction of heaven resignation resignation is that mild and heroic temper of mind which arises from a sense of an infinitely wise and good providence and enables one to acquiesce with a cordial affection in its just appointments this virtue has something very peculiar in its nature and sublime in its efficacy for it teaches us to bear ill not only with patience and as being unavoidable but it transforms as it were ill into good by leading us to consider it and every event that has the least appearance of ill as a divine dispensation a wise and benevolent temperament of things subservient to universal good and of course including that of every individual especially of such as calmly stoop to it in this light the administration itself nay every act of it becomes an object of affection the evil disappears or is converted into a balm which both heals and nourishes the mind for though the first expected access of ill may surprize the soul into grief yet that grief when the mind calmly reviews its object changes into contentment and is by degrees exalted into veneration and a divine composure our private will is lost in that of the almighty and our security against any real ill rests on the same bottom as the throne of him who lives and reigns for ever he therefore who is provided with such armour taken if we may say so from the armory of heaven may be proof against the sharpest arrows of fortune and defy the impotence of human malice and though he    cannot be secure against those ills which are the ordinary appendages of mans lot yet may possess that quiet contented mind which takes off their pungency and is next to an exemption from them but we can only touch on these things a fuller detail of our obligations to cultivate and pursue these moral goods of the mind and the best method of doing it must be reserved to another and more proper place chief good objective and formal before we finish this section it may be fit to observe that as the deity is the supreme and inexhausted source of good on whom the happiness of the whole creation depends as he is the object in nature and the only object who is fully proportioned to the intellectual and moral powers of the mind in whom they ultimately rest and find their most perfect exercise and completion he is therefore termed the chief good of man objectively considered and virtue or the proportioned and vigorous exercise of the several powers and affections on their respective objects as above described is in the schools termed the chief good formally considered or its formal idea being the inward temper and native constitution of human happiness from the detail we have gone thro the following corollaries may be deduced corollaries first it is evident that the happiness of such a progressive creature as man can never be at a stand or continue a fixed invariable thing his finite nature let it rise ever so high admits still higher degrees of improvement and perfection and his progression in improvement or virtue always makes way for a progression in happiness so that no possible point can be assigned in any period of his existence in which he is perfectly happy that is so happy as to exclude higher degrees of happiness all his perfection is only comparative   it appears that many things must conspire to complete the happiness of so various a creature as man subject to so many wants and susceptible of such different pleasures   as his capacities of pleasure cannot be all gratified at the same time and must often interfere with each other in such a precarious and fleeting state as human life or be frequently disappointed perfect happiness ie the undisturbed enjoyment of the several    pleasures of which we are capable is unattainable in our present state   that state is most to be sought after in which the fewest competitions and disappointments can happen which least of all impairs any sense of pleasure and opens an inexhausted source of the most refined and lasting enjoyments   that state which is attended with all those advantages is a state or course of virtue   therefore a state of virtue in which the moral goods of the mind are attained is the happiest state    section iii duties to society chapter i filial and fraternal duty as we have followed the order of nature in tracing the history of man and those duties which he owes to himself it seems reasonable to take the same method with those he owes to society which constitute the second class of his obligations connection of parents his parents are among the earliest objects of his attention he becomes soonest acquainted with them reposes a peculiar confidence in them and seems to regard them with a fond affection the early prognostics of his future piety and gratitude thus does nature dictate the first lines of filial duty even before a just sense of the connection is formed but when the child is grown up and has attained to such a degree of understanding as to comprehend the moral tye and be sensible of the obligations he is under to his parents when he looks back on their tender and disinterested affection their incessant cares and labours in nursing educating and providing for him during that state in which he had neither prudence nor strength to care and provide for himself he must be conscious that he owes to them these peculiar duties duties to parents to reverence and honour them as the instruments of nature in introducing him to life and to that state of comfort and happiness which  0 he enjoys and therefore to esteem and imitate their good qualities to alleviate and bear with and spread as much as possible a decent veil over their faults and weaknesses   to be highly grateful to them for those favours which it can hardly ever be in his power fully to repay to shew this gratitude by a strict attention to their wants and a solicitous care to supply them by a submissive deference to their authority and advice especially by paying great regard to it in the choice of a wife and of an occupation by yielding to rather than peevishly contending with their humours as remembering how oft they have been persecuted by his and in fine by soothing their cares lightening their sorrows supporting the infirmities of age and making the remainder of their life as comfortable and joyful as possible—to pay these honours and make these returns is according to plato to pay the oldest best and greatest of debts next to those we owe to our supreme and common parent they are founded in our nature and agreeable to the most fundamental laws of gratitude honour justice natural affection and piety which are interwoven with our very constitution nor can we be deficient in them without casting off that nature and counteracting those laws duties to brethren and sisters as his brethren and sisters are the next with whom the creature forms a social and moral connection to them he owes a fraternal regard and with them ought he to enter into a strict league of friendship mutual sympathy advice assistance and a generous intercourse of kind offices remembering their relation to common parents and that brotherhood of nature which unites them into a closer community of interest and affection    chapter ii concerning marriage connection with the other sex when man arrives to a certain age he becomes sensible of a peculiar sympathy and tenderness towards the other sex the charms of beauty engage his attention and call forth new and softer dispositions than he has yet felt the many amiable qualities exhibited by a fair outside or by the mild allurement of female manners or which the prejudiced spectator without much reasoning supposes those to include with several other circumstances both natural and accidental point his view and affection to a particular object and of course contract that general rambling regard which was lost and useless among the undistinguished croud into a peculiar and permanent attachment to one woman which ordinarily terminates in the most important venerable and delightful connection in life the grounds of this connection the state of the brute creation is very different from that of human creatures the former are cloathed and generally armed by their structure easily find what is necessary to their subsistence and soon attain their vigour and maturity so that they need the care and aid of their parents but for a short while and therefore we see that nature has assigned to them vagrant and transient amours the connection being purely natural and formed merely for propagating and rearing their offspring no sooner is that end answered than the connection dissolves of course but the human race are of a more tender and defenceless constitution their infancy and nonage continue longer they advance slowly to strength of body and maturity of reason they need constant attention and a long series of cares and labours to train them up to decency virtue and the various arts of life nature has therefore provided them with the most affectionate and anxious tutors to aid their weakness to supply their wants and to accomplish them in those necessary arts even their own parents on whom she has devolved this mighty charge rendered agreeable by the most alluring and powerful of all ties parental affection but unless both concur in    this grateful task and continue their joint labours till they have reared up and planted out their young colony it must become a prey to every rude invader and the purpose of nature in the original union of the human pair be defeated therefore our structure as well as condition is an evident indication that the human sexes are destined for a more intimate for a moral and lasting union it appears likewise that the principal end of marriage is not to propagate and nurse up an offspring but to educate and form minds for the great duties and extensive destinations of life society must be supplied from this original nursery with useful members and its fairest ornaments and supports but how shall the young plants be guarded against the inclemency of the air and seasons cultivated and raised to maturity if men like brutes indulge to vagrant and promiscuous amours moral ends of marriage the mind is apt to be dissipated in its views and acts of friendship and humanity unless the former be directed to a particular object and the latter employed in a particular province when men once indulge to this dissipation there is no stopping their career they grow insensible to moral attractions and by obstructing or impairing the decent and regular exercise of the tender and generous feelings of the human heart they in time become unqualified for or averse to the forming a moral union of souls which is the cement of society and the source of the purest domestic joys whereas a rational undepraved love and its fair companion marriage collect a mans views guide his heart to its proper object and by confining his affection to that object do really enlarge its influence and use besides it is but too evident from the conduct of mankind that the common tyes of humanity are too feeble to engage and interest the passions of the generality in the affairs of society the connections of neighbourhood acquaintance and general intercourse are too wide a field of action for many and those of a public or community are so for more and in which they either care not or know not how to exert themselves therefore nature ever wise and benevolent by implanting that strong sympathy which reigns between the individuals of each sex and by urging them to form a particular moral connection the spring of many domestic endearments    has measured out to each pair a particular sphere of action proportioned to their views and adapted to their respective capacities besides by interesting them deeply in the concerns of their own little circle she has connected them more closely with society which is composed of particular families and bound them down to their good behaviour in that particular community to which they belong this moral connection is marriage and this sphere of action is a family it appears from what has been said that to adult persons who have fortune sufficient to provide for a family according to their rank and condition in life and who are endued with the ordinary degrees of prudence necessary to manage a family and educate children it is a duty they owe to society to marry an objection answered some pretenders to a peculiar refinement in morals think however that a single state is most conducive to the perfection of our nature and to those sublime improvements to which religion calls us sometimes indeed the more important duties we owe to the public which could scarce be performed or not so well in the married state may require the single life or render the other not so honourable a station in such circumstances but surely it must be improving to the social affections to direct them to particular objects whom we esteem and to whom we stand in the nearest relation and to ascertain their exercise in a field of action which is both agreeable in itself and highly advantageous to society the constant exercise of natural affection in which one is necessarily engaged in providing for and training up ones children opens the heart and must inure the mind to frequent acts of selfdenial and selfcommand and consequently strengthen the habits of goodness the truth of this is but too evident in those married persons who are so unfortunate as to have no children who for want of those necessary exercises of humanity are too generally overanxious about the world and perhaps too attentive to the affair of oeconomy another circumstance deserves to be remembered that men who are continually engaged in study and business or anxiously intent on public concerns are apt to grow stern and severe or peevish and morose on account of the frequent rubs they meet with or the    fatigues they undergo in such a course the female softness is therefore useful to moderate their severity and change their illhumour into domestic tenderness and a softer kind of humanity and thus their minds which were overstrained by the intenseness of their application are at once relaxed and retuned for public action the minds of both sexes are as much formed one for the other by a temperament peculiar to each as their persons the strength firmness courage gravity and dignity of the man tally to the softness delicacy tenderness of passion elegance of taste and decency of conversation of the woman the male mind is formed to defend deliberate foresee contrive and advise the female one to confide imagine apprehend comply and execute therefore the proper temperament of these different sexes of minds makes a fine moral union and the wellproportioned opposition of different or contrary qualities like a due mixture of discords in a composition of music swells the harmony of society more than if they were all unisons to each other and this union of moral sexes if we may express it so is evidently more conducive to the improvement of each than if they lived apart for the man not only protects and advises but communicates vigour and resolution to the woman she in her turn softens refines and polishes him in her society he finds repose from action and care in her friendship the ferment into which his passions were wrought by the hurry and distraction of public life subsides and settles into a calm and a thousand nameless graces and decencies that flow from her words and actions form him for a more mild and elegant deportment his conversation and example on the other hand enlarge her views raise her sentiments sustain her resolutions and free her from a thousand fears and inquietudes to which her more feeble constitution subjects her surely such dispositions and the happy consequences which result from them cannot be supposed to carry an unfriendly aspect to any duty he owes either to god or to man duties of marriage of the conjugal alliance the following are the natural laws first mutual fidelity to the marriagebed disloyalty defeats the very end of marriage dissolves the natural cement of the relation weakens the    moral tye the chief strength of which lies in the reciprocation of affection and by making the offspring uncertain diminishes the care and attachment necessary to their education   a conspiration of counsels and endeavours to promote the common interest of the family and to educate their common offspring in order to observe these laws it is necessary to cultivate both before and during the married state the strictest decency and chastity of manners and a just sense of what becomes their respective characters   the union must be inviolable and for life the nature of friendship and particularly of this species of it the education of their offspring and the order of society and of successions which would otherwise be extremely perplexed do all seem to require it to preserve this union and render the matrimonial state more harmonious and comfortable a mutual esteem and tenderness a mutual deference and forbearance a communication of advice and assistance and authority are absolutely necessary if either party keep within their proper departments there need be no disputes about power or superiority and there will be none they have no opposite no separate interests and therefore there can be no just ground for opposition of conduct polygamy from this detail and the present state of things in which there is pretty near a parity of numbers of both sexes it is evident that polygamy is an unnatural state and tho it should be granted to be more fruitful of children which however it is not found to be yet it is by no means so fit for rearing minds which seems to be as much if not more the intention of nature than the propagation of bodies divorce c in what cases divorce may be proper what are the just obstacles to marriage and within what degrees of consanguinity it may be allowed we have not room to discuss here and therefore we refer the reader to mr hutchinsons ingenious moral compend book iii chap       chapter iii of parental duty connection of parents and children the connection of parents with their children is a natural consequence of the matrimonial connection and the duties which they owe them result as naturally from that connection the feeble state of children subject to so many wants and dangers requires their incessant cares and attention their ignorant and uncultivated minds demand their continual instruction and culture had human creatures come into the world with the full strength of men and the weakness of reason and vehemence of passions which prevail in children they would have been too strong or too stubborn to have submitted to the government and instruction of their parents but as they were designed for a progression in knowledge and virtue it was proper that the growth of their bodies should keep pace with that of their minds lest the purposes of that progression should have been defeated among other admirable purposes which this gradual expansion of their outward as well as inward structure serves this is one that it affords ample scope to the exercise of many tender and generous affections which fill up the domestic life with a beautiful variety of duties and enjoyments and are of course a noble discipline for the heart and an hardy kind of education for the more honourable and important duties of public life the authority founded on that connection the abovementioned weak and ignorant state of children seems plainly to invest their parents with such authority and power as is necessary to their support protection and education but that authority and power can be construed to extend no farther than is necessary to answer those ends and to last no longer than that weakness and ignorance continue wherefore the foundation or reason of the authority and power ceasing they cease of course whatever power or authority then it may be necessary or lawful for parents to exercise during the nonage of their children to assume or usurp the same when they have attained the maturity or full exercise of their strength and reason would be tyrannical and unjust from hence it is evident that parents    have no right to punish the persons of their children more severely than the nature of their wardship requires much less to invade their lives to encroach upon their liberty or transfer them as their property to any master whatsoever but if any parent should be so unjust and inhuman as to consider and treat them like his other goods and chattles surely whenever they dare they may resist and whenever they can shake off that inhuman and unnatural yoke and be free with that liberty with which god and nature has invested them duties of parents the first class of duties which parents owe their children respect their natural life and these comprehend protection nurture provision introducing them into the world in a manner suitable to their rank and fortune and the like education the second order of duties regards the intellectual and moral life of their children or their education in such arts and accomplishments as are necessary to qualify them for performing the duties they owe to themselves and to others as this was found to be the principal design of the matrimonial alliance so the fulfilling that design is the most important and dignified of all the parental duties in order therefore to fit the child for acting his part wisely and worthily as a man as a citizen and a creature of god both parents ought to combine their joint wisdom authority and power and each apart to employ those talents which are the peculiar excellency and ornament of their respective sex the father ought to lay out and superintend their education the mother to execute and manage the detail of which she is capable the former should direct the manly exertion of the intellectual and moral powers of the child his imagination and the manner of those exertions are the peculiar province of the latter the former should advise protect command and by his experience masculine vigour and that superior authority which is commonly ascribed to his sex brace and strengthen his pupil for active life for gravity integrity and firmness in suffering the business of the latter is to bend and soften her male pupil by the charms of her conversation and the softness and decency of her manners for social life for politeness of taste and the    elegant decorums of and enjoyments of humanity and to improve and refine the tenderness and modesty of her female pupil and form her to all those mild domestic virtues which are the peculiar characteristics and ornaments of her sex   delightful task to rear the tender thought   to teach the fair idea how to shoot   to breathe th enlivning spirit and to fix   the generous purpose in the glowing breast  to conduct the opening minds of their sweet charge through the several periods of their progress to assist them in each period in throwing out the latent seeds of reason and ingenuity and in gaining fresh accessions of light and virtue and at length with all these advantages to produce the young adventurers upon the great theatre of human life to play their several parts in the sight of their friends of society and mankind how gloriously does heaven reward the task when the parents behold those dear images and representatives of themselves inheriting their virtues as well as fortunes sustaining their respective characters gracefully and worthily and giving them the agreeable prospect of transmitting their name with growing honour and advantage to a race yet unborn chapter iv herile and servile duty the ground of this connection in the natural course of human affairs it must necessarily happen that some of mankind will live in plenty and opulence and others be reduced to a state of indigence and poverty the former need the labours of the latter and the latter the provision and support of the former this mutual necessity is the foundation of that connection    whether we call it moral or civil which subsists between masters and servants the conditions of service  he who feeds another has a right to some equivalent the labour of him whom he maintains and the fruits of it and he who labours for another has a right to expect that he should support him but as the labours of a man of ordinary strength are certainly of greater value than mere food and cloathing because they would actually produce more even the maintenance of a family were the labourer to employ them in his own behalf therefore he has an undoubted right to rate and dispose of his service for certain wages above mere maintenance and if he has incautiously disposed of it for the latter only yet the contract being of the onerous kind he may equitably claim a supply of that deficiency if the service be specified the servant is bound to that only if not then he is to be construed as bound only to such services as are consistent with the laws of justice and humanity by the voluntary servitude to which he subjects himself he forfeits no rights but such as are necessarily included in that servitude and is obnoxious to no punishment but such as a voluntary failure in the service may be supposed reasonably to require the offspring of such servants have a right to that liberty which neither they nor their parents have forfeited the case of great offenders as to those who because of some heinous offence or for some notorious damage for which they cannot otherwise compensate are condemned to perpetual service they do not on that account forfeit all the rights of men but those the loss of which is necessary to secure society against the like offences for the future or to repair the damage they have done the case of captives with regard to captives taken in war it is barbarous and inhuman to make perpetual slaves of them unless some peculiar and aggravated circumstances of guilt have attended their hostility the bulk of the subjects of any government engaged in war may be fairly esteemed innocent enemies and therefore they have a right to that clemency which is consistent with the common safety of mankind and the particular security of that society against which they are engaged though  0 ordinary captives have a grant of their lives yet to pay their liberty as an equivalent is much too high a price there are other ways of acknowledging or returning the favour than by surrendering what is far dearer than life itself to those who under pretext of the necessities of commerce drive the unnatural trade of bargaining for human flesh and consigning their innocent but unfortunate fellowcreatures to eternal servitude and misery we may address the words of a fine writer let avarice defend it as it will there is an honest reluctance in humanity against buying and selling and regarding those of our own species as our wealth and possessions as it is the servants duty to serve his master with fidelity and chearfulness like one who knows he is accountable to the great lord of the universe so the master ought to exact nothing of his servant beyond the natural limits of reason and humanity remembering that he is a brother of the same family a partner of the same nature and a subject of the same great lord chapter v social duties of the private kind hitherto we have considered only the domestic oeconomical duties because these are the first in the progress of nature but as man passes beyond the little circle of a family he forms connections with relations friends neighbours and others from whence results a new train of duties of the more private social kind as friendship chastity courtesy goodneighbourhood charity forgiveness hospitality mans aptitude for society man is admirably formed for particular social attachments and duties there is a peculiar and strong propensity in his nature to be affected with the sentiments and dispositions of others men like certain musical instruments are set to each other so that the vibrations or notes    excited in one raise correspondent notes and vibrations in the others the impulses of pleasure or pain joy or sorrow made on one mind are by an instantaneous sympathy of nature communicated in some degree to all especially when hearts are as an humane writer expresses it in unison of kindness the joy that vibrates in one communicates to the other also we may add that tho joy thus imparted swells the harmony yet grief vibrated to the heart of a friend and rebounding from thence in sympathetic notes melts as it were and almost dies away all the passions but especially those of the social kind are contagious and when the passions of one man mingle with those of another they increase and multiply prodigiously there is a most moving eloquence in the human countenance air voice and gesture wonderfully expressive of the most latent feelings and passions of the soul which darts them like a subtle flame into the hearts of others and raises correspondent feelings there friendship love goodhumour joy spread through every feature and particularly shoot from the eyes their softer and fiercer fires with an irresistible energy and in like manner the opposite passions of hatred enmity illhumour melancholy diffuse a sullen and saddening air over the face and flashing from eye to eye kindle a train of similar passions by these and other admirable pieces of machinery men are formed for society and the delightful interchange of friendly sentiments and duties to increase the happiness of others by participation and their own by rebound and to diminish by dividing the common stock of their misery duties arising from private relation the first emanations of the social principle beyond the bounds of a family lead us to form a nearer conjunction of friendship or goodwill with those who are any wise connected with us by blood or domestic alliance to them our affection does commonly exert itself in a greater or less degree according to the nearness or distance of the relation and this proportion is admirably suited to the extent of our powers and the indigence of our state for it is only within those lesser circles of consanguinity or alliance that the generality of mankind are able to display their abilities or benevolence and consequently to uphold their connection with society and subserviency to a public interest    therefore it is our duty to regard these closer connections as the next department to that of a family in which nature has marked out for us a sphere of activity and usefulness and to cultivate the kind affections which are the cement of those endearing alliances ingredients of friendship frequently the view of distinguishing moral qualities in some of our acquaintance may give birth to that more noble connection we call friendship which is far superior to the alliances of consanguinity for these are of a superficial and often of a transitory nature of which as they hold more of instinct than of reason we cannot give such a rational account but friendship derives all its strength and beauty and the only existence which is durable from the qualities of the heart or from virtuous and lovely dispositions or should these be wanting they or some shadow of them must be supposed present therefore friendship may be described to be the union of two souls by means of virtue the common object and cement of their mutual affection without virtue or the supposition of it friendship is only a mercenary league an alliance of interest which must dissolve of course when that interest decays or subsists no longer it is not so much any particular passion as a composition of some of the noblest feelings and passions of the mind good sense a just taste and love of virtue a thorough candor and benignity of heart or what we usually call a good temper and a generous sympathy of sentiments and affections are the necessary ingredients of this virtuous connection when it is grafted on esteem strengthened by habit and mellowed by time it yields infinite pleasure ever new and ever growing is a noble support amidst the various trials and vicissitudes of life and an high seasoning to most of our other enjoyments to form and cultivate virtuous friendship must be very improving to the temper as its principal object is virtue set off with all the allurement of countenance air and manners shining forth in the native graces of manly honest sentiments and affections and rendered visible as it were to the friendly spectator in a conduct unaffectedly great and good and as its principal exercises are the very energies of virtue or its effects or emanations so that wherever this amiable attachment prevails it will exalt our admiration and    attachment to virtue and unless impeded in its course by unnatural prejudices run out into a friendship to the human race for as no one can merit and none ought to usurp the sacred name of a friend who hates mankind so whoever truly loves them possesses the most essential quality of a true friend its duties the duties of friendship are a mutual esteem of each other unbribed by interest and independent of it a generous confidence as far distant from suspicion as from reserve an inviolable harmony of sentiments and dispositions of designs and interests a fidelity unshaken by the changes of fortune a constancy unalterable by distance of time or place a resignation of ones personal interests to those of ones friend and a reciprocal unenvious unreserved exchange of kind offices—but amidst all the exertions of this moral connection humane and generous as it is we must remember that it operates within a narrow sphere and its immediate operations respect only the individual and therefore its particular impulses must still be subordinate to a more public interest or be always directed and controuled by the more extensive connections of our nature love and chastity when our friendship terminates on any of the other sex in whom beauty or agreeableness of person and external gracefulness of manners conspire to express and heighten the moral charm of a tender honest heart and sweet ingenious modest temper lighted up by good sense it generally grows into a more soft and endearing attachment when this attachment is improved by a growing acquaintance with the worth of its object is conducted by discretion and issues at length as it ought to do in the moral connection formerly mentioned it becomes the source of many amiable duties of a communication of passions and interests of the most refined decencies and of a thousand nameless deepfelt joys of reciprocal tenderness and love flowing from every look word and action here friendship acts with double energy and the natural conspires with the moral    charm to strengthen and secure the love of virtue as the delicate nature of female honour and decorum and the inexpressible grace of a chaste and modest behaviour are the surest and indeed the only means of kindling at first and ever after of keeping alive this tender and elegant flame and of accomplishing the excellent ends designed by it to attempt by fraud to violate one or under pretence of passion to sully and corrupt the other and by so doing to expose the too often credulous and unguarded object with a wanton cruelty to the hatred of her own sex and the scorn of ours and to the lowest infamy of both is a conduct not only base and criminal but inconsistent with that truly rational and refined enjoyment the spirit and quintessence of which is derived from the bashful and sacred charms of virtue kept untainted and therefore ever alluring to the lovers heart courtesy goodneighbourhood c courtesy goodneighbourhood affability and the like duties which are founded on our private social connections are no less necessary and obligatory to creatures united in society and supporting and supported by each other in a chain of mutual want and dependence they do not consist in a smooth address an artificial or obsequious air fawning adulations or a polite servility of manners but in a just and modest sense of our own dignity and that of others and of the reverence due to mankind especially to those who hold the highest links of the social chain in a discreet and manly accommodation of ourselves to the foibles and humours of others in a strict observance of the rules of decorum and civility but above all in a frank obliging carriage and generous interchange of good deeds rather than words such a conduct is of great use and advantage as it is an excellent security against injury and the best claim and recommendation to the esteem civility and universal respect of mankind this inferior order of virtues unite the particular members of society more closely and form the lesser pillars of the civil fabric which in many instances supply the unavoidable defects of laws and maintain the harmony and decorum of social intercourse where the more important and essential lines of virtue are wanting    charity forgiveness charity and forgiveness are truly amiable and useful duties of the social kind there is a twofold distinction of rights commonly taken notice of by moral writers viz perfect and imperfect to fulfil the former is necessary to the being and support of society to fulfil the latter is a duty equally sacred and obligatory and tends to the improvement and prosperity of society but as the violation of them is not equally prejudicial to the public good the fulfilling them is not subjected to the cognizance of law but left to the candor humanity and gratitude of individuals and by this means ample scope is given to exercise all the generosity and display the genuine merit and lustre of virtue thus the wants and misfortunes of others call for our charitable assistance and seasonable supplies and the good man unconstrained by law and uncontrouled by human authority will chearfully acknowledge and generously satisfy this mournful and moving claim a claim supported by the sanction of heaven of whose bounties he is honoured to be the grateful trustee if his own perfect rights are invaded by the injustice of others he will not therefore reject their imperfect right to pity and forgiveness unless his grant of these should be inconsistent with the more extensive rights of society or the public good in that case he will have recourse to public justice and the laws and even then he will prosecute the injury with no unnecessary severity but rather with mildness and humanity when the injury is merely personal and of such a nature as to admit of alleviations and the forgiveness of which would be attended with no worse consequences especially of a public kind the good man will generously forgive his offending brother and it is his duty to do so and not to take private revenge or retaliate evil for evil for though resentment of injury is a natural passion and implanted as was observed above for wise and good ends yet considering the manifold partialities which most men have for themselves was every one to act as judge in his own cause and to execute the sentence dictated by his own resentment it is but    too evident that mankind would pass all bounds in their fury and the last sufferer be provoked in his turn to make full reprisals so that evil thus encountering with evil would produce one continued series of violence and misery and render society intolerable if not impracticable therefore when the security of the individual or good of the public does not require a proportionable retaliation it is agreeable to the general law of benevolence and to the particular end of the passion which is to prevent injury and the misery occasioned by it to forgive personal injuries or not to return evil for evil this duty is one of the noble refinements which christianity has made upon the general maxims and practice of mankind and enforced with a peculiar strength and beauty by sanctions no less alluring than awful and indeed the practice of it is generally its own reward by expelling from the mind the most dreadful intruders upon its repose those rancorous passions which are begot and nursed by resentment and by disarming and even subduing every enemy one has except such as have nothing left of men but the outward form hospitality the most enlarged and humane connection of the private kind seems to be the hospitable alliance from which flow the amiable and disinterested duties we owe to strangers if the exercise of passions of the most private and instinctive kind is beheld with moral approbation and delight how lovely and venerable must those appear which result from a calm philanthropy are founded in the common rights and connections of society and embrace men not of a particular sect party or nation but all in general without distinction and without any of the little partialities of selflove    chapter vi social duties of the commercial kind commercial duties the next order of connections are those which arise from the wants and weakness of mankind and from the various circumstances in which their different situations place them these we may call commercial connections and the duties which result from them commercial duties as justice fairdealing sincerity fidelity to compacts and the like their foundation it is observed somewhere by a writer of the first rank that though nature is perfect in all her works yet she has observed a manifest and eminent distinction among them to all such as lie beyond the reach of human skill and power and are properly of her own department she has given the finishing hand these man may design after and imitate but he can never rival them nor add to their beauty or perfection such are the forms and structure of vegetables animals and many of their productions as the honeycomb the spiders web and the like there are others of her works which she has of design left unfinished as it were in order to exercise the ingenuity and power of man she has presented to him a rich profusion of materials of every kind for his conveniency and use but they are rude and unpolished or not to be come at without art and labour these therefore he must apply in order to adapt them to his use and to enjoy them in perfection thus nature has given him an infinite variety of herbs grain fossils minerals wood water earth air and a thousand other crude materials to supply his numerous wants but he must sow plant dig refine polish build and in short manufacture the various produce of nature in order to obtain even the necessaries and much more the conveniencies and elegancies of life these then are the price of his labour and industry and without that nature will sell him nothing but as    the wants of mankind are many and the single strength of individuals small they could hardly find the necessaries and much less the conveniencies of life without uniting their ingenuity and strength in acquiring these and without a mutual intercourse of good offices some men are better formed for some kinds of ingenuity and labour and others for other kinds and different soils and climates are enriched with different productions so that men by exchanging the produce of their respective labours and supplying the wants of one country with the superfluities of another do in effect diminish the labours of each and increase the abundance of all this is the foundation of all commerce or exchange of commodities and goods one with another in order to facilitate which men have contrived different species of coin or money as a common standard by which to estimate the comparative values of their respective goods but to render commerce sure and effectual justice fairdealing sincerity and fidelity to compacts are absolutely necessary justice c justice or fairdealing or in other words a disposition to treat others as we would be treated by them is a virtue of the first importance and inseparable from the virtuous character it is the cement of society or that pervading spirit which connects its members inspires its various relations and maintains the order and subordination of each part to the whole without it society would become a den of thieves and banditti hating and hated devouring and devoured by one another sincerity sincerity or veracity in our words and actions is another virtue or duty of great importance to society being one of the great bands of mutual intercourse and the foundation of mutual trust without it society would be the dominion of mistrust jealousy and fraud and conversation a traffic of lies and dissimulation it includes in it a conformity of words with our sentiments a correspondence between our actions and dispositions a strict regard to truth and an irreconcileable abhorrence of falsehood it does not indeed require that we expose our sentiments indiscreetly or tell all the truth in every case but certainly it does not and cannot admit the least violation of truth    or contradiction to our sentiments for if these bounds are once passed no possible limit can be assigned where the violation shall stop and no pretence of private or public good can possibly counterbalance the ill consequences of such a violation and we trust the order of nature and providence is such that it seldom or never falls out that so valuable a sacrifice must be made in order to obtain the ends of an extensive benevolence it belongs to us to do what appears right and conformable to the laws of our nature and to leave heaven to direct and overrule events or consequences which it will never fail to do for the best fidelity to promises compacts c fidelity to promises compacts and engagements is likewise a duty of such importance to the security of commerce and interchange of benevolence among mankind that society would soon grow intolerable without the strict observance of it hobbes and others who follow the same track have taken a wonderful deal of pains to puzzle this subject and to make all the virtues of this sort merely artificial and not at all obligatory antecedent to human conventions no doubt compacts suppose people who make them and promises persons to whom they are made and therefore both suppose some society more or less between those who enter into these mutual engagements but is not a compact or promise binding till men have agreed that they shall be binding or are they only binding because it is our interest to be bound by them or to fulfil them do not we highly approve the man who fulfils them even tho they should prove to be against his interest and do not we condemn him as a knave who violates them on that account a promise is a voluntary declaration by words or by an action equally significant of our resolution to do something in behalf of another or for his service when it is made the person who makes it is by all supposed under an obligation to perform it and he to whom it is made may demand the performance as his right that perception of obligation is a simple idea and is on the same footing as our other moral perceptions which may be described by instances but cannot be defined whether we have a perception of such obligation quite distinct from the interest either public or private that may accompany  00 the fulfilment of it must be referred to the conscience of every individual and whether the mere sense of that obligation apart from its concomitants is not a sufficient inducement or motive to keep ones promise without having recourse to any selfish principle of our nature must be likewise appealed to the conscience of every honest man fairdealing and fidelity to compacts require that we take no advantage of the ignorance passion or incapacity of others from whatever cause that incapacity arises—that we be explicit and candid in making bargains just and faithful in fulfilling our part of them and if the other party violates his engagements redress is to be sought for from the laws or from those who are intrusted with the execution of them in fine the commercial virtues and duties require that we not only do not invade but maintain the rights of others—that we be fair and impartial in transferring bartering or exchanging property whether in goods or service and be inviolably faithful to our word and our engagements where the matter of them is not criminal and where they are not extorted by force—but on this the designed brevity of the work will not permit us farther to insist chapter vii social duties of the political kind we are now arrived at the last and highest order of duties respecting society which result from the exercise of the most generous and heroic affections and are founded on our most enlarged connections political connections the social principle in man is of such an expansive nature that it cannot be confined within the circuit of a family of friends or a neighbourhood it spreads into wider systems and draws men into larger confederacies communities and commonwealths—it is in these only that the higher powers of our nature attain the highest improvement and perfection of which they are capable these principles hardly find objects in the solitary state of nature there the principle of action rises no higher at farthest than natural affection towards ones offspring  0  there personal or family wants entirely engross the creatures attention and labour and allow no leisure or if they did no exercise for views and affections of a more enlarged kind in solitude all are employed in the same way in providing for the animal life and even after their utmost labour and care single and unaided by the industry of others they find but a sorry supply of their wants and a feeble precarious security against dangers from wild beasts from inclement skies and seasons from the mistakes or petulant passions of their fellowcreatures from their preference of themselves to their neighbours and from all the little exorbitances of selflove but in society the mutual aids which men give and receive shorten the labours of each and the combined strength and reason of individuals give security and protection to the whole body there is both a variety and subordination of genius among mankind some are formed to lead and direct others to contrive plans of happiness for individuals and of government for communities to take in a public interest invent laws and arts and superintend their execution and in short to refine and civilize human life others who have not such good heads may have as honest hearts a truly public spirit love of liberty hatred of corruption and tyranny a generous submission to laws order and public institutions and an extensive philanthropy and others who have none of those capacities either of heart or head may be wellformed for manual exercises and bodily labour the former of these principles have no scope in solitude where a mans thoughts and concerns do all either center in himself or extend no farther than a family into which little circle all the duty and virtue of the solitary mortal is crouded but society finds proper objects and exercises for every genius and the noblest objects and exercises for the noblest geniuses and for the highest principles in the human constitution particularly for that warmest and most divine passion which god hath kindled in our bosoms the inclination of doing good and reverencing our nature which may find here both employment and the most exquisite satisfaction in society a man has not only more leisure but better opportunities of applying his talents with much greater perfection and success especially as he is furnished with the joint advice and  0  assistance of his fellowcreatures who are now more closely united one with the other and sustain a common relation to the same moral system or community this then is an object proportioned to his most enlarged social affections and in serving it he finds scope for the exercise and refinement of his highest intellectual and moral powers therefore society or a state of civil government rests on these two principal pillars that in it we find security against those evils which are unavoidable in solitude—and obtain those goods some of which cannot be obtained at all and others not so well in that state where men depend solely on their individual sagacity and industry from this short detail it appears that man is a social creature and formed for a social state and that society being adapted to the higher principles and destinations of his nature must of necessity be his natural state political duties the duties suited to that state and resulting from those principles and destinations or in other words from our social passions and social connections or relation to a public system are love of our country resignation and obedience to the laws public spirit love of liberty sacrifice of life and all to the public and the like love of ones country love of our country is one of the noblest passions that can warm and animate the human breast it includes all the limited and particular affections to our parents children friends neighbours fellowcitizens countrymen it ought to direct and limit their more confined and partial action within their proper and natural bounds and never let them encroach on those sacred and first regards we owe to the great public to which we belong were we solitary creatures detached from the rest of mankind and without any capacity of comprehending a public interest or without affections leading us to desire and pursue it it would not be our duty to mind it nor criminal to neglect it but as we are parts of the public system and are not only capable of taking in large views of its interests but by the strongest affections connected with it and prompted to take a share of its concerns we are under the most sacred ties to prosecute its security and welfare with the utmost  0  ardor especially in times of public trial this love of our country does not import an attachment to any particular soil climate or spot of earth where perhaps we first drew our breath though those natural ideas are often associated with the moral ones and like external signs or symbols help to ascertain and bind them but it imports an affection to that moral system or community which is governed by the same laws and magistrates and whose several parts are variously connected one with the other and all united upon the bottom of a common interest perhaps indeed every member of the community cannot comprehend so large an object especially if it extends through large provinces and over vast tracts of land and still less can he form such an idea if there is no public ie if all are subjected to the caprice and unlimited will of one man but the preference the generality shew to their native country the concern and longing after it which they express when they have been long absent from it the labours they undertake and sufferings they endure to save or serve it and the peculiar attachment they have to their countrymen evidently demonstrate that the passion is natural and never fails to exert itself when it is fairly disengaged from foreign clogs and is directed to its proper object wherever it prevails in its genuine vigour and extent it swallows up all sordid and selfish regards it conquers the love of ease power pleasure and wealth nay when the amiable partialities of friendship gratitude private affection or regards to a family come in competition with it it will teach us bravely to sacrifice all in order to maintain the rights and promote or defend the honour and happiness of our country resignation and obedience to the laws c resignation and obedience to the laws and orders of the society to which we belong are political duties necessary to its very being and security without which it must soon degenerate into a state of licence and anarchy the welfare nay the nature of civil society requires that there should be a subordination of orders or diversity of ranks and conditions in it—that certain men or orders of men be appointed to superintend and manage such affairs as concern the public safety and happiness—that all have their particular provinces assigned  0  them—that such a subordination be settled among them as none of them may interfere with another—and finally that certain rules or common measures of action be agreed on by which each is to discharge his respective duty to govern or be governed and all may concur in securing the order and promoting the felicity of the whole political body those rules of action are the laws of the community and those different orders are the several officers or magistrates appointed by the public to explain them and superintend or assist in their execution in consequence of this settlement of things it is the duty of each individual to obey the laws enacted to submit to the executors of them with all due deference and homage according to their respective ranks and dignity as to the keepers of the public peace and the guardians of public liberty to maintain his own rank and perform the functions of his own station with diligence fidelity and incorruption the superiority of the higher orders or the authority with which the state has invested them entitle them especially if they employ their authority well to the obedience and submission of the lower and to a proportionable honour and respect from all the subordination of the lower ranks claims protection defence and security from the higher and the laws being superior to all require the obedience and submission of all being the last resort beyond which there is no decision or appeal—besides these natural and stated subordinations in society there are others accidental and artificial the opulent and indigent the great and the vulgar the ingenious and prudent and those who are less so the opulent are to administer to the necessities of the indigent and the indigent to return the fruits of their labours to the opulent the great ought to defend and patronize their dependents and inferiors and they in their turn to return their combined strength and assistance to the great the prudent should improve the ingenuities of the mind for the benefit of the industrious and the industrious lend the dexterities of their strength for the advantage of the prudent foundation of public spirit love of liberty c public spirit heroic zeal love of liberty and the other political duties do above all others recommend those who practise them to the admiration and homage of mankind because as they are the offspring  0  of the noblest minds so are they the parents of the greatest blessings to society yet exalted as they are it is only in equal and free governments where they can be exercised and have their due effect for there only does a true public prevail and there only is the public good made the standard of the civil constitution as the end of society is the common interest and welfare of the people associated this end must of necessity be the supreme law or common standard by which the particular rules of action of the several members of the society towards each other are to be regulated but a common interest can be no other than that which is the result of the common reason or common feelings of all private men or a particular order of men have interests and feelings peculiar to themselves and of which they may be good judges but these may be separate from and often contrary to the interests and feelings of the rest of the society and therefore they can have no right to make and much less to impose laws on their fellowcitizens inconsistent with and opposite to those interests and those feelings therefore a society a government or real public truly worthy the name and not a confederacy of banditti a clan of lawless savages or a band of slaves under the whip of a master must be such a one as consists of freemen chusing or consenting to laws themselves or since it often happens that they cannot assemble and act in a collective body delegating a sufficient number of representatives ie such a number as shall most fully comprehend and most equally represent their common feelings and common interests to digest and vote laws for the conduct and controul of the whole body the most agreeable to those common feelings and common interests political duties of every citizen a society thus constituted by common reason and formed on the plan of a common interest becomes immediately an object of public attention public veneration public obedience a public and inviolable attachment which ought neither to be seduced by bribes nor awed by terrors an object in fine of all those extensive and important duties which arise from so glorious a confederacy to watch over such a system to contribute all he can to promote its good by his reason his ingenuity his strength and every other ability whether natural or acquired  0  to resist and to the utmost of his power defeat every incroachment upon it whether carried on by secret corruption or open violence and to sacrifice his ease his wealth his power nay life itself and what is dearer still his family and friends to defend or save it is the duty the honour the interest and the happiness of every citizen it will make him venerable and beloved while he lives be lamented and honoured if he falls in so glorious a cause and transmit his name with immortal renown to the latest posterity of the people as the people are the fountain of power and authority the original seat of majesty the authors of laws and the creators of officers to execute them if they shall find the power they have conferred abused by their trustees their majesty violated by tyranny or by usurpation their authority prostituted to support violence or screen corruption the laws grown pernicious through accidents unforeseen or unavoidable or rendered ineffectual thro the infidelity and corruption of the executors of them then it is their right and what is their right is their duty to resume that delegated power and call their trustees to an account to resist the usurpation and extirpate the tyranny to restore their sullied majesty and prostituted authority to suspend alter or abrogate those laws and punish their unfaithful and corrupt officers nor is it the duty only of the united body but every member of it ought according to his respective rank power and weight in the community to concur in advancing and supporting those glorious designs of britons the obligations of every briton to fulfil the political duties receive a vast accession of strength when he calls to mind of what a noble and wellbalanced constitution of government he has the honour to partake a constitution founded on common reason common consent and common good a constitution of free and equal laws secured against arbitrary will and popular licence by an admirable temperament of the governing powers controuling and controuled by one another how must every one who has tolerable understanding to observe or tolerable honesty to acknowledge its happy effects venerate and love  0  a constitution in which the majesty of the people is and has been frequently recognized in which kings are made and unmade by the choice of the people laws enacted or annulled only by their own consent and for their own good in which none can be deprived of their property abridged of their freedom or forfeit their lives without an appeal to the laws and the verdict of their peers or equals a constitution in fine the nurse of heroes the parent of liberty the patron of learning and arts the dominion of laws the pride of britain the envy of her neighbours and their sanctuary too—how dissolute and execrable must their character and conduct be who instead of sacrificing their interest and ambition will not part with the least degree of either to preserve inviolate and entail in full vigour to their posterity such a glorious constitution the labour of so many ages and price of so much blood and treasure but would chuse rather to sacrifice it and all their own independency freedom and dignity to personal power and hollow grandeur to any little pageant of a king who should prefer being the master of slaves to being the guardian of freemen and consider himself as the proprietor not the father of his people—but words cannot express the selfishness and servility of those men and as little the public and heroic spirit of such if any such there are as have virtue enough still left to stem the torrent of corruption and guard our sacred constitution against the profligacy and prostitution of the corruptors and the corrupted  0  section iv duty to god divine connections of all the relations which the human mind sustains that which subsists between the creator and his creatures the supreme lawgiver and his subjects is the highest and the best this relation arises from the nature of a creature in general and the constitution of the human mind in particular the noblest powers and affections of which point to an universal mind and would be imperfect and abortive without such a direction how lame then must that system of morals be which leaves a deity out of the question how disconsolate and how destitute of its firmest support existence of god it does not appear from any true history or experience of the minds progress that any man by any formal deduction of his discursive powers ever reasoned himself into the belief of a god whether such a belief is only some natural anticipation of soul or is derived from father to son and from one man to another in the way of tradition or is suggested to us in consequence of an immutable law of our nature on beholding the august aspect and beautiful order of the universe we will not pretend to determine what seems most agreeable to experience is that a sense of its beauty and grandeur and the admirable fitness of one thing to another in its vast apparatus leads the mind necessarily and unavoidably to a perception of design or of a designing cause the origin of all by a progress as simple and natural as that by which a beautiful picture or a fine building suggests to us the idea of an excellent artist for it seems to hold universally true that wherever  0  we discern a tendency or cooperation of things towards a certain end or producing a common effect there by a necessary law of association we apprehend design a designing energy or cause no matter whether the objects are natural or artificial still that suggestion is unavoidable and the connection between the effect and its adequate cause obtrudes itself on the mind and it requires no nice search or elaborate deduction of reason to trace or prove that connection we are particularly satisfied of its truth in the subject before us by a kind of direct intuition and we do not seem to attend to the maxim we learn in schools that there cannot be an infinite series of causes and effects producing and produced by one another nor do we feel a great accession of light and conviction after we have learned it we are conscious of our existence of thought sentiment and passion and sensible withal that these came not of ourselves therefore we immediately recognize a parentmind an original intelligence from whom we borrowed those little portions of thought and activity and while we not only feel kind affections in ourselves and discover them in others but likewise behold all round us such a number and variety of creatures endued with natures nicely adjusted to their several stations and oeconomies supporting and supported by each other and all sustained by a common order of things and sharing different degrees of happiness according to their respective capacities we are naturally and necessarily led up to the father of such a numerous offspring the fountain of such widespread happiness as we conceive this being before all above all and greater than all we naturally and without reasoning ascribe to him every kind of perfection wisdom power and goodness without bounds existing through all time and pervading all space his relation to the human mind  we apply to him those glorious epithets of our creator preserver benefactor the supreme lord and lawgiver of the whole society of rational intelligent creatures—not only the imperfections and wants of our being and condition but some of the noblest instincts and affections of our minds connect us with this great and universal nature the mind in its progress from object to object from one character and prospect of beauty to another finds some blemish or deficiency in each and soon exhausts or grows weary and dissatisfied with its subject it sees no character   0 of excellency among men equal to that pitch of esteem which it is capable of exerting no object within the compass of human things adequate to the strength of its affection nor can it stop any where in this selfexpansive progress or find repose after its highest flights till it arrives at a being of unbounded greatness and worth on whom it may employ its sublimest powers without exhausting the subject and give scope to the utmost force and fulness of its love without satiety or disgust so that the nature of this being corresponds to the nature of man nor can his intelligent and moral powers obtain their entire end but on the supposition of such a being and without a real sympathy and communication with him the native propensity of the mind to reverence whatever is great and wonderful in nature finds a proper object of homage in him who spread out the heavens and the earth and who sustains and governs the whole of things the admiration of beauty the love of order and the complacency we feel in goodness must rise to the highest pitch and attain the full vigour and joy of their operations when they unite in him who is the sum and source of all perfection immorality of impiety it is evident from the slightest survey of morals that how punctual soever one may be in performing the duties which result from our relations to mankind yet to be quite deficient in performing those which arise from our relation to the almighty must argue a strange perversion of reason or depravity of heart if imperfect degrees of worth attract our veneration and if the want of it would imply an insensibility or which is worse an aversion to merit what lameness of affection and immorality of character must it be to be unaffected with and much more to be illaffected to a being of superlative worth to love society or particular members of it and yet to have no sense of our connection with its head no affection to our common parent and benefactor to be concerned about the approbation or censure of our fellowcreatures and yet to feel nothing of this kind towards him who sees and weighs our actions with unerring wisdom and justice and can fully reward or punish them betrays equal madness and partiality of mind it is plain therefore beyond all doubt that some regards are due     to the great father of all in whom every lovely and adorable quality combines to inspire veneration and homage right opinions of god as it has been observed already that our affections depend on our opinions of their objects and generally keep pace with them it must be of the highest importance and seems to be among the first duties we owe to the author of our being to form the least imperfect since we cannot form perfect conceptions of his character and administration for such conceptions thoroughly imbibed will render our religion rational and our dispositions refined if our opinions are diminutive and distorted our religion will be superstitious and our temper abject thus if we ascribe to the deity that false majesty which consists in the unbenevolent and sullen exercise of mere will or power or suppose him to delight in the prostrations of servile fear or as servile praise he will be worshiped with mean adulation and a profusion of compliments farther if he be looked upon as a stern and implacable being delighting in vengeance he will be adored with pompous offerings sacrifices or whatever else might be thought proper to sooth and mollify him but if we believe perfect goodness to be the character of the supreme being and that he loves those most who resemble him most the worship paid him will be rational and sublime and his worshipers will seek to please him by imitating that goodness which they adore rational faith the foundation then of all true religion is rational faith and of a rational faith these seem to be the chief articles to believe that an infinite allperfect mind exists who has no opposite nor any separate interest from that of his creatures—that he superintends and governs all creatures and things—that his goodness extends to all his creatures in different degrees indeed according to their respective natures but without any partiality or envy—that he does every thing for the best or in a subserviency to the perfection and happiness of the whole—particularly that he directs and governs the affairs of men—inspects their actions—distinguishes the good from the bad—loves and befriends the former—is displeased with and pities the latter in this world—and will according to their respective deserts reward one     and punish the other in the next—that in fine he is always carrying on a scheme of virtue and happiness through an unlimited duration—and is ever guiding the universe through its successive stages and periods to higher degrees of perfection and felicity this is true theism the glorious scheme of divine faith a scheme exhibited in all the works of god and executed through his whole administration morality of theism this faith well founded and deeply felt is nearly connected with a true moral taste and hath a powerful efficacy on the temper and manners of the theist he who admires goodness in others and delights in the practice of it must be conscious of a reigning order within a rectitude and candor of heart which disposes him to entertain favourable apprehensions of men and from an impartial survey of things to presume that good order and good meaning prevail in the universe and if good meaning and good order then an ordering an intending mind who is no enemy no tyrant to his creatures but a friend a benefactor an indulgent sovereign immorality of atheism on the other hand a bad man having nothing goodly or generous to contemplate within no right intentions nor honesty of heart suspects every person and every thing and beholding nature thro the gloom of a selfish and guilty mind is either averse to the belief of a reigning order or if he cannot suppress the unconquerable anticipations of a governing mind he is prone to tarnish the beauty of nature and to impute malevolence or blindness and impotence at least to the sovereign ruler he turns the universe into a forlorn and horrid waste and transfers his own character to the deity by ascribing to him that uncommunicative grandeur that arbitrary or revengeful spirit which he affects or admires in himself as such a temper of mind naturally leads to atheism or to a superstition full as bad therefore as far as that temper depends on the unhappy creature in whom it prevails the propensity to atheism or superstition consequent thereto must be immoral farther if it be true that the belief or sense of a deity is natural to the mind and the evidence of his existence reflected from his works so full as to strike even the most superficial observer with conviction     then the supplanting or corrupting that sense or the want of due attention to that evidence and in consequence of both a supine ignorance or affected unbelief of a deity must argue a bad temper or an immoral turn of mind in the case of invincible ignorance or a very bad education though nothing can be concluded directly against the character yet whenever ill passions and habits pervert the judgment and by perverting the judgment terminate in atheism then the case becomes plainly criminal the connection of theism and virtue but let casuists determine this as they will a true faith in the divine character and administration is generally the consequence of a virtuous state of mind the man who is truly and habitually good feels the love of order of beauty and goodness in the strongest degree and therefore cannot be insensible to those emanations of them which appear in all the works of god nor help loving their supreme sourceand model he cannot but think that he who has poured such beauty and goodness over all his works must himself delight in beauty and goodness and what he delights in must be both amiable and happy some indeed there are and it is pity there should be any such who through the unhappy influence of a wrong education have entertained dark and unfriendly thoughts of a deity and his administration though otherwise of a virtuous temper themselves however it must be acknowledged that such sentiments have for the most part a bad effect on the temper and when they have not it is because the undepraved affections of an honest heart are more powerful in their operation than the speculative opinions of an illformed head duties of gratitude love c but wherever right conceptions of the deity and his providence prevail when he is considered as the inexhausted source of light and love and joy as acting in the joint character of a father and governor imparting an endless variety of capacities to his creatures and supplying them with every thing necessary to their full completion and happiness what veneration and gratitude must such conceptions thoroughly believed excite in the mind how natural and delightful must it be to one whose heart is open to the perception of truth and of     every thing fair great and wonderful in nature to contemplate and adore him who is the first fair the first great and first wonderful in whom wisdom power and goodness dwell vitally essentially originally and act in perfect concert what grandeur is here to fill the most enlarged capacity what beauty to engage the most ardent love what a mass of wonders in such exuberance of perfection to astonish and delight the human mind through an unfailing duration other affections if the deity is considered as our supreme guardian and benefactor as the father of mercies who loves his creatures with infinite tenderness and in a particular manner all good men nay who delights in goodness even in its most imperfect degrees what resignation what dependence what generous confidence what hope in god and his allwise providence must arise in the soul that is possessed of such amiable views of him all those exercises of piety and above all a superlative esteem and love are directed to god as to their natural their ultimate and indeed their only adequate object and though the immense obligations we have received from him may excite in us more lively feelings of divine goodness than a general and abstracted contemplation of it yet the affections of gratitude and love are themselves of the generous disinterested kind not the result of selfinterest or views of reward a perfect character in which we always suppose infinite goodness guided by unerring wisdom and supported by almighty power is the proper object of perfect love and tho that character sustains to us the relation of a benefactor yet the mind deeply struck with that perfection is quite lost amidst such a blaze of beauty and grows as it were insensible to those minuter irradiations of it upon itself to talk therefore of a mercenary love of god or which has fear for its principal ingredient is equally impious and absurd if we do not love the loveliest object in the universe for his own sake no prospect of good or fear of ill can ever bribe our esteem or captivate our love these affections are too noble to be bought or sold or bartered in the way of gain     worth or merit is their object and their reward is something similar in kind whoever indulges such sentiments and affections towards the deity must be confirmed in the love of virtue in a desire to imitate its allperfect pattern and in a chearful security that all his great concerns those of his friends and of the universe shall be absolutely safe under the conduct of unerring wisdom and unbounded goodness it is in his care and providence alone that the good man who is anxious for the happiness of all finds perfect serenity a serenity neither ruffled by partial ill nor soured by private disappointment repentance c when we consider the unstained purity and absolute perfection of the divine nature and reflect withal on the imperfection and various blemishes of our own we must sink or be convinced we ought to sink into the deepest humility and prostration of soul before him who is so wonderfully great and holy when farther we call to mind what low and languid feelings we have of the divine presence and majesty what insensibility of his fatherly and universal goodness nay what ungrateful returns we have made to it how far we come short of the perfection of his law and the dignity of our own nature how much we have indulged to the selfish passions and how little to the benevolent ones we must be conscious that it is our duty to repent of a temper and conduct so unworthy our nature and unbecoming our obligations to its author and to resolve and endeavour to act a wiser and better part for the future the connection of our depravity and folly with inward remorse and many outward calamities being established by the deity himself is a natural intimation of his present displeasure with us and a propensity to continue in the same course contracted in consequence of the laws of habit gives us just ground of fear that we are obnoxious to his farther displeasure as that propensity gives a stability to our vice and folly and forebodes our perseverance in them hopes of pardon nevertheless from the character which his works exhibit of him from those delays or alleviations of punishment which offenders often experience and from the merciful tenour of his administration in many other instances the sincere penitent may entertain good hopes that his     parent and judge will not be strict to mark iniquity but will be propitious and favourable to him if he honestly endeavours to avoid his former practices and subdue his former habits and to live in a greater conformity to the divine will for the future if any doubts or fears should still remain how far it may be consistent with the rectitude and equity of the divine government to let his iniquities pass unpunished yet he cannot think it unsuitable to his paternal clemency and wisdom to contrive a method of retrieving the penitent offender that shall unite and reconcile the majesty and mercy of his government if reason cannot of itself suggest such a scheme it gives at least some ground to expect it but though natural religion cannot let in more light and assurance on so interesting a subject yet it will teach the humble theist to wait with great submission for any farther intimations it may please the supreme governor to give of his will to examine with candour and impartiality whatever evidence shall be proposed to him of a divine revelation whether that evidence is natural or supernatural to embrace it with veneration and chearfulness if the evidence is clear and convincing and finally if it bring to light any new relations or connections natural religion will persuade its sincere votary faithfully to comply with the obligations and perform the duties which result from those relations and connections—this is theism piety the completion of morality worship praise thanksgiving we must farther observe that all those affections which we supposed to regard the deity as their immediate and primary object are vital energies of the soul and consequently exert themselves into act and like all its other energies gain strength or greater activity by that exertion it is therefore our duty as well as highest interest often at stated times and by decent and solemn acts to contemplate and adore the great original of our existence the parent of all beauty and of all good to express our veneration and love by an awful and devout recognition of his perfections and to evidence our gratitude by celebrating his goodness and thankfully acknowledging all his benefits it is likewise our duty by proper exercises of sorrow and humiliation to confess our ingratitude and folly to signify our dependence on god and our     confidence in his goodness by imploring his blessing and gracious concurrence in assisting the weakness and curing the corruptions of our nature and finally to testify our sense of his authority and our faith in his government by devoting ourselves to do his will and resigning ourselves to his disposal these duties are not therefore obligatory because the deity needs or can be profited by them but as they are apparently decent and moral suitable to the relations he sustains of our creator benefactor lawgiver and judge expressive of our state and obligations and improving to our tempers by making us more rational social godlike and consequently more happy external worship we have now considered internal piety or the worship of the mind that which is in spirit and in truth we shall conclude this section with a short account of that which is external external worship is founded on the same principles as internal and of as strict moral obligation it is either private or public devotion that is inward or purely intellectual is too spiritual and abstracted an operation for the bulk of mankind the operations of their minds such especially as are employed on the most sublime immaterial objects must be assisted by their outward organs or by some help from the imagination otherwise they will be soon dissipated by sensible impressions or grow tiresome if too long continued ideas are such fleeting things that they must be fixed and so subtle that they must be expressed and delineated as it were by sensible marks and images otherwise we cannot attend to them nor be much affected by them therefore verbal adoration prayer praise thanksgiving and confession are admirable aids to inward devotion fix our attention compose and enliven our thoughts impress us more deeply with a sense of the awful presence in which we are and by a natural and mechanical sort of influence tend to heighten those devout feelings and affections which we ought to entertain and after this manner reduce into formal and explicit act public worship this holds true in an higher degree in the case of public worship where the presence of our fellowcreatures and the powerful contagion of the social affections conspire to kindle and spread the devout     flame with greater warmth and energy to conclude as god is the parent and head of the social system as he has formed us for a social state as by one we find the best security against the ills of life and in the other enjoy its greatest comforts and as by means of both our nature attains its highest improvement and perfection and moreover as there are public blessings and crimes in which we all share in some degree and public wants and dangers to which all are exposed it is therefore evident that the various and solemn offices of public religion are duties of indispensible moral obligation among the best cements of society the firmest prop of government and the fairest ornament of both     book iii section i of practical ethics or the culture of the mind dignity and importance of the subject we have now gone thro a particular detail of the several duties we owe to ourselves to society and to god in considering the first order of duties we just touched on the methods of acquiring the different kinds of goods which we are led by nature to pursue only we left the consideration of the method of acquiring the moral goods of the mind to a section by itself because of its singular importance this section then will contain a brief enumeration of the arts of acquiring virtuous habits and of eradicating vitious ones as far as is consistent with the brevity of such a work a subject of the utmost difficulty as well as importance in morals to which nevertheless the least attention has been generally given by moral writers this will properly follow a detail of duty as it will direct us to such means or helps as are most necessary and conducive to the practice of it sensible ideas and sensible taste in the first part of this inquiry we traced the order in which the passions shoot up in the different periods of human life that order is not accidental or dependent on the caprice of men or the influence of custom and education but arises from the original constitution and laws of our nature of which this is one viz that senseble objects make the first and strongest impressions on the mind these by   0 means of our outward organs being conveyed to the mind become objects of its attention on which it reflects when the outward objects are no longer present or in other words when the impressions upon the outward organs cease these objects of the minds reflection are called ideas or images towards these by another law of our nature we are not altogether indifferent but correspondent movements of desire or aversion love or hatred arise according as the objects of which they are images or copies made an agreeable or disagreeable impression on our organs those ideas and affections which we experience in the first period of life we refer to the body or to sense and the taste which is formed towards them we call a sensible or a merely natural taste and the objects corresponding to them we in general call good or pleasant ideas of beauty and a fine taste but as the mind moves forward in its course it extends its views and receives a new and more complex set of ideas in which it observes uniformity variety similitude symmetry of parts reference to an end novelty grandeur these compose a vast train and diversity of imagery which the mind compounds divides and moulds into a thousand forms in the absence of those objects which first introduced it and this more complicated imagery suggests a new train of desires and affections full as sprightly and engaging as any which have yet appeared this whole class of perceptions or impressions is referred to the imagination and forms an higher taste than the sensible and which has an immediate and mighty influence on the finer passions of our nature and is commonly termed a fine taste the objects which correspond to this taste we use to call beautiful harmonious great or wonderful or in general by the name of beauty moral ideas and a moral taste the mind still pushing onwards and increasing its stock of ideas ascends from those to an higher species of objects viz the order and mutual relations of minds to each other their reciprocal affections characters actions and various aspects in these it discovers a beauty a grandeur a decorum more interesting and alluring than in any of the former kinds these objects or the images of them passing in review     before the mind do by a necessary law of our nature call forth another and nobler set of affections as admiration esteem love honour gratitude benevolence and others of the like tribe this class of perceptions and their correspondent affections we refer because of their objects manners to a moral sense and call the taste or temper they excite moral and the objects which are agreeable to this taste or temper we denominate by the general name of moral beauty in order to distinguish it from the other which is termed natural sources of association these different sets of ideas or images are the materials about which the mind employs itself which it blends ranges and diversifies ten thousand different ways it feels a strong propension to connect and associate those ideas among which it observes any similitude or any aptitude whether original and natural or customary and artificial to suggest each other thus it is ready to associate the ideas of natural and moral beauty as both partake of the same principle viz design harmony of parts or reference to an end and are relative to mind the common origin of both a fine face or a graceful deportment naturally suggests ideas of moral beauty and many outward badges as crowns crosiers purple robes and statues do often by the force of custom excite moral sentiments as majesty piety justice virtue if any particular sets of ideas have been found at any time to coexist in the same objects the mind shall ever after have a propensity to unite them even when they no longer coexist thus because we have sometimes seen a good temper accompany a good aspect virtue annexed to politeness merit to fame we are strongly inclined to fancy that they can never be disunited when any ideas or sets of ideas have been produced by certain objects or occasions immediately and presently which objects or occasions have afterwards given rise to a different and perhaps quite opposite set of ideas or impressions the same objects recurring shall bring in view the former set while the latter being posterior in time shall be entirely forgot thus the drinker or rake upon seeing his bottle and his companion or mistress shall amuse himself with all the gay ideas of agreeable fellowship friendship gentlemanlike enjoyment giving and receiving pleasures which those objects first excited     but by an unhappy selfdelusion shall overlook those head achs heartachs that satiety and those other mortifying impressions which accompanied though more laterly his intemperate indulgences laws of association but whatever the reasons are whether similitude coexistence causality or any other aptitude or relation why any two or more ideas are connected by the mind at first it is an established law of our nature that when two or more ideas have often started in company they form so strong an union that it is very difficult ever after to separate them thus the lover cannot separate the idea of merit from his mistress the courtier that of dignity from his title or ribbon the miser that of happiness from his bags here the minds process is often the same as in its more abstracted operations when it has once been convinced of the truth of any geometrical proposition it may strongly retain the connection of the terms of the proposition suppose the equality of the angles of a triangle to two right ones though it does not attend to or has perhaps forgot the intervening ideas which shewed that connection in like manner tho perhaps it was the tendency of wealth and power when well employed to private pleasure or public happiness that gave the fond admirers of either the first notion of their value yet their mind having once settled that connection frequently forgets the immediate link viz the wise or generous use and by degrees come to admire wealth and power for themselves fancying them intrinsically valuable however they are used and whether used or not by these and many other ways the strongest associations of ideas are formed the different sets of ideas before mentioned are shuffled together without regularity or distinction often without any natural alliance or relation by mere accident example company sympathy education and sometimes by caprice so that any kind of natural good shall be combined with moral beauty nay ideas the most opposite in nature shall be coupled together so as hardly to be ever disunited in the observers mind as for instance prudence with craft honour with injustice religion with inhumanity corruption or sedition with patriotism—it is these associations of worth or happiness with any of the different sets of objects or images before specified that form our taste or complex     idea of good by another law of our nature our affections follow and are governed by this taste and to these affections our character and conduct are similar and proportioned on the general tenour of which our happiness principally depends leading passions follow taste as all our leading passions then depend on the direction which our taste takes and as it is always of the same strain with our leading associations it is worth while to enquire a little more particularly how these are formed in order to detect the secret sources from whence our passions derive their principal strength their various rises and falls for this will give us the true key to their management and let us into the right method of correcting the bad and improving the good the importance and use of the imagination a very slight inspection into human nature suggests to us that no kind of objects make so powerful an impression on us as those which are immediately impressed on our senses or strongly painted on our imaginations whatever is purely intellectual as abstracted or scientific truths the subtile relations and differences of things has a fainter sort of existence in the mind and though it may exercise and whet the memory the judgment or the reasoning powers gives hardly any impulse at all to the active powers the passions which are the main springs of motion on the other hand were the mind entirely under the direction of sense and impressible only by such objects as are present and strike some of the outward organs we should then be precisely in the state of the brutecreation and be governed solely by instinct or appetite and have no power to controul whatever impressions are made upon us nature has therefore endued us with a middle faculty wonderfully adapted to our mixed state which holds partly of sense and partly of reason being strongly allied to the former and the common receptacle in which all the notices that come from that quarter are treasured up and yet greatly subservient and ministerial to the latter by giving a body a coherence and beauty to its conceptions this middle faculty is called the imagination one of the most busy and fruitful powers of the mind into this common storehouse are likewise carried all those moral images or forms which are derived from our     moral faculties of perception and there they often undergo new changes and appearances by being mixed and wrought up with the images and forms of sensible or natural things by this coalition of imagery natural beauty is dignified and heightened by moral qualities and perfections and moral qualities are at once exhibited and set off by natural beauty the sensible beauty or good is refined from its dross by partaking of the moral and the moral receives a stamp a visible character and currency from the sensible—but in order to judge of this mutual influence it will be proper to give a few instances of the process of the imagination or of the energy of the associating principle its energy in various instances in heightening sensible pleasures as we are first of all accustomed to sensible impressions and sensible enjoyments we contract early a sensual relish or love of pleasure in the lower sense of the word in order however to justify this relish the mind as it becomes open to higher perceptions of beauty and good borrows from thence a nobler set of images as fine taste generosity social affection friendship good fellowship and the like and by dressing out the old pursuits with these new ornaments gives them an additional dignity and lustre by these ways the desire of a table love of finery intrigue and pleasure are vastly increased beyond their natural pitch having an impulse combined of the force of the natural appetites and of the superadded strength of those passions which tend to the moral species in heightening the pleasures of beauty harmony c when the mind becomes more sensible to those objects or appearances in which it perceives beauty uniformity grandeur and harmony as fine cloaths elegant furniture plate pictures gardens houses equipage the beauty of animals and particularly the attractions of the sex to these objects the mind is led by nature or taught by custom the opinion and example of others to annex certain ideas of moral character dignity decorum honour liberality tenderness and active or social enjoyment the consequence of this association is that the objects to which these are annexed must rise in their value and be pursued with proportionable ardor the enjoyment of them is often attended with pleasure and the mere possession of them where     that is wanting frequently draws respect from ones fellowcreatures this respect is by many equivalent to the pleasure of enjoyment hence it happens that the idea of happiness is connected with the mere possession which is therefore eagerly sought after without any regard to the generous use or honourable enjoyment thus the passion resting on the means not the end ie losing sight of its natural object becomes wild and extravagant in raising the value of external symbols c in fine any object or external denomination a staff a garter a cup a crown a title may become a moral badge or emblem of merit magnificence or honour according as these have been found or thought by the possessors or admirers of them to accompany them yet by the deception formerly mentioned the merit or the conduct which entitled or should entitle to those marks of distinction shall be forgot or neglected and the badges themselves be passionately affected or pursued as including every excellency if these are attained by any means all the concomitants which nature custom or accidents have joined to them will be supposed to follow of course thus moral ends with which the unhappy admirer is apt to colour over his passion and views will in his opinion justify the most immoral means as prostitution adulation fraud treachery and every species of knavery whether more open or more disguised in heightening the value of wealth power c when men are once engaged in active life and find that wealth and power generally called interest are the great avenues to every kind of enjoyment they are apt to throw in many engaging moral forms to the object of their pursuit in order to justify their passion and varnish over the measures they take to gratify it as independency on the vices or passions of others provision and security to themselves and friends prudent oeconomy or wellplaced charity social communication superiority to their enemies who are all villains honourable service and many other ingredients of merit to attain such capacities of usefulness or enjoyment what arts nay what meannesses can be thought blameable by those cool pursuers of interest—nor have they whom the gay world is pleased to indulge with the title of men of pleasure their     imaginations less pregnant with moral images with which they never fail to ennoble or if they cannot do that to palliate their gross pursuits thus admiration of wit of sentiments and merit friendship love generous sympathy mutual confidence giving and receiving pleasure are the ordinary ingredients with which they season their gallantry and pleasurable entertainments and by which they impose on themselves and endeavour to impose on others that their amours are the joint issue of goodsense and virtue its influence on all the passions these associations variously combined and proportioned by the imagination from the chief private passions which govern the lives of the generality as the love of action of pleasure wealth and fame they influence the defensive and affect the public passions and raise joy or sorrow as they are gratified or disappointed so that in effect these associations of good and evil beauty and deformity and the passions they raise are the main hinges of life and manners and the great sources of our happiness or misery it is evident therefore that the whole of moral culture must depend on giving a right direction to the leading passions and duly proportioning them to the value of the objects or goods pursued under what name soever they may appear moral culture by correcting our taste or imagination now in order to give them this right direction and due proportion it appears from the foregoing detail that those associations of ideas upon which the passions depend must be duly regulated that is to say as an exorbitant passion for wealth pleasure or power flows from an association or opinion that more beauty and good whether natural or moral enters into the enjoyment or possession of them than really belongs to either therefore in restoring those passions to their just proportion we must begin with correcting the opinion or breaking the false association or in other words we must decompound the complex phantom of happiness or good which we fondly admire disunite those ideas that have no natural alliance and separate the original ideas of wealth power or pleasure from the foreign mixtures incorporated with it which enhance its value or give it its chief power to enchant and seduce the mind for instance let it be considered how poor and inconsiderable     a thing wealth is if it be disjoined from real use or from ideas of capacity in the possessor to do good from independency generosity provision for a family or friends and social communication with others by this standard let its true value be fixed let its misapplication or unbenevolent enjoyment be accounted sordid and infamous and nothing worthy or estimable be ascribed to the mere possession of it which is not borrowed from its generous use by selfdenial and counterprocess if that complex form of good which is called pleasure engages us let it be analysed into its constituent principles or those allurements it draws from the heart and imagination in order to heighten the low part of the indulgence let the separate and comparative moment of each be distinctly ascertained and deduced from that gross part and this remainder of the accumulative enjoyment will dwindle down into a poor insipid transitory thing in proportion as the opinion of the good pursued abates the admiration must decay and the passion lose strength of course one effectual way to lower the opinion and consequently to weaken the habit founded on it is to practice lesser pieces of selfdenial or to abstain to a certain pitch from the pursuit or enjoyment of the favourite object and that this may be the more easily accomplished one must avoid those occasions that company those places and the other circumstances that enflamed one and endeared the other and as a counterprocess let higher or even different enjoyments be brought in view other passions played upon the former different places frequented other exercises tried company kept with persons of a different or more correct way of thinking both in natural and moral subjects by a sound and natural education as much depends on our setting out well in life let the youthful fancy which is apt to be very florid and luxuriant be early accustomed by instruction example and significant moral exercises nay by looks gestures and every other testimony of just approbation or blame to annex ideas of merit honour and happiness not to birth dress rank beauty fortune power popularity and the like outward things but to moral and truly virtuous qualities and to those enjoyments which     spring from a wellinformed judgment and a regular conduct of the affections especially those of the social and disinterested kind such dignified forms of beauty and good often suggested and by moving pictures and examples warmly recommended to the imagination enforced by the authority of conscience and demonstrated by reason to be the surest means of enjoyment and the only independent undeprivable and durable goods will be the best counterbalance to meaner passions and the firmest foundation and security to virtue by rightly studying human nature it is of great importance to the forming a just taste or pure and large conceptions of happiness to study and understand human nature well to remember what a complicated system it is particularly to have deeply imprinted on our mind that gradation of senses faculties and powers of enjoyment formerly mentioned and the subordination of goods resulting from thence which nature points out and the experience of mankind confirms who when they think seriously and are not under the immediate influence of some violent prejudice or passion prefer not the pleasures of action contemplation society and most exercises and joys of the moral kind as friendship natural affection and the like to all sensual gratifications whatsoever where the different species of pleasure are blended into one complex form let them be accurately distinguished and be referred each to its proper faculty and sense and examined apart what they have peculiar what common with others and what foreign and adventitious let wealth grandeur luxury love fame and the like be tried by this test and their true alloy will be found out by comparing the moment and abatements of different goods let it be farther considered whether the mind may not be easy and enjoy itself greatly though it want many of those elegancies and superfluities of life which some possess or that load of wealth and power which others eagerly pursue and under which they groan let the difficulty of attaining the precariousness of possessing and the many abatements in enjoying overgrown wealth and envyed greatness of which the weary possessors so frequently complain—as the hurry of business the burthen of company of paying attendance to     the few and giving it to the many the cares of keeping the fears of losing and the desires of increasing what they have and the other troubles which accompany this pitiful drudgery and pompous servitude—let these and the like circumstances be often considered that are conducive to the removing or lessening the opinion of such goods and the attendant passions or set of passions will decay of course by observing our own bent and character c let the peculiar bent of our nature and character be observed whether we are most inclined to form associations and relish objects of the sensible intellectual or moral kind let that which has the ascendant be particularly watched let it be directed to right objects be improved by proportioned exercises and guarded by proper checks from an opposite quarter thus the sensible turn may be exalted by the intellectual and a taste for the beauty of the fine arts and both may be made subservient to convey and rivet sentiments highly moral and public spirited this inward survey must extend to the strength and weaknesses of ones nature ones condition connections habitudes fortune studies acquaintance and the other circumstances of ones life from which every man will form the justest estimate of his own dispositions and character and the best rules for correcting and improving them and in order to do this with more advantage let those times or critical seasons be watched when the mind is best disposed towards a change and let them be improved by vigorous resolutions promises or whatever else will engage the mind to persevere in virtue let the conduct in fine be often reviewed and the causes of its corruption or improvement be carefully observed by frequent moral exercises it will greatly conduce to refine the moral taste and strengthen the virtuous temper to accustom the mind to the frequent exercise of moral sentiments and determinations by reading history poetry particularly of the picturesque and dramatic kind the study of the fine arts by conversing with the most eminent for goodsense and virtue but above all by frequent and repeated acts of humanity compassion friendship politeness and hospitality it is exercise gives health and strength he that reasons most frequently becomes the wisest and most enjoys the   0 pleasures of wisdom he who is most often affected by objects of compassion in poetry history or real life will have his soul most open to pity and its delightful pains and duties so he also who practices most diligently the offices of kindness and charity will by it cultivate that disposition from whence all his pretensions to personal merit must arise his present and his future happiness by an honest employment an useful and honourable employment in life will administer a thousand opportunities of this kind and greatly strengthen a sense of virtue and good affections which must be nourished by right training as well as our understandings for such an employment by enlarging ones experience giving an habit of attention and caution or obliging one from necessity or interest to keep a guard over the passions and study the outward decencies and appearances of virtue will by degrees produce good habits and at length insinuate the love of virtue and honesty for its own sake by viewing men and manners in a fair light it is a great inducement to the exercise of benevolence to view human nature in a favourable light to observe the characters and circumstances of mankind on the fairest sides to put the best constructions on their actions they will bear and to consider them as the result of partial and mistaken rather than ill affections or at worst as the excesses of a pardonable selflove seldom or never the effect of pure malice by consideration and pious exercises above all the nature and consequences of virtue and vice their consequences being the law of our nature and will of heaven the light in which they appear to our supreme parent and lawgiver and the reception they will meet with from him must be often attended to the exercises of piety as adoration and praise of the divine excellency invocation of and dependence on his aid confession thanksgiving and resignation are habitually to be indulged and frequently performed not only as medicinal but highly improving to the temper     by just views of human life and its connection with a future to conclude it will be of admirable efficacy towards eradicating bad habits and implanting good ones frequently to contemplate human life as the great nursery of our future and immortal existence as that state of probation in which we are to be educated for a divine life to remember that our virtues or vices will be immortal as ourselves and influence our future as well as our present happiness—and therefore that every disposition and action is to be regarded as pointing beyond the present to an immortal duration an habitual attention to this wide and important connection will give a vast compass and dignity to our sentiments and actions a noble superiority to the pleasures and pains of life and a generous ambition to make our virtue as immortal as our being     section ii motives to virtue from personal happiness motives from personal happiness we have already considered our obligations to the practice of virtue arising from the constitution of our nature by which we are led to approve a certain order and oeconomy of affections and a certain course of action correspondent to it—but besides this there are several motives which strengthen and secure virtue though not themselves of a moral kind these are its tendency to personal happiness and the contrary tendency of vice personal happiness arises either from the state of a mans own mind or from the state and disposition of external causes towards him happiness of virtue from within we shall first examine the tendency of virtue to happiness with respect to the state of a mans own mind—this is a point of the utmost consequence in morals because unless we can convince ourselves or shew to others that by doing our duty or fulfilling our moral obligations we consult the greatest satisfaction of our own mind or our highest interest on the whole it will raise strong and often unsurmountable prejudices against the practice of virtue especially whenever there arises any appearance of opposition between our duty and our satisfaction or interest to creatures so desirous of happiness and averse to misery as we are and often so oddly situated amidst contending     passions and interests it is necessary that virtue appear not only an honourable but a pleasing and beneficent form and in order to justify our choice to ourselves as well as before others we must ourselves feel and be able to avow in the face of the whole world that her ways are ways of pleasantness and her paths the paths of peace this will shew beyond all contradiction that we not only approve but can give a sufficient reason for what we do influence of vice on the temper of the mind let any man in a cool hour when he is disengaged from business and undisturbed by passion as such cool hours will sometimes happen sit down and seriously reflect with himself what state or temper of mind he would chuse to feel and indulge in order to be easy and to enjoy himself would he chuse for that purpose to be in a constant dissipation and hurry of thought to be disturbed in the exercise of his reason to have various and often interfering phantoms of good playing before his imagination soliciting and distracting him by turns now soothing him with amusing hopes then torturing him with anxious fears and to approve this minute what he shall condemn the next would he chuse to have a strong and painful sense of every petty injury quick apprehensions of every impending evil incessant and insatiable desires of power wealth honour pleasure an irreconcileable antipathy against all competitors and rivals insolent and tyrannical dispositions to all below him fawning and at the same time envious dispositions to all above him with dark suspicions and jealousies of every mortal would he chuse neither to love nor be beloved of any to have no friend in whom to confide or with whom to interchange his sentiments or designs no favourite on whom to bestow his kindness or vent his passions in fine to be conscious of no merit with mankind no esteem from any creature no good affection to his maker no concern for or hopes of his approbation but instead of all these to hate and know that he is hated to contemn and know that he is contemned by all by the good because he is so unlike and by the bad because he is so like themselves to hate or to dread the very being that made him and in short to have his breast the seat of pride and passion petulance and revenge deep melancholy cool malignity and all the other     furies that ever possessed and tortured mankind—would our calm enquirer after happiness pitch on such a state and such a temper of mind as the most likely means to put him in possession of his desired ease and selfenjoyment influence of virtue on the temper or would he rather chuse a serene and easy flow of thoughts a reason clear and composed a judgment unbiassed by prejudice and undistracted by passion a sober and wellgoverned fancy which presents the images of things true and unmixed with delusive and unnatural charms and therefore administers no improper or dangerous fuel to the passions but leaves the mind free to chuse or reject as becomes a reasonable creature a sweet and sedate temper not easily ruffled by hopes or fears prone neither to suspicion nor revenge apt to view men and things in the fairest lights and to bend gently to the humours of others rather than obstinately to contend with them would he chuse such moderation and continence of mind as neither to be ambitious of power fond of honours covetous of wealth nor a slave to pleasure a mind of course neither elated with success nor dejected with disappointment such a modest and noble spirit as supports power without insolence wears honours without pride uses wealth without profusion or parsimony and rejoices more in giving than in receiving pleasure such fortitude and equanimity as rises above misfortunes or turns them into blessings such integrity and greatness of mind as neither flatters the vices nor triumphs over the follies of men as equally spurns servitude and tyranny and will neither engage in low designs nor abet them in others would he chuse in fine such mildness and benignity of heart as takes part in all the joys and refuses none of the sorrows of others stands wellaffected to all mankind is conscious of meriting the esteem of all and of being beloved by the best a mind which delights in doing good without any shew and yet arrogates nothing on that account rejoices in loving and being beloved by its maker acts ever under his eye resigns itself to its providence and triumphs in his approbation—which of these dispositions would be his choice in order to be contented serene and happy—the former temper is vice the latter virtue where one     prevails there misery prevails and by the generality is acknowledged to prevail where the other reigns there happiness reigns and by the confession of mankind is acknowledged to reign the perfection of either temper is misery or happiness in perfection therefore every approach to either extreme is an approach to misery or to happiness that is to say every degree of vice or virtue is accompanied with a proportionable degree of misery or happiness an objection from an imaginary coalition of virtue and vice but many are of opinion and by their practice seem to avow the opinion that by blending or softening the extremes and artfully reconciling virtue with vice they bid fairer to strike a just medium of happiness to pass more smoothly through life and to have more resources in the present embarassed scene honesty they acknowledge is in the main the best policy but it is often too blunt and surly and always too scrupulous and therefore to temper and season it with a little discreet craft in critical and wellchosen conjunctures will they think make it more palatable to others and more profitable to ones self kind affection is a good thing in its own place and when it costs a man nothing but charity begins at home and ones regard for others must still look that way and be subservient to the main chance besides why suffer unnecessary disquiet on the account of others our own happiness is charge enough to us and if we are not to be happy till others are so too it is a mere utopian dream ever to expect it one would not chuse to do ill for the sake of ill but when necessity requires it the lesser good must submit to the greater that is to our own personal good for in it by the first and fundamental law of our nature we are most interested by such a conduct we shall have least reason to accuse ourselves be most easy within and best secured against the misfortunes and assaults of others the temper and condition of halfhonesty or knavery this is the language of great partiality of thought as well as great partiality of heart—but as it is one of the main forts in which selfishness and knavery use to intrench themselves it may be worth while to beat it down to make way for the full triumphs of their fair adversary that man may neglect or hurt their own interest by an indiscreet concern     about that of others—that honesty may sometimes degenerate into a blunt surliness or a peevish scrupulosity—that important occasions may demand the sacrifice of a less public to a greater private good—that it were folly to make ones self miserable because others are not so happy as one would wish we do not deny but is there not the justest reason to suspect that the dishonest or the halfhonest and contracted turn of mind here pleaded for is the very reverse of that temper which begets true satisfaction and selfenjoyment and of that character which entitles to credit security and success the man who doubts and hesitates whether he may not in some instances play the knave cannot in any sense be termed honest and surely he cannot approve himself for that conduct which by an inviolable law of his nature he is compelled to condemn and if he cannot approve himself for his conduct he is deprived of one of the sweetest feelings of the human heart but suppose he could disguise the immoral deed or disposition under the fair name of some virtue or the mask at least of a necessary selfregard as is often done to elude the awful decision of conscience which when uninfluenced is always unerring yet he must be conscious he cannot stand the test of judges less interested than himself and must therefore be under constant dread of discovery and consequently of public censure with all its mortifying attendants this dread must be so much the greater if he has had companions or tools of his knavery which generally it must have in order to supply its native impotence and deficiency this then is to be insecure obnoxious and dependent and that too on the worst set of men on whom one can have no hold but by their vices which like undisciplined wild beasts often turn upon their masters such an insecure obnoxious dependent state must necessarily be a state of suspicion servitude and fear which instead of begetting serenity and selfenjoyment are the parents of disquiet and misery besides the fluctuating perpetually between opposite principles the violence done to a native sense of honesty the reluctance against the first advances of young and blushing knavery the hot and cold fits of alternate virtue and vice the suspense and irresolution of a mind distracted between interfering passions are the first painful symptoms of that dreadful disease which afterwards lays waste every     thing goodly and ingenuous and raises agonies intolerable to the patient and quite inconceivable by others whether such an inconsistent conduct divided between vice and virtue will serve the views of interest proposed by it will be afterwards examined temper and condition of the good benevolent man as to the other part of the objection let it be considered that a man of an enlarged benevolent mind who thinks feels and acts for others is not subject to half the disquietudes of the contracted selfish soul—finds a thousand alleviations to soften his disappointments which the other wants—and has a fair chance for double his enjoyments his desires are moderate and his wants few in comparison of the others because they are measured by nature which has limits not by fancy or passion which has none he is cautious without being distrustful or jealous careful but not anxious busy but not distracted he tastes pleasure without being dissipated bears pain without dejection or discontent is raised to power without turning giddy feels few of the pains of competition and none of the pains of envy the alleviations of his ills the principal alleviations of his calamities are these—that though some of them may have been the effect of his imprudence or weakness yet few of them are sharpened by a sense of guilt and none of them by a consciousness of wickedness which surely is their keenest sting—that they are common to him with the best of men—that they seldom or never attack him quite unprepared but rather guarded with a consciousness of his own sincerity and virtue with a faith and trust in providence and a firm resignation to its perfect orders—that they may be improved as means of correction or materials to give scope and stability to his virtues—and to name no more they are considerably lessened and often sweetened to him by the general sympathy of the wise and good his enjoyments his enjoyments are more numerous or if less numerous yet more intense than those of bad men for he shares in the joys of others by rebound and every increase of general or particular happiness is a real addition to his own it is true his friendly sympathy with others     subjects him to some pains which the hardhearted wretch does not feel yet to give a loose to it is a kind of agreeable discharge it is such a sorrow as he loves to indulge a sort of pleasing anguish that sweetly melts the mind and terminates in a selfapproving joy though the good man may want means to execute or be disappointed in the success of his benevolent purposes yet as was formerly observed he is still conscious of good affections and that consciousness is an enjoyment of a more delightful savour than the greatest triumphs of successful vice if the ambitious covetous or voluptuous are disappointed their passions recoil upon them with a fury proportioned to their opinion of the value of what they pursue and their hope of success while they have nothing within to balance the disappointment unless it is an useful fund of pride which however frequently turns mere accidents into mortifying affronts and exalts grief into rage and frenzy whereas the meek humble and benevolent temper is its own immediate reward is satisfied from within and as it magnifies greatly the pleasure of success so it wonderfully alleviates and in a manner annihilates all pain for the want of it from merited esteem and sympathy as the good man is conscious of loving and wishing well to all mankind he must be sensible of his deserving the esteem and goodwill of all and this supposed reciprocation of social feelings is by the very frame of our nature made a source of very intense and enlivening joys by this sympathy of affections and interests he feels himself intimately united with the human race and being sensibly alive over the whole system his heart receives and becomes responsive to every touch given to any part so that as an eminent philosopher† finely expresses     it he gathers contentment and delight from the pleased and happy states of those around him from accounts and relations of such happinesses from the very countenances gestures voices and sounds even of creatures foreign to our kind whose signs of joy and contentment he can any way discern do not interfere with other joys nor do those generous affections stop any other natural source of joy whatever or deaden his sense of any innocent gratification they rather keep the several senses and powers of enjoyment open and disengaged intense and uncorrupted by riot or abuse as is evident to any one who considers the dissipated unfeeling state of men of pleasure ambition or interest and compares it with the serene and gentle state of a mind at peace with itself and friendly to all mankind unruffled by any violent emotion and sensible to every goodnatured and alluring joy he who daily dwells with temperance and virtue those everlasting beauties and of the highest order cannot be insensible to the charms of society or friendship the attractions of virtuous love the delights of reading or to any beauty of a lower species the unbendings of innocent mirth or whatever else sets the soul at ease and gives him a relish of his being by enjoying himself he is in the best posture for enjoying every thing else all is pure and wellordered in such a heart and therefore whatever pleasure is poured into it has an original savour not a single drop is lost for virtue draws off all but the dregs and by mixing something of her own with the most ordinary entertainments refines them into exalted enjoyments the misery of excess in the private passions it were easy by going through the different sets of affections mentioned formerly to shew that it is only by maintaining the proportion settled there that the mind arrives at true repose and satisfaction if fear exceeds that proportion it sinks into melancholy and dejection if anger passes just bounds it ferments into rage and revenge or subsides   0 into a sullen corroding gloom which embitters every good and renders one exquisitely sensible to every ill the private passions the love of honour especially whose impulses are more generous as its effects are more diffusive are instruments of private pleasure but if they are disproportioned to our wants or to the value of their several objects or to the balance of other passions equally necessary and more amiable they become instruments of intense pain and misery for being now destitute of that counterpoise which held them at a due pitch they grow turbulent peevish and revengeful the cause of constant restlessness and torment sometimes flying out into a wild delirious joy at other times settling into a deep splenetic grief the concert between reason and passion is then broke all is dissonance and distraction within the mind is out of frame and feels an agony proportioned to the violence of the reigning passion in the public affections the case is much the same or rather worse when any of the particular kind affections are out of their natural order and proportion as happens in the case of effeminate pity exorbitant love parental dotage or any party passion where the just regards to society are supplanted the more social and disinterested the passion is it breaks out into the wilder excesses and makes the more dreadful havock both within and abroad as is but too apparent in those cases where a false species of religion honour zeal or party rage has seized on the natural enthusiasm of the mind and worked it up to madness it breaks through all ties natural and civil counteracts the most sacred and solemn obligations silences every other affection whether public or private and transforms the most gentle natures into the most savage and inhuman such an exorbitant passion is like the enormous growth of a natural member which not only draws from the nourishment of the rest but threatens the mortification of the whole body and in the mean time occasions intolerable pain and anguish in fine all the natural affections like the animal spirits or humours of a strong body if restrained from their proper play turn furious or melancholic and generally force their way by some violent discharge no less hurtful to the patient than offensive to those with whom he is connected     happiness of well proportiond passions whereas the man who keeps the balance of affection even is easy and serene in his motions mild and yet affectionate uniform and consistent with himself is not liable to disagreeable collisions of interests and passions gives always place to the most friendly and humane affections and never to dispositions or acts of resentment but on high occasions when the security of the private or welfare of the public system or the great interests of mankind necessarily require a noble indignation and even then he observes a just measure in wrath and last of all he proportions every passion to the value of the object he affects or to the importance of the end he pursues sum of the argument to sum up this part of the argument the honest and good man has eminently the advantage of the knavish and selfish wretch in every respect the pleasures which the last enjoys flow chiefly from external advantages and gratifications are superficial and transitory dashed with long intervals of satiety and frequent returns of remorse and fear dependent on favourable accidents and conjunctures and subjected to the humours of men but the good man is satisfied from himself his principal possessions lie within and therefore beyond the reach of the caprice of men or fortune his enjoyments are exquisite and permanent accompanied with no inward checks to damp them and always with ideas of dignity and selfapprobation may be tasted at any time and in any place the gratifications of vice are turbulent and unnatural generally arising from the relief of passions in themselves intolerable and issuing in tormenting reflections often irritated by disappointment always inflamed by enjoyment and yet ever cloyed with repetition the pleasures of virtue are calm and natural flowing from the exercise of kind affections or delightful reflections     in consequence of them not only agreeable in the prospect but in the present feeling they never satiate or lose their relish nay rather the admiration of virtue grows stronger every day and not only is the desire but the enjoyment heightened by every new gratification and unlike to most others it is increased not diminished by sympathy and communication in fine the satisfactions of virtue may be purchased without a bribe and possessed in the humblest as well as the most triumphant fortune they can bear the strictest review do not change with circumstances nor grow old with time force cannot rob nor fraud cheat us of them and to crown all instead of abating they enhance every other pleasure external effects of virtue but the happy consequences of virtue are seen not only in the internal enjoyments it affords a man but in the favourable disposition of external causes towards him to which it contributes on the body as virtue gives the sober possession of ones self and the command of ones passions the consequence must be hearts ease and a fine natural flow of spirits which conduce more than any thing else to health and long life violent passions and the excesses they occasion gradually impair and wear down the machine but the calm placid state of a temperate mind and the healthful exercises in which virtue engages her faithful votaries preserve the natural functions in full vigour and harmony and exhilarate the spirits which are the chief instruments of action we might add what will appear perhaps too refined that as virtue is the sound temperament and beautiful complexion of the soul so it even diffuses sometimes a congenial air of beauty over the body lights up and spreads out the countenance into a certain openness chearfulness and dignity those natural irradiations of inward worth which politeness that ape of virtue may imitate but can never fully attain—in fine temperance which has been called sometimes the mother and at other times the nurse of the virtues is beautifully described by an ingenious author to be that virtue     without pride and fortune without envy that gives indolence of body and tranquillity of mind the best guardian of youth and support of old age the tutelar goddess of health and universal medicine of life that clears the head strengthens the nerves enlightens the eyes and comforts the heart on ones fortune interest c it may by some be thought odd to assert that virtue is no enemy to a mans fortune in the present state of things—but if by fortune be meant a moderate or competent share of wealth power or credit not overgrown degrees of them what should hinder the virtuous man from obtaining that he cannot cringe or fawn it is true but he can be civil and obliging as well as the knave and surely his civility is more alluring because it has more manliness and grace in it than the mean adulation of the other he cannot cheat or undermine but he may be cautious provident watchful of occasions and equally prompt with the rogue in improving them he scorns to prostitute himself as a pandar to the passions or as a tool to the vices of mankind but he may have as sound an understanding and as good capacities for promoting their real interests as the veriest courtslave and then he is more faithful and true to those who employ him in the common course of business he has the same chances with the knave of acquiring a fortune and rising in the world he may have equal abilities equal industry equal attention to business and in other respects he has greatly the advantage of him people love better to deal with him they can trust him more they know he will not impose on them nor take advantage of them and can depend more on his word than on the oath or strongest securities of others whereas what is commonly called cunning which is the offspring of ignorance and constant companion of knavery is not only a meanspirited but a very shortsighted talent and a fundamental obstacle in the road of business it may procure indeed immediate and petty gains but it is attended     with dreadful abatements which do more than overbalance them both as it sinks a mans credit when discovered and cramps that largeness of mind which extends to the remotest as well as the nearest interest and takes in the most durable equally with the most transient gains it is therefore easy to see how much a mans credit and reputation and consequently his success depend on his honesty and virtue the truly good man has no character to personate no mask to wear his designs are transparent and one part of his discourse and conduct exactly tallies with another having no sordid views to promote no mean passions to serve but wishing well to every body and doing all the good he can he is intrenched and guarded round by innocence and virtue and though he is not secured against misfortunes yet his character and the friends his merit has procured him will frequently retrieve him whereas tricking as one well expresses it is a sort of disguise by which a man hides himself in one place and exposes himself in another besides falshood and roguery are variable unsettled things and the source of a conduct both irresolute and inconsistent they must often change hands and be ever contriving new expedients as accidents vary and one lame measure must always limp on after another to support and back it so that an inexhausted fund of craft is necessary to play the knave to any purpose and to maintain for any time a counterfeit character when he is once detected his credit is blown for ever and unless he is a great master in dissimulation his artificial conduct will ever render him obnoxious to suspicion which is ever sharpsighted even the good man is not secure against the attacks of calumny but he is armed against its sting if he cannot silence he will confute detraction by obstinately persisting in being virtuous and doing good in time almighty truth will prevail and he might extort veneration from the partial as well as obtain a chearful tribute from the candid judges of merit but should the cloud in which malice or envy may have involved his virtue never be entirely dissipated in his life yet death that soother of envy and the malevolent passions will totally dispel any remaining gloom and display his character in all its genuine and unstained glory for the bed of virtue is a bed of honour and he who     dies in it cannot die unlamented by the good nor unreverenced by the bad on ones peace and security with regard to security and peace with his neighbours it may be thought perhaps that the man of a quiet forgiving temper and a flowing benevolence and courtesy is much exposed to injury and affronts from every proud or peevish mortal who has the power or will to do mischief if we suppose indeed this quietness and gentleness of nature accompanied with cowardice or pusillanimity this may often be the case but in reality the good man is bold as a lion and so much the bolder for being the calmer such a person will hardly be a but to mankind the illnatured will be afraid to provoke him and the goodnatured will not incline to do it besides true virtue which is conducted by reason and exerted gracefully and without parade is a most insinuating and commanding thing if it cannot disarm malice and resentment at once it will wear them out by degrees and subdue them at length how many have by favours and prudently yielding triumphed over an enemy who would have been enflamed into tenfold rage by the fiercest opposition in fine goodness is the most universally popular thing that can be though the prejudices or passions of men may sometimes dress it up in the disguise of weakness or deface it with unlovely features yet let the mask be dropt and the lovely form appear as it is the most prejudiced will respect the unprejudiced admire and love it and all will be afraid or at least ashamed to traduce or offend a thing so innocent and so godlike on ones family to conclude the good man may have some enemies but he will have more friends and having given so many marks of private friendship or public virtue he can hardly be destitute of a patron to protect or a sanctuary to entertain him or to entertain and protect his children when he is gone tho he should have little else to leave them he bequeaths them the fairest and generally the most unenvied inheritance of a good name which like good seed sown in the field of futurity will often raise up unsolicited friends and yield a benevolent harvest of unexpected charities but should the fragrance of the parents     virtue prove offensive to a perverse or envious age or even draw persecution on the friendless orphans there is one in heaven who will be more than a father to them and recompense their parents virtues by showering down blessings on them the thoughts of leaving them in such good hands sustain the honest parent and make him smile in the agonies of death being secure that that almighty friend who has dispensed such a profusion of bounties to himself cannot prove an unkind guardian or an unfaithful trustee to his fatherless offspring—this leads to consider a sublime motive and noble mould to virtue from whence it derives its firmest support and in which it receives its highest finishing and lustre     section iii motives to virtue from the being and providence of god two external motives to virtue besides the interesting motives mentioned in the last section there are two great motives to virtue strictly connected with human life and resulting from the very constitution of the human mind the first is the being and providence of god the second is the immortality of the soul with future rewards and punishments their importance it appears from sect   of book ii that man by the constitution of his nature is designed to be a religious creature he is intimately connected with the deity and necessarily dependent on him from that connection and necessary dependence result various obligations and duties without fulfilling which some of his sublimest powers and affections would be incomplete and abortive if he be likewise an immortal creature and if his present conduct shall affect his future happiness in another state as well as in the present it is evident that we take only a partial view of the creature if we leave out this important property of his nature and make a partial estimate of human life if we strike out of the account or overlook that part of his duration which runs out into eternity—we shall therefore consider the motives which arise from the former connection in this section and those arising from the latter in the next     piety it is evident from the abovementioned section that to have a respect to the deity in our temper and conduct to venerate and love his character to adore his goodness to depend upon and resign ourselves to his providence to seek his approbation and act under a sense of his authority is a fundamental part of moral virtue and the completion of the highest destination of our nature a support to virtue but as piety is an essential part of virtue so likewise it is a great support and enforcement to the practice of it to contemplate and admire a being of such transcendent dignity and perfection as god must naturally and necessarily open and enlarge the mind give a freedom and ampleness to its powers and a grandeur and elevation to its aims for as an excellent divine† observes the greatness of an object and the excellency of the act of any agent about a transcendent object doth mightily tend to the enlargement and improvement of his faculties little objects mean company mean cares and mean business cramp the mind contract its views and give it a creeping air and deportment but when it soars above mortal cares and mortal pursuits into the regions of divinity and converses with the greatest and best of beings it spreads itself into a wider compass takes higher flights in reason and goodness and becomes godlike in its air and manners virtue is if one may say so both the effect and cause of largeness of mind it requires that one think freely and act nobly now what can conduce more to freedom of thought and dignity of action than to conceive worthily of god to reverence and adore his unrivalled excellency to imitate and transcribe that excellency into our own nature     to remember our relation to him and that we are the image and representatives of his glory to the rest of the creation such feelings and exercises must and will make us scorn all actions that are base unhandsome or unworthy our state and the relation we stand in to god will irradiate the mind with the light of wisdom and ennoble it with the liberty and dominion of virtue a guard and enforcement to virtue the influence and efficacy of religion may be considered in another light we all know the presence of a friend a neighbour or any number of spectators but especially an august assembly of them to be a considerable check upon the conduct of one who is not lost to a sense of honour and shame and contributes to restrain many irregular sallies of passion in the same manner we may imagine that the awe of some superior mind who is supposed privy to our secret conduct and armed with full power to reward or punish it will impose a restraint on us in such actions as fall not under the controul or animadversion of others if we go still higher and suppose our inmost thoughts and darkest designs as well as our most secret actions to lie open to the notice of the supreme and universal mind who is both the spectator and judge of human actions it is evident that the belief of so august a presence and such awful inspection must carry a restraint and weight with it proportioned to the strength of that belief and be an additional motive to the practice of many duties which would not have been performed without it—as our sense of honour or blame is increased in proportion to the esteem we have of those who bestow either shall we suppose no sensibility to the applause or censure of him whom we believe to be the judge as well as standard of all perfection and if we suppose such a sensibility can we deny that it will operate on every mind which feels it both as an incentive to deserve that applause and as a guard to avoid that censure we may suppose some cases in which the virtuous man through the force of prejudices against him and because of the false lights in which his actions are viewed may be tempted to renounce the honest cause by which he happens to incur reproach or ridicule but if he can make his appeal from the opinions of men to the searcher of hearts it is evident that the consciousness   0 of so high a sanction may bear him out in his course and consequently be a support to his virtue and in due time may teach him to despise the strife of tongues nay the utmost efforts of malice and envy in cases of the greatest trial but a good man may likewise fall a sacrifice to power or to injustice his life may be a series of misfortunes and his virtue may have exposed him to many of them the constitution and state of his body and peculiar pressures on his mind may incapacitate him for enjoying the natural fruits of virtue at least with an high relish how supporting in such a case nay how preservative must it be to his integrity and what an antidote against that gloom and fretfulness which are apt to invade the mind in such circumstances of trial to believe that infinite wisdom and goodness preside in the universe—that every event being under their direction is the cause or consequence of some greater good to him or to the whole—that those misfortunes which befall him are appointed by heaven to correct his follies to improve or secure his virtues and consequently to increase his happiness these sentiments thoroughly felt must and will serve as a charm to sooth his sorrows and confirm his loyalty and resignation to the supreme providence in fine let the disposition of external causes be ever so unfavourable to the good man yet as he is conscious that the almighty governor is his parent patron and friend he may rest secure that he will either sustain and guard him in the midst of his troubles or direct and overrule them to his greatest good exercises of piety improving to virtue it may be observed farther that to live under an habitual sense of the deity and his great administration is to be conversant with wisdom order and beauty in the highest subjects and to receive the delightful reflections and benign feelings which these excite while they irradiate upon him from every scene of nature and providence how improving must such views be to the mind in dilating and exalting it above those puny interests and competitions which agitate and enflame the bulk of mankind against each other what genial and propitious influence on the temper must the admiration and love of divine goodness     have when it is considered as diffused through infinite space to infinite races of creatures and stretching from eternity to eternity what candor mildness benignity of heart and what grandeur as well as sweetness of manners must it inspire to conclude with what alluring and commanding energy must his benefits call forth our gratitude his example our imitation his wisdom power and goodness our confidence and hope his applause our ambition to deserve it and how must his presence strongly believed or rather powerfully felt enliven and fortify these and every other principle of virtue     section iv motive to virtue from the immortality of the soul c metaphysical arguments for its immortality the other motive mentioned was the immortality of the soul with future rewards and punishments the metaphysical proofs of the souls immortality are commonly drawn from its simple uncompounded and indivisible nature from whence it is concluded that it cannot be corrupted or extinguished by a dissolution or destruction of parts—from its having a beginning of motion within itself whence it is inferred that it cannot discontinue and lose its motion—from the different properties of matter and mind the sluggishness and inactivity of one and the immense activity of the other its prodigious flight of thought and imagination its penetration memory foresight and anticipations of futurity from whence it is concluded that a being of so divine a nature cannot be extinguished but as these metaphysical proofs depend on intricate reasonings concerning the nature properties and distinctions of body and mind with which we are not very well acquainted they are not obvious to ordinary understandings and are seldom so convincing even to those of higher reach as not to leave some doubts behind them therefore perhaps it is not so safe to rest the proof of such an important article on what many may call the subleties of schoollearning those proofs which are brought from analogy from the moral constitution and phenomena of the human mind the moral attributes of god and the present course of things and which are therefore called the moral arguments are the plainest and generally the most satisfying we shall select only one or two from the rest     moral proof from analogy in tracing the nature and destination of any being we form the surest judgment from his powers of action and the scope and limits of these compared with his state or with that field in which they are exercised if this being passes through different states or fields of action and we find a succession of powers adapted to the different periods of his progress we conclude that he was destined for those successive states and reckon his nature progressive if besides the immediate set of powers which fit him for action in his present state we observe another set which appears superfluous if he was to be confined to it and which point to another or higher one we naturally conclude that he is not designed to remain in his present state but to advance to that for which those supernumerary powers are adapted thus we argue that the insect which has wings forming or formed and all the apparatus proper for flight is not destined always to creep on the ground or to continue in the torpid state of adhering to a wall but is designed in its season to take its flight in air without this farther destination the admirable mechanism of wings and the other apparatus would be useless and absurd the same kind of reasoning may be applied to man while he lives only a sort of vegetative life in the womb he is furnished even there with a beautiful apparatus of organs eyes ears and other delicate senses which receive nourishment indeed but are in a manner folded up and have no proper exercise or use in their present confinement let us suppose some intelligent spectator who had never any connection with man nor the least acquaintance with human affairs to see this odd phenomenon a creature formed after such a manner and placed in a situation apparently unsuitable to such various machinery must he not be strangely puzzled about the use of his complicated     structure and reckon such a profusion of art and admirable workmanship lost on the subject or reason by way of anticipation that a creature endued with such various yet unexerted capacities was destined for a more enlarged sphere of action in which those latent capacities shall have full play the vast variety and yet beautiful symmetry and proportions of the several parts and organs with which the creature is endued and their apt cohesion with and dependence on the curious receptacle of their life and nourishment would forbid his concluding the whole to be the birth of chance or the bungling effort of an unskilful artist at least would make him demur awhile at so harsh a sentence but if while he is in this state of uncertainty we suppose him to see the babe after a few successful struggles throwing off his fetters breaking loose from his little dark prison and emerging into open day then unfolding his recluse and dormant powers breathing in air gazing at light admitting colours sounds and all the fair variety of nature immediately his doubts clear up the propriety and excellency of the workmanship dawn upon him with full lustre and the whole mystery of the first period is unravelled by the opening of this new scene though in this second period the creature lives chiefly a kind of animal life ie of sense and appetite yet by various trials and observations he gains experience and by the gradual evolution of the powers of imagination he ripens apace for an higher life for exercising the arts of design and imitation and of those in which strength or dexterity are more requisite than acuteness or reach of judgment in the succeeding rational or intellectual period his understanding which formerly crept in a lower mounts into an higher sphere canvasses the natures judges of the relations of things forms schemes deduces consequences from what is past and from present as well as past collects future events by this succession of states and of correspondent culture he grows up at length into a moral a social and a political creature this is the last period at which we perceive him to arrive in this his mortal career each period is introductory to the next succeeding one each life is a field of exercise and improvement for the next higher one the life of the foetus for that of the infant the life of the infant for that of the child and all the lower for the highest and     best—but is this the last period of natures progression is this the utmost extent of her plot where she winds up the drama and dismisses the actor into eternal oblivion or does he appear to be invested with supernumerary powers which have not full exercise and scope even in the last scene and reach not that maturity or perfection of which they are capable and therefore point to some higher scene where he is to sustain another and more important character than he has yet sustained if any such there are may we not conclude by analogy or in the same way of anticipation as before that he is destined for that afterpart and is to be produced upon a more august and solemn stage where his sublimer powers shall have proportioned action and its nature attain its completion powers in man which point to an afterlife if we attend to that curiosity or prodigious thirst of knowledge which is natural to the mind in every period of its progress and consider withal the endless round of business and care and the various hardships to which the bulk of mankind are chained down intellectual  it is evident that in this present state it is imposible to expect the gratification of an appetite at once so insatiable and so noble our senses the ordinary organs by which knowledge is let into the mind are always imperfect and often fallacious the advantages of assisting or correcting them are possessed by few the difficulties of finding out truth amidst the various and contradictory opinions interests and passions of mankind are many and the wants of the creature and of those with whom he is connected numerous and urgent so that it may be said of most men that their intellectual organs are as much shut up and secluded from proper nourishment and exercise in that little circle to which they are confined as the bodily organs are in the womb nay those who to an aspiring genius have added all the assistances of art leisure and the     most liberal education what narrow prospects can even they take of this unbounded scene of things from that little eminence on which they stand and how eagerly do they still grasp at new discoveries without any satisfaction or limit to their ambition moral powers but should it be said that man is made for action and not for speculation or fruitless searches after knowledge we ask for what kind of action is it only for bodily exercises or for moral political and religious ones of all these he is capable yet by the unavoidable circumstances of his lot he is tied down to the former and has hardly any leisure to think of the latter or if he has wants the proper instruments of exerting them the love of virtue of ones friends and country the generous sympathy with mankind and heroic zeal of doing good which are all so natural to great and good minds and some traces of which are found in the lowest are seldom united with proportioned means or opportunities of exercising them so that the moral spring the noble energies and impulses of the mind can hardly find proper scope even in the most fortunate condition but are much depressed in some and almost entirely restrained in the generality by the numerous clogs of an indigent sickly or embarrassed life were such mighty powers such godlike affections planted in the human breast to be folded up in the narrow womb of our present existence never to be produced into a more perfect life nor to expatiate in the ample career of immortality unsatisfied desires of existence and happiness c let it be considered at the same time that no possession no enjoyment within the round of mortal things is commensurate to the desires or adequate to the capacities of the mind the most envied condition has its abatements the happiest conjuncture of fortune leaves many wishes behind and after the highest gratifications the mind is carried forward in pursuit of new ones without end add to all the fond desire of immortality the secret dread of nonexistence and the high unremitting pulse of the soul beating for perfection joined to the improbability or the impossibility of attaining it here and then judge whether this elaborate structure this magnificent apparatus of     inward powers and organs does not plainly point out an hereafter and intimate eternity to man does nature give the finishing touches to the lesser and ignobler instances of her skill and raise every other creature to the maturity and perfection of his being and shall she leave her principal workmanship unfinished does she carry the vegetative and animal life in man to their full vigour and highest destination and shall she suffer his intellectual his moral his divine life to fade away and be for ever extinguished would such abortions in the moral world be congruous to that perfection of wisdom and goodness which upholds and adorns the natural therefore man immortal we must therefore conclude from this detail that the present state even at its best is only the womb of mans being in which the noblest principles of his nature are in a manner fettered or secluded from a correspondent sphere of action and therefore destined for a future and unbounded state where they shall emancipate themselves and exert the fulness of their strength the most accomplished mortal in this low and dark apartment of nature is only the rudiments of what he shall be when he takes his etherial flight and puts on immortality without a reference to that state man were a mere abortion a rude unfinished embryo a monster in nature but this being once supposed he still maintains his rank of the masterpiece of the creation his latent powers are all suitable to the harmony and progression of nature his noble aspirations and the pains of his dissolution are his efforts toward a second birth the pangs of his delivery into light liberty and perfection and death his discharge from gaol his separation from his fellowprisoners and introduction into the assembly of those heroic spirits who are gone before him and of their great eternal parent the fetters of his mortal coil being loosened and his prisonwalls broke down he will be bare and open on every side to the admission of truth and virtue and their fair attendant happiness every vital and intellectual spring will evolve itself with a divine elasticity in the free air of heaven he will not then peep at the universe and its glorious author through a dark grate or a gross medium nor receive the reflections of his glory through the strait openings of sensible     organs but will be all eye all air all etherial and divine feeling—let one part however of the analogy be attended to that as in the womb we receive our original constitution form and the essential stamina of our being which we carry along with us into the light and which greatly affect the succeeding periods of our life so our temper and condition in the future life will depend on the conduct we have observed and the character we have formed in the present life we are here in miniature what we shall be at full length hereafter the first rude sketch or outlines of reason and virtue must be drawn at present to be afterwards enlarged to the stature and beauty of angels immortality a guard and incentive to virtue this if duly attended to must prove not only a guard but an admirable incentive to virtue for he who faithfully and ardently follows the lights of knowledge and pants after higher improvements in virtue will be wonderfully animated and inflamed in that pursuit by a full conviction that the scene does not close with life—that his struggles arising from the weakness of nature and the strength of habit will be turned into triumphs—that his career in the tracks of wisdom and goodness will be both swifter and smoother—and those generous ardors with which he glows towards heaven ie the perfection and immortality of virtue will find their adequate object and exercise in a sphere proportionably enlarged incorruptible immortal on the other hand what an inexpressible damp must it be to the good man to dread the total extinction of that light and virtue without which life nay immortality itself were not worth a single wish proof from the inequality of present distributions many writers draw their proofs of the immortality of the soul and of a future state of rewards and punishments from the unequal distribution of these here it cannot be dissembled that wicked men often escape the outward punishment due to their crimes and do not feel the inward in that measure their demerit seems to require partly from the callousness induced upon their nature by the habits of vice and     partly from the dissipation of their minds abroad by pleasure or business—and sometimes good men do not reap all the natural and genuine fruits of their virtue through the many unforeseen or unavoidable calamities in which they are involved this no doubt upon the supposition of an allwise and good providence where an argument and a strong one too for a future state in which those inequalities shall be corrected but unless we suppose a prepollent good order in the present scene of things we weaken the proof of the divine administration and the presumption of any better order in any future period of it belief of immortality c a great support amidst trials from section the second of this book it appears that virtue has present rewards and vice present punishments annexed to it such rewards and punishments as make virtue in most cases that happen far more eligible than vice but in the infinite variety of human contingencies it may sometimes fall out that the inflexible practice of virtue shall deprive a man of considerable advantages to himself his family or friends which he might gain by a welltimed piece of roguery suppose by betraying his trust voting against his conscience selling his country or any other crime where the security against discovery shall heighten the temptation or it may happen that a strict adherence to his honour to his religion to the cause of liberty and virtue shall expose him or his family to the loss of every thing nay to poverty slavery death itself or to torments far more intolerable now what shall secure a mans virtue in circumstances of such trial what shall enforce the obligations of conscience against the allurements of so many interests the dread of so many and so terrible evils and the almost unsurmountable aversion of human nature to excessive pain the conflict is the greater when the circumstances of the crime are such as easily admit a variety of alleviations from necessity natural affection love to ones family or friends perhaps in indigence these will give it even the air of virtue add to all that the crime may be thought to have few bad consequences—may be easily concealed—or imagined possible to be retrieved in a good measure by future good conduct it is obvious to which side most men will lean in such a case and how much need there is of a balance in the opposite scale from   0 the consideration of a god of a providence and of an immortal state of retribution to keep the mind firm and uncorrupt in those or like instances of singular trial or distress in the general course of life but without supposing such peculiar instances a sense of a governing mind and a persuasion that virtue is not only befriended by him here but will be crowned by him hereafter with rewards suitable to its nature vast in themselves and immortal in their duration must be not only a mighty support and incentive to the practice of virtue but a strong barrier against vice the thoughts of an almighty judge and of an impartial future reckoning are often alarming inexpressibly so even to the stoutest offenders on the other hand how supporting must it be to the good man to think that he acts under the eye of his friend as well as judge how improving to consider the present state as connected with a future one and every relation in which he stands as a school of discipline for his affections every trial as the exercise of some virtue and the virtuous deeds which result from both as introductory to higher scenes of action and enjoyment finally how transporting is it to view death as his discharge from the warfare of mortality and a triumphant entry into a state of freedom security and perfection in which knowledge and wisdom shall break upon him from every quarter where each faculty shall have its proper object and his virtue which was often damped or defeated here shall be enthroned in undisturbed and eternal empire advantages of the christian scheme and its connection with natural religion or morality on reviewing this short system of morals and the motives which support and enforce it and comparing both with the christian scheme what light and vigour do they borrow from thence how clearly and fully does christianity lay open the connections of our nature both material and immaterial and future as well as present what an ample and beautiful detail does it present of the duties we owe to god to society and ourselves promulgated in the most simple intelligible and popular manner divested of every partiality of sect or nation and adapted to the general state of mankind with what bright and alluring examples does it illustrate and recommend the practice of those duties     and with what mighty sanctions does it enforce that practice how strongly does it describe the corruptions of our nature the deviations of our life from the rule of duty and the causes of both how marvellous and benevolent a plan of redemption does it unfold by which those corruptions may be remedied and our nature restored from its deviations to transcendent heights of virtue and piety finally what a fair and comprehensive prospect does it give us of the administration of god of which it represents the present state only as a small period and a period of warfare and trial how solemn and unbounded are the scenes which it opens beyond it the resurrection of the dead the general judgment the equal distribution of rewards and punishments to the good and the bad and the full completion of divine wisdom and goodness in the final establishment of order perfection and happiness—how glorious then is that scheme of religion and how worthy of affection as well as of admiration which by making such discoveries and affording such assistances has disclosed the unfading fruits and triumphs of virtue and secured its interests beyond the power of time and chance conclusion recapitulation we have now considered the constitution and connections of man and deduced the several duties resulting from both we have investigated some of the methods by which his constitution may be preserved in a sound and healthful state or restored to it we have enquired into the final causes of his constitution and found its admirable harmony with his situation and lastly we have enumerated the principal motives which inforce the practice of the duties incumbent on a creature so constituted and so situated result from this deduction it appears that man is a creature endued with a variety of senses powers and passions subject to a variety of wants and dangers environed with many natural and capable of forming many civil connections bound to many duties in consequence of     such a nature such a situation and such connections and susceptible of many enjoyments in the discharge of them—it farther appears that the sum of those duties may be reduced to such a conduct of his senses powers and passions as is duly proportioned to his wants to his dangers and to his connections—that this conduct is most approved in the mean time and yields the most refined and lasting pleasures afterwards—that particularly the exercise of the public affections is attended with enjoyments the greatest in dignity and duration—and in the largest sum of such pleasures and enjoyments his highest happiness consists therefore to keep those refined sources of enjoyment always open and in cases of competition to sacrifice the lower kinds ie those of sense and appetite to the higher ie to those of reason of virtue and piety is not real selfdenial but the truest wisdom and the justest estimate of happiness—and to shut up the nobler springs or to sacrifice the higher to the lower kinds is not selfindulgence but the height of folly and a wrong calculation of happiness the happiest youth therefore he who in his youth improves his intellectual powers in the search of truth and useful knowledge and refines and strengthens his moral and active powers by the love of virtue for the service of his friends his country and mankind who is animated by true glory exalted by sacred friendship for social and softened by virtuous love for domestic life who lays his heart open to every other mild and generous affection and who to all these adds a sober masculine piety equally remote from superstition and enthusiasm that man enjoys the most agreeable youth and lays in the richest fund for the honourable action and happy enjoyment of the succeeding periods of life the happiest manhood he who in manhood keeps the defensive and private passions under the wisest restraint who forms the most select and virtuous friendships who seeks after fame wealth and power in the road of truth and virtue and if he cannot find them in that road generously despises them who in his private character and connections gives fullest scope to the tender and manly passions and in his public character and connections     serves his country and mankind in the most upright and disinterested manner who in fine enjoys the goods of life with the greatest moderation bears its ills with the greatest fortitude and in those various circumstances of duty and trial maintains and expresses an habitual and supreme reverence and love of god that man is the worthiest character in this stage of life passes through it with the highest satisfaction and dignity and paves the way to the most easy and honourable oldage the happiest oldage finally he who in the decline of life preserves himself most exempt from the chagrins incident to that period cherishes the most equal and kind affections uses his experience wisdom and authority in the most fatherly and venerable manner acts under a sense of the inspection and with a view to the approbation of his maker is daily aspiring after immortality and ripening apace for it and having sustained his part with integrity and consistency to the last quits the stage with a modest and graceful triumph this is the best this is the happiest oldman the happiest life therefore that whole life of youth manhood and oldage which is spent after this manner is the best and the happiest life the good man he who has the strongest original propension to such sentiments and dispositions has the best natural temper he who cultivates them with the greatest care is the most virtuous character the virtuous  he who knows to indulge them in the most discreet and consistent manner is the wisest the wise the fortunate man  and he who with the largest capacities has the best opportunities of indulging them is the most fortunate a life according to nature to form our life upon this plan is to follow nature that is to say to act in a conformity to our original constitution and in a subordination to the eternal order of things and by acting in this manner so benevolently are we formed by our common parent we effectually promote and secure our highest interest duty wisdom and happiness are one  thus at last it appears and who would not rejoice in so divine a constitution that duty wisdom and happiness coincide and are one     the sum and perfection of virtue to conclude virtue is the highest exercise and improvement of reason the integrity the harmony and just balance of affection the health strength and beauty of the mind the perfection of virtue is to give reason free scope to obey the authority of conscience with alacrity to exercise the defensive passions with fortitude the private with temperance the public with justice and all of them with prudence that is in a due proportion to each other and an entire subserviency to a calm diffusive benevolence—to adore and love god with a disinterested and unrivalled affection and to acquiesce in his providence with a joyful resignation every approach to this standard is an approach to perfection and happiness and every deviation from it a deviation to vice and misery a noble and joyful corollary from this whole review of human nature the most divine and joyful of all truths breaks upon us with full evidence and lustre that man is liberally provided with senses and capacities for enjoying happiness furnished with means for attaining it taught by his nature where it lies prompted by his passions within and his condition without powerfully to seek it and by the wise and benevolent order of heaven often conducted to the welfare of the particular and always made subservient to the good of the universal system f i n i s     a brief account of the nature progress and origin of philosophy delivered by the late mr david fordyce p p marish col abdn to his scholars before they begun their philosophical course anno         philosophy a thing much talked of but little understood by the generality is defined by cicero the great interpreter of the greecian philosophy the knowledge of things divine  humane  but the definition of it given by pythagoras seems to express the nature with much more clearness  precisness he calls philosophy the knowledge of things which are of being which have a real existence or still more distinctly philosophy may be described to be the study  knowledge of the nature  laws of things  their established connections with proper reasonings upon them   the to pan universe or which system of things is independant on man who is only a part  perhaps a very inconsiderable one of the great whole for the supreme being by whom the world was made has formed the natures  connections of things  by laws adapted to the peculiar constitutions of his creatures  productive of the greatest good upon the whole does wisely produce every change  event that happens in the universe the operation of the deity by those laws or according to those settled rules  the regular  uniform alterations of things produced by them are named the course or phenomena of nature or the providence of god   the almighty god has placed upon this earth a great variety of sensible  intellectual beings rising the one above the other in a beautiful     state of perfection yet on man alone has he bestowed senses  powers which fit him for examining the nature  laws of the universe with abilities to deduce from thence in some measure the knowledge of the deity of nature  his own obligations in duty   but tho men have those superior powers they cannot attain to knowledge without labour  attention we come into the world destitute of the knowledge of things ignorant of ourselves  of our connections with those beings that surround us  of the relation of things to each other by slow degrees we receive our different perceptions or ideas of things above us  learn by experience what feelings we shall have in certain given circumstances  what connections our ideas have among themselves  by what means alterations may be made in things without us or in the perceptions of ourselves  others hence it is evident that setting aside sovreign instruction true knowledge must be acquired by slow degrees from experience  observation  that it will always be proportionate to the largeness  extent of our experience   the powers of our minds tho noble of themselves  admirably fitted for our present state of probation  this infancy of our existence are limited  narrow  unable at one view to take in the whole august drama of nature or providence which is presented to us  acted before us for while we are intent upon one scene an infinity of others skip  pass by us without being observed  of that to which we do attend many parts escape the notice of the most accurate spectator was man therefore to owe his whole stock of knowledge to the gleanings of his own observation during this short period of his present life his acquisitions would be very inconsiderable but to remedy this inconveniency the bountiful author of our nature has made us social creatures  by giving us power to communicate our observations to one another has enabled us to reap the benefit of the experience of others who have examined different parts of nature or perhaps the same part more accurately than ourselves   the knowledge then of the nature laws  connections of things is as has been observed philosophy and they who apply to the study of these  from thence deduce rules for the conduct  improvement of human life are philosophers they who consider things as they are     or as they exist  draw right conclusions from thence are true philosophers but they who without regard to fact or nature indulge themselves in framing systems to which they afterwards reduce all appearances are notwithstanding their ingenuity  subtilty to be reckoned only the corrupters  enemies of true learning   from this short deduction concerning the nature of philosophy  the origin of our knowledge it will appear that in the early ages of the world the beginnings of philosophy have been very inconsiderable  its progress slow for before societies were constituted  arts  sciences invented  separated the attention of the generality of mankind was turned upon procuring the necessaries of life and their wandring  unsettled way of life before the establishment of states  politics was doubtless a very great obstacle to the progress of knowledge which takes deepest root  spreads widest amidst ease  security we may therefore expect to find the beginnings of arts  sciences in those places where the first governments  societies were formed   as the east countries were first peopled  formed into empires  governments science took its rise in them  spread from thence thro the rest of the world now the first  most ancient kingdom seems to have been that of egypt for the joint testimony of all antiquity concurs in asserting that the neighbouring nations borrowed from this mother land both their religion  philosophy indeed we only grope in the dark about the high egyptian antiquities as there are few or no monuments of egyptian wisdom transmitted to us the books ascribed to hermes trismegistis  tho very antient are spurious the way their priests had of concealing their science  philosophy not only in characters unknown to the vulgar but likewise in hieroglyphics or sacred sculpture  other mysterious symbols which none understood but the priests or those initiated by them  their great shyness in admitting initiates to the mysteries are among the principal reasons of our ignorance     of the egyptian learning diodorus  informs us that their chief study lay in geometry arithmetick  astronomy  indeed the situation  circumstances of their country which was annually overflown by the nile put them upon studying them that they might the better ascertain  secure their property and arithmetic was not only necessary to assist them in their measurings  geometrical problems but was peculiarly necessary in the common practice  commerce of life in so great  civilized a nation their astronomy was chiefly adapted to the uses of agriculture  the settling their calendar  festivals politics  its inseparable attendant morals were likewise much studied here their architecture  the other elegant arts of life they seem to have carried to the utmost length having exhibited the noblest specimens of symmetry  grandeur in their publick works they were likewise the first who collected libraries those treasures of science which they called the store house of the remedies of the soul   next to the egyptians the assyrians persians  indians are recorded for the wisdom of their magi  brachmans of whose principles we have but a very lame account left us the assyrians are reckoned among the first who applied to letters  the first imperial school was at babylon which continued till nebuchadnezar the great  daniels time the chaldaeans were reckoned their wise men who were also called their magi daniel was set over their colleges  accademies by the king whence tis probable that they applied to studies of a legitimate kind  to natural knowledge as well as to astrology  other insignificant arts they were celebrated chiefly for their skill in geneaology  astronomy pythagoras went among them to learn the motion of the stars  the origin of the world on the two principal heads of natural philosophy viz κοσμοσυσασις  κοσμογονια or the constitution  generation of things they thought that the matter of the world was eternal but that it had the form  order from the divine     providence they ascribed the invention of their philosophy to zoroaster who reduced it to a system the persians did the same whose magi or wise men presided over the education of the royal children they studied philosophy divinity  politics  taught the period  renovation of the world they believed that the elements  stars of heaven were gods of whom they chiefly adored the fire  sun  by the name of jupiter understood the whole circumference of the heavens the indian brachmans or gymnosophists affected a solitary way of life  underwent great austerity they taught a future state  inculcated the offices of justice  virtue besides their morals they applied to physiology  astronomy  believed the formation of our world from water but of the universe from other principles the souls incorruptibility and the palingenesia or regeneration of all things in a word all the ancient kingdoms boasted of their learned men the phenicians had their sanhuniathon   were celebrated as the first who invented or at least introduced letters  characters under cadmus into greece they were likewise famous for their skill in astronomy navigation arithmetic mechanics  the other arts of a civilized life to which indeed their extensive commerce with the rest of the world did in a manner entitle them the chinese were celebrated for their skill in religion politics  morals which they principally owed to their great confucius even the barbarous northern nations the germans britons  the ancient celts had their learned druids  bards whose knowledge was chiefly traditionary or patroparodotoc for we do not hear that they committed any thing to writing which is the reason why we know so little about their philosophy or maxims  0 but leaving those things which are buried in obscurity we proceed to greece that favourite country where arts  sciences made quickest progress  arrived at their greatest perfection and here we   0 may trace the greek learning from its original having proper records to depend on these inform us that greece was formd with colonies from egypt and the other eastern nations who we may believe carried the religion  arts of their parent country along with them and indeed the learning of ancient greece wore the strongest features of resemblance to the egyptian consisting chiefly in fables  allegories short but pithy sentences  dark enigmas    the poets orpheus linus  hesiod are amongst the earliest philosophers of greece for the philosophic poetic  often legislative characters were joined in the same persons there being as yet no separation of the sciences the subjects which those old poets sung required a considerable acquaintance with nature being the θεαγονια or birth of the gods or the generation of things hesiod  whose θεαγονια birth of the gods has been preserved to our day has interwoven with his poems many moral reflections  precepts which show him well acquainted with morals  life orpheus employed musick or numbers  verse to humanize  soften the minds of his rude  savage cotemporaries  to insinuate his moral precepts with a more persuasive  irresistable charm in a word all the greek poets of note seem to have made no inconsiderable progress in philosophy and indeed if we consider as an imitator of nature every poet must be a philosopher for how can one copy what he knows not or imitate it    the first who made it their business to instruct their country men  upon that account were dignifyed with the name of σοφοι or wise men were the seven famous contemporaries commonly called the seven wise men of greece viz thales of miletus pittacus of mytellene bias of pryene solon of athens cleobulus of lindus miso of lycaonia  chylo of lacedemon they flourished betwixt the  0th and  0th olympiad 〈  0–  0 bc〉  excepting thales were all legislators in their respective states the credit of solon was much increasd by a remarkable instance of his modesty which happened on the following     occasion some young men of ionia bought a draught of the milesian fishermen when the net was drawn there was found in it a golden tripod of great value hereupon there arose a dispute  the oracle of delphi was consulted which returned this answer that it should be given to the wisest the milesians presented it to thales he sent it to bias he again to pittacus  so going thro all the seven it came at last to solon who affirming the deity to be the wisest consecrated the tripod to apollo the knowledge of the σοφοι wise men was communicated in short sentences or apothegms several of which are transmitted to us by ancient writers such as γνωθι σεαυτον know thyself they who have a mind to know more particulars about the early sages may consult diogenes laertius  plutarch     thales was the founder of the ionic sect or school as it was called  flourished  00 years after the taking of troy he was one of the first philosophers who travelled for the improvement of knowledge of men  things  who treated of nature simply without the disguise of fable or shadowings of allegory he taught the immortality of the soul marked the solstices  equinoxes inscribed triangles in circles  foretold the eclipses of the sun he thought water the first principle of all things and anaxagoras his follower set a mind over this fluid mass  explained the digestion of this mass into order by the sole power of gravity the ionic philosophers thought that the celestial regions consisted of a thing subtile or fluid that the planets were opaque bodies  the fixed stars firey nor were they ignorant of the earths motion after thales philosophy became a profession  was taught by anaximander  pythagoras  his disciples the latter was the founder of the italic school heard thales  phericydes  flourished about the  0th olympiad 〈  0–    bc〉 that is the  th or  th century before christ he to wit pythagoras travelled likewise in search of knowledge     thro egypt chaldea  phenicia he spent    years among the egyptian priests visited the oracles of delphi delos  crete was initiated into all the mysteries of the barbarians as well as greecians  instructed in the whole learning of the east he left samos  went to the south of italy called at that time magna greecia now the kingdom of naples  set up a school at crotona about the   d olympiad 〈    bc〉 pythagoras formed his philosophy on the egyptian plan which he delivered chiefly in numbers  numerical symbols for he reckoned numbers the causes  principles of things  accordingly held the number four τετραχις in great veneration which some explain of the jewish τετραγραμματον or the name jehovah it was not till after five years silence in a great variety of preparation in previous trials that his scholars were admitted to the full knowledge of his doctrine he made great improvements in geometry arithmetic  music  applied proportion of numbers  harmony to every thing or at least made them his ordinary symbols he invented the   th proposition of euclids first book  is said to have offered an hecatomb on that account he was so modest 〈he refused〉 the appellation of σοφος wise  assumed that humble one of φιλοσοφος a lover of wisdom he divided philosophy into theoretical  practical the end of the first is truth and to wonder at nothing  that of the other virtue  the liberty of the soul which he reckoned confined in the body as in a prison his doctrine of the transmigration of souls is well known to promote the enlargement or disengagement of the mind he prescribed a very spare diet forbade the eating of flesh or killing of animals either for food or sacrifice he himself lived on honey bread herbs  water his direction to enquire into the actions of the day every evening is justly celebrated he observed so much order design  proportion in the structure of the universe that he gave it the name κοσμος order he wrote several books which are all lost the golden verses of pythagoras tho they contain the sum of the pythagorean doctrine were not wrote by him but by epicharmus or empedocles pythagoras thought the earth moveable  placed the sun in the center which from him is called the pythagorean system he placed the comets without     air  set them among the planets  reckoned that the heavens were fluid  oetherial  that the stars were so many worlds you will find more particulars concerning pythagoras  his doctrine related by diogenes laertius iamblicus  porphery who have wrote his life  intermixed with it many ridiculous stories of the italic school were architus tarentinus ocellus lucanus epicharmus empedocles timaeus locrus and a great many others    to thales in the ionic school succeeded anaximander a milesian who invented gnomics or dialing   observed the obliquity of the zodiac  likewise observed equinoxes to him again succeeded anaximenes who held that air was the first principle of all things after him came anaxagoras who tho born to a great fortune left all to apply to philosophy in the  0th year of his age the first of the   th olympiad 〈  0 bc〉 he went to athens where he continued  0 years  for his great wisdom got the name of nouc or mind he was banished from athens in the  d year of the   d olympiad 〈  0 bc〉  retiring to lampsachon spent the rest of his days there archilaus was the scholar of anaxagoras master of socrates the celebrated athenian philosopher about the time of anaximander  archilaus flourished xenophanes the colophonian the founder of the eleatic sect which was a miscellaneous school consisting of philosophers differing in nation opinions  manners xenophanes thought there were innumerable worlds infinite suns  moons eternal  unchangeable parmenides one of this sect admitted an origin of things  that from fire  earth as elements herein he agreed with archilaus for the eliatics differ little from the ionics about the origin of things if they admitted any for some of them took away all motion without which there can be neither generation nor corruption some include leusippus  democrates in this sect who brought in the hypothesis of atoms  with that a sounder way of philosophizing by considering the state motion figure situation  bulk of bodies estimating their powers  explaining their     effects from thence not seeking as the italic  other philosophers the principles of bodies  their power among numbers proportions ideas  the like leusippus owned the earths motion about its axis  was followed by democrates in physics who conversed with the magi the chaldean priests  arabians the attention of the ionics from thaless time had been almost wholly employed in natural philosophy or physics in which very small progress was made for a reason to be mentioned afterwards it was socrates that gave the proper turn to learning  therefore is justly reckoned the father of true philosophy    socrates was born at athens in the   th olympiad 〈   –    bc〉 his father was sophroniscus a statuary  his mother phaenoreta a midwife he followed for some time his fathers profession but soon discovered such a genius and love for learning that crito a rich athenian took him from the shop  gave him a liberal education having observed of how little advantage the philosophy then in repute was in life socrates as cicero expresses it recalled philosophy from the hidden  obscure subjects about which his predecessors had busied themselves  brought it down to common life to enquire into good  evil virtue  vice  their consequences hence he is said to have fetcht philosophy from the heavens  to have introduced it into cities houses  families man was the subject of his philosophy  its scope was to make men wiser better  fitter for social  private life by inculcating the duties of religion  virtue his method of teaching was remarkable being admirably adapted to human nature it was by asking questions beginning at the most plain  simple  proceeding from the answers given to others of a higher more general  abstracted nature he himself all the while affirming nothing his method was founded upon the belief he had of the preexistence of souls whose former knowledge was lost by being immersed in the body  brought to remembrance again by instruction or the method of interrogation on this account he humourously used to say that his art had some affinity to his mothers for tho barren himself he assisted in bringing forth the births of others or educing those latent principles of knowledge with which the mind of man was originally stored his modesty was so great that he constantly said that he knew nothing save only that he knew     nothing  was for this saying honoured with the title of the wisest man by the oracle of apollo we are not however to conclude from this that socrates was a sceptic he seems only to have had a just sense of the weakness of human understanding to have shunned determining in speculative points  thought the great end of philosophy was to enforce with proper inducements the practice of virtue he saw through the absurdity of the popular religion  thought that god made the world knew all things  governed the universe by his providence he taught the immortality of the soul  supported that doctrine by a variety of arguments  besides inculcated a future state of rewards for the good  punishments for the wicked  in a word he made such improvements in moral philosophy that he seemed to have been the first that had just notions of the nature of man  his duty in order to lay the deeper foundations for a genuine philosophy he endeavoured to remove the rubbish that lay in his way those false opinions inveterate prejudices  high pretensions to wisdom which overrun greece at that time for this purpose by his interrogatory method of reasoning from him called the socratic way  likewise by a delicate  refined irony he exposed the sophists those high pretenders to wisdom who without any real knowledge pretended to know every thing  who professed to teach the art of speaking for  against every thing a race of men who then pestered the several cities of greece  took upon them the care  education of the youth in so ridiculous a light did he place them by his well timed  artful railery  so thoroughly did he confute the sham pretensions of those quacks  smatterers in learning that they concerted a design to bring about his ruin aristophanes the comedian at their instigation introduced him upon the stage  by dressing him up in a false  unnatural character made this great man who with a patience truly philosophical was a spectator of the play ridiculous to the people  at last one miletus accused him before the senate of despising the gods whom the city believd  introducing new deities and of corrupting the youth by his philosophy to the lasting reproach of his judges this extra   ordinary  virtuous person was condemned to death the day before the execution of this sentence he reasoned with his friends concerning the immortality of the soul  expressed a particular pleasure in the hopes of meeting with homer hesiod  other great men who had died before him in the evening the executioner brought him a cup of poison which with a chearful  undaunted mind he drunk of  soon after expired in the  st year of the   th olympiad 〈 00 bc〉 the athenians were soon so much ashamed of this infamous deed that they put his accusers to death tis generally thought that socrates wrote nothing we have a full account of his life  philosophy in the writings of his scholars xenophon aeschines  plato in the memorable things of socrates wrote by xenophon we have the best account of his reasoning  likewise in the dialogues of aeschines for plato in his dialogues has intermixt a great many of his own 〈ideas〉 which socrates never taught  has likewise adorned them with a profounder erudition  more laboured  florid eloquence than socrates used in his common conversation among his schollars were xenophon aeschines plato aristippus phaedo euclid of megara cebes  many others    xenophon  aeschines both athenians were particular favourites of socrates  committed his conversations in that simple  familiar way  manner in which socrates talked  debated some of which have happily reached our times xenophon was the son of gyrgilles  was born about the   d olympiad 〈    bc〉  he was in the peloponnesian war along with socrates  ever after followed a military life he attended cyrus the younger in his expedition into asia against artaxerxes the king of persia  is justly celebrated for that amazing instance of his wisdom  valour the conducting the extraordinary retreat of the greeks after the defeat of cyrus he died at corinth about the  0 th olympiad 〈  0 bc〉 his books are reckoned among the purest of the greek classics  discover him to have been a fine gentleman an able captain  a great scholar cebes of thebes another     of socratess scholars wrote several dialogues one of which viz the tablature or picture that admirable draught of human life has escaped the injury of time 0    aristippus of cyrene a scholar of socrates but differing widely from the practice of his master founded the cyrenaic sect they entirely rejected virtue as a principle of action amiable in itself  said that justice  honesty were only the institution of men they made pleasure the ultimate end of all their actions  virtue had no farther place in their system than it was thought expedient or necessary to produce pleasure this sect was also called hedonic from the name ἥδονη or pleasure  was divided into a great many branches one of which called theodorians from theodorus their head made profession of downright atheism phaedo the elian  euclid of megara were two other scholars of socrates the first was the author of the eliac  the last of the megaric sect tho we have no remains of the eliac philosophy yet we have reason to believe it differed very little from the socratic the megaric sect applied themselves mostly to the study of logic  from thence were named dialektikon or reasoners or logicians    antisthenes another scholar of socrates founded the sect of the cynics  had the famous diogenes for his scholar they had learned from socrates that morality was the usefullest of all sciences  from this they concluded absurdly enough that all other arts  sciences were to be despised their foundamental maxim was to live in conformity to virtue which they said was sufficient to make men happy they sought liberty  independency as the greatest good the gods said they stand in need of nothing  those that stand in need of few things do most resemble them to procure this happy independency they pretended to look upon honour  riches with perfect indifferency  to renounce all the inconveniencies of life diogenes would have no other habitation than a tub  when he found that he could drink     out of the hollow of his hand he threw away his wooden cup as a superfluity alexander the great coming to visit diogenes in his tub asked him what he desired of him nothing said the philosopher but that you would not stand between me  the sun the cynics under pretence of following nature  living independently observed no decency in their conduct  treated all the world with the utmost contempt the stoicks shot out as a branch from this sect who from an enthusiasm of temper pushed their philosophy beyond the bounds of nature  placed virtue in a total exemption from passion or at least from the smallest degree of perturbation of mind so that they alledged their virtuous man was happy in evry state  circumstance of life liber honouratus pulcher rex denique regum   we have several noble relicks of the stoical philosophy transmitted down to us from ancient times in which we find the noblest precepts for the conduct of life  particularly for attaining that tranquility of mind  indifference about external things without some degrees of which no man can be tollerably happy in this mixed uncertain  complicated scene of things the stoics however were more celebrated for their morals than for their physics they believed the conflagration of the world called god the artificer of all things the λογον δημιουρχον και τεχνικον under whom they placed passive matter they distinguished between σοιχεια   elements  αρχαι principles reckoning the latter ungenerated uncorporeal  uncompounded by the former perhaps they understood the simple unformed χυλη mass  distinguished it from body they believed that a fire was the first of bodies which were made  the rest of the elements of it  of both all kind of mixed bodies which they said were again resolved into fire they called the sun πυρ ειλικρινης pure fire the moon γεωδεσερα of an earthly matter  the stars πυρινα of a firey nature  likewise that some of them were higher than others in which they are supported by the modern philosophy their fate signified the unchangeable      immoveable order  series of things by which the gods themselves were governed in their productions of things    of all the scholars of socrates plato made the greatest figure he was born at athens in the   th olympiad 〈    bc〉 after he had heard  studied under socrates he travelled into egypt  italy  returning to athens he taught philosophy in the accademy the gymnasium or place of exercise in the suburbs of the city environed with woods  adorned with beautiful walks named from accademus a private gentleman to whom it first belonged inter sylvas accademi quarere verum   hence his followers got the name of accademics the philosophy which he taught was a compound of the socratic  pythagoric doctrines  was chiefly divided into these three parts ethics physics  dialectics the knowledge of the platonic philosophy is to be got from the works of its author which are justly held in the greatest esteem he wrote in the way of dialogues in which socrates makes one of the principal speakers  generally confutes the bombast or subtle sophists by the depths of his socratic reasoning joined with an exquisite strain of raillery his books de republica  legibus of the commonwealth  the laws show him to have been an able politician  deep scholar the platonics did as the pythagoreans apply more to the contemplation of ratios  abstract proportions than of matter  its properties we have a sketch of platos philosophy in his timaeus he assigned geometrical figures to the elements  compounds  places them geometrically he makes three principles of all things the νους deity χυλη matter  his ιδεα idea or exemplary cause or rather his proportion  ideas many traces of the old learning  the ancient world are to be found in his timaeus his politicus  phaedo which he brought from egypt  the pillar of hermes his genius in theology  morality was by the ancients esteemed divine  0 arcesilaus one of the successors of plato about the time of the   0  0 th olympiad 〈    bc〉 founded the middle accademy his way was to doubt of every thing in arguing for and against all manner of questions he went a great deal farther than socrates in sceptical philosophy  said that he could not be certain even of this that he knew nothing carneades did afterwards soften this scepticism a little by allowing that there was no truth which did not admit of some belief yet there were such degrees of probability as were sufficient to determine men this was the new or third accademy carneades was sent from athens in company with diogenes the cynic  critolaus the peripatetic on an embassy to rome about the    th year after the building of the city he  the other two taught in different places of the city  were resorted to by the roman youth who drank in their philosophy with the utmost avidity which made old cato the censor move in the senate to dispatch them as soon as possible lest the roman youth who he said were grown enthusiastically mad after greecian arts  learning should be diverted from a military life to the study of philosophy    aristotle the most famous of platos scholars was born at stagiola   a city of thrace in the first year of the   th olympiad 〈    bc〉 when he was    years of age he came to athens where he soon distinguished himself  became a favourite disciple of plato in the  th year of the  0 th olympiad 〈    bc〉 at the request of king philip he went into macedonia and became tutor to alexander the great not only in ethics  politics but in all the other sciences in the first year of the    th olympiad 〈    bc〉 philip dyd  aristotle returned to athens where he taught in the lycaeum a place in the suburbs built by pericles for exercising the citizens in walking up  down therein hence he  his schollars got the name of peripatetics or walkers he was the first who reduced the scattered precepts of philosophy into a system  left treatises wrote professedly on logic metaphysics ethics  physics all which shew a judgment  accuteness of penetration superior to most men he wrote on rhetoric poetry  natural history  other subjects in the two former treatises he discovers a great insight     in the human nature  large acquaintance with fine writing and indeed he is universally acknowledged to have been a very comprehensive  extraordinary genius the grand principle of his ethics is that every virtue consists in the mean or middle between two extremes both of which are vicious the peripatetic principles may be gathered from aristotles writings  are well explained by cicero in so far as they differ from the stoical principles to aristotle in the peripatetic school succeeded theophrastus strato lycon aristo critolaus diodorus c the aristotelians believed the world to be eternal as well as to its form as to its matter  all the creatures in it begitting  begotten in an infinite series with all its plants  various furniture aristotle thought the heavens were of adamant  the stars fixed like golden nails in the roofs of their orbits  these orbs chained together  all the whole world rolled about in    hours time that the planets were carried about by contrary motions that the matter of the heavens is quite different from all other  immutable into any other he introduced his substantial forms  specific qualities to explain the actions  forces of bodies he said that sensation was performed by an intentional species that providence descended not below the moon that the soul was the εντελεχεια a cant word that signified nothing he was uncertain of the immortality of the soul    epicurus the author of another sect named epicureans was born in the  d year of the  0 th olympiad 〈    bc〉 he began very early to read philosophy particularly the writings of democritus from whence he chiefly borrowed his physics having purchased a pleasant garden at athens he lived there with his friends  disciples  taught philosophy he ascertained that the world was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms falling  clashing one with another in infinite directions thro an immense void without the interposition of an intelligent principle tho he allowed the existence of the gods yet he said they took no care or concern about the world or its affairs but lived at a great distance in immortal peace  in inglorious indolence  by this means subverted the foundations of all religion which is built upon a sense of our connection with god  dependance upon him as the almighty     maker  governor of the world he affirmed that pleasure was the chief end of all our actions  the chief good  that virtue was no farther to be followed than as it produces  tends to pleasure but they are much mistaken who think that epicurus gave himself up to all manner of debauchery on the contrary he recommended temperance  the other virtues as conducive to true happiness yet some of his followers made a very bad use of his doctrine indulging themselves in the greatest sensuality  having no notion of moral happiness the school in the garden was continued till the days of augustus under the successive management of hermochus polystratus dyonisius basilides c epicurus made sense the supreme standard by which we judge of truth said the sun was no bigger than a foot  a half  that the earth was rooted to an infinite extent downward we have a large account of the epicurean doctrine in diogenes laertius  cicero  lucretius carus an elegant latin poet has given us a compleat system of his philosophy of which he was a professed admirer in his poem de rerum natura of the nature of things epicurus died in the second year of the    th olympiad 〈  0 bc〉    zeno contemporary with epicurus founded the stoical sect directly opposite to the principles of epicurus he was at first scholar to crates the cynic then to stilpo the megaric  afterwards heard diodorus cronus and polemon he set up a school in the ποικαλη σοα   painted walk at athens  thence his disciples got the name of stoics the most considerable part of the stoical philosophy was their morality whose fundamental principles were that virtue was the alone good  vice the only ill that pleasure was not good nor pain evil that the passions were preternatural perturbations entirely to be rooted out that men were not born for themselves but for their country  society  that the whole of mans duty was to live according to nature the απαθια or entire freedom from the passions of human nature was certainly impossible to be attained  perhaps was more than the stoics meant when they recommended the mastery over our appetites  passions     for they seem to have taken our passions in too limited a sense for mental disorders or such violent impulses  propensities of soul as are inconsistent with the exercise of reason  destructive of it  in this sense no doubt they are carefully to be subdued but both zeno  epicurus seem to have erred in not considering the whole of mans nature for epicurus viewed him only as a sensible being capable of pleasure  pain whereas zeno regarded only the moral part of his constitution the peripatetic philosophers seem to have had juster notions of the matter when they considered man as a creature formed for the enjoyment both of natural  moral good that is as a sensible  moral being  said that the passions were implanted in his nature for valuable purposes  therefore were not to be extirpated but governed by his reason the stoicks imagined the world or το παν to be an animal whereof god was the soul they maintained a fate or destiny to which gods  men were equally subjected they cultivated dialecticks but made little progress in physics in short they were a natural shoute 〈shoot〉 from the cynics only they refined upon  carried their philosophy to a higher pitch to zeno in the stoical school succeeded cleanthus chrysippus diogenes antipater panatius  posidonius    among the old greek philosophers of note were parmenides leusippus democritus  heraclitus who all especially the two last improved the corpuscular physics which epicurus perfected pyrrho contemporary with aristotle having read the books of democritus  having heard various philosophers gave rise to another sect called sceptics pyrronistics and sometimes zetetics they held nothing certain doubting every thing  said nothing was to be understood or comprehended as absurd as these principles were pyrrho had his admirers  followers such were simon   hecataeus eurylochus  sextus empyricus nay we find still that he has likewise his admirers in modern times who carry his philosophy to as extravagant a pitch as the evil of man can devise or his fancy wish    among this variety of different sects of philosophers it is reasonable     to believe their several systems were neither wholly true nor wholly false polemo of alexandria did therefore in the reign of augustus introduce the eclektic philosophy they who embraced this method espoused none of the systems in the gross but took such doctrines from each as seemed most reasonable every man judging for himself  allowing the same liberty to others having now pointed out the principal stages  periods of philosophy among the greecians it remains just to touch at the barbarian philosophy  its origen the opinions of those whom the greeks entitled barbarians were delivered mostly without proof or reasoning  received because of the authority of the teacher or the reasons are too weak  insufficient to convince we have an instance of this in the conflagration of the world whose causes  process they neither explain nor attempted to prove its truth the same thing may be said with regard to the periods of the world the preexistence  revolution of souls the ancient philosophy never laboured about theories or the demonstration of things from their causes or effects which the modern has attempted not without success but theirs was short  easy by way of questions  answers so that it plainly appears to have been propagated by tradition some derive it from the hebrews from moses  abraham but the former himself was a disciple of the egyptians so that the egyptian learning was before him and as to the arabian job who was a renowned  learned arabian is reckoned elder than moses for several reasons  st because that pious man counteracted the law of moses in offering sacrifices for himself after the examples of noah  others before the law  d because there is no mention made of moses or his exploits in his book  d from the measure of his life which ought to be placed about the third age after the deluge for he lived about  00 years besides his history seems to savour of great antiquity he mentions the first kind of idolatry that of the sun  moon he speaks of sculpture the most ancient kind of writing when he talks of recording his calamities his wealth is counted by his flocks he mentions no sabbath or instituted law  followed the precepts of noah josephus derives learning from abraham but without proof from sacred or prophane history besides tis improbable     that he shoude instruct the egyptians in the space of the two years he lived among them therefore it is more probable that the sciences derived their origin from a higher source even noah the common parent of the jews  nations he is said to have delivered moral precepts to his descendants called the precepts of the noachides  therefore why not opinions  doctrines also in short it is highly probable that he knew the greatest part of the wisdom of the long lived antidiluvian patriarchs since he had  00 years commerce with them  consequently that from him as from the fountain head were derived those streams of ancient learning which flowed through the old world of which only some small drops have descended to us    there is a contest betwixt the egyptians  hebrews about their precedency  antiquity in learning that none of the philosophers travelled among the latter to gather knowledge is a plain evidence that they were not renowned for letters we do not read that they excelled in natural or mathematical knowledge tho solomon certainly was an eminent naturalist their schools were formed for religion  prophecy rather than for the sciences no nation did ever abound so much in prophets  inspired men so that a divine virtue seems to have been peculiar to their soil  climate they pretended to have preserved among them from the beginning a cabala or secret science containing the mysteries of the natural  invisible world but two things are wanting in this science first the establishing  aggreeing upon certain common principles secondly their ascertaining the use  signification of words and indeed this boasted science of theirs seems to have been a mysterious gibberish or an obscure phraseology rather than the knowledge of things as to their four worlds of emanation creation formation  fabrication we know little of them  their explications of them are themselves inexplicable their ancient cabbala might have some foundation however deformed  vitiated by the moderns  perhaps treated of the origin  gradations of things or the scale of beings but being traditionary it came soon to be lost  so the modern doctors or rabbies in order to fill up this void  to maintain an imaginary character of ancient learning threw in their multiplied fictions till at length it grew up or swelled into the enormous size of the     present cabbala the cabbalists thought that gods or their ensoph contained all things within himself at first  only evolved or unfolded himself when the world was made  that it perishes again by its reflux or resolution into the divinity the opinion of the stoicks was too gross for they restricted every thing to matter  understood by jupiter the simple ether into which they thought the whole world would be finally resolved  then after a state of time would reassume its primitive form  appearance the essenes an ancient sect among the jews resembled the brachmans in their manners  studies their life was most simple  primitive  they applied themselves to the study of the divine nature  the origin of things    tis thought by sir isaac newton   that learning flourished early in arabia or at least in idumaea a country of it learning flourished there from the time of job to the age of solomon if the queen of sheba was of arabia as is highly probable job was a renowned sage among the arabs  had a great knowledge of nature as is evident from his book which is the first  oldest monument of arabic wisdom in it are many arabisms to be found tis probable the magi or wise men of the east who came to adore our saviour at his birth were of arabia because the presents they brought were only of an arabian growth  because the east is commonly used in scripture to signify arabia the zabii or zabaisti   the same with the sabaeans  their priests were famous among the arabians  were a very ancient nation the jews say that abraham was educated in their religion at first but that after he worshipped the true god he left them  inveighed against their doctrines maimonides will have moses to have chiefly regarded their rites      manners in forming his laws their magi were of long continuance  vaunt themselves to be noachides or followers of noah however they worship the sun moon  native genii or daemones job seems to allude hereto when he vindicates himself from the worship of the sun  moon chap    vers       he  his friends were genuine noachides but the zabians  other arabs were degenerate ones both sorts however retain some of the doctrines of the noachides which were the roots of oriental learning pythagoras  democritus visited them we have little account of them for the first ages after christ till in the sixth century with the rise of ishmaelism or the law of mahomet learning began also to revive among them for the arabians or the sarracens penetrating into the west  making conquests in europe with their arms raised a new empire to themselves  by degrees imbibed the greecian  european philosophy as the aristotelian or peripatetick philosophy prevailed chiefly at that time they embraced it  propagated it afterwards with great industry  noise their learned men particularly avicenna  averroes   translated the works of aristotle  gathered all the greecian authors they could find insomuch that they alone seemed to possess them as to the sarracens at the taking of alexandria the great  celebrated library that vast collection of ancient learning which had been collected by the kings of egypt for many ages was by their barbarous  brutal emperour at the instigation of his chief priest ordered to be burned  used as fewel to warm the hot baths after the times of mahomet the arabian learning degenerated into fable  allegory    when the romans extended their empire over greece they became acquainted with the learning  philosophy of that country they had indeed got some taste of greecian workmanship  politeness before by the taking of syracuse which was originally a greecian city  therefore old cato complains that hostile statues had been introduced     into the town from syracuse but those greecian pieces of virtuosoship were rather laid up as rarities to be gazed at or as piles to adorn their temples but the greecian learning  politic arts scarce made any advances till the thousand achaian exiles arrived at rome  were dispersed up  down the country 0 they scattered the first seeds of philosophy in that soil which had been formerly possessed by arms  overrun with the din of war that soil however being strong  fertile did by a happy culture  greater intercourse with greecian wits bring forth a rich crop of philosophers historians poets  orators as philosophers of all sects began to teach there the young romans commenced partizans of this or the other sect as best suited their taste  genius so that among the romans we find the learned men widely differing in their philosophy cicero the orator who contributed more than any other to make his countrymen acquainted with the greek philosophy as is evident from his philosophical works was a new academic  in some things an eclectic cato of utica  brutus who killed caesar were stoics lucullus was an old academic atticus  velleius were epicureans seneca the praeceptor of nero was a strict stoic as was also the famous philosophical emperor marcus antoninus who was both the highest pattern of virtue  the greatest master as well as patron of learning this was the state of philosophy at rome till the decline of the empire when barbarity  ignorance overwhelmed the remains of ancient learning  brought on a night of total and almost universal darkness    the platonists became famous in the  d   th centuries among whom were plotinus porphyrius iamblichus  proclus who spent all their time in explaining  writing mystical  jejune commentaries upon the tenets of the founders of the sect untill the  th century aristotle was but little known in the western world when boethius translated some of his writings the arabians whom we have already mentioned in the eleventh century introduced his philosophy into     spain  from thence sprung the scholastic peripatetic philosophers who overlooked  in a great measure neglected his most beautiful  usefull works viz his morals his politics  rhetoric  spent all their time  pains in writing huge commentaries upon his dialectics or logics  physical works the most lame of all his performances which they employed to furnish out materials for endless debate  to support an unintelligible  monstrous system of theology  0 after the fall of the roman empire  the irruption of the barbarous northern nations all europe continued for many years buried in great ignorance the small remains of knowledge that were to be found were confined to the cells of the monks  other clergy in the  th century the highest ambition of the clergy was to vie with one another in chanting the public service which yet they hardly understood the emperor charlemagne tho a warlick monarch allowed a public school to be opened in the imperial palace under the direction of our famous country man alcuine   on whom he chiefly relied for introducing into france some tincture of that philosophy which was still remaining in brittain as to brittain tho learning had still some footing there in the eighth century it was so totally exterminated from thence in the ninth that throughout the whole kingdom of the west saxons no man could be found who was scholar enough to instruct king alfred then a child in the first elements of reading so that he was in his   th year before he could name the letters of the alphabet when that renowned prince mounted the throne   he became the great restorer of arts in his dominions  gave all encouragement to learned men but these fair appearances were soon succeeded by a night of thicker darkness which quickly overspread the intellectual world to common sense  piety succeeded dreams  fables visionary legends  ridiculous pennances the clergy now utter strangers to all good learning instead of guiding a rude  vitious laity by the precepts of the gospel   0 which they no longer read amused them with forged miracles or overawed them with the ghostly terrors of daemons spectres  chimaeras the see of rome which should have been a pattern to the rest was of all christian churches the most licentious  the pontifical chair often filled with men who instead of adorning their sacred character made human nature itself detestable it was not till late after the sack of constantinople by the turks in the year      that the writings of aristotle began again to be universally known  studied they were then brought away  dispersed through the west part of europe by certain fugitive greeks who had escaped the fury of the ottoman arms the latin translations of his books gave birth as we have said to the scholastic philosophy which was neither that of aristotle entirely nor altogether differing from his they left natural knowledge wholly incultivated to hunt after occult qualities abstract notions  questions of impertinent curiosity by which they rendered the logic their labours turned upon intricate useless  unintelligible    the scholastics were divided into two sorts or sects the nominalists who owed their rise to rucelinus   an englishman the other was called the sect of the realists who had duns scotus   for their champion the titles with which these scholastic leaders were honoured by their followers on account of the sublime reveries they taught are at once magnificent  absurd such as the profound the subtile the marvellous the indefatigable the irrefragable the angelic the seraphic c but these titles prove rather the superlative ignorance of those times than any transcendent merit in the man to whom they were applied friar bacon   however was a great philosopher even in these ignorant times  made many new discoveries in astronomy      perspective in mechanics  chymistry the construction of spectacles of telescopes of all sort of glasses that either magnify or diminish objects the composition of gun powder which bartholinus swartz is thought to have first hit upon almost a century later are some of the many inventions ascribed to him for all which he was in his lifetime calumniated imprisoned  opprest  after his death called a magician who dealt in the black or informal arts the writings of aristotle 〈during the medieval period〉 were both reckoned the fountains of all knowledge  afforded materials for infinite debate  mutual animosities sometimes they were proscribed as heretical  sometimes they were triumphant  acknowledged the great bulwark of orthodoxy in the   th century they were not only read with impunity but every where taught with applause  whoever disputed their orthodoxy—i had almost said their infallibility—was persecuted as an infidel  miscreant after the scholastic philosophy had been adopted into the christian theology far from being of use to explain  ascertain mysteries it served only to darken  render doubtful the most necessary truths by the chicanery of argumentation with which it supplied each sect in defence of their peculiar and favourite illusions    when knowledge began to dawn  the reformation diffused a new light over europe universities were founded and professors were appointed to teach the several sciences nevertheless all ranks  parties blindly following the aristotelian philosophy then in fashion they made no new advances in learning but contented themselves with explaining  defending the systems of the times protestants as well as papists intrenching themselves behind the authority of aristotle  defending their several tenets by the weapons with which he furnished them this unnatural alliance between theology  the peripatetic doctrine rendered the opinions of aristotle sacred so that to dispute them was to pull up  remove the land marks of faith  orthodoxy so that any one who attempted to remove the awful veil of obscurity with which the face of nature was covered  to strick out new lights in science run the hazard of church censure which commonly ended in tortures  death the great end of philosophy which is to make     men wiser  better was wholly neglected  ones reputation as a learned man depended upon his being able to maintain a dispute right or wrong with a variety of subtile sophistical arguments if the disputant happened to bear hard on the system he was immediately  infallibly refuted with a metaphysical distinction or with the authority of aristotle or some of the scholastic doctors all this while the nature  relations of things were not observed philosophy then consisting not of observations made on the laws of motions  properties of bodies but of a set of opinions borrowed at second hand  received without examination if any one set about explaining the phaenomena of nature by second causes or the powers of matter  mechanism he was immediately supposed to have removed the first cause or the all sustaining  all governing providence  consequently was condemned as an atheist as if it had been less honourable to the supreme artist to have the symmetry  perfect mechanism of his works thoroughly understood than to have all the operations of nature in which he is the prime mover resolved into occult qualities substantial  i know not what mysterious nothings happy is it for us that we live in an age when people are allowed to see with their own eyes when the authority of fallible men bear no weight in philosophy  when we are directed to realities as the sole object of true knowledge    such were the dispositions of men  things when sir francis bacon   lord verulam  chancellor of england in the reign of james the sixth appeared upon the stage he was the first who saw thro the cloud in which philosophy had for many ages been wrapped up his vast  penetrating mind soon discovered the absurdity  fruitless insignificancy of the philosophy then in fashion  the impossibility of ever arriving at true knowledge in the beaten tract of disputation  of composing theories  systems without a proper induction of facts and therefore he laboured all he could to open again as he expresses it the commerce between the mind  things which had     been for so long time interrupted he understood well that the business of philosophy was not to support systems but to observe  explain nature  thence in two words he gave a more clear  satisfying account of philosophy than others had done in hundreds of volumes calling it interpretatio natura the interpreter of nature my lords extensive genius led him to peruse the registers of learning in all ages  to consider the state of all the sciences their origin the progress  advances they had made  the things in which they were still defective this put him upon composing that extraordinary work de dignitate  augmentis scientiarum of the dignity  improvement of the sciences in which he shews us a map of the intellectual world what regions of it have been already discovered  cultivated what parts remain still terra incognita or unknown by what means  with what instruments these are to be explored  consequently the great desiderata or blank of science supplied  filled up a book which must be admired and valued while there remains any taste for true learning among the sons of men in his book called his novum organum he has traced out the proper road of experience  observation by which alone we can obtain the true knowledge of things  consequently a proper dominion over nature the first aphorism of this admirable treatise contains more good sense  real learning than all the books that had been wrote on philosophy for a dozen of centuries before him it is this homo naturae minister et interpres tantum facil et intelligit quantum de natura ordine re vel mente observaverit nec amplius scit au potest literally thus man the minister  interpreter of nature can act  understand just in proportion to his experience  observation of the order of nature nor can he know or do any thing further here the foundation both of our knowledge  power is laid in the observation of things  their mutual connexions lord verulam is not to be considered so much the founder of a new sect as the great assertor of human liberty as one who rescued reason  truth from the slavery in which all sects alike had till then held them he was not however the first among the moderns who ventured     to dissent from aristotle ramus patricius bruno severinus   had already attacked the authority of that tyrant in learning who had long reigned as absolutely over the opinions as his restless pupil had of old affected to do over the persons of men but these writers being of the scholastic tribe invented but little that was valuable themselves and as to the real improvements made in some parts of natural knowledge before this great man appeared by gilbert harvy copernicus father paul    some few others they are well known  have been deservedly celebrated we shall afterwards have an occasion frequently to mention some other aphorisms of this great but unhappy man whose writings richly deserve the perusal of all such as wish to be instructed by what they read  to know things  not words    towards the end of the   th century renates de cartes   was the author of a new sect of philosophers called cartesians he said that in order to find out truth we must first doubt of every thing but our own existence accordingly cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am was the only first principle or self evident truth according to his system he maintained the doctrine of innate ideas  established the proof of the existence of god on the idea of a perfect being which he said was natural to the human mind alledging it was presumptuous for man to attempt to discover final causes in the works of god brutes     according to him were mera automata or pieces of machinery  clock work  by the motion of their animal spirits he solved all their actions his physics were meerly chimerical not being founded on experiments but upon data or principles which he took for granted yet he was no mean mathematician  had he applied his geometrical knowledge to facts  the phaenomena of nature he might have considerably improved philosophy the cartesian philosophy was for some time taught in a great many universities  it was heresy in religion as well as philosophy to doubt any of his doctrines but his philosophy is now quite out of fashion  has been justly exploded by a more genuin  august philosophy introduced  cultivated by sir isaac newton  other great philosophers who following the plan traced out to them by lord bacon have erected a noble structure of science beautiful in itself  highly beneficial to mankind    the reformation  the gradual progress of liberty especially in great brittain tended considerably to the improvement of the arts  sciences  the great plan of science which ld bacon had projected put men upon a more genuine  successful method of enquiry accordingly a whole train of philosophers  enquirers into nature arose up from time to time who following the tract pointed out to them by the aforesaid great man built up different parts of the great pile of science in the year      charles the  d king of england erected soon after the restauration the royal society for promoting all kinds of natural knowledge their charter bears date the   d of april of that year a little after that in the year      lewis the   th king of france did by means of the famous mr colbert our countryman establish the royal academy of sciences at paris  provided salaries for some of the members of it in imitation of these the emperor leopol 0 did also found his accademia natura curiosorum or accademy of the curiosities of nature  the king of prussia one of the same kind at berlin and the late czar of muscovy peter alexowitz commonly      very justly called the great who excelled all other princes in his endeavours to improve his own country to instruct  polish a rude  barbarous people by arts sciences  trade erected a society for natural philosophy in his new built city petersburgh by the name of accademia petropolitana these societies have contributed not a little to the advancement of natural knowledge that being the professed design of their institution accordingly the last age  this have produced a great many particular men who have enriched all the branches of philosophy with noble discoveries it may perhaps look like partiality in favour of our own country to say that brittain may boast of the greatest philosophers in every kind of science that ever appeared in the world it were endless to name them all let it suffice to say that some of those who shone in the foremost rank  made the most distinguishing figure were the honourable mr robt boyl   that eminent ornament in the learned world remarkable no less for his singular piety than for his extensive learning  indefatigable application to the several branches of natural knowledge mr wallis   who improved the doctrine of motion in all its parts so as to render it a compleat science but above all sir isaac newton that great name in philosophy who carried it to a higher pitch of perfection than any had done before him we may add to these dr gregory   that celebrated civilian professor of astronomy at oxford mr james gregory   of st andrews dr halley   the famous brothers     the keils john  james   mr derham   who wrote those ingenious pieces the physics  astrotheology hawksby   desaguliers   to name no more that excellent experimentor mr hailes 0 the author of the vegetable statics there were other noble philosophers who have shone in different parts of philosophy viz mr lock   the celebrated author of the essay on the human understanding who contributed more than any other to banish from the schools that unintelligible jargon those insignificant subtilties  perplext logomachies which had prevailed hitherto  who gave us a simple but elegant history of the progress  operation of the human mind cumberland   who gave us a beautiful detail of the laws of nature in the moral world dr samuel clark    many others whom it would be endless to name    it may appear a difficulty to account for the prodigious variety of sentiments  sects among philosophers seeing truth is one unvariable thing but in order to explain this appearance we need only consider     that to the attainment of every end certain means are to be applied  that if the means be either not used at all or misapplied success can never be expected now there is a natural  proper method of attaining to true knowledge as well as any other accomplishment which if neglected must occasion error  contradiction it cannot be too often repeated that there is no real knowledge nor any that can answer a valuable end but what is gathered or copyed from nature or from things themselves that the knowledge of nature is nothing else than the knowledge of facts or realities  their established connections that no rules or precepts of life can be given or any scheme of conduct prescribed but what must suppose a settled course of things conducted in a regular uniform manner that in order to denominate those rules just  to render those schemes successful the course of things must be understood  observed  that all philosophy even the most didactic  practical parts of it must be drawn from the observation of things or at least resolved into it or which is the same thing that the knowledge of truth is the knowledge of fact  whatever speculations are not reduceable to the one or the other of these are chimerical vague  uncertain we may therefore ascribe the various errors of philosophers either to the ambition they had of becoming the founders of sects or the authors of systems or to a prevailing opinion that philosophy was good for nothing if it left any thing in the dark which mistake would lead people to proceed farther than they were warranted by observation  experience or their mistakes may be owing to the fixing too much upon one part of nature considered as detached from the rest taking a particular view of one kind of objects  strenuously asserting them to be none other than they represented them whereas the true philosopher who has got a view of the vast extent of things  is conscious within how narrow a circle the faculties of the human mind are confined      how little the wisest of men can fully comprehend in the works of nature will be far from entertaining high notions of the extent or infallibility of his knowledge but will proceed cautiously in his enquiries  having an attachment to truth alone without regard to sect or parties  their systems will embrace truth wherever he finds it how opposite so ever to his former prepossessions or his future interests    from what has been already advanced in the progress of this short sketch it appears that philosophy is a very extensive thing comprehending all knowledge of whatever kind but according to the common acceptation of the words it extends only to those branches of knowledge which are called the sciences such are logic metaphysics pneumatics ethics  physics logic is that science which from the observation of the nature of the understanding  the other speculative powers of the mind  the laws of our perception  the origin of our knowledge

what you read and do not think you understand unless you have clear  distinct ideas  comprehend the coherence  scope of what you read consider nature or the world as the volume or book of god in the meanest page of which his perfections are legible  consider books as copies of one or more leaves of that stupendous volume γνωθι σεαυτον ie know thyself remember this as the most useful maxim of wisdom without which knowledge will breed vanity  learning become matter of ostentation only after reading ask yourself what you have learned from it  often revise what you have read  0 seek rather to be master of one good book than to glance over a score in a cursory manner timeo hominem unius libri 〈i fear men who know a single book〉 do not desire to hasten too fast in the pursuit of knowledge
