mr maitlands account of inoculating the small pox  london printed for the author by j downing and to be sold by j roberts at the oxfordarms in warwick lane       this account of inoculating the smallpox is most humbly inscribed to their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales  by their royal highnesses most faithful and most obedient humble servant charles maitland  advertisement this short account of inoculating the smallpox bating the later cases annexed was ready for the press some four months since and would then have been published had not their royal highnesses at whose command the operation at newgate was performed been all this while generously intending further to oblige the public by encouraging and promoting other trials of that kind both upon parish children and grown persons but these for certain reasons having hitherto been obstructed if yet they shall be brought to bear care will be taken in due time to give the world a true and faithful relation of them or failing them of any other observable cases in this practice  it has also been thought fit for a further confirmation of the truth to subjoin some certificates from the country under the hands of the persons immediately concerned those trials not having been made as the others here related were in the presence of any one or more of the london physicians  feb          mr maitlands account of inoculating the small pox having understood since my retirement into the country that the late experiment of inoculating the smallpox at newgate has been pretty much talked of and finding withal that the reports of that matter are various and oftentimes contradictory i thought it became me to give the public a plain and honest account of the truth of facts both to prevent if possible any ones being imposed upon as to the trials already made or seared from the practice of it for the future  it is not here my design to offer an essay on the theory of the smallpox or to attempt the best methods of cure i leave that to the learned gentlemen of the profession who i do not question notwithstanding all their best discoveries and observations hitherto made will certainly agree with me that it is a distemper of the most fatal and destructive kind and that far from being possessed of any infallible method or remedy they will own it is many times too too hard for them and very often baffles the most celebrated skill  they cannot then be offended i am sure the better and more candid part of the faculty will not if out of a single view of doing good i here publish to the world a certain method of relieving mankind and rescuing them from the fears and fatal effects of that very loathsome and malignant disease  the method i here propose is no other than that very plain one of raising the small pox by inoculation a method new indeed and utterly unknown here till of late though universally practiced with success all over turkey these threescore years past and in other parts of the east an hundred or for ought we know some hundreds of years before the practice having thus obtained amongst an illiterate sort of people what i here offer to recommend it shall be delivered in the plainest manner and suited to the meanest capacity without the labored embellishments of learning or eloquence and indeed one would think these should not be here wanted to reconcile to this very safe and useful method even persons or a higher rank and more delicate taste especially since they of all sorts of people generally speaking suffer the most witness the havoc made in great families not many months since by that mighty disease which seemed then to go forth like a destroying angel subduing all before it and contemning all human means used to stop its career  it may therefore be hoped that this practice should meet with a kind reception even by them who of all others are most terribly fearful of the prodigious loathsomeness of the distemper and of the ugly and monstrous effects it leaves both on them and their children yet being apprehensive that sloth and laziness illplaced affection and tenderness and it may be some worse dispositions too which i am not willing to suggest may possibly stifle this safe and useful method in its birth i shall here take a little pains to obviate the scruples and objections which are commonly raised against it and in order to this shall first of all give a short and historical account of what i have seen and practiced both in turkey and at london  in the year      when i had the honor to attend the english ambassador and his family at constantinople i had a fair opportunity fully to inform my self of what i had long before heard namely the famous practice of transplanting or raising the small pox by inoculation  my enquiry chiefly turned upon two or three particulars which i thought could i be well satisfied in would go a great way toward convincing me of the mighty advantages and safety of the method and resolving my greatest scruples and difficulties against it  having heard that this contagious disease which for many centuries of years has proved such a terrible scourge to mankind had its first rise in egypt arabia and other parts of the east i thought it proper to enquire first whether it continues still to rage in the turkish dominions in that violent manner it was anciently observed to do and as at times it is known to attack us here and most other parts of europe for should it be found to be always of a milder and more temperate sort than ours why should that people take so very strange and uncommon a way to avoid it i quickly found the case to be quite otherwise being assured besides what i saw with my eyes that the small pox is rather more malignant and epidemic there than with us insomuch that as some have affirmed one half or at least one third part of the diseased at certain times do die of it and they that escape are terribly disfigured by it vid d timoni and pylarini epist   again i enquired what were the symptoms which attend this new and strange operation and whether the issue is always known to be salutary the disorder both before and after the eruption was so very slight and gentle that in strictness of speech it could not be called a disease having none of the usual complaints of pain in the back vomitings headachs thirst inquietude and the like the pulse being only somewhat fuller and higher than before yet so far from a fever that it scarce deserves the name of a febricula bating some singular instances which are so rare that they are not one to a thousand and last of all which i thought not a little material the pustules whether many or few and they commonly were from  0 to an  00 sometimes more never left any marks or pits behind them except only in the incisions or parts ingrafted  but still i had one difficulty left which i took to be the most considerable and which if not fully cleared would render in my opinion the whole of the process but trifling and precarious and that is whether every one who has undergone this operation is really secured against all future danger of catching the small pox by infection were i but well assured of this i should then i thought be at liberty to practice it my self and likewise with confidence recommend it to others all my enquiries here were fully answered beyond expression for i was assured by all and they could have no design to impose upon me that there was not an instance known of any ones being ever infected who had had any pustules at all how few so ever raised by inoculation though for a further trial several had been once and again ingrafted and others also had been confined to the room and in the same bed too with the infected this i rejoiced to hear and from thence concluded the practice to be universally safe and useful and indeed wondered not a little that notwithstanding the authentic accounts thereof more than once transmitted into england there had never been hitherto any fair and full trial made of it  hence also i could not forbear admiring the very great sagacity of the men who first invented this method and the laudable and diligent observation of them too who so carefully practiced it themselves and so faithfully conveyed it to their neighbors they all indeed were sensible of the benefit and found their account in it  about this time the ambassadors ingenious lady who had been at some pains to satisfy her curiosity in this matter and had made some useful observations on the practice was so thoroughly convinced of the safety of it that she resolved to submit her only son to it a very hopeful boy of about six years of age she first of all ordered me to find out a fit subject to take the matter from and then sent for an old greek woman who had practiced this way a great many years after a good deal of trouble and pains i found a proper subject and then the good woman went to work but so awkwardly by the shaking of her hand and put the child to so much torture with her blunt and rusty needle that i pitied his cries who had ever been of such spirit and courage that hardly any thing of pain could make him cry before and therefore inoculated the other arm with my own instrument and with so little pain to him that he did not in the least complain of it the operation took in both arms and succeeded perfectly well after the third day bright red spots appeared in his face then disappeared and thus interchangeably as it commonly happens till in the night betwixt the seventh and eighth day he was observed to be a little hot and thirsty yet remained so but a few hours and then the small pox came out fair they became round and yellow like those of the more gentle distinct kind and the red spots which appeared first were the fullest and largest of all they began to crust a few days after and then gently died away so that the young gentleman was quickly in a condition to go abroad with safety he had above an hundred in all upon his body but without any the least disorder but what i have mentioned and they all fell off without leaving any one mark or impression behind them this operation was performed at pera near constantinople in the month of march       the honorable lady abovementioned who had been happily delivered of a daughter some three months before seeing the great success of the operation upon her son had a mind to have it tried also upon the infant but this for certain reasons was then laid aside and i hope very luckily being reserved to set the first and great example to england of the perfect safety of this practice and especially to persons of the first rank and quality who have ever suffered so much by that fatal distemper  this noble lady sent for me last april and when i came she told me she was now resolved to have her daughter inoculated and desired me forthwith to find out matter for the purpose i pleaded for a delay of a week or two the weather being then cold and wet for indeed i was unwilling to venture on an experiment altogether new and uncommon here in a cold season though i am now convinced it may with due care be practiced at all times and seasons but still with more safety in the temperate and favorable i also prayed that any two physicians whom they thought fit might be called not only to consult the health and safety of the child but likewise to be eyewitnesses of the practice and contribute to the credit and reputation of it this indeed was at first denied me it may be out of a design to keep it secret or least it should come to nothing  in the mean time having found proper matter i ingrafted it in both arms after the usual manner the child was neither blooded nor purged before nor indeed was it necessary considering the clean habit of body and the very cool regular diet she had ever been kept to from her infancy she continued easy and well without any sensible alteration bateing the usual little spots and flushings till the tenth night when she was observed to be a little hot and feverish an ancient apothecary in the neighborhood being then called prudently advised not to give the child any medicine assuring them there was no danger and that the heat would quickly abate which accordingly it did and the small pox began next morning to appear which was indeed some two days later than usual by reason of the uncommon discharge of matter at the incisions from the beginning three learned physicians of the college were admitted one after another to visit the young lady they are all gentlemen of honor and will on all occasions declare as they have hitherto done that they saw miss wortley playing about the room cheerful and well with the small pox raised upon her and that in a few days after she perfectly recovered of them several ladies and other persons of distinction visited also this young patient and can attest the truth of this fact i need not here be more particular in determining the several periods of this cafe they being the very same with that abovementioned except only that here the pustules were not so many nor did they ripen so soon which may be easily accounted for without having regard to the difference of climates for there is little or nothing in that seeing the circassians and others inhabiting the banks of the caspian sea a climate much colder and more difficult than ours practice it with safety  another instance i shall give for the further confirmation of this practice namely one of the learned physicians abovementioned who had visited miss wortley having some years since fully informed himself of this method of practice and being thoroughly satisfied of the safety and reasonableness of it at length resolved to try it in his own family he had formerly lost some children in a very malignant kind of the small pox and therefore desired me to lose no time to ingraft the only son he had left the boy who was not quite six years of age being of a pretty warm and sanguine complexion the doctor ordered about five ounces of blood to be taken from him and then in ten days after having found matter which he liked i inoculated him in both arms this was performed the    th of may next day having looked at the incisions i found them both inflamed which convinced me the thing had taken some red spots appeared about his temples the third day and some two or three pustules between the seventh and eighth the boy being all the while without any thing of thirst headache or any other disorder only his pulse was observed to be fuller and quicker and then about the  0 th or    th some more pustules appeared round and yellow and in two or three days more died away the incisions continuing all the while inflamed and discharging a thick welldigested matter  here i could bring a great many cases of persons inoculated in turkey to prove the constant and certain success of this practice in all which i have never seen any miscarriage except in one which was wholly owing to the rashness and inadvertence of a surgeon at constantinople i would not here be thought to pretend to a secret or to make a mystery of this operation no my design is only to advise every one that attempts it to be cautious for ill consequences may sometimes happen and never more than in things common and easy and adapted to vulgar capacities in it self indeed it is simple and obvious and may like other plain chirurgical operations be in a manner mechanically learned and practiced for not to mention several surgeons whose business it is i knew an old greek woman who having been taught it from her youth had practiced it with success a great many years  hence if any regard be due to facts and to the most certain observation and experience of others which in matters of practice have ever been counted the best and surest direction i am persuaded all impartial people will allow this method to be not only safe but useful and highly worthy to be received with esteem and applause is it not a matter of the greatest importance to us to know how to prevent the mighty contagion of the small pox and how to preserve our children and families from the violent attacks and fatal effects of it what would not tender parents give to secure to them the lives and features of their beloved offspring when they behold them disfigured by the loathsome disease and struggling with the pangs of death do not we oftentimes see great families extinguished by it as by the plague and their titles and estates thereby transmitted to strangers and if they have the good fortune to escape with their lives what an ugly change from what they were before what pittings seams and scars in their faces what films and fistulas and sometimes blindness in their eyes what ulcers and imposthumes in their bodies contractions of the nerves and even lameness for life again to avoid the infection what uneasiness and disquiet of mind what fears and apprehensions do not even grown people labor under especially the more delicate and tender dont they renounce all commerce with their best friends and dearest relations and if by chance they meet an object that has but lately recovered how susceptible then are they of the distemper and how few thus seized do ever escape  in short then to prevent all these and many the like calamities the almost universal and inevitable consequences of this fatal disease i may truly venture to affirm that the method here recommended is of all others hitherto known the safest and i am sure far more infallible than that of the most learned and most cautious practice  i have however in conversation met with several scruples and objections against this method some whereof relate to the manner of the operation which i hope by the account already given are in some measure satisfied some again concern the lawfulness of it and others would even seem to question the fact denying that the small pox are hereby raised or that the eruptions ought to be deemed of that kind since they are not preceded by a fever nor attended with the usual periods of the distemper  they that scruple the lawfulness of this practice are apt to call it a presumption a forcing of nature a tempting of providence and the like true indeed were the operation in it self dangerous and the issue generally doubtful as several both in physic and surgery sometimes are yet neither presumptuous nor unlawful for all that i should be ready to own the charge and yield it at once to the tenderhearted and the scrupulous but pray what are they afraid of is there any thing here frightful or shocking to the nicest and the most delicate the practice is most plain rational and easy intended only to prevent the malignant infection and to preserve life not to give a disease and in this sense to force nature before its time but in effect to cleanse nature from the latent fomes or seminium and to secure against that popular contagion we have heard and indeed it were much to be wished we had any that truly deserve the name of preservatives against the plague and why may not this which has elsewhere been so universally tried and approved pass for one against the small pox  but again what do they mean by tempting of providence can they imagine that using the fair and proper means of avoiding and preventing a disease is oftensive to providence why then do they bleed vomit or purge or use any other remedy to prevent a fever and why dont they trust that providence rather than dare to abandon their families and desert the distressed to flee from this or any other disease nay so far am i from counting this method tempting to providence that i rather esteem it a motive of thankfulness to the divine providence and a great one too for the discovery  as to the objection against the fact denying the small pox to be hereby raised did the eruptions come the natural and common way i acknowledge it to be highly reasonable for the only way we have to distinguish between the genuine small pox of the several kinds and the spurious or what they call the chicken pox is not only by observing the nature and periods of the pustules but also by the first invasion and subsequent progress of the fever and of the usual symptoms attending it the known periods of the small pox are different according to their different kinds and this difference arises not only from the various dispositions of the juices and habits of the bodies affected but likewise from the different degrees and qualities of the external infection howsoever communicated as it is more or less subtle malignant and epidemic  now in those raised by inoculation the periods though a little different from the common and natural are in their kind as certain and regular as the other a difference indeed is observed of sometimes two or three days as to the time of eruption but that is no more than what is common in the natural sort and thus too it is with respect to the other stages of the disease i mean those of the invasion maturation and declination they are equal and regular and what is more the process is certain and the prognostic infallible  but the principal and most material difference of all lies in the fever which here is so gentle that it hardly deserves the name but in the natural and especially the confluent kind it is always violent and often the immediate cause of death  were it not altogether foreign to my design and inconsistent with the brevity i here propose i could easily demonstrate the cause of this difference and make it appear that the small quantity of the matter inserted into the capillary vessels of the skin is not capable of altering or dissolving the mass of blood as it happens in the case of infection nor of raising an ebullition sufficient to produce a fever and the dangerous symptoms which always follow upon it and yet it is certain notwithstanding all this that the matter thus inserted does produce eruptions of the right small pox kind with good digested matter as hereafter described and without any thing of the danger and loathsomeness ever inseparable from the other  that it is the right and genuine kind may be further proved beyond all exception by a few plain instances here subjoined by which it will appear that the small pox thus raised by inoculation is truly infectious and catching and that several adult persons who never before had them have been actually seized by means of kissing and caressing a child not quite three years of age while the eruptions thus raised were upon it what stronger proof can reasonably be desired of the genuine small pox and what need is there of more words or arguments to convince any one that will not be persuaded by facts  i am hastening to give you an account of those facts and do assure you it shall be an honest and a true one but before i come to it i would briefly take notice of a question or two which a learned physician one day asked me on the subject as first whether i was always sure thus to give the small pox and then whether when given i could engage the patient should never take them again by infection  to the first i answered the operation had never yet failed me or any one else that i know of nor do i believe it ever can when duly performed but upon persons who have had them before for i very much question what some have affirmed namely that there are people in the world who are not susceptible of the disease in the mean time i had a mind with great submission to have asked the doctor a plain question in answer to his and that is whether when he prescribes a purge or a vomit he is always sure it will answer his intention for i have often heard that vomits have sometimes proved purges and purges vomits too and which is worse that people have had the misfortune to die under both operations which has never yet happened in the case of ingrafting  as to the doctors second question i have said somewhat already and now can add further that besides the frequent experiments which have been made in turkey as of inoculating the fame person a second and a third time and the like i my self have lately made open and repeated trials on one of the six inoculated criminals of newgate reserved for that purpose sufficient to convince any one that there is no danger of their catching the disease by any future infection this is one see the journal annexed elizabeth harrison of about nineteen years of age here i must observe to you that this girl had the fewest eruptions upon her of any of the five that were inoculated at newgate but had a more than ordinary discharge at the incisions  i first employed her as nurse to a servant maid very ill and full of the continueddistinct kind of the small pox in the house of mrs moss in christs hospital buildings at hertford whom she attended during the whole course of the disease this maid had hardly recovered when one of the boys about ten years old of the said hospital was also seized with the very same sort i obliged her to lie every night in the same bed with this boy and to attend him constantly from the first beginning of the distemper to the very end and thus she continued for six weeks together without intermission or feeling any the least headache or other disorder though indeed i once saw some heats and little pimples upon her as nurses commonly have under such confinements there is no ground to question this fact being attested by a cloud of witnesses  for a further confirmation of what i have said i once intended to have here subjoined d timoni and pylarinis letters published in the philosophical transactions no     and     but being unwilling to enlarge this account beyond its just bounds i must leave them to another opportunity and withal take the liberty to refer the reader to them  a journal of the experiment at newgate  london august         in obedience to their royal highnesses commands i performed the operation of inoculating the small pox on six condemated criminals at newgate in presence of several eminent physicians surgeons and other  the names of the criminals are   mary north aged    years   anne tompion aged    years   elizabeth harrison aged    years   john cawthery aged    years   john alcock aged  0 years   richard evans aged    years   august        being wednesday betwixt the hours of   and  0 in the morning i made incisions in both arms and the right leg of all the six   0 and    thursday and friday i find little or no alteration in any of them except mary north who sometimes was troubled with vapors as usual to her they all sleep well dress and walk about all day and are hungry for their food their pulse a little raised but without any sensible disorder     saturday in the morning observing the incisions not so much inflamed and tending to suppuration as usual and thence suspecting the matter ingrafted to have been defective and languid having been kept at least    or    hours for a very good but unavoidable reason i searched for fresh matter and having found it in christs hospital about   a clock at night i made new incisions in each arm of five of them and ingrafted it as before i had no matter left for the sixth evans     sunday morning these five complain all of pain in both arms having taken off the dressings i find all the first incisions inflamed and festerd but without any sickness in the patients their pulse sensibly higher and their water turbid     monday morning red spots and flushings appear on all the five but most of all on mary north especially about her face neck and breast and so likewise on ann tompion but without any sickness headache or thirst except a little they complained of in the night and a higher pulse     tuesday the same spots and flushings appear fresh in the morning but turn paler and darker toward night yet without any disorder  it is here to be observed that the sixth viz richard evans who had had the small pox in prison last september has had no manner of pain heat or inflammation in any of his incisions nor any manner of alteration otherwise but all continuing pale from the beginning yesterday dried up entirely     wednesday they all continue much as before only their incisions begin to discharge a thick purulent matter anne tompion has a large yellow pustule on the bending of her thigh and another on the outside of her right arm like small pox and john alcock has more fresh pustules appearing on his face and arms having had a slight febricula in the night with disturbed water and john cawthery has a large yellow pustule on his left cheek and several small ones on his face     thursday the said alcock has these pustules appearing now fairly with a yellow digested matter and red bottoms and a great many of them but without sickness ann tompion has the same yellow pustules on her right arm and thigh with other fresh ones struck out about her chin and mouth     friday alcocks small pox appear still fair and yellow but fuller and larger with a bright red round them all the others much the same with their incisions running     saturday last night this alcock unaccountably pricks and opens all the pustules he could come at with a pin which occasions them to fall and crust sooner but they continue red at bottom and the incisions in him abate of their running  it is here to be noted that though he has had by much the greatest number of pustules or small pox upon him yet the second time he was touched in one arm only there not being matter enough for the other arm whereas the other four had both arms ingrafted and matter in abundance   0 and    sunday and monday all of them continue as before the incisions on the other four run still a thick digested yellow pus  here i must observe that the second incisions in both arms by which a vast discharge has been made seem to me in the issue to have been rather a prejudice and impediment to the eruption than to have in any sort contributed toward it but however i believe them to be in all respects as safe from any future infection as alcock who had  0 small pox at least upon him     and    tuesday and wednesday all of them continue well and their incisions cease running and dry up apace     thursday i purged alcock and cawthery for the first time and did design also to purge the three women but was prevented by their monthly purgations which i was not a little surpised to hear seized them all about the same time though some of them had been obstructed several months before     monday mary north before she was quite free unaccountably washed in cold water and thence caught a violent colic which lasted near two days   0 wednesday they all three take a purging potion which answers the intention and perfectly carries off mary norths colic pains     the two men are again purged in order to their being discharged and so likewise next day are the women  and on the sixth of september they were all dismissed to their several counties and habitations  to conclude the thing has been successful on all the five far beyond my expectation considering their age habit of body and circumstances and it has perfectly answered doctor timonis account of this practice and also the experience of all who have seen it in turkey  i cannot here forbear mentioning the very ample testimony which mr cook an eminent turkey merchant one day gave to this experiment in my hearing at newgate after having seen the persons ingrafted and fully considered their incisions and eruptions he openly declared they were the very same with what he had ever observed in turkey of which he had seen a great many instances and that we might be assured none of these here would ever be infected with the small pox again  and it is particularly remarkable in this whole affair that though there was not the least encouraging or favorable circumstance attending it before the operation yet after it nothing in any sort dangerous or unsuccessful did happen although no art nor stimulating medicine was made use of to promote the eruptions not so much as to oblige the patients to keep their bed the whole having been left to nature assisted by a strict and regular diet  october        after due preparation of the body i ingrafted mary batt an infant of two years and an half old daughter of thomas batt a quaker living at temple within three miles of hertford the red spots and flushings appeared on her face and neck the fourth day and she kept playing about well till the seventh or eighth when she became a little heavy and thirsty with a fuller and quicker pulse then the pustules came out fresh and full and the incisions discharged a thick welldigested matter she had not above  0 in all upon her they continued about three or four days then dried away and fell off and the child recovered perfectly  thus far all was well but what happened afterward was i must own not a little surprising to me not having seen or observed any thing like it before the case was in short this six of mr batts domestic servants viz four men and two maids who all in their turns were wont to hug and caress this child whilst under the operation and the pustules were out upon her never suspecting them to be catching nor indeed did i were all feizd at once with the right natural small pox of several and very different kinds for some had the round distinct sort some the small continued and others the confluent all of em had a great many but especially the last with the usual bad symptoms and very narrowly escaped but they all god be thanked did well except one maid that would not be governed under the distemper who died of it and now enjoy a perfect state of health see the certificates annexed page      october         i inoculated joseph and benjamin sons of william heath of hertford the first of about seven and the second of three years of age both with the same matter and at the same time the last had a very gentle and favorable kind in all respects like the abovenamed mary batt but the first viz joseph being a fat foul gluttonous boy who would not be confined to the rules and directions i had strictly charged his mother withal as to diet and keeping warm was taken very ill before the eruption and after it had a great load of the continued small kind but at last recovered and did well  what a mighty difference is here to be observed between those two boys the reason of it seems to be plainly this the younger who had the favorable kind was of a clean habit moderate appetite and easily governed during the whole process the elder was not only as i have said of a gross foul constitution but likewise had a voracious appetite always eating and filling his belly with the coarsest food as cheese fat country pudding cold boiled beef and the like which i saw my self as i came in by chance the third day after the operation nor was there any care taken to restrain or keep him within in cold windy frosty weather he once wet his feet in the water insomuch that had he taken the small pox by infection the world could not have saved his life hence it appears how necessary it is to cleanse thoroughly those foul habits before the operation and withal to keep them to a very strict regimen under it  it is also here very remarkable further to evince the power of infection and the genuineness of the inoculated small pox that an infant of about four months old then on mrs heaths breast while she nursed her two sons and lay in bed with them was also seized with the distinct natural kind and in due time perfectly recovered mrs heath also by being night and day constantly with her children and always embracing and caressing of em though she had had the small pox many years before struck out in several pimples or pustules on her face and hands but without any thing of sickness or disorder which we know has often happened to nurses by attending people in this distemper and even by washing their linen  not many days after this i met mr hughes judge advocate general of his majestys forces who requested me upon my return to hertford to visit his two children at his house in herting for dbury which i promised to do and found when i came there his son a child of about    months old actually ill of the small pox i immediately acquainted mr hughes with this and withal removed the daughter who was about three years of age to a neighboring gentlemans house mr hughes then recommended to me the particular care of his son and prayed me if the small pox should prove of the favorable kind not to fail to inoculate his daughter from him the boy had indeed the fair distinct kind and not a great many and recovered perfectly of them but afterward died of a cancerous tumor which had been breeding in his cheek and upper jaw long before his seizure with the small pox but to return i took matter from him at the proper time and with it inoculated his sister november   th having first gently purged her the thing took she sickend the    th and two days after the small pox appeared fair and continued to fill and ripen to december the   d then crusted and gradually fell off in the usual manner  this young patient had above two thousand pustules or small pox upon her that came out well filled up ripened and fell off observing the most regular periods of the natural small pox of the distinct kind yet she did not keep her bed one day nor wanted a nurse to watch with her one night during the whole process never having been affected with the usual complaints and symptoms of the natural small pox nor in the least pitted or scared with them  i thought it proper to be the more particular in relating this case because of the very false account which had been given of it in the post man of december   which in my absence the gentleman himself was pleased to contradict in the st jamess evening post december   th  december    i inoculated two of mr john colts children at his house in clements lane lombard street the one a boy of   the other a girl of about   years of age their bodies having first been duly prepared by a physicians order they both sickend the    th the small pox appeared on the girl the    th and on the boy the    th they came out gently filled and ripened to the   d and   th of january and then died away as usual those children had at least  00 small pox each all fair and round but the boy had rather more his came out later and kept out longer too than his sisters which can only be accounted for the ingrafted matter having been the same and in the same quantity by the difference of their habits and juices in the mean time neither of em from the beginning could be said to be downright ill nor was obliged to lie in bed nor in a word was affected with any of the dangerous or bad symptoms ordinarily attending that disease or consequential to it  they being perfectly recovered saturday january    th i performed the operation upon a third child of the said mr colt a boy of about   years of age who was also designed to have undergone it with the other two the month before had it not been that he was then out of order he continued cheerful and well till the  0 th when he became ill and feverish then the small pox appeared the    d and three days after the eruption being quite over they grew fair round full and yellow like the natural small pox of the distinct kind and thus went on to the    th or  0 th when they began to crust and fall off after the usual manner this child had a great many upon him like the abovenamed miss hughes and is also perfectly well recovered of them he was visited while under them as indeed were the other two by several eminent physicians and other persons of distinction about the town who all unamiously agreed that it was the right small pox and declared themselves fully satisfied with the trial  i do not here take notice of the little heats and flushings which appeared upon them in the beginning nor of the other more minute circumstances generally common to all nor of the proper evacuations prescribed before and after that i may avoid tedious repetitions as much as i am able but i would beg leave to add one observation the reason of which is plain and obvious namely that the greater the discharge of matter at the incisions is the fewer commonly are the eruptions and on the contrary hence also the great advantage of issues in this and other cuticular diseases may with great probability be evinced and demonstrated  but to conclude from these few instances which i have here contracted into the narrowest compass several very obvious and useful observations might be made and unquestionable proofs brought to show in the most satisfactory manner that the small pox thus raised are of the true and genuine kind that they may be always given and communicated to proper subjects young or old without any danger of a relapse and finally that this whole practice prudently managed is always safe and useful and the issue ever certain and salutary  the certificates from hertfordshire these are to certify that elizabeth harrison one of the five persons inoculated at newgate has lived at our house in christs hospital buildings at hertford for above ten weeks and has during that time attended our servant maid and after her one of the boys belonging to the said hospital both in the natural small pox and lay with the said boy from the beginning to the end of that distemper without sickness or receiving the least infection

recovered in about fifteen days i do declare that six of my domestic servants were seized with the small pox which i believe was owing to their carrying about and frequently conversing with my said daughter they having had no correspondence during that time with any person or family who had them which inclines me to think my child had the true small pox  as witness my hand this   th day of
