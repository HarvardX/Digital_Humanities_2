hodges a millar j whiston and j robinson mdccxlii  a tour through the island of great britain vol ii letter i containing a description of the north shores of the counties of cornwall and devon and some parts of somersetshire wiltshire dorsetshire gloucestershire buckinghamshire and berkshire sir i now turned about to the east and as when i went west i kept to the southern coast of this long county of cornwall and of devonshire also so in going east i shall keep the north shore the first place of any note we came to was st ives a pretty good town and grown rich by the fishing trade it is situated on the west side of a deep bay called st ivesbay from the town this bay is opposite on the landside to mounts bay which i spoke of in my last but it is filled up with sands and here is but very little trade in any thing else but cornish slate  it is a very pleasant view we have at madernhills and the plain by them in the way from the landsend to st ives where we have a prospect of the ocean at the landsend west of the british chanel at mountsbay south and the bristol chanel or severn sea north at st ives the land between the two bays being not above four or five miles over is so situated that upon the hill neither of the two seas are above three miles off and very plain to be seen and so likewise in a clear day are the islands of scilly though above  0 miles off  the country from hence to padstow is both fruitful and pleasant and several houses of gentlemen are seen as we pass the sands also are very agreeable to the eye and to travel upon among the gentlemens houses is lanhidrock the seat of the earls of radnor who are barons of truro and were so long before they obtained the title of radnor also a good house belonging to the ancient family of trefusis  the hills are fruitful of tin copper and lead all the way on our right hand the product of which is carried all to the other shore so that we shall have little to say of it here the chief business on this shore is the herring fishing the herrings about october come driving up the severn sea and from the coast of ireland in prodigious shoals and beat all upon this coast as high as bidiford and barnstable in devonshire and are caught in great quantities by the fishermen chiefly on account of the merchants of falmouth foy plymouth and other ports on the south  st michaels or modishole a mean portreeve borough is not now remarkable but was of great note in the saxon time and has still a market weekly and a yearly fair  we then came to st columbs a little market town a lordship belonging to the arundels of wardour so called to distinguish them from the arundels of trerice in this county which family espousing the kings side in the civil wars suffered much and was innobled in charles iis time the wardour family was likewise loyal and suffered in the same cause  near this place is a hill which has a rampire on the summit of it and a causeway leading to it it is an old danish camp and called castellum danis  padstow is a large town and stands on a very good harbor for such shipping as use the irish trade the harbor is the mouth of the river camel or camal which rising at camelford runs down by bodmyn to wadbridge a little town where a large stone bridge of about eight arches is built by the contributions of the country gentlemen at the motion and under the direction of one nicolas lovibond vicar of wadbridge the passage over the river before being very dangerous and having occasioned the loss of some lives as well as goods  the passage from this town of padstow to ireland is said by writers to be no more than twentyfour hours but this if ever done hat been so seldom that it ought not to be mentioned as generally the case for i believe not one in twentyfour ships makes its voyage in so few hours and that they are oftener five or six days in the passage here is a very ancient seat like a castle of a family of the name of prideaux the chief of which in queen elizabeths time built this noble seat there  higher within the land lies the market and borough town of bodmyn formerly one of the coining towns of tin till it lost that privilege to lestwithyel however it still injoys several advantages some of which are tokens of its antiquity it is pretty large and stands between two hills in a good air it had anciently several churches of which now only one remains which belonged to the priory and is at present the parish church a kind of carnival is kept here yearly in july whither great numbers of people resort  the coinage towns were in queen elizabeths time four namely leskard lestwithyel truro helston   since that in king jamess time was added pensance  camelford is a mean but ancient boroughtown here the river camel rises which takes its name from the british word came i e crooked it has not either church or chapel in it nor ever had it is only remarkable for two great battles which were fought here one between king arthur and his nephew mordred and the other between the britons and saxons  the borough of bossiney otherwise called trevena is but a small village it is famous only for the splendid ruins of an impregnable castle built on the rock which stood partly on the continent and partly on an island joined together by a drawbridge the castle was the seat of the british princes and since of the dukes of cornwall and it is said arthur was born here and died in one of the abovementioned battles near camelford  launceston which is a corruption of the british word lanstuphadon i e st stephens church is a market and boroughtown pretty neat and is situate on a rising ground at the extremity of the county on the borders of devonshire great part of it is very old ragged and decayed  when richard earl of cornwall had the government of this county this was a frontier town well walled about and fortified and had also a noble castle which from its strength was called castle terrible the inhabitants for the defense and repair of it held formerly the lands here by castleguard  here the lord hoptons good fortune failed him and he was forced by fairfax to disband his army  not far from hence is hengestonhill which produces a great plenty of cornish diamonds the cornish britons joined the danes here to drive out the saxons from devonshire but were totally defeated by egbert in     which it is conjectured gives the name of hengist to this hill in commemoration of their first leader  newport is a little village adjoining and was formerly part of launceston and yet sends two members to parliament and indeed there are no less than fortyfour and the number of electors are so few in many of the places that an administration of which side soever it be as to party has usually a great reliance on the elections in this county every new parliament in order to obtain a majority in the house of commons for fortyfour members from hence and fortyfive from another part of the island who generally go one way make no small figure in a question and in this case it may not be improperly observed that the two extremities of the island let the other parts go as they will are generally united in the same way of thinking or at least of acting in all political debates and are likely to be so in all times to come  there is a fine image or figure of mary magdalen upon the tower of the church at launceston to which the papists fail not to pay reverence as they pass by there is no tin copper or lead found hereabouts as i could hear nor any manufacture in the place there are a pretty many attorneys here who manage business for the rest of their fraternity at the assizes as to trade it has not much to boast of and yet there are people enough in it to excuse those who call it a populous place there is a long nook of the county runs north from this place called the hundred of stratton in which there is one market town named stratton but it has nothing in or about it worth remarking except only stowhouse built by the earl of bath in the reign of king charles ii and as to its finishings within not inferior to any in england the carvings especially those of the chapel the grand alcove and some of the best rooms were done by the hand of michael chuke and are not excelled by gibbon himself the landschape and seapieces of which there were a great number particularly in the great stairs a prospect of plymouth containing    feet by    were the work of vandeist the situation of this stately palace renders it a disagreeable habitation for which reason the owners have disposed of the materials and it is now  nov      pulling to pieces near this town sir ralph hopton defeated the parliament forces under the command of major general chudleigh and took him prisoner for which he was made baron stratton it is said the place where this battle was fought produced a prodigious crop of barley of  0 or    ears on a stalk the next year  not far from bodmyn is to be seen the set of monumental stones called the hurlers which dr stukeley says are out of doubt remains of an ancient druid temple probably they are called by this name from the game of hurling practiced in these parts the country people giving them that for want of a better and indeed it is said that they have a superstitious notion that they were once men who were transformed into stones for playing at this sport on a sunday they are oblong rude unhewn stones pitched on one end upon the ground they stand on a down in three circles the centres whereof are in a right line the middlemost circle the greatest  now i have mentioned the hurlers i must take the opportunity to describe the hurling match for which the cornish men are so particularly famous and which is one of their principal recreations though barbarous enough a silver ball is generally the prize on these occasions the match is made in different manners for sometimes the challenge is by twenty or thirty men on a side and no others are to interfere at other times when a great number of people are assembled at a wake or churchale the word is given out that johns wills and toms will oppose all other names or at other times that eldest or seconds are against all younger sons and so the ball is thrown up and becomes the property of that party which carries it away to the goal set for that purpose  but another kind of hurling is when an outball as they call it is thrown up and these matches are generally made by two or more neighboring gentlemen who at a day agreed on bring each of them the men of two three or more parishes and the goals are then set perhaps four or five miles distant at some gentlemens houses towns or the like and here nothing is said about matching in number or otherwise but the ball is thrown up and a bloody skirmish generally ensues no bushes briers bogs mudpools rivers or any other impediments hinder their course nor any friendship relation or former obligation in the least abates their fury the party prevailing generally present the ball to the gentlemen who brought them on as a trophy and he in return sets open his cellardoors where they wash away the blood from their noses and apply a balsam to their bruises  the wrestling in cornwall is indeed a much more manly and generous exercise and that closure which they call the cornish hug has made them eminent in the wrestling rings all over england as the norfolk and suffolk men are for their dexterity at the hand and foot and throwing up the heels of their adversary without taking hold of him  passing the river tamar about two miles from launceston we enter the great county of devon and as it is in the most wild and barren part of it and where formerly tin mines were found though now they are either quite exhausted or not to be worked without more charge than profit so we must expect it a little to resemble its neighbor county  the river tamar here abounds with fresh salmon which are so exceeding fat and good that they are esteemed in both counties above the fish of the same kind found in other places and the quantity is so great as supplies the country in abundance this is occasioned by the mouth of the river being so very large and the water so deep for two leagues before it opens into plymouth sound that the fish have a secure retreat in the salt water for their harbor and shelter and from thence they shoot up into the fresh water in vast numbers to cast their spawn  we ride but a few miles in devonshire before we find a different face in several respects as   more people than in cornwall   larger towns   the people all busy and in full employ upon their manufactures  at the uppermost and extreme part of the county northwest runs a large promontory into the sea beyond all the land on either side whether of devonshire or of cornwall this they would fain have called herculess promontory but the honest sailors and after them the plain country people call it hartland point or hearty point from the town of hartland which stands just within the shore and is situated on the utmost edge of the county of devon it is a market town of good resort the people coming constantly to it out of cornwall the fisherboats of barnstable bidiford and the other towns on the coasts lying often under the lee as they call it of these rocks for shelter from the southwest or southeast winds at which time the seamen go on shore here and supply themselves with provisions nor is the town unconcerned in that gainful fishingtrade which is carried on for the herrings on this coast  from this point or promontory the land falling away for some miles makes a gulf or bay which reaching to the headland or point of barnstable haven is called from thence barnstable bay into this bay or at the west end of it the rivers taw and towridge empty themselves at one mouth and it is very particular that as two rivers join in one chanel so here are two great trading towns in one port a thing which as it is not usual so i cannot say is an advantage to any of them for it naturally follows that they rival one another and lessen both whereas had they been joined together in one town or were it possible to join them they would make the most considerable town or city rather in all this part of england  these are the towns of barnstable and bidiford the first the most ancient the last the most flourishing the harbor or river is in its entrance the same to both and when they part the towridge turns to the right or southwest and the taw to the southeast yet they seem to be both so safe so easy in the chanel so equally good with respect to shipping and so equidistant from the sea that neither town complains of the bounty of the sea to them or their situation by land and yet of late years the town of bidiford has flourished and the town of barnstable rather declined  bidiford is a clean well built town the more ancient street which lies next the river is very pleasant where is the bridge a very noble quay and the customhouse it is also very well built and populous and fronts the river for above three quarters of a mile but besides this there is a new spacious street which runs north and south or rather northwest and southeast a great length broad as the high street of exeter well built and inhabited with considerable and wealthy merchants who traffic to most parts of the world  here as is to be seen in almost all the market towns of devonshire is a very large and wellfinished meeting house and by the multitude of people which i saw come out of it i thought all the town had gone thither and began to inquire for the church but i found that also large spacious and filled with people of the best fashion  the trade of this town as well as of all the towns on this coast being very much in fish i observed that several ships were employed to go to liverpool and up the river mersey to warrington to fetch the rock salt which is found in that county and of which i shall say more in my remarks on those parts to bidiford and barnstable and there dissolve it into brine in the seawater joining the strength of two bodies in one and then boil it up again into a new salt as the dutch do by that of the french and portuguese this is justly called salt upon salt and with this they cure their herrings as this is a trade which can be but of few years standing because the rock salt itself has not been discovered in england many years so the difference in curing the fish has been such that the demand for them has considerably increased in foreign markets  here is a very fine stone bridge over the river built in the   th century on    gothic arches all uniform and regular and very good workmanship of the kind these arches are indeed beautiful and stately but what a late author says that one of them is so big that a ship of  0 tons may sail under it is a mistake no such thing being practicable either at london bridge rochester bridge or even at york where the largest arch in england is supposed to be  as bidiford has a fine bridge over the towridge so barnstable has a very noble one over the taw and though not longer is counted larger and stronger than the other these two rival towns are really very considerable both of them have a large share in the trade to ireland and in the herringfishery and in a trade to the british colonies in america if bidiford cures more fish barnstable imports more wine and other merchandises they are both established ports for landing wool from ireland of which by itself  if bidiford has a greater number of merchants barnstable has a greater commerce within land by its great market for irish wool and yarn etc with the sergemarkets of tiverton and exeter who come up hither to buy so that in a word barnstable though it has lost ground to bidiford yet take it in all its trade completely is full as considerable as bidiford only that perhaps it was formerly far superior to it and the other has risen up to be its match  barnstable is a large well built town seated among the hills it is more populous than bidiford but not better built and stands lower insomuch that at high water in springtides it is in a manner surrounded with water the bridge was built by the generous benefaction of one stamford a citizen and merchant of london who it seems was not a native of the place but by trading here to his gain had kindness enough for the town to confer that valuable benefit upon them it was formerly walled in and had a castle and a priory it is governed by a mayor and twentyfour burgesses whereof two are aldermen it has also an highsteward and recorder  the bridge at bidiford as above was likewise a gift but was as they say done by collections among the clergy by grant of indulgences and the like church management however both the towns are infinitely obliged to the benefactors and we wish no worse use had ever been made of superstition  behind bidiford as we come from launceston are several good towns though i observed that the country was wild and barren as tavistock torrington etc  tavistock is situate on the tavy among springs and is a large town pretty well built the abbot of this place sat in parliament built a church of     yards long spacious cloisters and a chapter house with    stalls which are all now destroyed  the town of torrington is situated on the same river that bidiford stands upon it has a large spacious church with a library in it and was for some time the residence of margaret the mother of henry vii  another town in this part of the country is okehampton vulgarly okington a good market and boroughtown governed by eight principal burgesses and as many assistants it is a manufacturing town as all the towns this way now are and pretty rich but in the records of antiquity it appears to have been much more considerable than it is now having    knights fees belonging to it  a little above barnstable n e upon the coast stands a noted market and porttown called ilfordcomb a place of good trade populous and rich which is owing to its having a very good harbor and road for ships which affords a safe shelter for vessels from ireland when in bad weather they cannot without the extremest hazard run into the mouth of the taw which they call barnstable water and this is one reason that the merchants at barnstable do much of their business at this port of ilfordcomb  the harbor of this town was maintained formerly at the private expense of the ancestors of sir bourchier wrey bart lord of the manor and the quay or pier of it contains in length upwards of   0 feet and in height upwards of forty and the warphouse lighthouse pilotboats and tawboats belonging to the port were at first founded and built and constantly repaired and maintained by that worthy family without any assistance but some small acknowledgments paid to them as lords of the manor but by length of time and violence of the sea the quay was very much sunk and impaired the warp and warphouse by long usage was gone to decay and the boats for piloting and towing were much out of repair and the small duties and acknowlegements to sir bourchier sinking and being frequently unpaid to remedy all these evils an act passed anno      george ii for repairing and keeping in repair and enlarging the piers and harbor and for the support of the light and lighthouse the warp and warphouse and the pilot and towingboats as abovementioned so that by this means the harbor of ilfordcomb is likely to continue the useful and convenient port it has been for so many years past to the end of time  antiquity tells us long stories of the danes landing on this coast of hubba the danish king being slain at kennith castle between this place and the mouth of the taw and towridge and that the place was called hubbestow from his being buried there but i could not hear either of this castle or burialplace or so much as the ruins of them  the seacoast in this country runs a little farther east by north but nothing of moment is to be seen there except fishingtowns and little creeks on which are two market towns viz combemerton and porlock till we came to minehead  leaving the coast in our journey southward we came to the great river ex or isca which rises in the hills on the north side of the county and like the tamar begins within four or five miles of the severn sea the country it rises in is called exmore camden says it is a filthy barren ground and indeed so it is but as soon as the ex comes off from the moors and hilly country and descends into the lower grounds we found an alteration for then we saw devonshire in its other countenance cultivated populous and fruitful and continuing so till we came to tiverton  next to exeter this is the greatest manufactureing town in the county and of all the inland towns is likewise next to it in wealth and number of people it stands on the river ex and has over it an old stone bridge with another over the little river loman which immediately after falls into the ex just below the town antiquity says before those bridges were built there were two fords here one through each river and that the town was from thence called twyfordton that is the town upon the two fords and so by abbreviating the sounds twyforton then tiverton  this town has been a remarkable sufferer by fire for in the year      april   it was consumed on a sudden aug        it was again burnt down and july        another dreadful fire destroyed there  00 of the best houses  an act passed on this sad occasion anno      for the more easy rebuilding of the town and determining differences on that account and it injoins that the newbuilt houses shall be covered with lead slate or tile and not thatch that perilous trades shall not be exercised in public streets that no stacks of hay straw corn etc shall be erected at or near the public parts of the town that fireengines may be bought by the guardians of the poor that houses may be demolished to stop any future fire that the streets and passages of the town may be enlarged and particular houses pulled down for that purpose with other useful provisions  an act also passed anno      for making a chapel built by the subscription of the inhabitants of tiverton a perpetual cure and for providing a maintenance for the ministers who shall officiate in it for as the preamble to the act observes the parish church was not near capacious enough to receive the inhabitants of the parish the late sir william wyndham was a great encourager and promoter of this new chapel at its first erection  but the beauty of tiverton is the free school at the east entrance into the town a noble building but a much nobler foundation it was erected by one peter blundel a clothier and a lover of learning who used the saying of william of wickham to the king when he founded the royal school at winchester viz that if he was not himself a scholar he would be the occasion of making more scholars than any scholar in england to which end he founded this school he has endowed it so liberally that i was told the schoolmaster has at least sixty pounds per annum besides a very good house to live in and the advantage of scholars not on the foundation and that the usher has in proportion to this the generous founder added two fellowships and two scholarships which he gave the maintenance for to sydney college in cambridge and one fellowship and two scholarships to baliol college in oxford all which are appointed for the scholars bred up in this school  as this is the chief nursery of almost all the young gentry of these western parts the profit arising to the master from boarders and the liberal benefactions of the parents added to the salary beforementioned render it a preferment suitable to a man of the best parts and learning and as the trustees are gentlemen of great honor it is generally disposed of to the most worthy candidate mr rayner presided in it for many years with very great applause and died about this was written anno    0 twelve years ago to him succeeded mr smith after him mr jones next mr wesley once usher of westminster school as noted for his poetical performances as his brothers john and charles are for their being at the head of the new sectarists who are called methodists and he dying nov      is succeeded by mr daddo thus has it in twelve years time undergone five different regimens and if it be considered that every change introduces some difference in the method of teaching and discipline it will be no surprise that the school is something sunk in its former reputation the present master is fellow of baliol college oxford had his education here and from his great abilities and good economy in which last respect a great complaint lay against his predecessor the school is like to retrieve its former flourishing condition  the great number of gentlemens sons sent hither for their education as i have hinted is no small advantage to the town likewise and this joined with the brisk trade carried on here renders it so flourishing that notwithstanding the dreadful calamity it underwent by the fire in      which almost totally consumed it it is already very elegantly rebuilt and carries very few other marks of this devastation than the magnificence and beauty of the new structures  as this is a manufacturing country we found the people here all fully employed and very few if any out of work  from this town there is little belonging to devonshire but what has been spoken of except what lies in the road to taunton which we took next where we meet with the river columb which rises also in the utmost limits of the county toward somersetshire and gives name to so many towns on its banks that it leaves no room to doubt of its own name being right such are columbdavids ufcolumb columbstock and columbton the last is a market town and they are all full of manufacturers depending much on the mastermanufacturers of tiverton  before we leave devonshire it will not be amiss to take notice of lundy island which though  0 miles from devonshire northwestward is much mote remote from any other continent it is but five miles long and two broad but so surrounded with inaccessible rocks that there is but one small entrance into it where two men can scarce go abreast though this island lies so far in the sea it has the advantage of several springs of fresh water  with the town of tiverton we leave the county of devon and entering somersetshire have really a view of a different country from devonshire for at wellington the first town we came to in somersetshire though partly employed in manufactureing too we were immediately surrounded with beggars to such a degree that we had some difficulty to keep them from under our horses heels i was astonished at such a sight in a country where the people were so generally full of work for in cornwall where there are hardly any manufacturers and abundance of poor we never found any like this  wellington is a low dirty place and is only remarkable for having been the place of residence of the lord chief justice popham in the reigns of q elizabeth and king james i who was buried here they talk much of one salkeld who was converted from popery by king james i and made minister of this place he called himself in compliment to the king the royal convert who in return complimented him with the title of the learned salkeld which bythebye reflected no bad compliment on himself for having converted a learned man  the county of somerset joins to the northeast part of devonshire and takes its name from the british word gladyr haf which signifies summercountry and so the welsh call it in their language to this day i touched only upon one point of the county in my last as i went westward the whole county is worth a more particular account than can be given within the space of a letter  from wellington we came to taunton leaving blackdown hills on our right and ilminster behind them southward a market town famed for its very good church and a stately monument erected in it to nicolas wadham and dorothy his wife founders of wadham college oxon  near taunton lies that rich track of ground vulgarly called tauntondean this large wealthy and very populous town takes its name from the river tone whereon it is situated one of the chief manufacturers here told us that there was at that time so good a trade in the town that they had eleven hundred looms going for the weaving of sagathies duroys and such kind of stuffs and that not one of those looms wanted work he added that there was not a child in the town or in the villages round it of above five years old but if it was not neglected by its parents and untaught could earn its own bread this was what i never met with in any place in england except at colchester in essex  the election of members here is by those whom they call potwalloners that is to say every inhabitant whether housekeeper or lodger who dresses his own victuals to make out which several inmates or lodgers will some little time before the election bring out their pots and make fires in the street and boil their victuals in the sight of their neighbors that their votes may not be called in question  there are two large parish churches in this town and two or three meeting houses one of which is said to be the largest in the county the inhabitants have been noted for dissenters principally for taunton was always counted a seminary for such they suffered much in the duke of monmouths rebellion but paid king james home for the cruelty exercised by jefferies among them for when the prince of orange arrived the whole town ran in to him with so universal a joy that it was thought if he had wanted it he might have raised a little army there and in the adjacent part of the country  there is a kind of college or academy for the dissenters in this town and it is by far the greatest town in all this part of the country  from taunton we went north to take a view of the coast exmore of which mention was made above where the river ex rises lies in the way part of it in this county and extending to the sea side it gives indeed but a melancholy view being a vast track of barren and desolate lands yet on the coast there are some very good seaports  porlock mentioned before on the utmost extent of the county has but a small harbor nor has it any thing of trade  but minehead the safest harbor on this side is a fine port no ship is so big but it may come in and no weather so bad but the ships are safe when they are in and they told me that in the great storm anno   0  when the ships were blown on shore wrecked and lost in every harbor of the county they suffered little or no damage in this  the trade of this town lies chiefly with ireland and this was for many years the chief port in these parts where wool from ireland was allowed to be imported but that liberty is since enlarged to several other ports by act of parliament  the town is well built is full of rich merchants and has some trade also to virginia and the west indies they correspond much with the merchants of barnstable and bristol in their foreign trade what has greatly contributed to the improvement of minehead was an act passed in the   th and   th year of the late king williams reign which was continued by an act of the tenth of the late queen anne for recovering securing and keeping in repair the harbor of minehead and now so lately as in the session       another act passed for further continuing the terms and powers of the two former acts for the bringing to effect the same laudable purposes in pursuance of which a new head has been built the beach cleared and a great progress made in the piers and designed works  from hence the coast bears back west to watchet a small port of late years though formerly much more considerable for it had given place to minehead though now it is in a much better condition than it used to be in and this it owes to two acts of parliament one passed in the sixth year of the late queen anne for repairing of its quay and harbor and the other in the tenth but when the works designed were near completed it was found that the quay was built much too low and not extended to a sufficient length to preserve the town and the ships and vessels riding in the harbor from the violence of the sea whereupon another act passed in the seventh of king george i for continuing the duties laid by the former acts and remedying the inconveniences beforementioned  it seems to me that the town of minehead rose out of the decay of the towns of porlock and watchet  on this coast are vast quantities of rock or rather pebbles which the sea at low water leaves uncovered from whence the neighboring inhabitants fetch them on shore to a higher ground and burn them into lime for dressing their land but it is more especially useful in building for that no cement whatsoever is more lasting for jets d eau heads piers and other masonry that is to lie under water in which position it runs up to a stone as hard as marble and is scarce to be beaten abroad the cliffs are stored with alabaster which by the wash of the sea falls down and is conveyed from hence to bristol and other places on this shore in great quantity neither should it be omitted that the inhabitants burn great quantities of seaweed to supply the glassmakers at bristol  walking on the beach near watchet i discovered among the large gravel great numbers of stones fluted in imitation of the shells of fishes of all kinds many of the flat kind are double and curiously tallied one in another which may by a violent stroke be separated how to account for the vast variety to be found here of this sport of nature i know not some i have seen as broad as a pewterdish and again others no bigger than a peppercorn but in all of them the flutings are regular some like the escallop in rays from a center others like the perriwinkle in spiral lines in these and all other forms they lie here in great plenty  quantock is a high down in the neighborhood from whence besides the two little islands called the steepholmes and the flatholmes and an extensive view of the chanel i had a fair and distinct prospect of the welsh coast for many leagues in length  from hence the winding shore brings us to bridgwater this is an ancient and very considerable town and port it stands at the mouth of the river parrat or perrot which comes from the south after having received the river tone from the west which is made navigable up to within a few miles of taunton by a very fine new chanel cut at the expense of the people of taunton and which by the navigation of it is infinitely advantageous to that town and well worth all their expense first by bringing up coals which are brought from swanzy in wales by sea to bridgwater and thence by barges up this river to taunton next for bringing all heavy goods and merchandises from bristol such as iron lead oil wine hemp flax pitch tar grocery dyestuffs and the like  this town of bridgwater is a populous tradeing town well built and as well inhabited having many families of good fashion dwelling in it besides merchants the famous admiral blake who under the commonwealth so much exalted the glory of the english maritime force was a native of this town  this town was regularly fortified in the late civil wars and sustained more than one siege the situation of it renders it easy to be fortified the river and haven taking one chief part of the circumference over the river they have a very good bridge of stone and the tide rises here at high water near six fathoms and sometimes flows in with such impetuosity that it comes two fathoms deep at a time and when it does so unawares it often occasions great damage to ships driving them foul of one another and frequently oversets them this sudden rage of the tide is called the boar and is frequent in all the rivers of this chanel especially in the severn it is also known in the north particularly in the trent and the ouse at their entrance into the humber at bristol and in several other places  there is in bridgwater besides a very large church a fine meeting house built since the toleration in which it is remarkable that they have an advanced seat for the mayor and aldermen when any of the magistrates shall be of their communion as sometimes has happened here also is a college or private academy for the dissenters to breed up their preaching youth  from bridgwater is a road to bristol which they call the lowerway the upperway which is the more frequented road being over mendip hills this lowerway is not always passable being subject to floods and dangerous inundations all this part of the country viz between bridgwater and the sea and on northward upon the coast lies low and is wholly employed in feeding of black cattle which they bring out of the west part of devon and the neighboring borders of cornwall where the finest are bred for as to those few bred in these low lands they are very heavy sluggish and unshapely and the beef soft and spongy such as they seldom or never drive to london markets indeed they breed a great many colts but then they too must be transplanted very young into a dry healthy soil for it is very difficult to find a horse of their own breed fit for any thing but a drudge the moors or marshgrounds which are also employed in the same way extend themselves up the rivers perrot and ivil into the heart of the country of which in its place  this low part between bridgwater and bristol suffered exceedingly in that terrible inundation of the sea which was occasioned by the great storm anno   0  and the country people have set up marks upon their houses and trees with this note upon them thus high the waters came in the great storm thus far the great tide flowed up in the last violent tempest and the like  in one place they showed us where a ship was driven up upon the shore several hundred yards from the ordinary high water mark and left upon dry land  as the low part is thus employed in grazing and feeding cattle so all the rest of this large extended country is employed in the woollen manufacture and in the best and most profitable part of it viz in taunton the serges druggets etc and several other kinds of stuffs in wells shepton glastenbury etc knitting of stockens principally for the spanish trade in bristol and many towns on the somersetshire side druggets cantaloons and other stuffs in froom philipsnorton and all the country bordering upon wiltshire fine spanish medley cloths especially on that part of the county from wincanton and mere to warminster bruton castlecary templecomb down to gillingham and shaftsbury in dorsetshire   these fine spanish medley cloths are the mixed colored cloths which all the persons of fashion in england wear there are vast quantities of these exported to all parts of europe and it is so very considerable a trade and of so vast an advantage to england in maintaining and supporting so many poor families and making so many rich ones that it is almost impossible to give a just description of it the above sketch however may serve as an introduction to it but i shall add a little more concerning this county and upon my entering into the northwest and west parts of wiltshire where the center of this prodigy of a trade is i shall sum it all up together and show you the extent of land which it spreads itself upon and so give you some idea as well of the vast numbers of people who are sustained as of those who are enriched by it  but i must first go back a little while into somersetshire the northern part of the county i did not visit in this journey which as i hinted before is only a return from my long travel to the landsend in omitting this part i of course leave the two cities of bristol and bath and that high part of the county called mendiphill to my next western journey which will include all the counties due west from london for these now spoken of though ordinarily called the westcountry are rather northwest than west  in that part of the country which lies southward of taunton and bridgwater is langport a wellfrequented market town on the river parr which is navigable for barges to bristol and occasions a good trade here eels are exceeding plentiful and cheap here near this place general fairfax beat up the discontented gorings quarters and entirely defeated him  south petherton is a market town on the same river famous of old for the place of king ina but now of no other note than an annual fair which lasts five days in june  from hence you come to yeovil which i have already mentioned in a former letter  ivelchester is a borough town and as its ruins show was formerly very large and encompassed with a double wall and had four churches it has now a good bridge over the ivel it was here that on the  d of may    0 mrs elizabeth branch and her daughter miss betty branch were executed for a most barbarous murder committed on the body of a servant girl by one continued series of seven hours beating and whipping which with the behavior of the criminals was of so cruel and atrocious a nature that it shocked the whole kingdom the particulars are too well known to need any farther mention here had we room which we have not  somerton is a good market town whence some say the country takes its name it was anciently very noted and had a strong castle in which john king of france was prisoner here is a fair which holds from palm sunday to the middle of june  milbourn lies on the edge of dorsetshire and is very ancient but has neither market nor fair  camalet is a noted place situated on the highest ground in this county on the edge of dorsetshire its vulgar name is cadburycastle from the village of northcadbury wherein it stands hereabouts rise the rivers of somersetshire which run into the severn sea westward and that in dorset which goes eastward through sturminster into the southern ocean it is a noble fortification of the romans the prospect is woody and very pleasant hereandthere lofty and steep hillocks roman coins in great plenty have been found here and in all the country round the entrance is guarded with six or seven ditches on the northside in the fourth ditch is a never failing spring called king arthur s well over it they have dug up square stones doorjambs with hinges and say there are subterraneous vaults thereabout the church and tower of cadbury is small but neatly built of stone  at wincaunton an urn was lately found full of roman money half a peck of the same coin was discovered in enclosing ground toward beaconash a little above sutton as also pateras a knife and other antiquities now in lord winchelscas custody in particular at longleat in lord weymouths library a piece of lead weighing  0 pounds one foot nine inches long two inches thick three and an half broad found in lord fitzhardings grounds near bruton in somersetshire was discovered by digging a hole to set a gatepost in with a legible inscription  the road from hence to glastenbury is over rocks and heads of rivers but that is alleviated by the many natural curiosities such places afford  kyneton village for half a mile together is naturally paved with one smooth broad rock the whole length of the road so that it looks like ice  crossing the fosse road at lyteford you enter a flat moorish country full of artificial cuts and drains the ascent to the torr which overhangs the town of glastenbury is very difficult upon a narrow crest of the torr which is much the highest the abbot built a church to st michael of good square stone the tower is left though ruinous and is an excellent seamark it probably cost more to raise the stone to this height than to erect the building half way up is a spring it is certainly higher than any ground within ten miles of the place in the times of superstition this great monastery held the first place for reputation of sanctity  the inhabitants will have it that king arthur was buried here and as a proof thereof that his coffin had been found in this place and also that joseph of arimathea had been here and that when he had fixed his staff in the ground which was on christmas day it immediately took root budded put forth whitethorn leaves and the next day was in full blossom white as a sheet and that the plant is preserved and blows every christmas day as at first to this very time  i believe the miracle amounts to no more than this viz that a kind of whitethorn grows hereabout which in a mild winter puts forth some blossom about christmas and i doubt not but some of the same kind may be found at other places if any observations were made of it but this place is remarkable for many other mavelous stories recorded by the monks who formerly possessed it  as to the burial of king arthur mr camden makes no doubt of it and gives us from giraldus cambrensis an account how king henry ii caused search to be made for his tomb and before the workmen had dug seven feet deep they came to a great stone having a cross of lead on the inside of it and the subsequent letters or inscription upon it and in the following rude character which the said giraldus cambrensis mr camden says was an eyewitness of as well as of a coffin of hollowed oak which they found by digging nine feet deeper than the inscription wherein were deposited the bones of that great prince the inscription is as follows  but to leave these more disputable points for matters of greater certainty it is not doubted but king ina built the church of glastenbury as one of the most ancient so the most wealthy and magnificent loaded with revenues by the saxon and perhaps the british monarchs the abbot lived in little less state than the royal donors his revenue amounting to  0000 l annually he could from the torr see a vast track of this rich land in his own possession and seven parks well stored with deer belonging to the monastery it is walled round and imbattled like a town a mile in compass  when i was last at glastenbury there were magnificent ruins but within a few years a presbyterian tenant had made more barbarous havoc there than had been since the dissolution for every week a pillar a buttress a windowjamb or an angle of fine hewn stone was sold to the best bidder and they were actually stripping st josephs chapel for that purpose and the squared stones were laid up by lots in the abbots kitchen the rest goes to paving yards and stalls for cattle or to the highway so much dread indeed have the people here of founders curses that they are afraid to make use of the materials for dwellinghouses and are full of stories of sad accidents and judgments that have fallen upon such as have but venture it for the highways for a townhouse and even for barns and stables so that as one observes where few are so hardy as to apply them to their particular or personal use a public building shall be erected where all come in for their snack  the abbots lodging was a fine stone building but could not content the justmentioned tenant who pulled it down and out of it built a new house absurdly setting up the arms and cognizances of the great saxon kings and princes who were founders and of the abbots over his own doors and windows nothing is left entire but the kitchen a judicious piece of architecture but tradition says that this is but a modern building for the story goes that whiting the last abbot being dealt with by henry viii and his cormorants for a surrender and bravely refusing to join in the sacrilege that prince proceeded to menaces and told him he would burn his kitchen about his ears to which he returned answer that he would build such an one as all the timber in the forest should not burn and accordingly as it is said built this in defiance which is all of firm stone walls and roof having nothing combustible in it but what neither flattery nor menaces could effect tyranny and murder brought about for the abbot was hanged on st michaels tower just now mentioned on the top of the high hill called the torr thereby accomplishing a prophecy as the townsmen call it but rather occasioning a saying since spread abroad that a whiting should swim over glastenbury torr  the church was large and magnificent the walls of the choir are standing    fathom long and    broad there is one jamb at the east end of the high altar left  hereabout were buried king edgar and many of the saxon monarchs whose noble ashes ought to have protected the whole  two pillars of the great middle tower are left next the choir on the northside is st marys chapel as they told me the roof beat down by violence and a mean wooden one in its place thatched with stubble to make it serve as a stable the manger lies upon the altar and nich where they put the holy water st edgars chapel is opposite to it but there is not much left of it beside the foundations the present work is    paces long    wide without the roof is chiefly wanting two little turrets are at the corners of the west end and two more at the interval of four windows from thence which seem to indicate the space of ground the first chapel was built on the rest between it and the church was a kind of antechapel underneath was a vault now full of water the floor of the chapel being beaten down into it it was wrought with great stones  here was a capacious receptacle of the dead they have taken up many leaden coffins and melted them into cisterns  the roof of the chapel was finely arched with ribwork of stone the sides of the walls are full of small pillars of sussex marble as likewise the whole church which was a mean way of ornamenting in those times they are mostly beaten down between them the walls are painted with pictures of saints as still easily seen all the walls are overgrown with ivy which is the only thing here in a flourishing condition every thing else presenting a most melancholy though venerable aspect on the south side the cloisters was the great hall  the townsmen bought the stones of the vaults underneath to build a sorry markethouse not discerning the benefit accruing to the town from the great concourse of strangers purposely to see this abbey which is now its greatest trade as formerly its only support for it is in a most miserable decaying condition as wholly cut off from the large revenues spent among them  there are many other foundations of the buildings left in the great area but in the present hands will soon be rooted up and the very footsteps of them effaced which so many ages had been erecting  the abbots hall i have been told was curiously wainscotted with oak and painted with coats of arms in every panel the mortar of these buildings is very good and great rocks of the roof of the church lie upon the ground chiefly consisting of rubblestone untouched by the fanatical destroyers who chiefly work on the hewn stone of the outside till a whole wall falls when undermined a little  throughout the town are the tattered remains of doors windows bases capitals of pillars etc brought from the abbey and put into every poor cottage  in the town are two churches the upper a handsome fabric with a fine tower of good design adorned with figures in niches the george inn is an old stone building called the abbots inn where chiefly the pilgrims were lodged who came strolling hither and idling their time away for sanctity a coat of arms of the kings of england supported by a lion and a bull is over the gate with many crosses there was a bed of large timber with imbossed gilt panels which seemed to have been the abbots  four miles from glastenbury lies the little city of wells where is one of the neatest cathedrals in england particularly the west front of it which is a complete draught of imagery as well as very ancient  the close or part of the city where the bishops palace is is very properly called so for it is walled in and locked up like a little fortification and has a ditch round it the dignified clergy live in the inside of it and the prebendaries and canons have very agreeable dwellings here are no less than    prebendaries and    canons besides a dean a chancellor a precentor and three archdeacons a number which very few cathedrals in england have besides  the county is the diocese and contains     parishes and the archdeaconries are of wells bath and taunton  the city lies just at the foot of the mountains called mendiphills and is built on a stony foundation its manufacture is chiefly of stockens as has been said it is well built and populous  near this city and just under the hills is the famous wokey hole the chief curiosity of which is frequently found in all such subterraneous caverns that the water dropping from the roof of the vault petrifies and hangs in long pieces like icicles as if it would in time turn into a column to support the arch  not far from hence is sedgmore a watery splashy place and infamous for the defeat of the duke of monmouth  in the low country on the other side mendip hills lies chedder a village pleasantly situated under the very ridge of the mountains before the village is a large green or common on which all the cows belonging to the town feed the ground is exceeding rich and as the inhabitants are cowkeepers they take care to maintain the goodness of the soil by agreeing to lay on large quantities of dung for manuring and enriching the land  several persons frequently here mix their milk together which often weighs a hundred weight sometimes more and is so excellent that it is often sold from sixpence to eightpence per pound when the cheshire cheese is sold but from twopence to twopence halfpenny  here is a deep frightful chasm in the mountain in the hollow of which the road goes toward bristol and out of the same hollow springs a little stream which is so rapid that it is said to drive    mills within a quarter of a mile of the spring but it must be supposed to fetch some winding reaches in the way otherwise there would not be room for    mills to stand and have a sufficient head of water to each within so small a space of ground the water of this spring grows quickly into a river and runs down into the marshes and joins another little river called axe about axbridge and thence into the bristol chanel or severn sea  i must now turn east and southeast for i resolved not to go up the hills of mendip at all this journey leaving that part to another tour when i shall give an account of these mountains as also of the cities of bath and bristol to which they are very near in one letter  i come now to that part of the county which joins to wiltshire which i reserved in particular to this place in order to give some account of the broadcloth manufacture which i several times mentioned before and which is carried on here to such a degree as to deserve a place in all the descriptions or histories which shall be given of this country  as the east and south parts of wiltshire are all hilly spreading themselves far and wide in plains and grassy downs for breeding and feeding vast flocks of sheep and as the west and north parts of somersetshire are on the contrary low and marshy or moorish for feeding and breeding of black cattle and horses or for lead mines etc so all the southwest part of wiltshire and the east part of somersetshire are low and flat being a rich enclosed country full of rivers and towns and infinitely populous insomuch that some of the market towns are equal to cities in bigness and superior to many of them in numbers of people  this low flat country contains part of the three counties of somerset wilts and gloucester and that the extent of it may be the easier understood by those who know any thing of the situation of the country it reaches from cirencester in the north to sherburn on the edge of dorsetshire south and from the devizes east to bristol west which may take in about  0 miles in length where longest and  0 in breadth where narrowest  in this extent of country we have the following market towns which are principally employed in the clothing trade that is to say in that part of it which i am now speaking of namely fine medley or mixed cloths such as are usually worn in england by the better sort of people and also exported in great quantities to holland hamburgh sweden denmark spain italy etc the principal clothing towns in this part of the country are these somersetshire from pentford philipsnorton bruton sheptonmallet castlecarey and wincaunton wiltshire malmsbury castlecomb chippenham caln devizes bradford trubridge westbury warminster mere dorsetshire gillingham shaftsbury bemister and bear sturminster shireborn gloucestershire cirencester tetbury marshfield minchinghampton and fairford   these towns as they stand thin and at considerable distance from one another for except the two towns of bradford and trubridge the others stand at an unusual distance are interspersed with a very great number of villages hamlets and scattered houses in which generally speaking the spinning work of all this manufacture is performed by the poor people the master clothiers who generally live in the greater towns sending out the wool weekly to their houses by their servants and horses and at the same time bringing back the yarn that they have spun and finished which then is fitted for the loom  the increasing and flourishing circumstances of this trade are happily visible by the great concourse of people to and increase of buildings and inhabitants in these principal clothing towns where this trade is carried on and in the wealth of the clothiers the town of from or as it is written in our maps fromesellwood is a specimen of this which is so prodigiously increased within these last  0 or  0 years that they have built a new church and so many new streets of houses and these houses are so full of inhabitants that from is now reckoned to have more inhabitants in it than the city of bath and some say than salisbury and if their trade continues to increase in like manner for a few years more it is very likely to become one of the greatest and wealthiest inland towns in england  its trade is wholly clothing and the cloths they make are generally speaking all conveyed to london where blackwellhall is their market and if we may believe common fame there are above  0000 people in from now more than lived in it  0 years ago and yet it was a considerable town then  here are also several large meeting houses as well as churches as there are generally in all the manufacturing trading towns in england especially in the western counties  the devizes is next to from a large and important town and full of wealthy clothiers but it has lately run pretty much into the druggetmaking trade a business which has made some invasion upon that of the broadcloth great quantities of druggets being worn in as well as exported from england instead of broadcloth but this is much the same as to the trade still for since it is all a woolen manufacture and the druggets may properly be called cloth though narrow and of a different make so the makers are all called clothiers  the river avon a noble and large fresh river branching itself into many parts and receiving almost all the rivers on that side of the hills waters this whole fruitful vale and the water of this river seems particularly qualified for dying the best colors and for fulling and dressing the cloth so that the clothiers generally plant themselves upon this river but especially the dyers as at trubridge and bradford which are the two most eminent clothing towns in that part of the vale for the making fine spanish cloths and for the nicest mixtures  from these towns south to westbury and warminster the same trade continues and the finest medley spanish cloths in the whole world are made in this part they told me at bradford that it was no extraordinary thing to have clothiers thereabout worth from  0000 to  0000 l a man and many of the gentry in those counties have been originally raised from this truly noble manufacture  if i may speak here from the authority of the ancient inhabitants of the place who have been curious observers upon this subject the country which i have now described as principally employed in and maintained by this prodigy of a trade contains    0000 acres of land and has in it     parishes and    000 people it is true that this is all guesswork but i must confess myself very willing to believe that the reckoning is far short of the account for this part is exceeding large and populous  it may be worth inquiry how the manufacturers in so vast a consumption of the wool as such a trade must take up can be supplied with wool for their trade and indeed it would be something strange if the answer were not at hand    we may reasonably conclude that this manufacture was at first seated in this county or as we may say originally planted itself here because of the infinite numbers of sheep which were always upon the downs and plains of dorset wilts and hampshire all adjoining this no doubt induced the first planters of the clothing manufacture to make choice of this delightful vale in the neighborhood of those plains which afforded such immense funds of wool for the carrying on their works thus the manufacture of white cloth was planted in stroudwater in gloucestershire for the sake of the excellent water there for the dying scarlets and all colors that are dyed in grain which are better done there than in any other place of england some towns near london excepted hence therefore we first observe they are supplied yearly with the fleeces of two or three millions of sheep    but as the number of sheep fed on these downs is lessened rather than increased because of so many thousand acres of the carpet ground being of late years converted into tillage and sowed with this alteration has made warminster a market town on the edge of somersetshire the greatest market for wheat in england where none of it is bought to send to london wheat and at the same time the manufacture prodigiously increasing the manufacturers applied to other parts for a supply and hence began the influx of north country wool from the counties of northampton leicester and lincoln the center and markets of which trade are about tetbury and cirencester where several hundred packs are sold every week to supply this prodigious consumption    from london they have great quantities of wool which is generally called kentish wool in the fleece which is brought up from thence by the farmers since the late severe acts against their selling it within a certain number of miles of the sea also fellwool for the combers bought of the woolstaplers in barnabystreet and sent back by the carriers which bring up the cloths to market    they have also sometimes large quantities of irish wool by the way of bristol or of minehead in somersetshire but this is uncertain and only on extraordinary occasions i omit the spanish wool as being an article by itself  thus as those who see the almost countless numbers of sheep on the downs and plains and the great quantities of wool brought to the markets of tetbury and other towns as well as what are sent down from london into this single vale would wonder how it was possible so much wool could be consumed manufactured and wrought up so on the other hand those that see what numbers of people are employed and what vast quantities of goods are made in this part of england would wonder how the nation should be able to supply them with wool  and yet notwithstanding the whole country is thus busied in the broadcloth manufacture i must not omit to mention that here is a very great application to another branch or two of trade viz the supplying the city of london with provisions though it is true that the general employment of the people in all this county is in the woollen manufacture yet as the spinning is generally the work of the women and children and the land is here exceeding rich and fertile so it cannot be supposed but that here are farmers in great numbers whose business it is to cultivate the land and supply the rest of the inhabitants with provisions and this they do so well that notwithstanding the county is exceeding populous yet provisions of all sorts are cheap the quantity very great and a considerable overplus sent every day to london  all the lower part of this county and also of gloucestershire adjoining is full of large feeding farms which we call dairies and the cheese they make is excellent and is eaten newer than that from cheshire of this a vast quantity is every week sent up to london where though it is called gloucestershire cheese yet the greatest part of it comes from wiltshire the gloucestershire cheese being more generally carried to bristol and bath where a very great quantity is consumed as well by the inhabitants of these two populous cities as in exportation to our west india colonies and other places whereas this wiltshire cheese is carried to the river of thames which runs through part of the county by landcarriage and so by barges to london  again in the spring of the year they make a vast quantity of that we call green or new cheese which is a thin and very soft cheese resembling cream cheeses but somewhat thicker these are so universally liked in london that all the low rich lands of this county are hardly enough to supply the market but then this holds for little more than the two first summer months of the year  besides this the farmers in wiltshire and the part of gloucestershire adjoining send a very great quantity of bacon up to london which is esteemed the best bacon in england hampshire only excepted this bacon is raised here by their great dairies as the hogs are fed with the vast quantities of whey and skimmed milk which the farmers must otherwise have thrown away  but this is not all for as the north part of wiltshire as well the downs as the vales border upon the river thames and in some places come up even to the banks of it so most of that part of the county being arable land they sow a very great quantity of barley which is carried to the markets at abingdon at faringdon and such places where it is made into malt and carried to london this imploys all the hillcountry from above malmsbury to marlborough and on the side of the vale of whitehorse as it is called which is in berkshire and the hills adjoining a track of fertile ground which furnishes a prodigious quantity of barley  thus wiltshire helps to supply london with cheese bacon and malt three very considerable articles besides that vast manufacture of fine spanish cloths of which i have said so much and i may without partiality say that it is thereby rendered one of the most important counties in england to the public wealth of the kingdom the bare product is in itself prodigiously great the downs are an inexhausted storehouse of wool and of corn and the valley or low part of it is the like for cheese and bacon  one thing here is worth while to mention for the observation of those counties in england where they are not yet arrived to that perfection in husbandry as in this county and i have purposely reserved it to this place and that is the downs or plains which though generally called salisbury plain yet extend themselves into the counties of southampton wilts and dorset were formerly wholly taken up with sheep as being thought incapable of producing grain but now are made to yield most plentiful crops by folding their sheep upon the ploughd lands removing the fold every night to a fresh place till the whole fallow has been folded on this alone has made these lands which in themselves are poor and in some places so shallow as that the earth is not six inches deep over the solid chalk able to bear as good wheat as any of the richer lands in the vales though not altogether in such great quantities and were it not for this improvement the product would hardly compensate the ploughmans labor for many of these lands lie up such high hills so remote from the farmers houses which are always in the valleys that it would be very difficult to carry up their dung to manure them  if this way of folding sheep upon the fallows and ploughed lands were practiced in some other parts of britain and especially in scotland it would effectually improve the waste lands which now are useless and uncultivated and turn both sheep and lands to a better account than was ever yet known among them in wiltshire it appears to be so very significantly for if a farmer has a thousand sheep and no fallows to fold them on his neighbors will give him ten shillings a night for every thousand  but as i have not mentioned these clothing towns other than as they contribute to that trade i shall now proceed to say something of the towns themselves except those in gloucestershire of which i shall speak in my next letter as i fall down westward  shiptonmallet castle carey wincaunton and bruton lie to the southward of wells and have nothing remarkable in them except the last which lies on the river brews it has a fair church a good free school and a stately almshouse the ruins of a priory and beside the clothingtrade is famous for stockens  from and philips norton lie east of somersetshire upon the borders of wilts the first is near the forest of selwood and i have already mentioned its prodigious increase of late years the last is a very good market town and has two annual fairs one reputed for a oneday fair as great as any in england  bensford is a small market town and lies northwest toward bristol  malmsbury is a very ancient town and it is said was built by a british prince called caer bladdon it was formerly defended by walls and a large strong castle which was razed afterward to enlarge the abbey which was very famous and the greatest in wiltshire the abbot sat in parliament king athelstane was buried here and they still show his tomb here vast piles of buildings were pulled down at the dissolution but the church of the abbey was saved a great part of which still remains and is used as the parish church it is a corporation governed by a justice who is an annual magistrate and called the alderman it has a good market weekly the town is neat and lies on the river avon it is also famous for the birthplace of william of malmsbury the historian and of that great scholar philosopher and mathematician hobbes and of diverse other very great and remarkable men  near this town southward on the same river lies the village of dantsey which though but an obscure place has given title of honor to many eminent persons and among the rest to henry danvers created baron of this place by king james i though afterward made earl of danby he had distinguished himself in queen elizabeths irish wars was as good as great and died with glory but his brother and heir having sat ungratefully a judge on that very king who made his brother earl was at the restoration attainted of high treason and this his manor of dantsey given to james then duke of york who settled it in dowry on his second consort on his abdication it became a second time forfeited and king william conferred it on charles lord mordaunt late earl of peterborough and monmouth in whose family it still remains but as there are some other things more than ordinarily particular relating to this manor i shall enlarge a little upon it  the whole parish of dantsey consists of this manor only and not a foot of ground in it belongs to any other person it is altogether pasture and indeed very rich the inhabitants who are all tenants of the manor make most excellent cheese not at all inferior to that of chedder which is the only commodity in the place for the late lord would not permit the grounds to be ploughed up and i believe there is not an acre in the parish of arable land though the tenants have offered a considerable advance of rent for liberty to break up the ground which indeed seems to want it and would be much bettered by the plough nor would his lordship for some years before his death renew a life upon it either by lease or copyhold except as many of the last as would keep up the homage and the rights of the manor and the reason of this was not only to get a clear rackrent estate in it but to prevent the cheats and impositions which the copyhold tenants of the manor put upon their lord for as every widow has her life in her husbands copyhold after his death if she continues sole and continent it is a very common thing there for an old man on his deathbed to marry a young woman who privately contracts to give part of the profits of the copyhold or some consideration for it to the husbands relations and not seldom selects for a bedfellow for herself one of her favorite menservants  the abuse which accrued from granting leases on lives is this that whereas a person takes a lease for three lives viz his own his wifes and his son johns to defraud the lord of the manor he names all his sons john so that as long as any of the sons live john in the lease never dies  by these frauds the earl who was none of the best oeconomists and lived remote from this place suffered considerably though he could not find out how but frequently complained that his lessees and his copyholdwidows were very long lived and in an humorous way used to recommend his manor of dantsey to all such as were apprehensive of dying  as all in the parish were his tenants and had an interest in the fraud they combined against him so that he could get no intelligence of it and though his lordship enjoyed the manor ever since the revolution yet by reason of its being then full estated that is all let out upon lives then actually subsisting and continued by the abovementioned frauds his lordship received no great benefit out of it till some few years before his death when he came to a resolution not to renew though when all the lives drop in this manor will at a rackrent amount to at least  000 l a year  there is a large old mansion house here lying just on the river with gardens formed after the manner of those at parsonsgreen but it is not a kindly place for ripening fruit and the grounds lie very low and splashy being all of a stiff clay and yet very good pasture here is also a fine park well timberd but without deer his lordship had once a design to improve this mansion house and estate and resided here in   0  when he was called to court and sent to command the queens forces in spain where his conduct and great services to his country are too well known to need mentioning here  though this place is often overflowed with water yet there is none good either for brewing or washing or any spring of sweet water here is a spring of a chalybeat kind which would turn to good account were it not in such a distant and an almost inaccessible part of the country occasioned by bad roads which were a great protection to the inhabitants in the late civil wars who were never visited by either party but enjoyed an easy and uninterrupted repose whlist their neighbors on all sides were involved in the calamities of that unnatural war  here is likewise a good neat church with one of the bestbuilt high square towers i ever saw raised at the expense of one of the lords of dantsey probably the aforementioned henry who lies buried here under a very large magnificent tomb here likewise is interred lieutenant general lewis mordaunt a brother of the late earl a gentleman noted for his great wit humor and polite conversation as indeed all his brothers were as well as his lordship  castlecomb is a village of small account  chippenham is a corporate good market town likewise on the river avon over which it has a bridge of sixteen arches famous for the residence and resort of many of the west saxon kings particularly alfred here is a very magnificent church and near this place formerly was a famous forest  bradford is a market town and has a bridge over the avon it is well built of stone and lies in the side of a hill  trubridge is an ancient market town and had formerly a castle of seven towers but long since destroyed the court of the duchy of lancaster for this county is annually held here  westbury is a little borough market town but was formerly of great note some quantity of roman coins have been found here  warminster is noted as i have said for the prodigious quantity of corn which is sold in it every market day upon the downs near this town are two ancient camps supposed to be danish  it is observable that these five last towns belonged anciently to the family of the hungerfords which in king edward ivs reign came by marriage to the lord hastings who being executed in richard iiis time this vast estate was given by that king to howard duke of norfolk first earlmarshal of that family in england  near warminster is the famous forest of selwood called by the ancient britons coedmaur i e greatwood it is    miles in length and very thick of wood  mere which in the old saxon signifys boundary as this place seems to be on the borders of wilts somerset and dorset is but a village and yet gives name to the hundred where it stands it has neither fair nor market in it but it had anciently a castle not far from this place is an old danish camp called whitesholehill sir francis cotton who flourished in the reign of king james and afterward of charles i was born here  a little southeast of mere lies hindon a small borough and market town and northeast of it stands heightsbury an inconsiderable town but noted formerly for an hospital  lavington is also a little more north a very indifferent market town  the devizes is excellently situated about two miles from the bottom of the hills which keep off the eastern winds and in a rich soil under the hill at runway is an excellent spring which the inhabitants have not yet found means to convey thither though it runs but a little way off the town where they want water it is a very large old town consisting chiefly of two long parallel streets the houses mostly of timber but of a very good model the inhabitants value themselves for being tenants to the king and for one of the best weekly markets in england the castle was originally roman judiciously seated upon a natural fortification but in aftertimes made in a manner impregnable by roger a bishop of salisbury though now it suffers daily by peoples taking away the materials here are two churches the choir of st marys is of a very old model as are the steeple choir and both wings of st johns to which additions have been made and new wide windows with pointed arches in the room of the ancient narrow semicircular ones  just out of town is a pretty plain called the green with another handsome church and steeple suburbs to the old town here william cadby a gardener dug up his collection of gods which he carried about for a show they were found in a garden in a cavity enclosed with roman brick the venus is of an excellent design and the vestal virgin as they call it a fragment of corinthian brass and of very curious workmanship vulcan is as lame as if made at a forge he had also several coins found thereabouts and a brass roman key which my lord winchelsea bought roman antiquities are discovered here every day the same nobleman has a brass probus on the reverse victoria germ with a trophy a great number of such relics is to be met with all round the country  calne is a little town situate on a stony hill and very ancient and is supposed to have been one of the seats of the west saxon kings it has a neat church and a good weekly market after a great rain in november      the waters rose so very high here on a sudden that they overflowed the town damaged a great quantity of goods drowned two men in the street and carried off a cask of oil of  00 gallons which could not be found for several days after a great parcel of roman coins were dug up here formerly here was likewise anciently an hospital of black canons  i am now come into the road to marlborough on the downs about two or three miles from the town are abundance of loose stones lying scattered about the plain some whereof are very large and appear to be of the same kind with those of stonehenge and some larger they are called by the country people the gray weathers and it must be confessed that they look not unlike sheep straggling upon the downs on a transient and distant view as travelers pass these gray weathers on a more curious inspection are found to be a sort of white marble and lie upon the surface of the ground in infinite numbers and of all dimensions they are loose detached from any rock and as dr stukeley thinks lay there ever since the creation being solid parts thrown out to the surface of the fluid globe when its rotation was first impressed  marlborough so called from its hills of chalk which anciently was called marle it is the cunetia from kenet of the romans but from the coming of the saxons to the conquest there is no mention of it it is governed by a mayor aldermen and burgesses and is well built it consists chiefly of one broad and strait street to the south are some relics of a priory the gate house is still remaining on the north the chapel of another religious house remains now turned into a dwelling house the seat of my lord hertford was the site of the roman costrum for there they find foundations and roman coins and toward the river without the gardenwalls one angle of it very manifestly remains and the rampart d ditch entire the road going over the bridge cuts it off from the present castle the ditch is still  0 feet wide in some parts the mount so much noted was the keep of the castle it is now converted into a pretty spiral walk on the top of which is an octagonal summer house from whence you have a pleasant view over the town and county the town has at present a pretty good shopkeeping trade but not much of the manufacturing part the river kennet some years ago made navigable by act of parliament rises just by this town from whence running to hungerford and newbury it becomes a large stream and passing by reading runs into the thames near that town this river is famous for crayfish which they help travelers to at newbury but they seldom want for price  at abury near marlborough downs in the way to bath are to be seen the stupendous remains of a druids temple being a collection of monstrous stones of the like nature with those of stonehenge and brought together from the downs for the same religious purposes as dr stukeley makes no question  on the hills on this side the devizes is roundway down where the kings forces under prince maurice but owing chiefly to the lord wilmot beat and entirely routed the famous sir william waller in the civil wars from whence the place is called by some runaway down to this day  a little nearer toward marlborough is st anns hill where notwithstanding several high hills between and the distance of twentytwo miles or more is a fair view of salisbury steeple or spire which is deemed the highest in england  at badmington in wiltshire have been found nine caves all in a row but of different dimensions the least of them four feet wide some nine or ten feet long two long stones being set upon the sides and the top covered with broad stones spurs pieces of armor and the like have been found in these caves which gives ground to believe that they were tombs of some ancient warriors romans saxons or danes  in our way from marlborough to newbury we mounted a chalky hill of which sort is much of the soil of wilts on the top of which we entered into savernack forest belonging to the rght hon the lord bruce and is almost the only privileged ground of hunting of that denomination possessed by a subject it is in circumference about twelve miles plentifully stocked with deer of a large size and rendered very pleasant and delightful by the many walks and vistas lately cut and levelled through the several coppices and woods with which it abounds eight of these vistas meet like so many rays of a star in a point near the middle of the forest where his lordship has prepared and cleared the ground for erecting an octagon tower whose sides will be correspondent to the vistas through one of which you will have a view of his lordships seat at about two miles distance called tottenham from a park of that name in which it is situate contiguous to the forest  it is a stately edifice newly erected on the same spot of ground where stood an ancient palace destroyed by fire of the marquis of hereford so justly celebrated for his steady adherence and powerful assistance to the royal cause during the whole course of the civil wars from whom his lordship is descended by his mother the lady elizabeth sister and niece to the two last dukes of somerset of the elder line  to give you some idea of the grandeur and magnificence of the structure it will be sufficient to observe that it was begun carried on and finished after the model and under the direction of our modern vitruvius the earl of burlington who to the strength and convenience of the english architecture has added the elegance and politeness of the italian taste  the house has four towers and four fronts each of them diversely beautified and adorned to which are now added four wings wherein are rooms of state a noble and capacious room for a library containing a judicious and large collection of several thousand books in all languages but especially the modern  the beauty and delightfulness of the buildings are much augmented by the large canals the spacious and wellplanted walks which surround it one of which leading to the london road extends two miles in length  about the same distance from hence on the opposite side are to be seen the remains of a large house the seat of sir john seymour father of the unfortunate protector called wolfhall of which no more is standing than suffices for a farmhouse here king henry viii as tradition goes celebrated his nuptials with the lady jane seymour and kept his weddingdinner in a very large barn hung with tapestry on the occasion for confirmation of which they show you in the walls thereof some tenterhooks with small pieces of tapestry fastened to them and between this place and tottenham thre is a walk with old trees on each side still known by the name of king harrys walk  from hence continuing our course easterly we came to a boroughtown called great bedwin which dr stukeley takes to be the leucomagus of ravennas it is an old corporation and gave birth to the famous dr t willis the ornament of english physicians castle copse half a mile from the town south east was probably the roman castle and havisdike a camp of that people some time since there was in the east window of the church the picture of a priest with two crutches a cup in his hand and a can standing by him with an inscription in old english capitals but in the language obsolete french which in english is this i am peris called vicar of this church upon my crutches leaning just in this wise my pouch in my fist and i will drink without guile my pot at my back set after the new mode to my pot and my pouch i will have justice done for none shall drink without putting in as much again   the church is large and capacious in which are some ancient monuments particularly one of a knighttemplar called adam of scott from a manor of that name in the parish with an inscription not legible and another abovementioned of sir john seymour father of the protector wherein we have an account of the names of all his children with their several intermarriages and deaths the church is very strongly built with flint and a cement near as hard as themselves in form of a cross in the center of which is erected a high tower containing a good ring of six very musical bells  moving hence toward the northeast a little we crossed the much famed wansdyke a work of prodigious labor and expense and concluded by most writers to be a boundary of one of the kingdoms of the heptarchy probably that of the west saxons before its enlargement by incroaching on other kingdoms it may be traced from near bath all over the downs to this place where it turns its course toward the southern coasts it is supposed by some to derive its name from woden one of the saxon deities  soon after we mounted a small hill of easy ascent on the summit of which was erected as historians inform us a fortified place the residence of cissa a viceroy of one of the southsaxon kings from whom it derives its denomination of chisbury or cisbury who also built chichester for the resort of his people as he did this for the repose of himself it seems to have been strongly fortified being surrounded with a double ditch or mote of considerable depth and breadth and full of water since which time there has been a religious house here the chapel of which is still remaining but converted into a barn  from hence we returned to the great london road and soon arrived at a village called froxfield about seven miles from marlborough in which is a handsome and wellendowd almshouse founded by sarah duchess dowager of somerset relict of john the last duke of the elder branch of the noble family of seymours descended from the great duke of somerset protector of the king and kingdom during the minority of king edward vi this lady bequeathed by her will above  000 l for the building and furniture of this almshouse and devised several manors messuages and farms for the maintenance of thirty poor widows not having  0 l per ann to subsist upon one half of which are widows of clergymen and the other of laymen giving a preference to those of the last sort who live on the manors so devised by her she left in her will particular directions for the form dimensions and site of the structure and for the manner of electing ruling and providing for the widows which her executors especially sir william gregory who chiefly took upon him the execution of the trust punctually observed  the building is neat and strong in the form of a quadrangle having one front and a court before it facing the road it contains thirty groundrooms and as many chambers one of each sort being allowed to every widow for her apartment with an area or bed in a garden on the north part of the building enclosed with a brickwall  in the midst of the quadrangle is built a handsome and convenient chapel furnished with a communion table pulpit desk pews and books for the use of the widows wherein the chaplain whose stipend is  0 l per ann is to read prayers every day and to preach on sundays and for his further encouragement is to be presented on a vacancy to the rectory of kemish in the same county which the duchess has appropriated to that use besides the yearly pension in money which is now about eight guineas she has also ordered a clothgown with a certain quantity of wood every winter to each of the widows and when the estates which she has given to the said almshouse many of which are now demised upon leases for lives shall fall in and shall produce a clear yearly income of more than  00 l she has appointed additional lodgings to be built for the reception of twenty more widows who are to be placed on the same establishment elected and provided for in the same manner as the thirty former and then all the rents and profits of the said estates the salary for the chaplain and a steward being first deducted shall be distributed in equal shares and proportions between the fifty widows  the produce of all the estates devised to this and another charitable use which i shall mention byandby upon the determination of the leases granted will according to the best information i could get amount to little less than  000 l per ann  this truly useful and excellent charity which displays the judgment as well as charitable disposition of the noble foundress is under the inspection and management of several worthy gentlemen and clergymen of the neighborhood who discharge the trust reposed in them with a very laudable diligence and integrity scrupulously or religiously rather pursuing the directions of the will carefully preventing all imbezelments and frequently meeting at their own expense for the dispatch of business in the execution of their trust which worthy example if imitated by other trustees or directors of charitable benefactions who too often make a property of their trust would be of public emolument and singular benefit to the poor by rescuing charitable devises from the discouragement they now lie under and rendering unnecessary the trouble and expense of applying for and suing out commissions of charitable uses  the same charitable lady to make provision for the helpless young as well as destitute old has also bequeathed a considerable yearly sum for the apprenticing of ten or twelve children in which a preference is to be given to such as were born in her manors in the management of which trust another set of trustees act with the same commendable uncorruptness and integrity as the former  we next came to hungerford a little markettown situate in a moorishplace remarkable only for being a great thoroughfare to bath and bristol and for plenty of trout and crayfish it is governed by the lord of the manor as constable who is however chosen annually into that office from this town the ancient family of the barons of hungerford took their name and title the first of the family was the first speaker of the house of commons in    edward iii they possessed a vast estate this way and in all the neighboring counties which was twice forfeited for their attachment to the house of lancaster this vast estate fell by a daughter to the famous lord hastings who was executed in the reign of richard iii when howard first duke of norfolk had a grant of it from that prince who falling with his master in the battle of bosworthfield king henry vii restored it with the honor to a younger branch of the hungerfords who had joined him and shared in the glory of that victory but his descendants suffered death for treason    henry viii though queen mary restored them again he was the third of the family who died for treason such vicissitudes attended this noble family and their great estate  we pursued the great road and arrived at newbury situate in a most fruitful plain and watered by the river kennet which is made navigable up to the town which carries on a very great trade in malt etc with london it is governed by a mayor high steward aldermen and burgesses the streets are spacious and the marketplace large where there is great store of corn sold and a hall for the business of the corporation stands in it  here is also a good charityschool very well endowed and this place is noted for good trout and crayfish  near this town was a double scene of blood for here were two obstinate battles fought at different times between the kings army and the parliaments king charles being present at them both and both were fought almost upon the same spot of ground in these two battles it was observed by an experienced soldier who served in the kings army that the generals on both sides showed the most exquisite skill in the managing posting bringing up and drawing off their troops and the men fought with equal bravery in the first of these battles the success was doubtful and both sides claimed the advantage in the last the kings army had apparently the worst of it and yet the king in a very few days with a great body of horse brought off his cannon which he had in the close of the battle thrown into dunington castle and carried them away to oxford the head quarter of his army and this he did in the sight of the victorious army facing them at the same time with a body of six thousand horse they on the other hand not thinking fit to draw out to attack him that retreat in point of honor was equal to a victory and gave new courage as well as reputation to the kings troops  part of newbury is also known by the name of spinhamlands for it arose out of the ruins of an old town called spine the remains of which now join to newbury in respect to which it was called new borough and for shortness newbury it is noted among other things for two or three good inns where travelers are well accommodated  this town of newbury was an ancient clothing town though now little of that business remains to it but it retains still a manufacturing genius and the people are generally employed in making shalloon which though it be used only for the lining and insides of mens clothes yet it becomes so generally worn both at home and abroad that it is increased to a manufacture by itself and is more considerable than any single manufacture of stuffs in the nation this imploys the town of newbury as also andover a town i have already described and many others in different counties of england  here lived the famous jack of newbury the greatest clothier that ever was in england having  00 looms at work in his own house he flourished in the reign of henry viii and marched at the head of  00 of his own men all clothed and maintained by himself to the battle of floddenfield where he behaved well he rebuilt part of newbury church and the whole tower of it this is one of the two legatee towns as they were called in the will of the famous mr kenrick who being the son of a clothier of newbury and afterward a merchant in london left  000 l to newbury and   00 l to reading to encourage the clothing trade and to set the poor at work besides other gifts of extraordinary value to the poor  this gentlemans will is to be seen at large in stows survey of london to which i refer  what improvement the towns of newbury and reading have made of these great sums i did not inquire into  near newbury the late earl of craven built a very stately pile of buildings for his own dwelling called spine but as it was never quite finished so i do not understand that his lordship ever came to live in it and some years ago it was by a sudden fire burnt down to the ground it was reported that that lord built this magnificent palace for such it really was at a time when he had hopes of marrying madame royale as she was then called viz the queen of bohemia sister to king charles i who then a widow lived under the shadow of the english coutt but being frustrated in that view the earl went no farther in his building but his present lordship has lately rebuilt this house and though not in so grand a manner as the former it is very commodious  westward a little out of our way we visited the ruins of the castle of donnington just mentioned which was seated on the brow of a high hill washed by the little river lambourn and had been the seat of sir geoffrey chaucer father of english poetry they show us a place here where in his days as well as many years since even down to the memory of some of the inhabitants now living flourished a great oak called chaucers oak where they very gravely tell you he used to sit and compose his poems  we went forward to the town of lambourn so called from the river which runs down and falls into the kennet near thatcham it is situate on the south side of whitehorsehill and has a market this river is remarkable for being very low in winter and high in summer it goes off about michaelmas and the sooner it goes the more plentiful say the inhabitants will that year be this town is likewise noted for the birthplace or at least the residence of the poet sylvester who celebrates the river in the following lines and little lambesbourn  all summer long while all thy sisters shrink then of thy waters thousands daily drink besides shed water which in haste does run to wash the feet of chaucers donnington but while the rest are full unto the top all summer long thou do not shed a drop nor sendst a doit of needless subsidy to cram the kennet s wantless treasury before her stores be spent and springs be staid then then alone thou lendst a liberal aid teaching thy wealthy neighbors mine of late how when and where to right participate their streams of comfort to the poor that pine and not to grease the still too greasy swine neither for fame or form when others do to give a morsel or a mite or two but sevrally and of a selfly motion when others miss to give the most devotion   at newbury we quitted the high road and being desirous to see something of the north of berkshire we struck up to islip which though but an inconsiderable little town yet has a good weekly market for sheep  we passed northeastward to wantage a town of some antiquity pretty good and neat it is noted for the birthplace of the renowned king alfred and is watered by the och  from wantage we advanced into the fine and fertile vale of whitehorse which extends almost from farringdon to abington though not in a direct line looking south from the vale we see a trench cut on the side of a high green hill in the shape of a horse and not ill done the trench is about a yard deep and filled almost up with chalk so that at a distance you see the exact shape of a whitehorse so large as takes up near an acre of ground from this figure the hill is called whitehorsehill and the vale below takes also its name it is said to be done in order to commemorate a signal victory and some give it to the saxons whose device was and still is a white horse westward of this vale lies ashbury betwixt which and wantage is a very large camp on the brow of a hill it is single worked and of a quadrangular form which shows it a roman work  the neighboring parish to this whitehorse have a custom annually at midsummer to go and weed it in order to keep it in shape and color and when they have done their work they end the day in feasting and meriment  we arrived at farringdon noted for its pleasant situation on a hill it has a very good market weekly and is very neat and clean in this place may be seen the ruins of a castle built by robert earl of gloucester in king stephens reign here was also a priory of cistertian monks the church is large and handsome  from hence we went partly by the forest to abingdon a handsome well built town where the assizes and sessions and other public meetings of the county are generally held here is a stately markethouse built on high pillars over which is a large hall for the assizes the town consists of several wellpaved streets which center in an open and spacious place where the cornmarket is kept they make great quantities of malt here and send it up by barges to london here is a good free school and also a charityschool the corporation is governed by a mayor two bailiffs and nine aldermen  it is an ancient town and was famed for religious houses in the time of the ancient britons it was also famous for having several synods held there and for one of the noblest abbeys in the kingdom founded as it is said by heane nephew to cissa father to king ina henry i was educated in this monastery  we next came to wallingford called by the ancient britons gwal hen i e old fort a place of great figure as well in their days and of the romans as of the saxons and danes the last of whom destroyed it in  00  but it was soon rebuilt and esteemed a borough in the confessors time it has been defended by a strong castle which has been long since demolished it is still a large well built town has a good marketplace and town hall where the assizes have been sometimes held and a quartersession for the borough always it has still two churches standing but one was very much damaged in the civil wars when two others here were altogether destroyed it has two weekly markets and is governed by a mayor burgesses etc  here we crossed the thames into oxfordshire and leaving wathington a little inconsiderable market town on the left we fell down through netlebed likewise a town of little note to henley upon thames a very ancient town the name being derived from the british word henlley i e old place it was formerly part of the estate of the barons of hungerford mentioned before it is now a corporation of great account governed by a warden burgesses and other officers it has a considerable corn and maltmarket the inhabitants are mostly maltsters mealmen and bargemen who by carrying corn and timber to london get a gainful living and enrich the neighborhood it has a good free grammar school and also a charity school liberally endowed for teaching clothing and apprenticing several poor children here is also an almshouse but meanly endowed for though there are not above six or seven persons in it they have but sixpence apiece weekly for their allowance  we returned over a wooden bridge into berkshire and as thatcham woolhampton and theal which lie between newbury and reading are at present noted only for being great thoroughfare towns and full of inns we went no further back than reading  reading is so called from the british word rhedin i e fern which formerly grew in great quantity there it is a very large and wealthy town handsomely built the inhabitants rich and driving a very great trade the town is situated on the river kennet but so near the thames that the largest barges which they use may come up to the town bridge where they have wharfs to load and unload them their chief trade is by this waternavigation to and from london though they have necessarily a great trade into the country for the consumption of the goods which they bring by their barges from london and particularly coals salt grocery wares tobacco oils and all heavy goods  they send from hence to london by these barges very great quantities of malt and meal and these are the two principal articles of their loadings some of those barges are so large that i was told they bring a thousand or twelve hundred quarters of malt at a time which according to the ordinary computation of tonnage in the freight of other vessels is from a hundred to an hundred and twenty ton dead weight  they also send very great quantities of timber from reading for berkshire being a wellwooded county and the river thames a convenient conveyance for the timber they transport the largest and fairest of the timber to london which is generally bought by the shipwrights in the river for the building merchantships the like trade of timber is carried on at henley abovementioned and at maidenhead of which in its place  a large manufacture of sailcloth was set up in reading by the late sir owen buckingham lord mayor of london and many of the poor people were profitably employed in it but sir owen dying and his son being unhappily killed in a duel a little while after that manufacture died also  here is however still a remnant of the woollen manufacture which was once carried on in it to a very considerable degree and this town as well as newbury has enjoyed the abovementioned legacies of mr kenrick to set the poor at work and encourage the clothing trade viz   00 l  mr camdens continuator says there were once   0 masterclothiers in this one town but now they are almost all gone during the civil wars in england this town was strongly fortified and the remains of the bastions and other works are still to be seen  there are three churches built of flint and square stones in the quincunx fashion with tall towers of the same here are also two large meeting houses besides that of the quakers camden calls it a little city it is said to contain about  000 people including a little hamlet at the bridge over the thames archbishop laud was born in this town  it was formerly noted for a very famous abbey and other religious foundations the abbey stood in a charming situation and large ruins of it are still visible built of flint the walls which remain are about eight feet thick though the stone that faced them is gone what is left is so hard cemented that the labor in separating them would not be answered by their use there are many remnants of arched vaults a good height above ground whereon stood as may be presumed the hall lodgings etc the abbey gate house is yet pretty entire  this was built by king henry i on an old abbey formerly erected by a saxon lady that prince was buried in it with his queen but their monuments are lost in the ruins of the place and nowhere to be found  there was a famous old castle long since demolished  the empress maud daughter of henry i was also buried here but her monument is lost as well as the others it bore this inscription as we are assured magna ortu majorque viro sed maxima partu hic jacet henrici filia sponsa parens thus translated illustrious in descent in marriage more but noblest in her offsprings royal power great henrys daughter parent wife deplore   the deceased earl cadogan who was created baron of reading by his late majesty king george i in      built a fine large house at caversham near reading which his successor the present lord cadogan thought fit to reduce to a smaller and more convenient size as less regarding the outward glare of magnificence than use and convenience  at reading in the year      began the universal alarm that spread over the whole kingdom almost at the same time of the irish being coming to cut every bodys throats which was carried from town to town by peoples fears and terrors aggravated by the menaces of an irish detachment of soldiers who were beat out of reading by the dutch and prevented taking the quarters they intended at maidenhead colebrook stanes etc  it is impossible to express the consternation of the people all over england on this occasion for the terrible story spread like the undulations of the water in a pond when a flat stone is cast upon the surface all over the kingdom as i have said in one day for fear gave wings to the news no post could carry it as it flew from town to town and still every messenger had two articles with him   not that such and such towns were to be burnt and plundered by them but that they were already burnt and   that the irish were at their heels to do the like there and the service this report did to the cause of the revolution is hardly to be imagined  twyford is about five miles east of reading and is only noted like theale and the other towns beyond reading for its number of inns for the accommodations of carriers etc  just beyond theale is inglefield where king ethetwolf routed the danes  from reading i went to great marlow in buckinghamshire which though not in the direct road yet lying on the banks of the river thames is proper enough to be spoken of and is particularly worth notice for several things    it is a town of very great imbarkation on the thames not so much for manufactures wrought here for the trade of the town is chiefly in bonelace but for goods brought from the neighboring towns a very great quantity of malt and meal particularly being brought hither from high wickham which is one of the greatest cornmarkets on this side of england and lies on the road from london to oxford    between high wickham and marlow is a little river called the loddon on which are a great many cornmills and some papermills the first of these grind and dress the wheat and then the meal is sent to marlow and put on board the barges for london and the second make great quantities of ordinary printingpaper    on the thames just by the side of this town though on the other bank are three very remarkable mills called the templemills or the brassmills for making bisham abbey battery work as they call it viz brass kettles and pans etc of all sorts and these works were attended with no small success till in the year    0 they made a bubble of it and then it ran the fate of all the bubbles at that time    next to these are two mills which are both of an extraordinary kind one for making of thimbles a work which performs to admiration and another for pressing of oil from rape and flaxseed both which turn to very good account to the proprietors  hither is also brought down a vast quantity of beech wood which grows in buckinghamshire more plentifully than in any other part of england and from whence the county itself derives its name  at bisham over against this town was formerly an abbey and the remains of it are still to be seen the estate belonged once to the knights templars and since came to the ancient family of hobby whereof sir william hobby and sir edward hobby are noted in our histories the latter as having been employed by queen elizabeth in the most important foreign negotiations as a learned man and great antiquary their monuments with those of their ladies and children are in the little church of bisham and well worth seeing the seat of the family is now in dorsetshire but hither they are generally all brought when they die to be buried with their ancestors  a little higher on the same side of the river is hurley an ancient seat of the lord lovela and all the male branches of the family bg extinct it came by the daughter and heirs  o sr hnry johnson of blackwall near ratcliffe who originally was only a shipwright or masterbuildr at the great yard and dock there of which i shall speak in their place this lady left only one daughter married to the late earl of strafford  from hence we fell with the thames into maidenhead and so came into the london road again it is an ancient corporation under the government of a high steward a mayor a steward and ten aldermen out of which they annually elect two bridgmasters to look after the large timberbridge which here crosses the thames for the repair of which the town has three trees annually allowed them out of windsor forest the mayor for the time being is clerk of the market and coroner and he and the mayor for the preceding year and the steward are justices of the peace they choose yearly two macebearers the town is a large thoroughfare with many good inns in it and has a good market weekly it lies in two parishes one part of it is in bray famous of old for its conforming vicar to all times changes and seasons  as soon as you are out of maidenhead you see cliefden on your left where george duke of buckingham began a magnificent and delightful palace which the late earl of orkney afterward purchased of the family and finished and now has the honor to be the summer retreat of his royal highness frederick prince of wales  we came to slough a village five miles east of maidenhead which consists almost entirely of inns they seem to vie with one another and it is wonderful how they all subsist and especially as they are opposed by the two famous new ones of the castle and windmill a little way out of slough which are much more delightfully situated and have better accommodations  here we left the road and turned to the right and soon arrived at eton where there is the finest school for grammar learning that is in britain or perhaps in europe  the buildings except the great schoolroom are ancient the chapel gothic but all has been repaired at a very great expense out of the college stock within these few years and a noble library built for the reception of books  in the great court a fine statue is erected to the honor of the founder by dr godolphin late dean of st pauls and provost of this college and the library has received several considerable benefactions particularly very lately the fine collection of richard topham esquire formerly keeper of the records in the tower which was presented to it by the late excellent lord chief justice reeves and before that a collection of books valued at  000 l was left to it by dr waddington late bishop of chichester  the gardens which extend from the college down almost to the bank of the thames are well planted and kept  this college was founded by king henry vi a prince munificent in his gifts for the encouragement of learning witness besides this noble foundation that of kings college in cambridge to which the scholars of eton are annually removed and which had it been perfected as he designed it would have been the noblest building of the kind in the world but his successor and deposer k ed iv took several manors from eton college and bestowed them on their neighbors at windsor and had intended to have taken from them still more had not the celebrated jane shore solicited in their behalf  this college has a settled revenue of about  000 l per ann and maintains a provost a viceprovost who is also a fellow six other fellows and  0 scholars on the foundation besides a full choir for the chapel with necessary officers and servants the school is divided into the upper and lower and each into three classes each school has one master and each master four assistants or ushers none are received into the upper school till they can make latin verses and have a tolerable knowledge of the greek in the lower school the children are received very young and are initiated into all schoollearning besides the seventy scholars upon the foundation there are always abundance of children generally speaking of the best families and of persons of distinction who are boarded in the houses of the townsmen and within the college  the number of scholars instructed here used to be from  00 to  00 but has not been for seven years past more than   0  the election of scholars for the university out of this school is made annually on the first tuesday in august in order to it three persons are deputed from kings college in cambridge viz the provost of that college and one senior and one junior poser fellows of the same who being joined by the provost the viceprovost and the head master of eton college call before them the scholars of the upper class and examining them in the several parts of their learning choose out twelve such as they think best qualified and enter them in a roll or list for the university these youths are not immediately removed from the school but must wait till vacancies fall in kings college and as such happen are then taken as they stand in seniority in the roll of election  when a scholar from eton comes to kings college he is received upon the foundation and pursues his studies there for three years after which he claims a fellowship unless forfeited by marriage accepting of ecclesiastic preferments etc according to the terms of the statutes  the provost has a noble house and garden besides the use of the college gardens at his pleasure  will you sir excuse me here a few lines to the memory of the late excellent lord chief justice reeves beforementioned this worthy and eminent lawyer had a seat in this town to which he constantly retired at the close of every term while he was at the bar for he would never go the circuit or attend the court of chancery and actually declined accepting of the high office of a judge while his lady lived choosing rather to spend his vacations in retirement with his family than either honor or profit yet he was pursued even here with cases for his opinion as being the greatest lawyer of his time and these were conveyed to him by his clerk from his chambers in the temple and after he had answered them he would return them thither again without seeing the practisers who left them  this gentleman lay a long time undistinguished in his profession under an invincible modesty insomuch that he thought once of quitting the bar but a lucky occasion happening whereby he had an opportunity to show his great parts and learning he was soon taken notice of and retained in every cause of moment but however confined himself entirely to the courts of law and chiefly to that of the kings bench after the death of his wife he was prevailed with to ascend the bench as a judge in the last court which he accepted probably to alleviate and divert the concern he was in for her death he was afterward made lord chief justice of the common pleas in which office he lived but two years his death was a public loss and much lamented  i am now come to windsor where i must for a while quit the subject of trade and navigation in order to describe the most beautiful and most pleasantly situated castle and royal palace in the whole isle of great britain  william the conqueror was the first of our english monarchs who distinguished windsor that prince who delighted much in hunting finding it a situation highly proper for that purpose and as he said of it a suitable place for the entertainment of kings agreed with the abbot of westminster for an exchange and so took possession of it he built a castle here and had several little lodges or huntinghouses in the forest adjoining and frequently lodged for the convenience of his sport in a house which the monks before enjoyed near or in the town of windsor for the town is much more ancient than the present castle and was an eminent pass upon the thames in the reign of the saxon kings  after him king edward iii taking an extreme liking to that place resolved to fix his summer residence here and accordingly laid out himself the plan of that magnificent palace which as to outward form and building we now see there for whatever has been done as to beautifying altering or amending the inside and apartments nothing has been added to the building itself except that noble terrace which runs under the north front and leads to the green on the park at the east side or end of it along which the fine lodgings and royal apartments were at first built all the northpart being then taken up in rooms of state and halls for public balls etc  the house itself was indeed a palace and without any appearance of a fortification but when the building was brought on to the slope of the hill on the town side the king added ditches ramparts the round tower and several other places of strength and thence it was called a castle  such a pride did this great king take in being the founder of this sumptuous building that when it was suggested to him that william of wickham had assumed the honor of it to himself it had like to have cost william all his interest in the kings favor which at that time was very great but the prelate cleared himself by disavowing the charge urging that all he protended to was to acknowledge that the money and the reputation he had gained by building that castle for the king had been the making of him for it seems he had caused these words this made wickham to be cut in stone in the inner wall of the little tower which from him is to this day called winchester tower  william of wickham whom i have beforementioned in my account of winchester was at that time the architect of the court and so well performed his part that in all the decorations and ornaments which have been made since by succeeding princes they have found no occasion to add to or diminish any thing except it be to alter some small matter at the entrance to the great staircase the kitchen and offices below stairs and suchlike but the great north and east fronts the square of the inner court the great gates at the entering from the town with the round tower and the walls annexed are all standing in the very form in which king edward iii left them  the only addition in the inside is a fine equestrian statue of king charles ii which stands over the great well sunk as may be supposed in the first building for the supply of the castle with water and in which was an engine for raising it notwithstanding the great depth by very little labor the contrivance and performance of sir samuel morland an excellent mechanic and mathematician  on the outside as i have said was added the terrace walk by queen elizabeth where she usually walked for an hour every day before her dinner if not hindered by windy weather to which she had a peculiar aversion for she loved to walk in a mild calm rain with an umbrella over her head  this is really a magnificent work for as it is raised on a steep declivity of the hill it was necessarily cut down a very great depth to bring the foundation to a flat equal to the breadth which was to be formed above from the foundation it was raised by solid stone work of a vast thickness with cross walls of stone for banding the front and preventing any thrust from the weight of earth within  this noble walk is covered with fine gravel and has cavities with drains to carry off the water so that not a drop of rain will rest on the terrace but it is dry hard and fit to walk on immediately after the greatest showers the breadth of this walk is very spacious on the north side on the east side it is narrower neither versailles nor any of the royal palaces in france naples or rome can show any thing like this the grand seigniors terrace in the outer court of the seraglio next the sea is what i think comes the nearest and yet is not equal to it if i may believe the account of those who have seen it  at the northeast corner of this terrace where it turns south to run on by the east side of the castle are steps by which you go off upon the plain of the park which is kept smooth as a carpet and on the edge of which the prospect of the terrace is doubled by a vista south over the park and quite up to the great park and toward the forest here also is a small seat that will not contain above one or two at most with an high back and cover for the head which being fixed on a pin of iron or brass the persons who sit in it may easily turn it from the wind however it may blow and enjoy a complete calm this is said also to be queen elizabeths invention to avoid being ruffled with the wind and it affords no less shelter from the sun  from this lofty terrace the people within have an egress to the park and to a most beautiful walk which neither king edward iii nor his successors for some hundreds of years knew any thing of all their prospect being from the windows of the castle  on that side of the building which looks out upon the terrace are all the royal apartments those of king edward iii which were on the east side being now allotted to great officers of state  you mount into the royal apartments by several back stairs but the public way is up a small ascent to a flat or halfpace where there are two entries of state by two large staircases one on the left hand to the royal apartments and the other on the right to st georgeshall and the royal chapel  before the entrance to these on either side you pass through the guardchambers where you see the walls furnished with arms and the kings yeomen of the guard keep their station these rooms lead as well to the fine lodgings as to st georgeshall  in the royal lodgings there have been so many alterations of furniture that there can be no entering upon a particular description in the chimneypiece of one of these apartments is a piece of needle work exquisitely fine performed as they say by the queen of scots during the time of her confinement in fotheringaycastle there are several family pictures in the chimneypieces and other parts of those lodgings which are very valuable  these rooms look all out north toward the terrace and over part of the finest and richest vale in the world which along the course of the river thames with very little interruption reaches to and includes the city of london east and the city of oxford west the river with a beautiful winding stream gliding gently through the middle of it and enriching by its navigation both the land and the people on every side  it may be proper to say something of the beauties and ornaments of st georgeshall though nothing can be said equal to what the eye may be witness to it is surprising at the first entrance to see at the upperend the picture of king william on horseback under him an ascent with marble steps a balustrade and a half pace which formerly was actually there with room for a throne or chair of state for the sovereign to sit on when on public days he thought fit to appear in ceremony  at the west end of the hall is the chapel royal the neatest and finest of the kind in england the carved work is beyond any that can be seen in the kingdom  after we had spent some hours in viewing all that was curious on this side we came down to the dungeon or round tower which goes up a long but easy ascent of steps and is very high here we were obliged to deliver up our swords but nowhere else though here is nothing curious the governor or constables lodgings are neatly furnished but nowise extraordinary  from this tower you see st pauls cathedral at london very plainly  coming down from hence we entered into the other court where is the great chapel of the garter and the house or college for the poor knights as they are called  i might go back here to the history of the order of the garter the institution of which by king edward iii had its original here but this is done so fully in other authors that i shall only mention that this order was not founded on the countess of salisburys garter as polydere virgil the most conceited and most erroneous author that ever wrote of the english affairs ridiculously asserts but on that martial kings own garter which he gave as the signal at the glorious battle of cressi as st george was given for the word of the day to commemorate which in honor of his brave and warlike son and of those nobles and gentlemen who shared with him in the glory of that ever memorable day he instituted this order and here i cannot forbear observing though entirely out of my way how fond we have ever been in following foreigners in most things even from the coxcomb in dress up to the historian as is evident not only from this idle story of the abovementioned author prevailing among u in particular and of his history in general but likewise of the performance of a late foreign author of the affairs and transactions of this country whereby the translator and undertake to usher it out in english got at least  0000 l when it had nothing more but rather much less to recommend it than any of our own english histories  the following are the names of the first knights of this most noble order king edward iii the black prince henry d of lancaster thomas earl of warwick peers capitow de la bouch ralph earl of stafford w montacute e of salis roger mortimer earl of march john de lysle bartholomew burghersh john de beauchamp john de mun hugh courteney thomas holland john de gray richard fitz simon miles stapleton thomas wale hugh wortesley nele loring john chandos james d audeley otho holland henry eam sanchet daubricourt walter paveley alias pevrell   these though not all noblemen were however men of great characters and stations either in the army or in the civil administration and such as the sovereign did not think it below him to make his companions  the lower court of the castle although not so distinguished by lodgings and rooms of state is nevertheless particularly glorious for the fine chapel of the order a most beautiful and magnificent work and which shows the greatness not only of the court in those days but the spirit and genius of the magnanimous founder the chapel is not only fine within but the workmanship without is extraordinary nothing so ancient is to be seen so beautiful kingscollege chapel at cambridge built by henry vi and henry viis chapel in westminsterabbey are fine buildings but they are modern compared to this which was begun as by the inscribed dates upon the walls appears in the year       the coats of arms and the various imagery and other ornaments both inside and outside not only of the king but of several of the first knights companions are wonderfully finished and the work has stood out against the injury of time to admiration  it is observable that king edward owns this chapel was begun by his ancestors and some think it was by king edward i and that he himself was baptized in it and there was a castle built by william the conqueror also as to the chapel which was then called a church or a convent king edward iii did not pull down the old building entirely but he added all the choir to the first model and several other proper parts for the purposes intended as houses and handsome apartments for the canons dignitaries and other persons belonging to the church which are generally situated on the north side of the square out of sight or rather skreened from the common view by the church itself which dwellings are notwithstanding very good and well accommodated for the persons who are possessors of them then the king finished it in the manner we now see it as for the old castle the building of william the conqueror the king pulled it down to the foundation forming a new building according to the present plan and which stood as above to the time of king charles ii without any alteration  the establishment for this chapel was very considerable by the donation of diverse subjects before it was set apart to be the chapel of the order the duke of suffolk in particular as appears in dugdales monasticon gave near  000 acres of land    manors   0 messuages and tofts and several advowsons of churches to it which with other gifts afterward made the revenue above  000 l a year in those days which was a prodigious sum as money went at that time  in the choir are the stalls for the knights of the order with a throne for the sovereign also stalls in the middle of it for the poor knightspensioners who live in their house or hospital on the south side of the square or court in which the church stands  here are to be seen the banners of the knights who now enjoy the honor of the garter when they die those banners are taken down and the coat of arms of the deceased knight set up in the place allotted for those arms over the same stall so those coats of arms are a living history or rather a record of all the knights that ever have been since the first institution of the order and how they succeeded one another by which it appears that kings emperors and sovereign princes have not thought it below them to accept of the honor of being knights companions of the order while at the same time it must be noted to the honor of the english crown that our kings have never thought fit to accept of any of their orders abroad of what kind soever whereas there is an account in the registry of the order that there are reckoned up of this most noble company   emperors of germany   kings of sweden   kings of denmark   kings of prussia   kings of spain   princes of orange   kings of france   peers of france a king of scotland besides james vi   kings of portugal a king of poland   kings of naples a king of arragon   infants of portugal a prince of denmark a bishop of osnabrug   princes of lunenburg an elector of brandenburg   electors palatine   electors of saxony   dukes of lorrain   dukes of wirtenberg   dukes of holstein   grandees of spain   dukes de urbino a duke of savoy a duke of saxe gotha a prince of hesse etc   besides these foreign princes there is a little galaxy of english nobility the flower of so many courts and so many ages to whose families the ensigns of the order have been an honor and who are not the least glory this order has to boast of but as to the list of the present knights that being subject to fluctuation comes not within my design in this letter  several kings and persons of high rank have been buried also in this chapel as edward iv and charles i here also is the family buryingplace of the dukes of beauford who are a natural branch of the royal family of lancaster  all the ceremonies observed here in the instalment of the knights are so perfectly set down in mr ashmoles history of the order of the garter that nothing can be said but what must be a copy from him  as the upper court and building are fronted with the fine terrace so the lower court where this beautiful chapel stands is encompassed with a very high wall which goes round the west end of the court to the gate and looking south leads into the town as the gate of the upper court looks likewise southeast into the little park  the parks about windsor are very agreeable and spacious the little park as it is called is above   miles round the great one    and the forest above  0 the first is particular to the court the others are open for riding hunting and taking the air for any gentlemen that please  the lodges in those parks may be called palaces were they not eclipsed by the palace itself they have been beautified by the noble persons to whom the post of rangers has been generally assigned who having been enriched by other advancements honors and profitable employments thought nothing too much to lay out to adorn their apartments in a place wherein it was so much to their honor as well as convenience to reside such is the lodge belonging once to admiral churchill the duchess of marlborough and others  we left windsor and struck again into the london road at colebrook and passed over the heath and through the town of hounslow brentford hamersmith and kensington into london  and here i shall conclude this letter with assuring you that i am sir  your humble servant  letter ii containing a description of the city of london as taking in the city of westminster borough of southwark and the buildings circumjacent sir i am now to describe the city of london and parts adjacent a work infinitely difficult to be performed in the narrow compass of a letter since we see it so fully takes up two large volumes in folio which yet if i may venture to give an opinion of it is very imperfectly executed and has employed since another very large one in folio written by mr w maitland f r s which has much more merit than the two volumes and contains many things needful to be known by the curious which are incompatible with the brevity to which our narrow limits confine us  london as a city only and as its walls and liberties line it out might indeed be viewed in a smaller compass than what we propose to consider it in for when i speak of london in the modern acceptance i take in all that vast mass of buildings reaching from blackwall in the east to tothillfields in the west and extended in an unequal breadth from the bridge or river in the south to islington north and from peterboroughhouse on the bankside in westminster to cavendishsquare and all the new buildings by and beyond grosvenor and hanover squares to the brentford road one way to the acton road another a prodigy of buildings that nothing in the world does or ever did surpass except old rome in trajans time when the walls of that city were  0 miles in compass and the number of inhabitants   00000 souls  london as to its figure must be owned to be very irregular as it is stretched out in buildings just at the pleasure of every undertaker of them and as the convenience of the people directs whether for trade or otherwise this has given it a very confused face and made it uncompact and unequal being properly neither long or broad round or square whereas the city of rome was in a manner round with very few irregularities in its shape  one sees london including the buildings on both sides the water in some places three miles broad as from st georges in southwark to shoreditch in middlesex or two miles as from peterboroughhouse to montaguehouse and in some places not half a mile as in wapping and less in rotherhith  we see several villages formerly standing as it were in the country and at a great distance now joined to the streets by continued buildings and more making haste to meet in the like manner for example    deptford this town was formerly reckoned at least two miles from rotherhith and that over the marshes too a place unlikely ever to be inhabited and yet now by the increase of buildings in that town itself and the many streets erected at rotherhith and by the docks and buildingyards on the riverside which stand between both the town of deptford and the streets of rotherhith are in a manner joined and the buildings daily increasing so that deptford may be reckoned a part of the great mass and infinitely full of people also and were the town of deptford now separated and rated by itself i believe it contains more people and stands upon more ground than the city of wells    the town of islington on the northside of the city is in like manner joined to the streets of london excepting one small field and which is in itself so small that there is no doubt but in a very few years they will be entirely joined and the same may be said    of mileend on the east end of the town    newingtonbutts in surrey reaches out her hand north and is so joining to southwark that it cannot now be properly called a town by itself but a kind of suburb to the borough and if as once was talked of st georgesfields should be built into squares and streets newington lambeth and the borough would make but one southwark  that westminster is in a fair way to shake hands with chelsea as st gyless is with marybone and great russel street by montaguehouse with tottenhamcourt is very evident and yet all these put together may still be called london whither will this city then extend and where must a circumvallation line of it be placed  i have as near as i could caused a measure to be taken of this mighty body and for the satisfaction of your curiosity i have here given as accurate a description of it as i can do in so narrow a compass or without drawing a plan of the places  as i am forced in many places to take in some unbuilt ground so i have on the other hand been obliged to leave a great many whole streets of buildings out of my line so that i have really not stretched my calculations to make it seem bigger than it is nor is there any occasion for it  a line of measurement drawn about all the continued buildings of the city of london and parts adjacent including westminster and southwark etc nb i shall sum up by figures       etc the particulars at last  the line begins for the middlesex side of the buildings   at peterboroughhouse the farthest house west upon the river thames and runs northwest by west by the marshes to tothillfields and passing by the neathouses and arnolds brewhouse ends at chelsea road measured   mile   furlongs    rods    then allowing an interval from buckinghamhouse cross the park about one furlong and half to the corner of my lord godolphins gardenwall the line goes north behind the stableyard buildings and behind parkplace and on the parkwall behind the buildings on the west side of st jamessstreet to the corner in soho or piccadilly then crossing the road goes along the north side of the road west hydepark gate   mile   furlongs    rods    then the line turns northeast by east and taking in the buildings and streets called mayfair holds on east till the new streets formed out of hydehouse garden cause it to turn away north a point west reaching to tyburnroad a little to the east of the great mother conduit then it goes north and crossing the road takes in the west side of cavendishsquare and the streets adjoining and leaving marybone goes away east till it reaches to hampsteadroad near a little village called tottenhamcourt   miles   furlongs  0 rods    from tottenhamcourt the line comes in a little south to meet the bloomsbury buildings then turning east runs behind montague and southampton houses to the northeast corner of southamptonhouse then crossing the path meets the buildings called queenssquare then turning north till it comes to the northwest corner of the square thence it goes away east behind the buildings on the north side of ormondstreet till it comes to lambs conduit   mile   furlong    rods    here the line turns south and indents to the corner of bedfordrow and leaving some few houses with the cockpit and bowlinggreen goes on the back of graysinn wall to graysinnlane then turns on the outside of the buildings which are on the west side of graysinnlane going north to the stones end when turning east it passes to the new river bridge without liquorpondstreet so taking in the coldbath and the beargarden but leaving out a large mass of buildings has been erected since our author drew this line consisting of many streets and passages the whole coldbathfields being built upon quite up to sir john oldcastles sir john oldcastles and the spaw goes on east by the duckingpond to the end of new bridewell and crossing the fairfield comes into the islington road by the distillers house formerly justice fullers   mile   furlongs   rods    here to take in all the buildings which join islington to the streets the line goes north on the east side of the road to the turkshead alehouse then turning northwest passes to the new river house but leaving it to the west passes by sadlerswells from thence to busbyshouse and keeping on the west side of islington till it comes opposite to canburyhouselane turns into the road and passes south almost to the lane which turns east down to the lower street but then turns east without the houses and goes to the cowkeepers in the lower street crossing the road and through the cowkeepers yard into froglane then turning west on the south side of the town just without the buildings joins again to the buildings on the west side of woodsclose passing behind the sheepmarket wall   miles   furlongs    rods    from woodsclose the line goes due east to mountmill where leaving several buildings to the north it passes on crossing all the roads to bricklane to the north side of the great new square in oldstreet and taking in the pesthouse wall turns south at the northeast corner of the said wall to oldstreet road then going away east till it meets the buildings near hoxtonsquare it turns north to the northwest corner of the wall of asks hospital then sloping northeast it passes by pimlico the cyderhouse and the two walls to the north end of hoxton when it turns east and enclosing the gardenwalls comes into the ware road just at the kingshead in the new buildings by the land of promise   miles    rods    from the kingshead the line turns south running to the stones end in shoreditch then turning east it takes in a buryingground and some buildings in the hackney road when sloping southeast by south it goes away by the virginiahouse to a great brewhouse and then still more east to the back of wheelerstreet and then east by south to bricklane crossing which it goes away east toward bethnalgreen but then turning short south it goes toward whitechapel mount but being intercepted by new streets it goes quite up to the south end of the dogrow at mileend   mile   furlongs    rods    from the dogrow the line crosses the road and takes in a hamlet of houses called stepney and coming back west to the streets end at whitechapel mill goes away south by the hoghouses into churchlane and to ragfair when turning again east it continues in a strait line on the north side of ratcliff highway till it comes almost to the farthe glasshouses then turning north it surrounds all stepney and stepneycausway to mileend road then turning east again and afterward south comes back to the new streets on the north side of limehouse and joining the marsh comes down to the waterside at the lower shipwright dock in limehousehole   miles   furlongs   rod  the particulars of the middlesex side put together are as follows viz miles furl rods                          0                               0                     total          nb this line leaves out all the north side of mileend town from the end of the dogrow to the jews buryingground which is all built also all the north part of the dogrow and all bethnalgreen also poplar and blackwall which are indeed contiguous a trifle of ground excepted and very populous for the southwark side of the buildings the line is as follows having ended the circumference of the middlesex building at limehouse and the street extending toward poplar the hamlets of poplar and blackwall though very near contiguous in buildings being excluded i allow an interval of two miles from poplar cross the isle of dogs and over the thames to the lower watergate at deptford and though in measuring the circumference of all cities the river where any such runs through part of the buildings is always measured yet that i may not be said to stretch the extent of the buildings which i include in this account i omit the river from limehouse to deptford where if included it ought to begin and begin my line as above    from the said watergate at deptford the line goes east to the corner next the thames where the shipwrights yard now is and where i find a continued range of buildings begins by the side of a little creek or river which runs into the thames there and reaches quite up the said river to the bridge in the great kentish road and over the street there taking in the south side of the street to the west corner of the buildings in that street and then measuring down on the west side of the long street which runs to the thames side till you come to the new street which passes from deptford to rotherhith then turning to the left passing on the backside of the kings yard to mr evelins house including the new church of deptford and all the new streets or buildings made on the fields side which are very many this amounts in the whole to   miles   furlong    rods    from mr evelins gardengate the line goes northwest taking in all the new docks and yards the redhouse and several large streets of houses which have been lately built and by which the said town of deptford is effectually joined to the buildings reaching from cuckoldspoint eastward and which are carried out as if rotherhith stretched forth its arm to embrace deptford then for some length rotherhith continues narrow till you come to churchstreet where several streets are also lately built south and others parallel with the street till gradually the buildings thicken and extend farther and farther to the south and south by east till they cross over the east end of horslydown to bermondsey church and thence east to the sign of the worldsend over against the great fort being the remains of the fortifications drawn round these parts of southwark in the late civil wars this extent is by computation four miles but being measured as the streets indented the circuit proved   miles   furlongs    rods    from this fort to the corner of longlane and through longlane to the lock at the end of kentstreet is   mile   furlongs   rods    from the corner of kentstreet to the town of newingtonbutts drawing the line behind all the buildings as they stand and round the said village of newington to the haberdashers almshouses and thence by the road to the windmill at blackman street is   miles   furlongs    rods    from the windmill crossing st georgesfields on the back of the mint to the fighting cocks thence to the restoration gardens and thence on the outside of all the buildings to lambethwells and on to vauxhall bridge over against the other fort of the old fortifications being just the same length that those old fortifications extended though infinitely fuller of buildings this last circuit measures   miles   furlongs    rods  the particulars of the southwark side put together the town of greenwich which may indeed be said to be contiguous to deptford might be also called a part of the measurement but i omit it as i have the towns of chelsea and knightsbridge on the other side though the latter actually joins the town and the other as also kensington very nearly  are as follow viz miles furl rods                                                     middlesex side         total          were it possible to reduce all these buildings to a compact situation it is generally thought that the whole body so put together allowing the necessary ground which they now employ for the several trades in the outparts such as the buildingyards by the river for shipwrights tanners yards dyers whitsters etc would take up    miles in circumference very compactly built  the guesses that are made at the number of inhabitants have been variously formed mr maitland abovementioned  anno      computes that within the walls and the bars as i may say it contains      0  but sir william petty famous for his political arithmetic supposed the city at his last calculation to contain a million of people and this he judges from the number of births and burials but he must take in a greater compass than mr maitland to make up this number and according to this rule as well by what is well known of the increase of the said births and burials as of the prodigious increase of buildings it may be very reasonable to conclude the present number of inhabitants within the circumference i have mentioned in my line to amount to about   00000 souls  the government of this great mass of building and of such a vast collected body of people though it consists of various parts is perhaps the best regulated that any city can pretend to and of late years it boasts of several new regulations as to beggars lights pavements etc which turn out greatly to its advantage  the government of the city of london in particular and abstractedly considered is by the lord mayor twentyfour aldermen two sheriffs the recorder and common council but the jurisdiction of these is confined to that part only which they call the city and its liberties which are marked out except the borough by the walls and the bars as they are called  besides this the lord mayor and aldermen of london have a right presidial in southwark and hold frequent courts at st maryhill in the borough they are also conservators of the bridge and the bridge itself is their particular jurisdiction  also the lord mayor etc is conservator of the river thames from stanes bridge in surrey and middlesex to the river medway in kent and as some insist up the medway to rochester bridge  the government of the outparts is by justices of the peace and by the sheriffs of london who are likewise sheriffs of middlesex and the government of westminster is by a highbailiff constituted by the dean and chapter to whom the civil administration is committed and who presides in elections of parliament for the city of westminster and returns the candidates who are chosen  the remaining part of southwark side where the city jurisdiction does not obtain is governed also by a bench of justices and their proper substituted peaceofficers excepting out of this the privileges of the marshalseas or of the marshals court the privilege of the marshal of the kings bench and the like    that i may observe some method in the description of this noble metropolis and avoid repetitions i will divide my subject into the following branches i i will give a brief account of what the city was before the fire and how improved when rebuilt and within a few years after it ii of the prodigious increase of buildings within our own memory down to the year    0 iii of the public offices and city corporations iv of the mansion house and other most noted edifices structures and squares in and about london v of the principal hospitals and other charitable institutions in about london vi of the churches of london and westminster southwark etc vii of st jamess palace the parliament house westminster hall etc viii of the statues and other public ornaments ix of the gates of london and westminster x of the public and private prisons xi of the markets of london etc xii of the public schools and libraries xiii of the shipping in the thames and the trade carried on by means of that noble river xiv of the manner by which the city is supplied with water xv of the christenings and burials in london the importance of the city of london to the whole kingdom of its comparative proportion to the public expense and the disproportionate number of members it returns xvi the benefit to the public of a good understanding between the court and city   to begin then with the first viz  i i a brief account of what the city was before the fire and how improved when rebuilt and within a few years after it take the city and its adjacent buildings to stand as described by mr stow or by any other author who wrote before the fire of london and the difference between what it was then and what it is now may be observed thus  before the fire of london anno      the buildings looked as if they had been formed to make one general bonfire whenever any wicked incendiaries should think fit to attempt it for the streets were not only narrow and the houses all built with timber lath and plaster but the manner of the building in those days one story projecting out beyond another was such that in some narrow streets the houses almost touched one another at the top insomuch that it often happened that if a house was on fire the opposite house was in more danger according as the wind stood than the houses adjoining on either side  and though by the new buildings after the fire much ground was given up to enlarge the streets yet it is to be observed that the old houses stood generally upon more ground were much larger upon the flat and in many places gardens and large yards about them so that there are many more houses built than stood before on the same ground for example  swithens alleys by the royal exchange were all before the fire taken up with one single merchants house mr swithen by name whereas upon the same ground where the house stood stand now about    or    houses which belong to his posterity  copthall court in throgmortonstreet was also before the fire a single house inhabited by a dutch merchant likewise three more courts in the same streets were single houses two on the same side of the way and one on the other  the several alleys behind st christophers church now vulgarly called st christophers churchyard were likewise before the fire one great house with warehouses in which mr kendrick lived whom i have mentioned in my account of reading and newbury and took up almost all the ground on which now a street of houses is erected called princesstreet going through into lothbury  kingsarms yard in colemanstreet now built into fine large houses and inhabited by eminent merchants was before the fire a stableyard for horses and an inn which gave the sign of the kings arms  i might give many more instances but these will account for what some assert viz that so many great houses were converted into streets courts alleys and buildings that near  000 houses stand on the ground which the fire left desolate more than stood on the same ground before  another increase of buildings in the city is to be taken from the inhabitants in the unburnt parts following the same example of pulling down great old buildings which took up large tracks of ground in some of the well inhabited places and building on the same ground not only several houses but even whole streets of houses which are since fully inhabited for example  crosbysquare within bishopsgate formerly the house of sir james langham merchant  devonshiresquare and street with several back streets and passages into petticoatlane one way and houndsditch another all built on the ground where the old earl of devonshire had an house and garden  bridgwatersquare and several streets adjoining built on the ground where the earl of bridgwater had a large house and garden in barbican  billetersquare and several passages adjoining built upon the grounds of one great house in which one merchant only lived  all those palaces of the nobility formerly making a most beautiful range of buildings fronting the strand with their gardens reaching to the thames where they had their particular watergates and stairs have had the same fate such as essex arundel norfolk salisbury worcester exeter hungerford and york houses the lord brooks house in holbourn in the place of which are now so many noble streets and houses erected as are in themselves equal to a large city all which extend from the temple to northumberlandhouse somerset house and the savoy only intervening and the latter of these may be said to be not an house but a little town being separated into innumerable tenements and apartments  these are prodigious inlargements to the city even upon that which i call inhabited ground and where infinite numbers of people now live more than lived upon the same spot of ground before  suoh was the state of london before the fire in      and so prodigious were the improvements made in it within the course of a few years after that disaster but what are these compared to what has been done since within our own memory and this brings me to my second article  ii of the prodigious increase of buildings within our own memory down to the year    0 not to enter on a particular description of the buildings i shall only take notice of the places where such inlargements are made as    all those numberless ranges of building called spitalfields reaching from spitalyard at northern fallgate and from artillerylane in bishopsgatestreet with all the new streets beginning at hoxton and the back of shoreditch church north and reaching to bricklane and to the end of harestreet on the way to bethnalgreen east then sloping away quite to whitechapel road southeast containing as some people say above   0 acres of ground which are now close built and inhabited with an infinite number of people  the lanes were deep dirty and unfrequented that part now called spitalfieldsmarket was a field of grass with cows feeding on it since the year    0 the old artilleryground where the parliament listed their first soldiers against the king took up all those long streets leading out of artillerylane to spitalyard back gate and so on to the end of wheelerstreet bricklane which is now a long wellpaved street was a deep dirty road frequented chiefly by carts fetching bricks that way into whitechapel from brickkilns in those fields whence it had its name    on the more eastern part the same increase goes on in proportion namely all goodmansfields and the many streets between whitechapel and rosemarylane all built since the year      wellclose now called marine square all the hither or west end of ratcliffhighway from the corner of gravellane to the east end of east smithfield was a road over the fields likewise those buildings now called virginiastreet and all the streets on the side of ratcliffhighway to gravellane abovenamed which of late years extends so far that the end of limehouse stands a chance to be soon joined to the beginning of poplar    to come to the north side of the town and beginning at shoreditch west and hoxton square and charlessquare adjoining those were all open fields from agnes st clare to hoxton town till the year      or thereabout pitfieldstreet was a bank parting two pasturegrounds and asks hospital was another open field farther west the like addition of buildings begins at the footway by the pesthouse and includes the french hospital oldstreet two squares and several streets extending from bricklane to mountmill and the road to islington and from that road still west to woodsclose and to st johns and clerkenwell all which streets and squares are built since the years      and      and were before that and some for a long time after open fields or gardens and never built on till after that time and moreover within these few years all those open grounds called bunhillfields adjoining to the dissenters buryingground are now built upon and are complete streets of houses to the very road and generally well inhabited  from hence we go on still west and beginning at graysinn and going on to those formerly called redlion fields and lambsconduit fields we see there prodigious piles of buildings they begin at graysinnwall toward redlionstreet from whence in a strait line they go quite to lambsconduit fields north including a great range of buildings reaching to bedfordrow and the cockpit east and including redlionsquare ormondstreet great and little marlboroughstreets queenssquare and all the streets between the square and kingsgate in holbourn these piles are very great and the houses so magnificent and large that abundance of persons of quality are found among them  farther west in the same line is southampton great square called bloomsbury with kingstreet on the east side of it and all the numberless streets west of the square to the marketplace and through great russel street by montaguhouse quite into the hampstead road all which buildings except southamptonhouse and some of the square have been formed from the open fields since the time abovementioned and contain several thousands of houses  the increase of the buildings in st gyless and st martins in the fields is really a kind of prodigy comprising all the buildings north of longacre up to the seven dials all the streets from leicesterfields and st martinslane both north and west to the haymarket and scho and from the haymarket to st jamessstreet inclusive and to the parkwall then all the buildings on the north side of the street called picadilly and the road to knightsbridge and between that and the south side of tyburn road including sohosquare goldensquare hanoversquare  two bondstreets georgesstreet and that new  out to tyburn road called grosvsquare and cavendishsquare and all the  them some part of which will be briefly mentioned under the head of squares  this last addition is by calculation more in bulk than the cities of bristol exeter and york if they were all put together all which places were a few years ago mere fields of grass and employed only to feed cattle  in springgardens near charing cross are lately erected several very handsome new buildings and a neat chapel  the new buildings in the end of broadstreet near bishopsgate formerly called pettyfrance deserve to be mentioned here it is in every ones memory what a poor and decayed place pettyfrance was but now the spot where it stood is called new broadstreet and consists of regular and stately houses built after the manner of those by hanoversquare and are the most elegant buildings in the city they are increased quite into old bethlehem which consisted of mean and ruinous houses and there may be said to be a new and stately town of buildings erected here  and it would be endless to enumerate the other new buildings that have taken place in and about this great city of old and ruinous houses and streets see the articles of churches squares etc  iii of the public offices and city corporations the exciseoffice is kept in the old jewry in a very large house formerly the dwelling of sir john frederick and afterward of sir john hern very considerable merchants in this one office is managed an immense weight of business and they have in pay several thousands of officers the whole kingdom is divided by them into proper districts and to every district a collector a supervisor and a certain number of gaugers called by the vulgar excisemen  under the management of this office are now brought not only the excise upon beer ale and other liquors as formerly but also the duties on malt and candles hops soap and leather coffee tea and chocolate all which we managed in several classes  the act lately passed against retailing spirituous liquors in less quantities than two gallons which had become so pernicious a trade that the lower class of people was almost wholly debauched and enervated by it has very much increased the consequence as well as the business of this office for the commissioners for what relates to this matter are a kind of absolute judges in the cases brought before them  the post office is kept in lombard street in a large house formerly sir robert viners and is under an admirable management the penypost is a branch of it and a most useful addition to trade and business for by it letters are delivered at the remotest corners of the town almost as soon as they could be fent by a messenger and that from four five six to eight times a day according as the distance of the place makes it practicable insomuch that you may send a letter from limehouse in the east to the farthest part of westminster for a penny several times in the same day and to the neighboring villages as kensington hamersmith chiswick etc westward newington islington kentishtown hampstead holloway highgate etc northward to newingtonbutts camberwell etc southward and stepney poplar bow stratford deptford greenwich etc eastward once a day  nor are you tied up to a single piece of paper as in the general post office but any packet under a poundweight goes at the same price  the customhouse comes next to be mentioned the long room is like an exchange every morning and the crowd of people who appear there and the business they do is not to be explained by words the whole building is very convenient but not like what it might or ought to have been and moreover the quays thereabouts are so thronged and crowded that they are much too little for the business continually carrying on there  between the horseguards at whitehall and charing cross at an huge expense but with very little taste is seen the newerected admiraltyoffice this office is perhaps of the most importance of any of the public parts of the administration the royal navy being the sinews of our strength  the navyoffice a neat and convenient building in cruchedfryars and the victuallingoffice on tower hill near east smithfield both which had we room deserve a particular description are but branches of this administration and receive their orders from hence as do likewise the docks and yards theirs from the navyoffice the whole being carried on with the most exquisite order and dispatch the admiralty has been in commission ever since the death of prince george of denmark the commissioners so often change by deaths or removals that it will be of very little use to insert them in a work like this  though his majesty resides all the winter at st jamess yet the business of the government is chiefly carried on at the cockpit whitehall near which is lately finished a magnificent building with a very grand front looking to the parade in st jamess park for the treasuryoffice and it being a lofty structure over that is the office of the secretaries of state  the office for the board of trade is held just by the upperend of the privygarden adjoining to an old gate at the entrance of king street which is now demolished it is a large house and convenient for the purpose  at the horseguards is a building commodious enough built as a barrack for a large detachment of the horseguards who keep post here over it are offices belonging to the judgeadvocate for holding councils of war for trial of deserters and others according to the articles of war  a new office and house is very lately erected adjoining to the horseguards for the paymastergeneral of the army  the bank used to be kept in grocershall but is within these few years removed to an entire new edifice built for that thriving corporation in threadneedlestreet adjoining to st christophers church it is a noble structure but i have not room for a particular description of it  the east india house situated where formerly was that of sir william craven was rebuilt in the year      it is very convenient within but without makes not the appearance that is worthy of the companys trade and figure in the world its front being not extended enough in the back part toward limestreet they have also warehouses which were rebuilt in a very handsome manner anno       the african companys house is in the same street a convenient house which serves for all the offices their business requires  the south sea house is situate in a large spot of ground between broadstreet and threadneedlestreet at first two large houses were taken in to form the whole office but as they were streightend for room and were obliged to summon their general courts at merchant taylorshall hard by so they have lately erected a new building for the whole business which my limits will not permit me particularly to describe  the yorkbuildings company has been struggling for some years past with the great difficulties into which it has been plunged by the fatality attending some late transactions and i shall say no more of it here  here are also several great offices for societies of insurers where almost all hazards may be insured the four principal are called   the royal exchange insurance kept in a part of the royal exchange   the royal insurance kept in cornhill   the handinhand fireoffice kept on snowhill   the sun fireoffice in threadneedlestreet  in the two first all hazards by sea of ships and goods not lives are insured as also houses and goods are insured from fire  in the last two only houses and goods  in all which offices the premio is so small and the recovery in case of loss so easy and certain that nothing can be shown like it in the world  there are also offices of insurance on lives the union fireoffice in gutterlane the westminster fireoffice and others which manage a great deal of business in the same way  the charitable corporation office is in springgarden a society that set out with laudable pretensions but many hundreds of people have found to their cost that the best pretenses are often made a cloak for the worst practices fair and softly is now the word with them and it is fit a profound stilness should succeed the boisterous storm they occasioned in which the fortunes of multitudes of innocent subjects suffered a wreck which they will never recover  the offices of ordnance and the mint for coining money are kept in the tower of london  iv of the mansion house and other most noted edifices squares and public structures in and about london   that beautiful column called the monument erected at the charge of the city to perpetuate the fatal burning of the whole cannot be mentioned but with some due respect to the building itself as well as to the city it is  0  feet high and exceeds all the obelisks and pillars of the ancients there is a staircase in the middle to ascend to the balcony which is about  0 feet short of the top and whence there are other steps made even to look out at the top of all which is fashioned like an urn with a flame issuing from it  the lord mayors of this famous metropolis have been hitherto forced to content themselves with residing in some one or other of the stately halls of the city companies hired for that purpose an inconvenience which was equally unworthy of the grandeur of the great officer and of the city over which he presided and which now will be soon remedied for on the   th day of october      the chief cornerstone of the mansion house was laid by the right honorable micajah perry esquire then lord mayor and by the committee appointed for that purpose in the place where stocksmarket used to be kept with an inscription on it signifying as much and giving the names of the gentlemen of the said committee the sheriffs and the architect but perhaps it may be as much to the latter gentlemans credit not to name him as to name him for connoisseurs find so many faults with the design that if what they say is true though it may be a costly building yet will it not do any great honor to this famous metropolis among good judges  the royal exchange is the greatest burse in the world it is so well known and has been so often described that it is unnecessary for me to enter upon it here it is said that it cost above  0000 l in building and yet the interest of the money was a great while answered by the rent made of the shops and vaults but now the trade that used to be carried on there is so dispersed in other places that it cannot be supposed to do so according to architectural criticism the building has numerous faults the turret is egregiously bad though a very expensive part of the structure  the hospital of bethlehem is a noble pile but we shall take notice of it under the head of hospitals  the south sea house the bank the east india house etc also the treasury the admiralty the customhouse the excise and other public offices are taken notice of under the preceding article of public offices etc  the college of physicians in warwick lane is a beautiful and magnificent structure built of brick and stone and is one of the finest ornaments of the city though built in a place where all its beauties are in a manner buried we have not room to be so particular in its description as it very well deserves but we shall take notice that in the front of the hall toward the court is a statue of king charles ii well cut in stone  on the west side of the theater is another of sir john cutler and in june      a very fine busto carved out of a block of white marble was erected in the great hall of this college to the honor of the famous dr harvey with the following inscription on its marble pediment hanc magni illius senis octogenar imaginem a d mdccxxxix in english thus richard mead physician to his majesty caused this statue of the great william harvey who first demonstrated the circulation of the blood and instituted a rational course of medicine to be here erected in the year      in token of his veneration according to the original picture drawn at  0 years of age which he keeps in his own library  the surgeons theater in monkwellstreet is a fine piece of architecture admirably disposed for seeing and hearing the work of the famous inigo jones the noble earl of burlington out of love to the memory of this architect was pleased to repair it at his own charge  in the hall of this theater is a capital picture of hans holbein in which is the portrait of king henry viii sitting in his chair delivering the charter which he granted to the college of physicians etc it is said the company have been offered  00 l for this piece for it is highly valuable as it is the only remaining picture of the first painter of note in this kingdom his celebrated piece called the dance of death being destroyed by fire and not only presents the king taken from the life but also the most eminent physicians of that time when the incorporation was granted and excepting the famous familypiece by titian in the possession of the duke of somerset and another of the pembroke family at wilton painted by vandyke it is esteemed the most valuable portraitpicture in the kingdom  thanethouse in aldersgate street built by inigo jones is entirely worthy of him but it is now let out to a tavern and other trades as unworthy of its founder as of its architect  the palace of the bishop of london is over against it it is an old building and no otherwise remarkable than that it is let out to tradesmen chiefly and has not been for a great while the residence of its bishop who has a country palace at fulham and the air of the court being judged better than that of the city whitehall has been preferred to it for a townresidence  several acts of parliament have passed within these few years for building a new bridge over the thames at westminster and three successive lotteries have been given for that end it was at first resolved to be built at the horseferry over to lambeth but those who had most influence changing their minds the design was altered and it is now begun at the woolstaple near palaceyard and is to be carried to stangate on the opposite side great powers are given by this act to commissioners to agree with persons who own houses and lands on either shore and they intend to pull down whole streets about palaceyard and channingrow besides what they are to do on the surry side for the more commodious passage to it in short if the plan be pursued that is proposed it will be a very considerable work but yet we must say that the greatest part of the expense would have been saved had it been built where first proposed and as the money is raised by lotteries which are always of pernicious consequence to trade it had been perhaps as well in the present juncture of the public affairs that the nearest way had been followed and i may presume to intimate that though the horseferry were to be rejected yet scotlandyard which is a great body of ruinous or decaying buildings and joins to whitehall and to which the main streets point leading down from pall mall picadilly etc by charing cross would have been in my humble opinion a preferable situation it is certain it might have been effected there not only with more convenience but at an easy expense to what now must be the case and there had been no need to have pulled down the houses of tradesmen and others which brought in tolerable rents by their vicinity to westminster hall and the two houses of parliament several stone piers are already erected in the thames and they are proceeding with one of the noblest streets of houses that are any where to be seen fronting palaceyard and here we shall leave it for this time choosing rather to describe what is than what is designed to be since the time this work will take up still may subject it to several alterations now not easy to be foreseen  the newbuilt houses of the dukes of montagu and richmond in the privygarden are convenient and noble structures  the meuse near charing cross where the kings horses are kept and the coaches of state set up is a very large kind of square but the buildings being old and unworthy of the situation as well as of the use are as it is said to be pulled down and built in a beautiful manner the principal range at the upper end is already finished and when the other parts are completed it will be one of the finest things of its kind in europe  on the right side of the street coming from whitehall is northumberlandhouse belonging to the duke of somerset in right of marriage  it is an ancient but large and welldesignd building and fit to receive a retinue of one hundred in family nor does the dukes family come so far short of the number as not very handsomely to fill the house  carlton house and gardens adjoining to st jamess park belong to his royal highness the prince of wales who has built an octagon at the west end of his garden which is elegantly furnished the lower part is a grotto or fine batheingroom over which is a dining room finely adorned with pictures etc and with four marble bustos of shakespeare milton dryden and mr pope on the outside over the door one on each side are placed the bustos of the renowned king alfred and edward the black prince both so famous in english history with inscriptions to their honor which at the same time are equally so to that of the royal erector of them who gives a glorious specimen therein of what examples he thinks most worthy of his heroic imitation  the noble houses of the late dukes of marlborough and buckinghamshire in st jamess park are too well known to need any particular description  the newbuilt house of the duke of devonshire in picadilly that noble one built by the famous inigo jones being destroyed by fire in      the newly beautified one of the duke of bedford in bloomsburysquare those of the lord bateman the duke of queensbury general wade and the late lord bingley the noble and extensive streets of buildings about soho grosvenor cavendish and hanoversquares with those noble squares themselves and the new alterations in st jamess square redlionsquare lincolnsinnfields the new buildings about jockeyfields chancery lane fetterlane serjeantsinn cravenstreet and the newexchange in the strand now all built into fine houses would take up too much of my room to particularize and i can therefore only name them having so many curious matters to add in these letters  but yet i cannot forbear particularly to mention one beauty because it is an honor to our country and that is the great piazza in covent garden the noblest square in europe for grandeur of the design especially with the beauty of the east front of that elegant church the only piece the moderns have yet produced that can admit of a just comparison with the works of antiquity where a majestic simplicity commands the approbation of the judicious the rustic arcade round the square is of an excellent composition above which is a grand story and an attick and the windows dressed with a regular entablature  i must but slightly mention for the reasons already given the new road in hydepark the reservoirs in the two parks the late queens library etc which may just serve as a hint to travelers who have less upon their hands than i have upon mine  v of the principal hospitals and other charitable institutions in and about the city of london no city in the world can show the like number of private and public charities as the cities of london and westminster  i have not room particularly to describe them and must therefore content myself with giving little more than their names and those of their munificent founders referring to those larger works where more ample accounts and descriptions may be expected    then i will mention bethlehem hospital in moorfields erected at the charge of the city anno      and said to be built after the model of versailles this has lately received very great additions and is designed for the reception of lunaticks    bridewell is as well an house of correction as an hospital it was formerly the kings city palace but given to the city by king edward vi for the reclaiming of idle persons vagrants etc and for bringing up lads to handicraft businesses  there are two other houses of correction called bridewells one at clerkenwell for middlesex the other in tohillfields for westminster    christshospital originally founded by king edward vi at the request of the lord mayor and aldermen of london and of the pious martyr dr ridley then bishop of london for entertaining educating nourishing and bringing up the poor children of the citizens such as their parents or fathers at least being dead have no other way of support  this noble charity maintains near  000 poor children who have food clothing and instruction useful and sufficient learning and an exceeding good discipline observed and at the proper ages they are put out to trades suitable to their several geniuss and capacities and others are taught mathematics navigation and arithmetic to fit them for private and public service the seeing of these children at church on a sunday at christchurch and at supper on sunday evening may be reckoned as fine a sight as any in london and occasions a constant resort of people of all ranks who admire the neatness of their appearance and the good management of the house dependent on this noble charity is also an house at hertford where diet schooling etc are given to the younger boys    st bartholomews hospital adjoins to christs hospital its first foundation may be said to be owing to king henry viii whose statue in stone very well done is for that reason erected in the new front over the entrance to the cloister in westsmithfield with two cripples no mean pieces of sculpture on the top of the pediment over his head this hospital has received very great additions of late years and they are going on building still and it is well if they do not overdo it for they demolish their houses and reduce their estates by it and leave it upon the generosity of future benefactors to support what they are about  this hospital relieves about  00 patients daily with lodging diet physic and surgery  the lock at kingsland and that in southwark belong to st bartholomews hospital and are used for such as have the foul disease only  there generally is under the care of this hospital upwards of  000 poor sick and lame persons destitute of other relief    st thomass hospital in southwark is also a noble piece of charity of the like nature with that of st bartholomew the church and most of the hospital was rebuilt in a beautiful manner from the year   0  to   0  it was founded by edw vi and inscriptions are set up in it to the honor of mr guy mr frederick sir robert clayton the last of whom has his statue there as has king edw vi lately erected by charles joy esquire late treasurer of this hospital    guys hospital is situated very near st thomass hospital and is perhaps one of the greatest private charities that was ever known its founder thomas guy was a bookseller in lombard street he lived to see this work in great forwardness and at his death anno      left about  00000 l to finish and endow it anno      mr guys statue was erected in the principal square  though this hospital is said to be for incurables it is not for such as are absolutely so for the founder used to say that he would not have his hospital made an almshouse  over and above the  00000 l left to this hospital the founder left as many legacies and other dispositions as were computed to amount to near   0000 l more    the london workhouse as it is called founded on an act of parliament passed in the   th year of king charles ii is situated without bishopsgate and is an edifice consisting of several workrooms and lodgingrooms for vagrants and parishchildren  they have a handsome chapel built at the upper end of the yard belonging to the house where they go to prayers twice a day at seven in the morning and at seven in the evening on sundays they all go to st helens where they have seats  the charityschools and workhouses set up in almost every parish of this prodigious city have in some measure pursued the design of this laudable workhouse and if they have thereby interfered with it and taken off some benefactions that otherwise might have flowed into that canal it will be the less to be wondered at    the hospital called the charter house or suttons hospital must be recorded to be the greatest and noblest gift that ever was given for charity by any one man public or private in this nation since history gives us any account of things except we give a preference to that of mr guy the revenue of mr suttons hospital being besides the purchase of the place and the building of the house and other expenses little less than  000 l per annum revenue it is of so long standing and its government etc so well known that we shall afford it no further mention  the royal hospitals of greenwich and chelsea are also not mentioned in this account as not being within the reach of the extended bounds of the city of london as we have laid them down and are therefore taken notice of in their proper places  the greycoat and greencoat hospital in tothillfields emanuel hospital westminster that for the poor of the french refugees near islington the ironmongers almshouses near shoreditch alderman askes at hoxton those stately ones of the trinityhouse the vintners and several others in the way to mileend as also those handsome ones lately erected by the will of mr francis bancroft a lordmayors officer in the same road all deserve particular mention had i room for it  but i must say a word or two of those useful charities the two infirmaries one in jamess street westminster and the other at hydepark corner which have given birth to the like laudable institutions in other parts of the kingdom the design of them is to supply the places of the hospitals of st bartholomew and st thomass aforementioned there being no such charitable foundations in the city of westminster and here the best order is observed the best medicines dispensed and the best assistances given as well by physicians as surgeons and apothecaries to all who are admitted into these charities i shall refer you to the accounts published by each every year for further particulars of their institutions progress and success  in august      a corporation was erected for the relief of poor officers widows belonging to the navy which allots    l per ann to a captains widow  0 l to a lieutenants and  0 l to the widows of boatswains gunners carpenters pursers surgeons second master of a yacht or master of a naval vessel warranted by the navyboard provided the annual incomes of their real and personal estates do not amount to the aforesaid yearly sums to this charity all admirals captains lieutenants and warrant officers pay   d per pound out of their salaries and his majesty king george ii graciously contributed  0000 l as a foundation for it  in the year      a most useful and longwishdfor charity was established by royal charter in order to found an hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children otherwise called foundlings  an act of parliament has passed for confirming and enlarging the powers granted by this charter and to enable them to execute the good purposes thereof and several meetings of the governors and guardians have been held and sixty children have been determined to be admitted for a beginning and as many gentlemen have already subscribed it is to be hoped that succes will attend this praiseworthy and longwishdfor undertaking the governors have hired the house in hattongarden wherein the late sir fisher tench lived till they shall be able to build a proper hospital which they intend to do on the north side of ormondstreet and lambs conduit having purchased of the earl of salisbury four fields of pasture land containing fiftysix acres at the rate of  000 l for the purpose  the corporation for clergymens sons deserves also to be taken notice of as an excellent institution but we must draw to a conclusion of this article  we shall only further observe in general that those noble foundations added to the innumerable almshouses which are to be seen in almost every part of london make it certain that there is no city in the world can show the like number of charities from private hands there being not less than twenty thousand people maintained of charity besides the charities of schooling for children and besides the collections at the annual feasts of several kinds where money is given for putting out children apprentices etc a great number of which owe their rise to the period of time included in  0 years past so that the papists have no reason to boast that there were greater benefactions and acts of charity to the poor given in their days than in our protestant times and this is indeed one of the principal reasons for my making mention of it in this place for let any particular age be singled out and let the charities of this age for about  0 years past and the sums of money bestowed by protestants in this nation on mere acts of charity to the poor not reckoning gifts to the church be cast up it will appear they are greater by far than can be found in england in any the like number of years take the time when we will  nor do i include in this the money collected by briefs all over england upon casualties by fire though that is an eminent act of charity as any can be nor the money given either in public or private for rebuilding st pauls and other churches demolished by the fire of london or the augmentation of poor benefices by the bounty of queen anne and many other such gifts  vi of the churches of london westminster and southwark there are within the walls of london    parishes without the walls    in the outparishes in middlesex and surrey in the bills of mortality    and in the city and liberty of westminster  0 in all     we shall as briefly as possible touch upon the most remarkable churches  we must observe in the first place that the churches in london are rather convenient than fine not adorned with pomp and pageantry as in popish countries but like the true protestant plainness have very little ornament either within or without  but the most famous of all the churches in the city and of all the protestant churches in the world is the cathedral of st paul an edifice exceedingly beautiful and magnificent with fewer faults than are to be found in any building of the like nature and extent though some who would be thought to have skill in architecture are pleased to say there are many and particularly censure it for its heaviness though perhaps it would be found that the fault is in their not considering separately the beauty and proportion of every part in order to enter into the nature and design of the whole composition  the vast extent of the horizontal arch of the cupola which supports a stone lantern near  0 feet high may well account for the strength of the piers and butments below eight of which support the whole of that prodigious weight and though common observers assert that those piers as also the piers of all the arches withinside are too thick and heavy yet whoever knows any thing of the rules of architecture must allow them to be as slender as the strictness of those rules would admit of for the thickness of each pier is not one third part of the void of each arch and as to the piers which support the dome they when compared with those that support the cupola of st peters at rome come out to be but one third part of the bigness of the latter the one measuring   0 feet in circumference the other not quite  0 yet there is not a great deal of difference in the dimensions and weight of the two cupolas for that of st pauls is considerably larger and higher in proportion to the piers that support it and to the body of the church than that of st peters wherefore i may venture upon the whole to assert that were we to compare every part of the two buildings together we shall find st pauls to be much less liable to the objection of being a heavy pile than st peters  the chief reason as i imagine why this church is censured for heaviness is not that it is really so in itself but appears so compared with the gothic architecture which is more familiar to some persons than the other and admits of an extravagant airiness and lightness in that  of building the designer is bound down to no rules of proportion but what his own fncy sugsts  whereas in the other the dimensns of every individual member are ascertained which cannot be deviated from without occasioning a fault the height of every arch has a fixed proportion to its breadth the doors windows and their ornaments are the same the intercolumniations and their intablatures are all confined to certain admeasurement but who ever found that exactness observed in any gothic structure it must be allowed there are pieces of that sort of architecture that in the whole look very august and venerable yet let any one view the vast stone buttresses round the outside of westminster abbey and see what confusion of lines and breaks they occasion in the perspective and they will then easily account for the lightness of the inside of that building for they are those buttresses which by extending so far out support the whole structure more than its walls or pillars this i mention for the sake of common observers only for to the judicious it is altogether unnecessary  sir christopher wren had the satisfaction to find the injudicious reprovers of his work confuted by the approbation of the best masters in europe who allowed that the church of st peters at rome which is the most stupendous structure in the world only exceeds st pauls with respect to the largeness of its dimensions its rich mosaic work the beautiful marble of which both its outside and inside entirely consist the latter in different colors its statues paintings gildings altars and oratories ornaments not allowed of in protestant churches  had the inside of st pauls been adorned in as profuse and pompous a manner as st peters it would have attracted the admiration of superficial critics so that they would never have been able to discover the faults they now pretend to find faults which can only be attributed to the plainness of its materials but to such as are real judges the harmony proportion and beauty of buildings are equally admirable whether they be executed in plain freestone or the most beautiful marble whether the carvings or mouldings be gilt or not the recesses or panels in the walls be curiously painted or only plastered  in the year   0  the house of commons had it under consideration whether the cupola should be covered with this is an authentic account of the matter copper or lead and upon inquiry into which was most expedient and least expensive it appeared that the covering of lead would amount to about   0 tons and the expense thereof including workmanship was estimated at   00 l  the copper covering was computed at eleven tons three hundred three quarters and odd pounds and the expense was estimated at  0 0 l upon which the house fixed upon a copper covering  but when the bill which had a clause in it for that purpose went up to the lords their lordships left out the clause upon which the commons desired a conference alleging that copper was preferable to any other covering as well in respect of duration as lightness for that lead being subject to frequent repairs the necessary scaffolding for that purpose at any one time would exceed the difference of charge between that and copper besides that frequent scaffolding would very much prejudice the building but the sessions closing the same day put an end to the affair and there were no conferences though the preceding reasons were what the commons intended to offer if there had been one  it very probably was upon this occasion that sir christopher is said to have declared his opinion in the house of commons when some gentlemen doubted whether the cupola would bear the leaden covering that it was able to bear  000 tons more than what is now upon it and that he would undertake to raise a spire of stone upon the whole  00 feet higher than the cross now stands  the expense of this magnificent structure as it was laid before the parliament anno      including the building of the chapter house near it a neat and elegant fabric purchasing of property together with the estimate of what was necessary to complete the whole in which was concluded a ring of twelve bells not yet put up nor cast as also the furniture for the choir amounted to   0  0 l   s  these things that were not so easy for every one to know we have thought it necessary to enlarge upon our bounds will not permit us to say all that the subject requires and we would not dwell upon points which every one knows or may easily inform himself of by his own observation or from other writers in relation to this famous structure  but one thing it will be requisite to observe further which every one does not know and which therefore i shall mention  this able architect sir christopher wren at the first setting about the church would have had its situation removed a little to the north to stand just on the spot of ground which is taken up by paternoster row and the buildings on either side so that the northside of the church should have stood open to newgatestreet and the south side to the ground on which the church now stands  by this situation the east end of the church would have looked directly down the main street of the city cheapside and for the west end ludgate having been removed a little north the main street called ludgate street and ludgate hill would only have sloped a little w s w as they do now irregularly two ways one within and the other without the gate and all the street beyond fleetbridge would have received no alteration at all  by this situation the common thoroughfare of the city would have been removed at a little farther distance from the work and we should not then have been obliged to walk just under the very wall as we do now which makes the work appear out of all perspective and is the chief reason of the objections i have mentioned as to the outside appearance whereas had it been viewed at a little distance the building would have been seen infinitely to more advantage  had sir christopher been allowed this situation he would then also have had more room for the ornament of the west end which though a most beautiful work would have been much more so then and he would have added a circular piazza to it after the model of that of rome but much more magnificent and an obelisk of marble in the center of the circle exceeding any thing that the world can show of its kind of modern work  but the circumstance of things hindered this noble design and the city being almost rebuilt before he obtained an order and provision for laying the foundation he was prescribed to the narrow spot where it now stands in which the building however magnificent in itself stands with great disadvantage as to the prospect of it the inconveniences of this were so apparent when the church was finished that leave was at length though not without difficulty obtained to pull down one whole row of houses on the northside of the body of the church to make way for the noble balustrade of cast iron raised upon an handsome stone wall of above a yard high that surrounds the churchyard and indeed to admit light into the church as well as to preserve it from the danger of fire  that admirable architect met with no better success in a plan which was one of the most beautiful that could enter the mind of man and would have made this city the noblest on earth this i shall relate in the words of a certain author viz  the fire of london furnished the most perfect occasion that can ever happen in any city to rebuild it with pomp and regularity this sir christopher wren foresaw and it is said offered a scheme which would have made it the wonder of the world he proposed to have laid out one large street from aldgate to temple bar in the middle of which was to have been a large square capable of containing the new church of st pauls with a proper distance for the view all round whereby that huge building would not have been cooped up as it is at present in such a manner as nowhere to be seen to advantage at all but would have had a long and ample vista at each end to have reconciled it to a proper point of view and give it one great benefit which in all probability it must now want for ever he farther proposed to rebuild all the parishchurches in such a manner as to be seen at the end of every vista of houses and dispersed in such distances from each other as to appear neither too thick nor thin in prospect and give a proper heightening to the whole bulk of the city as it filled the landschape lastly he proposed to build all the houses uniform and supported on a piazza like that of covent garden and by the waterside from the bridge to the temple he had planned a long and broad wharf or quay where he designed to have ranged all the halls that belong to the several companies of the city with proper warehouses for merchants between to vary the edifices and make it at once one of the most beautiful and most useful ranges of structure in the world but the hurry of rebuilding and the disputes of property prevented this glorious scheme from taking place  when this great man found he could not carry this point he proposed what we have already mentioned but as we have observed with as little success as the above grand scheme private property on this occasion as it does on most others getting the better both of public utility and public spirit  the new churches at limehouse ratcliffehighway spitalfields oldstreet the strand ormondstreet hanoversquare the horseferry bloomsbury i can but just mention though they deserve to be taken notice of by travelers but the latter i must observe was the first building wherein was introduced a portico after the manner of the ancient temples the body of the church is a masterly performance but the placing for a weathercock the statue of a prince famous for good sense and steadiness is an absurdity peculiar to the church of bloomsbury  the newbuilt steeples or towers of st margarets westminster st michaels cornhill st mary aldermary st sepulchres st christophers st dunstans in the east st clements danes and the newbuilt churches of st mary woolnoth bishopsgate st leonard shoreditch st catharine coleman st martins in the fields st giless i can only mention  among the beauties of london must be numbered the admirable church of st stephen walbrooke the templechurch bowchurch st clements danes st paul covent garden and that incomparable piece called the banqueting house at whitehall now made use of as a chapel this was the design of inigo jones as one pavilion for that admirable model he gave for a palace and if this specimen has justly commanded the admiration of mankind what must the finished piece have done it is to be hoped britain will one day have the glory to accomplish it according to this plan and then it will far exceed all the palaces of the universe here is strength with politeness ornament with simplicity and beauty with majesty it is without dispute one of the noblest structures in the world the ceiling is an admirable fine piece of painting by rubens  the abbey or collegiate church of westminster is a venerable old pile of building but begins to appears with a new face for a tower is actually finished at the west end and another is about the beginning of a fine and costly spire was also laid some time ago near the middle of the edifice which however is yet uncertain whether it will be proceeded on or not the west window fronting these towers is one of the most beautiful in glass painting that has been done of late years and the window also fronting king street finished in the deanery of the late bishop atterbury is one of the finest modern performances of its kind  we are also assured that the houses adjoining to this venerable building will be all pulled down and the building left clear an action that will be as laudable when done as it was scandalous when begun the effect of private avarice whereby that venerable pile is subjected to the hazards of fire and other accidents whenever an idle servant shall get in a sottish a careless or sleepy fit  but after all this building though very expensive is far less elegant than several other gothic structures its outside can never be made beautiful and within it is extravagantly out of proportion with regard to the height and breadth of the middle nef and sideayles the high altar withinside is a noble piece and had a wonderful fine effect from the west door before the organ lately erected intercepted its view  the towers at the west end which i have just mentioned as they stand so close together are not sufficiently contracted in the carrying them up the four pinacles have a very wretched effect when viewed in a diagonal line the style of the building so far as is entire new work is a sort of medley neither gothic nor any thing else as so many beautiful structures of this kind are to be seen it is amazing that any architect should be above imitating them when it is plain he cannot equal much less excel them  this abbey is the repository of the deceased british kings and nobility and very fine monuments are seen over the graves of our ancient sovereigns the particulars are too long to enter into here  the monarchs of great britain are likewise always crowned here  the churches in southwark are as follow   the church of st mary vulgarly called st mary overy and st savior in southwark is a noble gothic pile having three ails running from east to west and a cross ayle after the manner of a cathedral   the newbuilt church of st george southwark makes a handsome appearance   st thomass is a neat and convenient building   st olaves is also newbuilt   st johns vulgarly called horsleydown church is one of the fifty new ones   the church of st mary magdalen bermondsey is a neat structure   christchurch is newbuilt as is also   rotherhithchurch but the particular description i have not room for   vii of st jamess palace the parliament house westminster hall etc the palace of st jamess though the winter receptacle of all the pomp and glory of this kingdom is really mean in comparison of the glorious court of great britain the splendour of the nobility the wealth and greatness of the attendants the economy of the house and the real grandeur of the whole royal family outdoes all the courts of europe and yet this palace comes beneath those of the most petty princes in it although there cannot be in the world a nobler situation for a royal palace than whitehall and it is with some concern that we see so fine a spot become a sacrifice to private spirit so much of it being given away to particular families as makes more remote than we might otherwise expect it to be the hope we might justly have entertained of seeing a palace built there worthy of the glory of our monarchs  many plans have been drawn for the rebuilding of this palace but the most celebrated draughts are those of inigo jones and may be seen in mr campbells vitruvius britannicus and mr kents edition of joness works the last of these if executed would for magnificence and beauty transcend even the temple of solomon if we are to form a judgment from the plans given of that famous edifice but it is a question whether the expense would not exceed that of st peters at rome which cost forty millions of roman crowns  as the court is now stated all the offices and places for business are scattered about here and there  the parliament meets as they used to do while the court was at westminster in the kings old palace nor can it be said but the place is made tolerably convenient for them and is still more so of late years than it used to be for the court of requests is entirely newbuilt and made a noble room and other conveniences are added the house of commons meet in the chapel of the palace at westminster dedicated to st stephen and fitted for this purpose by that admirable architect sir christopher wren  the house of lords is a venerable old place though it must be said to be much streightened in the several avenues to it and rooms above it and particularly the matted gallery the lobby the back ways the king goes to it are very short of the requisite dignity or convenience of the place and of the glory of a king of great britain who there meets the peers and commons of his realm who together constitute the most august assembly in the world  westminster hall a very noble gothic building in which are held the courts of justice is said to be the largest room in the world its roof which is the finest of its kind that can be seen is  00 feet wide and here is held the coronationfeast of the kings and queens of england also the courts of chancery kings bench and common pleas and above stairs that of the exchequer but it must be confessed that it makes no very advantageous appearance without resembling at a distance a great barn of  00 feet long within it is filled with booksellers shops and those of other trades though the alteration lately made in the chancery and kings bench courts at the upper end of the hall and those for the common pleas on the right hand of it give it a much better appearance than it had before  adjoining to the hall are kept the numerous offices belonging to the exchequer of england some of them very dark and inconvenient and such as to a stranger would afford a no very remote idea particularly in some of the avenues from office to office of the dismal mansions to which moneytransactions often are thought to bring the devoted subjects of plutus  viii of the statues and other public ornaments in and about the cities of london and westminster this article we insert rather for the sake of the number of the statues etc than their excellency though some of them must be allowed to be very valuable  the brass statue of k james ii in the habit of a roman caesar in the privygarden at white hall is a very beautiful one and can hardly be outdone by any modern performance of that kind in europe  a fine brass bust of king charles i done by panini a famous italian master of sculpture is placed over the passage at the upper end of westminster hall adjoining to the court of kings bench which though little observed is very curious  the statue in brass of king charles i on horseback at charing cross is a curious piece though not perfect according to the notion of some critics  in the center of sohosquare is the statue of king william iii with four figures representing the thames the medway the severn and the humber but the piece is not extraordinary  on the front of montaguhouse the four cardinal virtues also in the garden in metal a curious figure of a gladiator and likewise a venus and a satyr  the busts over the entrance of the prince of waless octagon at carltonhouse are fine  in grosvenorsquare an equestrian statue of king george i finely gilded but that is its chief beauty  in queenssquare westminster is a statue of queen anne at full proportion on a pedestal  at somerset house on the south front in a niche apollo finely done in marble with a bow arrows and dogs a neat figure in brass of a cleopatra with her asps invironing one arm and fixed on her breast also in an altorelievo on the front of the watergate two figures representing isis and them also in the garden a naked venus with a dolphin and a cupid and a boy on his back  in the gardens of lincolns end are the figures of julius caesar pompey augustus caesar mark antony and an hercules and a neptune in the benchers garden  at temple bar anne queen to king james i finely cut in a niche also king james i charles i and charles ii in other niches  king lud and his two sons on the east side of ludgate queen elizabeth on the west side  at st pauls the figures of the apostles and evangelists on the west north and south fronts and in the middle of the area the statue of her late majesty queen anne at full length crowned with a scepter in one hand and a globe in the other round the pedestal of which are the figures of britannia france in a pensive attitude ireland and america also st paul with a group of other figures expressing his conversion finely done in relievo over the door in the west front  on the front of the hall of the college of physicians toward the court is a statue of king charles ii well cut in stone on the west side of the theater is also the statue of sir john cutler carved in stone a fine busto of dr harvey is also newly erected in the front of the hall  another of king charles ii in a niche is also to be seen in that part of christshospital fronting greyfriers as are also two of king edward vi in different parts of that hospital also the statue of sir j more  in the front of st bartholomews hospital next smithfield which is a very handsome gateway is a statue of king henry viii done in a very good taste  in aldersgate king james i on horseback well carved in altorelievo also the prophets samuel and jeremiah  on newgate in both fronts are the figures of justice liberty mercy peace plenty and truth  in mercerschapel in the front charity and her three children  in clothworkershall is a curious figure of king james i and king charles i  at the chapel by guildhall the statues of king edward vi queen elizabeth with a phoenix under her and king charles i treading upon a globe etc  in the royal exchange the statues of edward i edward iii henry v henry vi edward iv edward v henry vii henry viii edward vi queen mary i queen elizabeth king james i king charles i king charles ii king james ii king william iii and queen mary queen anne king george i and king george ii also on the south side are two fine statues of king charles i and king charles ii a statue of king charles ii in a roman habit in the center of the area is a very noble performance also in two places of the exchange statues of sir thomas gresham one of them deserves a better situation than the dark corner in which it is placed under the piazza of the northwest angle just regarding the turkey walk with a bale of silk by him  the two figures over the gate of bethlem hospital one representing a person melancholy mad the one raving are inimitable performances by cibber  on the pediment over the outer door of st magnus church by london bridge the figure of atlas in a cumbent posture is curiously carved and gilt  in st thomasshospital southwark a statue of sir robert clayton in marble another in brass of king edward vi  in mr guys hospital a statue in brass of that gentleman  on the south side of the sessions house in southwark is a fine stone statue of king james ii in his royal habiliments  a good statue of king charles ii in brass in a roman habit is in the quadrangle before chelsea college  in the public office of the bank is set up a curious marble statue of king william iii with the following inscription on its pedestal ob legibus vim hujus aerarii societas which may be rendered thus in remembrance of vigor restored to the laws authority to the courts of judicature reverence to the parliament and to all britons their civil and religious rights and assuring to posterity the succession of the most illustrious house of hanover to the throne of great britain  the society of this bank has gratefully placed and dedicated this statue to the most excellent prince william iii their founder in the year of christ      and of this building the first    the noble collections made by several of our english nobility and gentry from abroad would afford a curious article in this place but our design is to give an account of things as they are in and about this great city  ix of the gates of london and westminster the gates of the city of london are seven besides posterns two of them were demolished at the fire but beautifully rebuilt these are ludgate and newgate  ludgate is a prison for debt for freemen of the city only  newgate is a prison for criminals both in london and middlesex and for debtors also for middlesex being the county gaol  moregate is also rebuilt and is a very beautiful gateway the arch being near twenty feet high which was done to give room for the city traindbands to go through to the artillery ground where they muster and that they might march with their pikes advanced for then they had pikemen in every regiment as well in the army as in the militia which since that is quite left off this makes the gate look a little out of proportion to those who know not the occasion of it  cripplegate is very old and makes but a mean figure  bishopsgate is newly rebuilt but not with the elegance that might have been wished  aldersgate and aldgate both make a very handsome appearance  most of these gates are given by the city to the chief officers to live in and are very convenient dwellings  temple bar is the only gate which is erected at the extent of the city liberties and this was occasioned by some needful ceremonies as at the proclaiming any king or queen of england at which time the gates are shut the herald at arms knocks hard at the door the sheriffs of the city call back asking who is there then the herald answers i come to proclaim etc according to the name of the prince who is to succeed to the crown and repeating the titles of great britain france and ireland etc at which the sheriffs open and bid them welcome and so they go on to the exchange where they make the last proclamation  there was formerly another gate belonging to the city of london called the posterngate at tower hill but it being partly demolished by time it is now turned into private buildings  westminster had no less than five gates and all standing within a small compass of ground as first the noble gothic gate at whitehall which is left standing for the beauty of its workmanship secondly a gate a little farther where king street begins which was a good old structure and pulled down a few years ago to enlarge the passage thirdly a gate where now unionstreet is communicating king street with the new palaceyard and this has been several years demolished and the said little street built where it stood fourthly a gate leading from new palaceyard to st margaretslane which has been lately demolished to enlarge that passage by which the king goes to the house of lords fifthly the gate house near the west end of the abbey which is an old building used for the public gaol of the city of westminster  to these we may also add the watergate at westminster in new palaceyard near which is begun to be erected the new bridge  x of the public and private prisons there are in london and its far extended bounds notwithstanding we are a nation so fond of liberty more public and private prisons and houses of confinement than in any city in europe the public ones are as follow public gaols the tower newgate ludgate kings bench the fleet bridewell marshalseas the gatehouse two counters in the city one counter in the borough st martins le grand the clink formerly the prison to the stews whitechapel finsbury the duchy st catharines baledock littleease new prison new bridewell tothillfields bridewell night prisons called roundhouses etc tolerated prisons bethlem or bedlam above  00 sponginghouses    private madhouses the sergeant at armss officers houses the blackrod officers houses etc the admiralty officers houses etc   pesthouses tipstaffs houses chancery officers houses    these private houses of confinement are pretended to be like little purgatories between prison and liberty places of advantage for the keeping of prisoners at their own request till they can get friends to deliver them and so avoid going into public prisons though in some of them the extortion is such and the accommodation so bad that men choose to be carried to prison directly  xi of the markets of london and   that of smithfield for cattle is without question the greatest in the world no calculation of the numbers of horses oxen cows calves sheep etc can be made this market is held every monday and friday  there is also a great market or rather fair for horses in smithfield every friday in the afternoon where very great numbers of horses and those of the highest price are sold weekly  the flesh markets are leaden hall honeylane newgate clare shadwell southwark westminster spitalfields whitechapel brook bloomsbury newport st jamess hungerford and now lately the new market at fleetditch as also another for which a patent was granted may    0 to be held on monday wednesday and friday weekly at brookfield by mayfair in the parish of st george hanoversquare for meat herbage etc  at all these markets a part is set by for a fishmarket and a part for an herbmarket notwithstanding which there are the following particular fish and herbmarkets viz  fishmarkets at billinsgate fishstreethill and old fishstreet  herbmarkets covent garden and till within this little while stocksmarket which is removed to the new one at fleetditch to make room for a mansion house for the lord mayor of this city  at the three cranes are also markets for cherries apples and other fruits  cornmarkets are at bear quay and queenhith  mealmarkets at queenhith hungerford ditchside and whitecrossstreet  haymarkets at whitechapel smithfield southwark the haymarketstreet westminster and bloomsbury  leathermarket at leaden hall  hides and skins at leaden hall and woodsclose  coalmarkets at roomland and billinsgate  baymarket at leaden hall  broadclothmarket at blackwellhall a grant for a new market near grosvenorsquare is now  anno      obtained   the last three are without doubt the greatest in the world of those kinds  there are moreover multitudes of coalmerchants who have coalwharfs from the hermitage one way to the horseferry and westminster another which may be deemed so many markets though not public ones  these markets are so considerable in themselves that they merit a larger and more particular description than i have room for i shall however briefly observe of them that of the fifteen fleshmarkets for provisions seven of them are of ancient standing but the others are erected since the increase of the city the old ones are leaden hall whitechapel newgatemarket southwark clare st jamess and westminster to which some add honeylane and these are so considerable have such numbers of buyers and such an infinite quantity of provisions of all sorts flesh fish and fowl that especially with regard to leaden hall no city in the world can equal them  the great market called leaden hall of which a certain spanish ambassador said there was as much meat sold in it in one month as would suffice all spain for a year contains three large squares every square having several outlets into diverse streets and all into one another the first and chief is called the beefmarket which has two large gates one into leadenhallstreet one into grace church street and two smaller viz one by a long paved passage leading into limestreet and one under a gateway from the second square in this square every wednesday is kept a market for raw hides tanned leather and shoemakers tools and in the warehouses up stairs on the east and southsides of the square is the great market for colchester bays  the second square is divided into two oblongs in the first is the fishmarket and in the other a market for country higglers who bring small things as pork butter eggs pigs rabbets fowls etc  in the north part of the fishmarket the place being too large for the fishmongers use are the stalls of the town butchers for mutton and veal the best and largest of which that england can produce are to be bought there and the east part is a fleshmarket for country butchers  the third and last square which is also very large is divided into three parts round the circumference is the buttermarket with all the sorts of higglery goods as before the south part is the poultrymarket and the baconmarket and the center is an herbmarket and there have been lately still more conveniences and additions made to this prodigious market which we have not room to particularize  all the other markets follow the same method in proportion to the room they have for it  there are two cornmarkets viz bearquay and queenhith to the first comes all the vast quantity of corn that is brought into the city by sea from the counties which lie commodious for that carriage and here corn may be said not to be sold by cartloads or horseloads but by shiploads and except the cornchambers and magazines in holland when the fleets come in from dantzick and england the whole world cannot equal the quantity bought and sold here for no quantity can be wanted either for home consumption or for foreign exportation but the cornfactors who are the managers of this market are ready to supply it  queenhith is chiefly for malt the barley of which takes up the ground of so many hundred thousand acres of land in the counties of surrey bucks berks oxford southampton and wilts and is called west country malt  it is true there is a very great quantity of malt and of other corn too brought to some other places on the river and sold there viz to milfordlane above the bridge and the hermitage below the bridge but this is but in general a branch of the trade of the other places  it must not be omitted that queenhith is also a very great market for meal as well as malt and perhaps the greatest in england  the vessels which bring this malt and meal to queenhith are worthy observation they are remarkable for the length of the vessel and the burden they carry and yet the little water they draw for some of those barges carry above a thousand quarters of malt at a time and yet do not draw two feet of water and a thousand quarters of malt must be granted to be at least a hundred tons burden and some of these large barges come as far as from abington which is about one hundred and fifty miles from london if we measure by the river  the next market which is more than ordinary remarkable is the coalmarket at billinsgate this is kept every morning on the broad place just at the head of billinsgatedock and the place is called roomland from what old forgotten original it has that name history is silent i need not except for the sake of strangers take notice that the city of london and parts adjacent as also all the south of england is supplied with coals called therefore seacoal from newcastle upon tine and from the coast of durham and northumberland this trade is so considerable that it is esteemed the great nursery of our seamen i shall have occasion to say more of it in my account of the northern parts of england the quantity of coals which one year with another are burnt and consumed in and about this city is supposed to be about  00000 chalders every chalder containing    bushels and generally weighing  000 weight  most of these coals are bought and sold on this little spot of roomland and though sometimes especially in case of a war or of contrary winds a fleet of  00 to  00 sail of ships comes up the river at a time yet they never want a market the brokers of these coals are called crimps the vessels they load their ships with at newcastle keels and the ships that bring them cats and hags or hagboats flyboats and the like  the increase of this consumption of coals is another evidence of the great increase of the city of london for within a few years past the import of coals was not in the river of thames so great by very near half  it must be observed that as the city of london occasions the consumption of so great a quantity of corn and coals so the measurement of them is under the inspection of the lord mayor and court of aldermen and for the direction of it there is allowed a certain number of cornmeters and coalmeters whose places are for life and bring them in a very considerable income  they have abundance of poor men employed under them who are also called meters and are or ought to be freemen of the city  this is indeed a kind of tax as well upon the coals as corn but the buyer is abundantly recompensed by being ascertained in his measure for the sworn meters are so placed between the buyer and the seller and have so many eyes upon them being besides men of character that there is hardly ever any room for complaint on this head  xii of the public schools and libraries we must be very brief in this article nor have we room to say anything of the private schools which are hardly to be numbered  near the abbey at westminster is the royal free school founded by queen elizabeth it is not outdone even by those of winchester and eton for the excellent scholars it has produced and is in a very flourishing condition several good houses and even streets are lately built in its neighborhood  st pauls school founded by dr colet dean of st pauls is a fair foundation for     boys to be taught gratis  merchant tailors school was founded by sir thomas white founder of st johns college oxon for  00 scholars to be taught gratis  00 more for half a crown and another  00 for five shillings a quarter and has    fellowships established in st johns college for scholars elected from this school  another excellent school was founded at mercerschapel by that company  to say nothing of upwards of  0 charity schools upheld by the benevolent contributions of charitable persons also the mathematical and other schools at christs hospital which i have not room to be more particular in  as to the libraries i can only mention em likewise in a cursory manner those at sioncollege the temple and other inns of court castleyard near the meuse the kings etc deserve more particular mention than we can give them in redcrossstreet near cripplegate an handsome building was erected ann      by the late dr daniel williams a dissenting divine for a public library for the use of the dissenting ministers of london  the valuable collections called the cotton library is so well known that we shall only mention the great disaster that befell it in the year    0 when a fire happened not through overcare we may be sure which burnt and defaced a great number of valuable manuscripts but most happily it was discovered and extinguished before it made so great a destruction as was at first apprehended the learned keeper of this inestimable treasure dr bentley master of trinitycollege cambridge whose labors have done so much honor to the commonwealth of learning was the first we are told to express to some of his friends who came to condole with him the public loss the great joy he conceived that all his own works had escaped the ravages of that furious element which had been so little complaisant to many curious pieces of antiquity i would studiously avoid all illnatured insinuations but wish that with all the excellencies which adorn this learned mans character the age in which he lives might be able to hand down his fame to succeeding times free from that private spirit and narrowness of mind of which his enemies accuse him if he deserves not the ill will of such he has to comfort himself that envy always pursues true merit and so may make himself easy if he does we will venture to say that it is a pity that any mans listing himself either on this or that side as to party should shield him from deserved censure  the inestimable collections made by the earl of oxford the late lord sunderland etc are rather private than public and so come not under our notice  xiii of the shipping in the thames and the trade carried on by means of that noble river the whole river from london bridge to blackwall is one great arsenal nothing in the world can be like it the great buildingyards at schedam near amsterdam are said to outdo them in the number of ships which are built there and they tell us that there are more ships generally seen at amsterdam than in the thames  i will not say but that there may be more vessels built at schedam and the parts adjacent than in the river thames but then it must be observed    that the english build for themselves principally the dutch for all the world    that almost all the ships the dutch have are built there whereas not one fifth part of our shipping is built in the thames but abundance of ships are built at the seaports in england such as at newcastle sunderland stockton whitby hull gainsborough grimsby lynn liverpole yarmouth alborough walderswick ipswich and harwich upon the east coast and at shoreham arundel brighthelmston portsmouth southampton pool weymouth dartmouth plymouth besides other places on the south coast    that we see more vessels in less room at amsterdam but setting aside their hoys bilanders and schouts which are in great numbers always there being vessels peculiar to their inland and coasting navigation you do not see more ships nor near so many ships of force at amsterdam as at london  that part of the river thames which is properly the harbor and where the ships usually deliver or unload their cargoes is called the pool and begins at the turning of the river out of limehouse reach and extends to the customhouse quays in this compass i have had the curiosity to count the ships as well as i could en passant and have found about  000 sail of all sorts not reckoning barges lighters or pleasureboats and yachts but of vessels that really go to sea  it is true the river or pool seemed at that time to be pretty full of ships as also that i included the ships which lay in deptford and blackwall reaches and in the wet docks but then i did not include the men of war at the kingsyard and in the wet dock at deptford which were not a few  in the river there are from battlebridge on the southwark side and the hermitagebridge on the city side reckoning to blackwall inclusive   wet docks for laying up merchantships    dry docks for repairing merchantships    yards for building merchantships   including the buildings of lighters hoys etc but excluding all boatbuilders wherrybuilders and above bridge bargebuilders  to enter into any description of the great magazines of all manner of naval stores for the furnishing those builders would be endless it is sufficient to add that england is an inexhaustible storehouse of timber and all the oak timber and generally the plank also used in the building these ships is found in england only and that principally in the southern counties near us as particularly berks bucks surrey kent sussex and suffolk and very little is brought farther  xiv of the manner by which the city is supplied with water no city in the world is so well furnished with water as london for their necessary occasions there as well as for the extinguishing of fires when they happen    by the great convenience of water which being everywhere laid in the streets in large timber pipes as well from the thames as the new river those pipes are furnished with a fire plug of which the parish officers have the key and when opened let out not a pipe but as one may say a river of water into the streets so that making but a dam in the chanel the whole street is immediately under water to supply the engines    by the great number of admirable engines of which almost every parish has one and some halls also and several private citizens have them of their own so that no sooner does a fire break out but the house is surrounded with engines and a flood of water poured upon it till it is extinguished    the several insurance offices of which i have spoken in article iii have each of them a certain set of men whom they keep in constant pay and furnish with tools proper for their work and to whom they give jack caps of leather able to keep them from hurt if brick or timber or any thing not of too great a bulk should fall upon them these men whom they call firemen make it their business to be ready at call all hours to assist in case of fire and it must be acknowledged they are very dexterous bold diligent and successful  there are two great engines for the raising the thames water one at the bridge and the other near brokenwharf and these raise so great a quantity of water that it is said they are able to supply every house throughout the whole city with a running pipe of water up to the uppermost story  however the new river which is brought by an artificial stream from ware continues to supply the greater part of the city and that with more ease than the thames engines of this river i shall take farther notice in my description of hertfordshire where it takes its rise  the chelsea waterworks as they are called are also of no small use for the new buildings at that end of the town and a noble cut being a large though not long river of itself from the thames to near buckingham gardenwall and a great reservoir of water in hydepark produced by the same undertaking are no small additions to the great convenience we are speaking of for the parts which they respectively serve  formerly there were several beautiful conduits in london the water of which was very sweet and good and brought to them at a vast expense from several distant springs in large leaden pipes some of these were rebuilt since the fire but now the city is so well supplied with water that they are either quite demolished or entirely out of use that in cheapside was pulled down but very lately and a statue proposed to be built in its place in honor to the great king william iii and it must be owned that it is one of the most commodious places for such a purpose in the whole city but it being set on foot as some thought by party on one side was rejected from far less laudable motives by party on the other  it is a well known fact that the bringing the new river to islington for the benefit of the city was the ruin of the first attempter sir hugh middleton  the society of the temple neglected to lay in water till the year      when a terrible fire happening in it which burnt down several houses and the middle temple kitchen among the rest that society agreed with the new river water company and there are nowfine conveniences built for that purpose in every court and open place which are only to be uncovered on occasion of such accidents this fire happened jan         and in it was consumed one of the most valuable collections of antiquity in england belonging to james west esquire except the cotton and harleian library  to sum up my description of london take the following heads there are in this great mass of buildings thus called london two cathedrals   choirs for music worship     parishes    chapels where the church of england service is performed   churches at deptford not taken into the limits now described    foreign churches besides dissenters meetings of all persuasions popish chapels and   jews synagogues there are also    hospitals besides lesser charities called almshouses of which they reckon  00 many of which have chapels for divine service   colleges    public prisons   public schools called freeschools     charityschools in london and westminster and  0 miles round    markets for flesh   for live cattle   herbmarkets    other markets    inns of court   fairs    squares besides those within any single building as the temple somerset house etc   public bridges and a new one now building a townhouse or guild hall a royal exchange another exchange for shops a customhouse   artillerygrounds   pesthouses   bishops palaces   royal palaces   xv of the christenings and burials in london etc of the importance of the city of london to the whole kingdom of its comparative proportion to the public expense of the kingdom and the disproportionate number of members it returns let us now mention something briefly in relation to the yearly births and burials of this extended ciy from an account of which sir william petty thought he might make some calculations of the numbers of the inhabitants and i shall only take notice that whereas the general number of the burials in the year      and farther back were from   000 to   000 in a year the yearly bill for the year      amounted as follows parishes christened buried in the    parishes within the walls         0 in the    parishes without the walls       00  in the    outparishes in middlesex and surry          0 in the  0 parishes in the city and liberty of westminster         0                  here is to be observed that the number of burials exceeding so much the number of births is because as it is not the number born but the number christened that are set down which is taken from the parish register so all the children of dissenters of every sort protestant popish and jewish are omitted also all the children of foreigners french dutch etc which are baptized in their own churches and all the children of those who are so poor that they cannot get them registered so that if a due estimate be made the births may be very well supposed to exceed the burials one year with another by many thousands  london returns four members to parliament westminster two and these six with two for the county of middlesex make the eight which is all that this exceeding populous county returns although every single ward in london is far superior to most of the boroughs in england and really to many of the greater towns that are represented by two members and contributes infinitely more to the public charge and indeed one may ask what are the greatest part of the boroughs of cornwall and many in that of devon which two counties alone return  0 members compared to  0 populous villages one might name in the neighborhood of london some of which no doubt would be considered were a new repartition of this kind practicable and many of those peddling boroughs be obliged to give up to them a scheme that must be set on foot under a very undesigning and honorable administration for reasons too obvious to need particularizing  the following scheme though calculated before the union and consequently before the    members which represent north britain were added to the     returned for england and wales will set this matter in a still clearer light  a scheme of the proportions the several counties in england paid to the three shillings aid      compared with the number of members they send to parliament in this scheme the proportions are thus considered viz that as the whole kingdom send     members to parliament so the whole tax is divided into     equal parts  the   column shows the name of the county   how many parts of the of     each county paid   how many members of the     each county send   counties p m bedford     berks  0   bucks       cambridge     chester     cornwall       cumberland      derby     devon        dorset     0 duham      essex      gloucester      hereford     hertford      huntingdon     kent       lancaster       leicester     lincoln       middesex  0   monmouth     norfolk       northampton      northumberland      nottingham     oxon  0   rutland     salop      somerset       southampton        stafford    0 suffolk  0    surrey       sussex       warwick  0   westmorland      wilts        worcester     york      0 wales       all england and wales         p m note that the proportion of the six northern and five western counties marked thus  are  0      and that middlesex and essex are  0      cities are included in their respective counties    xvi the benefit to the public of a good understanding between the court and city having shown the grandeur and importance of this great metropolis it remains only to observe how necessary it is for the good of the whole kingdom that there should be a right understanding cultivated between the administration and that for  there has formerly been a great emulation between the courtend of the town and the city and it was seriously proposed in a certain reign how the court should humble the city nor was it an impracticable thing at that time had the pernicious scheme been carried on indeed it was carried further than consisted with the prudence of a good government or of a wise people for the court envied the citys riches and the citizens were ever jealous of the courts designs the most fatal steps the court took at that time to humble the city were   the shutting up the exchequer and   the bringing a quo warranto against their charter but these things can but be touched at here the city has outlived it all and both the attempts turned to the discredit of the party who pushed them on the city is indeed and at all times must be so necessary to the court that no prudent administration will ever seek occasions for misunderstandings with it but will if not infatuated do all in its power to encourage and increase the opulence of the city which upon any emergency will be able and willing if not disobliged to support the court and furnish means to protect the kingdom against either foreign or domestic enemies    and here having exceeded all bounds of a letter for which however the subject is an excuse i will close my account of this famous metropolis and with it my letter being sir  yours etc  letter iii containing a description of part of middlesex and of the whole county of hertford sir the villages round london partake of the influence of london as i have taken notice in the counties of essex kent and surrey  hackney and bromley are the first villages which begin the county of middlesex east for bow as reckoned to stepney is a part of the great mass this town of hackney is of great extent containing no less than twelve hamlets or separate villages though some of them now join viz churchstreet homerton wyckhouse grovestreet clapton marestreet wellstreet cambridgeheath shaklewell dalstone kingsland newington   all these though some of them are very large villages make up but one parish and are within a few years so increased in buildings and so well inhabited that there is no comparison to be made between their present and former state every separate hamlet being increased and some of them more than trebly bigger than formerly they were  hackney is so remarkable for the retreat of wealthy citizens that there are at this time near an hundred coaches kept in it  newington tottenham edmonton and enfield stand all in a line north from the city the increase of buildings is so great in them all that they seem to a traveller to be one continued street especially tottenham and edmonton and in them all the new buildings so far exceed the old especially in their value and the figure of the inhabitants that the fashion of the town is quite altered  at tottenham we see the remains of an ancient building called the cross from which the town takes the name of highcross here is a small but pleasant seat of the earl of colerain  highgate and hamstead are next on the northside at the first is a very beautiful house built by the late sir william ashurst on the very summit of the hill and with a view from the very lowest windows over the whole vale to the city and that so eminently that they see the ships passing up and down the river for twelve or fifteen miles below london  as the county does not extend far this way i take no notice of smaller towns nor is there any thing of note but citizens houses for several miles except the chase at enfield which was a very beautiful place when king james i resided at theobalds for the pleasure of his hunting and was then very full of deer and all sorts of game but it has suffered several depredations since that and particularly in the times of usurpation when it was stripped both of game and timber and let out in farms to tenants for the use of the public  after the restoration it was laid open again woods and groves were everywhere planted and the whole chase stored with deer but it is not nor perhaps ever will be what it was  hampstead is risen from a little village almost to a city nor could the uneven surface inconvenient for building check the humor of the builders for even on the very steep of the hill where there is no walking twenty yards together without tuging up or straddling down a hill the buildings are increased to that degree that the town almost spreads the whole side of the hill  the heath extends about a mile every way and affords a most beautiful prospect for we see here hanslop steeple one way which is within eight miles of northampton n w to landownhill in essex another way east at least sixtysix miles from one another the prospect to london and beyond it to bansteaddowns south shootershill southeast redhill southwest and windsorcastle west is also uninterrupted indeed due north we see no farther than to barnet which is no love six miles from it  at the foot of this hill is an old seat of the earls of chesterfield called belsize which for many years had been neglected but being tenanted by a certain projector who knew by what handle to take the gay part of the world he made it a house of pleasure and entertainment this brought a wonderful concourse of people to the place and they were effectually gratified in all sorts of diversion but there being too great a license used it alarmed the magistrates and now the house is hastening apace to ruin  besides the long room at hampstead in which the company meet publicly on a monday evening to play at cards etc mr vipand the master of that built in the year      a fine assemblyroom sixty feet long and thirty wide elegantly decorated every one who does not subscribe pays half a crown for admittance every gentleman who subscribes a guinea for the season has a ticket for himself and for two ladies gentlemen and ladies who lodge in the town are entertained every sunday for   d each with tea and coffee but no other amusements  i could not be at hamstead without making an excursion to edgworth a little market town on the road to st albans for it is certain that this was formerly the main road from london to st albans being the famous high road called watlingstreet which reached from london to shrewsbury and on toward wales  near this town the duke of chandos has built one of the most magnificent palaces in england with a profusion of expense and so well furnished within that it has hardly its equal in england the plaistering and gilding are done by the famous pargotti an italian the great salon or hall is painted by paolucci the pillars supporting the building are all of marble the great staircase is extremely fine and the steps are all of marble every step being of one whole piece about twentytwo feet in length  the avenue is spacious and majestic and as it gives you the view of two fronts joined as it were in one the distance not admitting you to see the angle which is in the center so you are agreeably drawn in to think the front of the house almost twice as large as it is  and yet when you come nearer you are again surprised by seeing the winding passage opening as it were a new front to the eye of near   0 feet wide which you had not seen before so that you are lost a while in looking near hand for what you so evidently saw a great way off  the gardens are well designed and have a vast variety and the canals are very large and noble  the chapel is a singularity both in its building and the beauty of its workmanship and the duke used to maintain there a full choir and had the worship performed with the best music after the manner of the chapel royal  two miles from hence we go up a smaller ascent by the great road when leaving the street way on the right we enter a spacious common called bushyheath where again we have a very agreeable prospect on the right hand we have in view the town of st albans and all the spaces between and further beyond it look like a garden the enclosed cornfieldsd make one grand parterre the thickplanted hedgerows seem like a wilderness or labyrinth the villages interspersed look like so many several noble seats of gentlemen at a distance in a word it is all nature and yet looks like art on the left hand we see the west end of london westminster abbey and the parliament house but the body of the city is cut off by the hill at which hampstead intercepted the sight on that side more to the south we have hampton court and s w windsor and between both those beautiful parts of middlesex and surrey on the bank of the thames which are the most agreeable in the world but i must travel no farther this way till i have taken a journey west from london and seen what the country affords that way  the next towns adjacent to london are kensington chelsea hamersmith fulham brentford twickenham etc all of them near or adjoining to the river of thames and which by the beauty of their buildings make good the north shore of the river answerable to what i have already described  but here i ought not to omit mentioning the new bridge from fulham to putney cross the thames which is a handsome wooden fabric and as convenient by its many angular indentings for footpassengers as for horses and coaches a toll is paid for every one that passes it let it be ever so often in a day and the rate pretty much the same as the ferry used to be and as the proprietors are said to divide  0 or    l per cent from the profits of it it is pity methinks that footpassengers who cannot wear the bridge should pay at all  kensington cannot be named without mentioning the kings palace there it was originally an old house of the earl of nottinghams of whom the late king william bought it and then enlarged it as we see some of the old building still remaining in the center of the house  the house itself fronts to the garden three ways the gardens being now made exceeding fine and enlarged to such a degree as to reach quite from the great road in kensington town to the action road north more than a mile besides a great track of ground out of hydepark an artificial mount is also erected which affords a fine view is planted with evergreens and has a seat upon it which turns round with great ease at pleasure the noble river that is lately dug in hydepark affords a fine view from these beautiful gardens the first laying out of these gardens was the design of the late queen mary who finding the air agreed with the king resolved to make it agreeable to herself too and gave the first orders for enlarging them  the late queen anne improved what queen mary began and delighted very much in the place and often was pleased to make the greenhouse which is very beautiful her summer supperhouse  and her late majesty queen caroline completed the whole by the additions just now mentioned  king william prince george of denmark and queen anne died here  as this palace opens to the west there are two great wings built for receiving such as necessarily attend the court and a large portcocher at the entrance with a postern and a stone gallery on the south side of the court which leads to the great staircase  it is no wonder the court being so much at kensington that the town has increased in buildings and indeed it abounds with handsome houses and has a very pretty square  south of this town stands chelsea at which place is the noblest building and one of the best foundations of its kind in the world for maimed and old soldiers built by sir christopher wren  here also are the physickgardens belonging to the company of apothecaries of london in it is lately built a stately and convenient edifice which serves at the same time for a greenhouse and apartments over it for meeting of the company of apothecaries etc and over them are very convenient apartments which may be used for drying seeds of plants etc as this ground was made a present by sir hans sloane they have erected in the new building a statue of that gentleman and intend to make in due time an opening down to the river which will have a beautiful effect upon the thames and receive no less grace from it on the pedestal of this statue is an inscription expressing the companys gratitude to sir hans  near the royal hospital was till very lately a neat and beautiful house and gardens built by the late earl of ranelagh but they are now quite destroyed being sold out in parcels to builders and other purchasers  sir robert walpole has a fine house here and good gardens adjoining to the hospital adorned with noble pictures etc  in short there is an incredible number of fine houses built in all these towns within these few years which in other places would pass in a manner for palaces and most of the possessors whereof keep coaches  among these are the late lord peterboroughs at parsonsgreen lord halifaxs at bushypark earl of bradfords earl of straffords earl of shrewsburys earl of burlingtons suttoncourt chiswick mr barkers lord wilmingtons general whethams hollandhouse near kensington situated on a fine eminence and which now is taken by the lord bruce who is making it once more a delightful habitation the late secretary johnsons at twickenham and multitudes of others  but i must not pass over so slightly the noble seat of the right hon the earl of burlington at chiswick and yet i can only mention cursorily some of its beauties as the river his lordship has dug in his gardens a very fine one indeed from the earth of which he has formed a noble mount next the road or rather a terrace from which the whole country may be viewed and which serves at the same time for a defense to his gardens on that side and is planted to the road with all manner of sweet shrubs roses honeysuckles etc that yield in the season a delightful fragrance as well to the passengers as to those on the terrace the magnificent buildings in imitation of ancient temples etc interspersed in the gardens the beautiful bridge over the river in it the fine walks the unbounded prospects several curious statues a noble obelisk delicate vistas and the sumptuous buildings adjoining to the old house commanding a fine view to the river which with the pictures and valuable curiosities withinside altogether exceed description  in the village of hamersmith which was formerly a long scattering place full of gardeners grounds with here and there an old house of some bulk we see now great numbers of fine houses and a continued range of a great length which makes the main street  i have now traversed the best part of middlesex a county made rich pleasant and populous by the neighborhood of london the borders of the county have three market towns stanes colbrook and uxbridge this last is a pleasant large town full of good inns as the others are and famous in particular for having abundance of fine seats of gentlemen and persons of quality in the neighborhood and also for a vain attempt made in the great civil war to settle the peace of these nations by a treaty here i should never have done were i to pretend to describe though ever so slightly the large towns on both sides the river as lambeth battersea wandsworth fulham putney barnet roehampton hamersmith mortlack brentford kew richmond isleworth twickenham padington acton ealing where a new church is just finished and others all crowded and surrounded with fine houses or rather palaces of the nobility quality and gentry of england  there are but three more market towns in the county viz brentford the countytown edgworth and enfield  and now i enter the county of hertford a fruitful soil as it is managed for it is certain it is more indebted for its fertility to the sagacity and industry of the husbandman than to nature rich meadows are seldom found here for it affords not any large rivers the arable has generally too much gravel or too much clay but these last cold and wet lands have been within these forty years greatly improved by draining off the rainwater which stagnated on the clayey surface as in a cup and chilled the roots of the corn an invention called bushdraining  the county is wellwaterd for the convenience of the inhabitants though the lea is the only navigable stream in it which has its rise in bedfordshire of which more anon but this county assumes the honor of giving rise unto several rivers viz the parish of tring to the thames which leaving the county at putenham goes by ayleshury to them and thence by wheatleybridge to dorchester and falls into the isis  the county may be divided into three parts pretty equal by two great roads one part lying between the north road which goes through hertford to nottingham etc and the borders of cambridgeshire north and those of essex east another part lying between that road and the other which leads through st albans to coventry and chester and the third lying between this last road and the borders of middlesex south and those of bucks west  i shall begin with the last at eastbarnet a thoroughfaretown of note and well supplied with inns it lies high and pleasant and was formerly frequented for its medicinal waters and now for its swinemarket it has in its neighborhood several very handsome houses of the londoners and which are the more pleasant by being so near the chase  totteridge is near it also and is a very pleasant village it is situated on a fine eminence looking to the north over the st albans road into the forest and on the south over the edgware road to harrow etc it is very clean and has several very good houses in it the road from hampstead here is extremely pleasant and so well repaired that in the worst season there is scarce any water or dirt remaining in it and as it lies not on any great road there are no heavy carriages passing that way therefore a small expense annually well laid out will always keep this road in excellent repair  cheapingbarnet lies a little north in the st albans road and is remarkable for the decisive battle fought there on easter day      between the houses of york and lancaster in which the great earl of warwick styled makeking was killed with many of the prime nobility and  0000 men the place supposed to be the field of battle is a green spot near kicksend between st albans and hatfield roads a little before they meet the manor is in the property of the duke of chandois a handsome row of six almshouses for so many widows founded by james ravenscroft esquire in      with a little furniture to each is in the street queen elizabeth built a free schoolhouse of brick in the same street where nine children are taught gratis and all other boys at five shillings the quarter  about two miles n w from hence on the left hand lies durhams formerly the seat of the austins but is now the property of the earl of albemarle who purchased it of sir john austin and has since greatly beautified the seat by laying most of the neighboring fields belonging to the estate into a park and turning and repairing of the roads the house stands on an eminence situated in a small valley surrounded with pretty high hills at a little distance so that in the summer months it is an agreeable retirement but the soil all round it being a strong clay all the rain which falls in winter being detained on the surface renders the situation very cold and moist add to this the want of good water and timber near the house except the young trees which have been planted by his lordship and upon the whole it cannot be esteemed a good seat  idlestrey or elstre is a village on the roman watlingstreet on the very edge of middlesex but it is chiefly noted for its situation near brocklyhill by stanmore which affords a lovely view cross middlesex over the thames into surrey near this is kendale wood where formerly was found an old flint wall so hard as not to yield to the strokes of the pickax as likewise an oven mr philpot digging his canal and foundations for his buildings upon the spot of the old city suellaniacis found many coins urns and other antiquities they have a proverb here relating to the antiquities no heart can think nor tongue can tell what lies tween brockleyhill and pennywel   pennywel is a parcel of closes across the valley beyond brockleyhill where foundations are discernible and where they say has been a city  about two miles further west lies watford a market town seventeen miles from london upon the colne where it has two streams which run separately to rickmersworth several almshouses belong to this town and an handsome free school built in   0  and finished   0  by elizabeth fuller widow and in the church are several handsome monuments the town is very long having but one street which is the public and so is extremely dirty in winter and the waters of the river at the entrance of the town are often so much swelled by floods as to be unpassable and the bridge designed as the road at such times is so much out of repair that it is very dangerous for any carriages of burden to pass over it which is a very great disadvantage to the town  cassioberry the seat of the earl of essex is the next thing that occurs worth notice and is elegant the situation is the best in the county upon a dry spot within a park of a large extent the house is built in form of an h the middle and the east wing is modern and in good repair but the west wing is very old and by no means corresponding with the other parts of the house the front faces the southeast and looks directly on the house in moorepark on which the late mr styles expended such great sums of money and which has a noble look from cassioberry house in the front of the house is a fine dry lawn of grass which immediately after the heaviest winter rains may be rode or walked on as on the driest downs and a little below the house is a river which winds through the park and in the driest seasons constantly runs with a fine stream affording great plenty of trout crayfish and indeed most other kinds of fresh water fish on the north and east sides of the house are large woodwalks which were planted by the famous le notre in the reign of charles ii the woods have many large beech and oaktrees in them but the principal walks are planted with limetrees and these are most of them too narrow for their length and too regular for the modern taste on the other side of the river the ground rises to a considerable height which affords an agreeable variety part of which being covered with stately woods appearing at a proper distance from the front of the house have a fine effect to the eye in short the whole spot if a small expense was bestowed to improve and put it more in the modern taste would be one of the finest places near london  near cassioberry is a pleasant seat purchased by the late lord raymond called langleybury  rickmersworth is a market town within three or four miles west of watford it gave birth to sir thomas white merchanttaylor of london who founded gloucester hall and st johns college in oxford here are two almshouses one for four the other for five widows  we visited in this neighborhood morepark with a fine house in it of the late duke of monmouth standing upon the side of the hill facing cassioberry on the other side the river it has been allowed one of the best pieces of brickwork in england sir william temple commends the garden as one of the best laidout in england the duchess of monmouth on whom it was settled by marriage sold it in    0 to benjaminheskins styles esquire who has made it a magnificent edifice having built a south front of stone with colonnades by which an opening is made through the hill that once obstructed its view toward uxbridge a north front is also erected and the hill toward watford cut through for a vista the inside of the house is also adorned with admirable work of painting in digging this hill veins of seasand with muscles in it were found  abbotslangley twentytwo miles from london situated about three miles north of cassioberry in a good air and soil is remarkable for the birth of an english pope nicolas brakespear by the title of adrian iv the emperor frederick held his stirrup while he dismounted he was choked as some say by a fish and as others by a quinsy but it is an indelible stain on his memory that when sovereign pontiff he suffered his mother to be maintained by the alms of the church of canterbury  we proceeded to kingslangley so called because henry iii built himself a royal house here of which the ruins still exist and here was born and buried edmund de langley duke of york fifth son of edward iii and his wife isabel youngest daughter of don pedro king of castile was also buried here and the tomb is in the church of this place  we next went to hempsted a little further north and about twentythree miles from london a bailiwick corporate town it has the greatest cornmarket in the county or perhaps in england in which  0000 l a week are frequently returned for meal only eleven pair of mills stand within four miles of the place which bring a great trade to it but the road is by this means so continually torn that it is one of the worst turnpikes round about london  a little north of hempsted we turned west and came to great barkhamsted about twentyfour computed miles from london it is a very ancient town which for many hundred of years has been one of the crown manors which granted to it many very ample privileges it is now annexed to the dukedom of cornwall and as such appropriated to the princes of wales the castle and manor are at present held by lease from the prince by edward carey esquire which was obtained by his ancestors of queen elizabeth  barkhamsted has evidently been a roman town by the name of durobrivae and probably the castle stands upon a roman foundation roman coins are frequently dug up there it is most pleasantly environed with high and hard ground full of hedgerows pastures and arable though situated upon a south side of a marsh it extends itself far in handsome buildings and a broad street in the time of the heptarchy it was the residence of the kings of mercia and here wightred king of kent and mercia in the year    held a parliament here also king inas laws were published  the castle was judiciously set on the northside of the town on dry ground amongst springs and made exceedingly strong by the saxons it was rebuilt by moreton earl of cornwall brother to william the conqueror and razed for rebellion in his sons time and so with the manor fell to the crown henry ii kept his court here and granted great privileges to the place the castle was afterward rebuilt as it is thought in the reign of king john for the dauphin of france in conjunction with the barons besieged it and the defendants surrendered not till they had the kings orders for it  when the castle was demolished a large house was built out of its ruins which is beautifully situated what now remains of it is but the third part and the back of the great house for the other two thirds were destroyed by fire in the reign of charles i it was in king jamess time a nursery for that princes children and prince henry and prince charles were bred up there and in the time of the late troubles colonel axtel a parliament officer held it it is now in the possession of the roper family  the corporation sunk in the war between the king and parliament in king charles iis time an attempt was made to revive the charter but it was dropped this body politic is now reduced to a skeleton like the castle which is only to be known by its moats and walls  the castle contains within its first moat four or five acres there is again a division by another moat the south part consisting of about two acres is upon a level with most of the outward walls and chimneys remaining toward the north across a moat is a high hill or keep capable of defending itself against the former if possessed by an enemy the traces of the bridge of communication and the moat dividing these two places of strength are continued to the grand one that takes in the whole site of the fortification the remains of the bridge for entrance from the town are visible answering exactly to the other as the north of the first area which led to the hills  in this town was the famous interview between william the conqueror and the english nobility in his march toward london after his victory over harold he passed the thames at wallingford and was going forward to st albans when the stout abbot frederick stopped his march by trees etc till he could get the english nobility together and then he made him swear to keep inviolably the good and ancient laws of the kingdom yet he took away all their lands and divided them among his hungry normans  this town gives name to the deanery the church is handsome dedicated to st peter it has had many chapels and oratories on the pillars of the church are the eleven apostles with each of them a sentence of the creed and st george killing a dragon on the twelfth these were whited over by the zeal of the late times and are but lately come to light  the chapel of st john is used only by the master ushers and scholars of the free school st leonards hospital was at the southeast end of the high street and st jamess hospital at the other end the free grammar school was built by dean incent of st pauls it is a handsome brick structure with an apartment at one end for the master at the other for the usher and chantryclerk it was twenty years in building  they have had other large benefactions which we have not room for  tring being twentyeight computed miles from london is a small market town stands upon the extremity of hertfordshire next to buckinghamshire east of and near the ikeningstreet  it is very ancient and was formerly a royal manor but now possessed by william gore esquire who has made a park of  00 acres of which part is on the chiltern in it is a beautiful wood enclosed lying close to the ikeningstreet mr gore has beautified and wainscotted the church in a most elegant manner and gives  0 l per ann for a charityschool the church is a handsome pile of building with a ring of six bells the chancel was wainscotted by sir richard anderson it is decent and capacious and worthy a choir both church and chancel are paved with freestone the pillars are painted the pulpit and sounding board are of fine inlaidwork and a handsome vestry is under the belfry  among other monuments is a magnificent one for sir william gore and his lady with inscriptions to their honor but too long for a place here  from tring i passed next eastward and came to gadesdenlittle where i had heard was a fine prospect and i wanted not curiosity to see it this vill has cawleywood and ivingohills on the northwest aldburycliffs on the southwest dunstabledowns to the north the prospect i mean is from one part of this parish to which a common of fine turf leads under the duke of bridgwaters shady park and a noble one it is of three counties worthy of the pencil of the greatest artist in landschape  the variety of woods cliffs arable and pasture are charming but they must be tempted to half a miles pleasant exercise to get to the beautiful scene  cawleywood belonging to the duke of leeds is a small covert a mile from hence at the top of a hill in bucks one of the greatest landmarks in the south of england which overlooks eleven counties it stands as a monument to show notwithstanding all the modern improvements that nature will not be outdone by art  now i am on this subject i shall just mention penleylodge for a most delightful retirement to a man who wants to deceive life in an habitation which has all the charms nature can give there is behind a large common of fine turf bounded on a wood on the west to which if one ascend a quarter of a mile he has a view of northamptonshire and warwickshire from the house a semicircular prospect of bedfordshire middlesex and bucks a bended one toward ivingo and aldburycliffs with the shady woods of the dukes of leeds and bridgwater seeming to hang over the rivulet called bulborn  the manor of aldbury lies northeast of tring and in the way to gadesden it belongs to the duke of leeds whose father married the heiress of the family of hyde and so does muniboroughhill lie in the way from aldbury to littlegadesden and affords a handsome prospect  ashridge stands near aldbury but in bucks an ancient mansion house and fine park belonging to the duke of bridgwater  gadesden is famous for the birth of john de gadesden who flourished in the beginning of the fourteenth century the first englishman who was a court physician and of whose skill chaucer makes honorable mention in his doctor of physic prefixed to his canterbury tales though dr friend from johns own books will not allow him to deserve it there are several monuments in the chancel of this church of the bridgwater family whose finely situated seat and park at ashridge formerly a royal house of pleasure and where edward i held a parliament in the nineteenth year of his reign is in this parish but in the county of bucks the duke is lord of this manor as also of that of greatgadesden  i crossed over a slip as i may call it of bucks which runs into hertfordshire between aldbury and kensworthgreen which lies a little south of the road which leads from st albans to dunstable and is a situation surprisingly fine about half a mile in length a good turf and level with whipsnapewoods on the back of it and rows of high trees on the other side nothing but sky is to be seen from it one way and the other we have only a view of the top of a grove at marketcell it seems to claim a preference of every place in the county for a cell yet never had one on it it comes very little short of the famous guys cliff near warwick there the shady grove and rolling stream below it make a beautiful scene for solitude here the woods and trees afford shade enough and the pure circumambient either with nothing in view but the tops of trees would make a hermit think himself in another world  here i came into the road and so turned southeast for st albans through flamstead parish where is a well built and delightful seat of sir thomassaunders sebright bart on a rising ground in the middle of a park it is called beechwood manor from the great number of fine beechtrees which were formerly growing here some of which are yet remaining on the sides of the park the soil of this park is for the most part dry the surface being shallow on a strong or chalky bottom which renders the turf very fine and short and very pleasant for the exercise of either riding or walking it was formerly a nunnery for a prioress and ten nuns independent of any other convent and then called st gyles in the wood a very serious inscription in flamstead church on a monument of one of the saunders family may be worth transcribing as it certainly is a piece of sound doctrine in which every living man may find an use  he that looks hereon may consider how fleeting all worldly comforts are and how great a vanity it is to place his affection thereon such things there are as worldly comforts it is true but they ought to be looked on as little streams and whoever delights in them more than in the fountain from whence they proceed may soon find them dry and vanished the truth of which he that wrote this has sensibly found and wills others to place their affections chiefly on that object of love which is unchangeable and is the center of all true joy and felicity  pursuing still the same course along the great road we came next to st albans the capital town of hertfordshire famous for deriving its name from the protomartyr of england who suffered so early in the fourth century it is governed by a mayor  0 burgesses a steward and a chamberlain and is a peculiar liberty both for ecclesiastical and civil government  the town rose out of the ruins of old verulam of which so much has been said by mr camden and others that we refer to them for particulars in that great mans time the ruins afforded much more for the observation of the curious than now for they are since dug away for mending the highways the first verulam was stormed and taken by julius caesar and here cassibelan a famous british king then kept his court the first destruction of the place is supposed to have been by boadicea the famous british queen who cut off  0000 romans in one battle and the second which was erected on the ruins of the other in the wars between the britons and saxons and almost infinite are the numbers of antiquities here dug up  the origin of st albans was owing to the monastery built by offa king of the mercians to the memory of st alban in expiation of his barbarous murder of ethelbert king of east angles whom he had treacherously inveigled to his court on pretense of marrying his daughter and the same offa it was that built hertford cathedral and dedicated it to st ethelbert and made a journey to rome as further penance where he was absolved though he kept the murdered princes dominions and joined them to his own  of all the monasteries in england none could outshine this its revenue was great and its privileges still greater in the royalties it had from its founder and the episcopal powers from the pope none came up to it the mitred abbot had precedence of all in england and subject to no ecclesiastical power but the pope immediately and he had episcopal jurisdiction over both clergy and laity in all the lands belonging to his monastery from first to last they were fortyone in number and many of them persons of great accomplishments and high birth the   th of which though not highborn was cardinal wolsey the last abbot was richard boreman who at the dissolution quietly surrendered on the royal command and accepted of a pension for life of     l    s and   d  two bloody battles were fought near this place between the houses of york and lancaster the first upon the   d of may      in which the yorkists got the day the second on shrovetuesday in the   th of henry vi when the martial queen margaret overcame the yorkists who had then the king in their power and fought under the sanction of his name  but we must not dismiss this subject without giving some brief particulars of the famous abbey church we have before observed that it was founded by king offa but it has been rebuilt in whole or part several times the town purchased it at the dissolution for  00 l which prevented so noble a fabric being pulled down and torn to pieces for making money of the materials and it is made a parish church for the borough the high altar is a curious piece of gothic architecture  within the north entrance is offa on his throne underneath fundator ecclesiae circa annum     quem male depictum et residentem cernitis alte sublimem solio mercius offa fuit that is the founder of the church about the year     whom you behold illpainted on his throne sublime was once for mercian offa known   in the most eastern part of the church stood the shrine six holes remain in the pavement where the supporters of it were fixed this inscription is still to be seen s albanus verolamensis anglorum junij      on the south side the shrine in the wall of the south isle is duke humphreys monument with the arms of france and england quartered and a ducal coronet in niches on the south side are    kings the niches on the other side have none remaining piae memoriae v opt sacrum hic jacet humphredus dux ille glocestrius olim henrici sexti protector fraudis ineptae detector dum ficta notat miracula coeci lumen erat patriae columen venerabile regni pacis amans musisque

couched within the blind impostors eye alluding to a pretended miraculous cure of a blind man detected by the duke  his countrys light the states revered support who peace and rising learning deigned to court whence his rich library at oxford placed her ample schools with sacred influence graced yet fell beneath an envious womans wile both to herself her king and kingdom vile who scarce allowed his bones this spot of land yet spite of envy shall his glory stand   it is but little above  0 years ago that digging for a grave the stairs leading down to the vault where the body lies were discovered  in the vault is a leaden coffin with the body preserved by the pickle it lies in except the legs from which the flesh is wasted the pickle of that end being dried up on the wall at the east end of the vault is a crucifix painted with a cup on each side of the head another at the side and a fourth at the feet the vault is very neat and has no offensive smell the coffin we are told had an outside of wood which is entirely gone  the west end of the choir has a noble piece of gothic workmanship for the ornament of the high altar capt polehampton about  0 years ago gave an altarpiece which represents the last supper  there are many curious medals and coins to be seen in the church which have been dug out of the ruins of old verulam  this noble fabric has wanted its abbots zeal and purse too for repairs since it has been a parish church the roof was preserved by contribution of the nobility and gentry of england many of whose arms are put up on this occasion and money has been collected several times besides for its support indeed such a fine fabric must too often stand in need of such helps as there is no settled fund to maintain it  there are three churches in the town at present besides the abbey church viz st michaels abovementioned st peters and st stephens  there were also formerly belonging to this town st germans chapel st mary magdalens chapel st julians hospital the hospital of st mary des prees the nunnery of sopwell etc but they are all demolished and secularized there was also in the town the parish church of st andrew but that had dropped down before the dissolution  near this place is sopwel nunnery where they say king henry was married to anne of bolen in the heart of the adjoining corporation stood one of queen eleanors crosses demolished by the inhabitants  in the neighborhood of st albans is gorhambury where is a statue of king henry viii with other things worthy a travellers curiosity it is now the seat of the lord grimston but what it will be always most famous for is that the manor is the paternal estate of that mirror of all ages and ornament of his country for learning francis bacon created lord verulam and viscount of st albans once lord chancellor of england who first revived experimental philosophy of whose merits rise and fall we shall say nothing but refer our readers to his life now lately in    0 published and prefixed to a new and beautiful edition of his works written by the ingenious mr mallet sir thomas meautys who had been the secretary of this wonderful man and to whom he conveyed this estate in gratitude erected a monument for him in st michaels church in this town sitting thoughfully in an elbowchair  the monument bears this inscription francisc bacon baro de verulam sti albani viceco an dom      aetat    tanti viri mem thomas meautys superstitis cultor thus translated francis bacon baron of verulam and viscount of st albans or by his more known titles the light of the sciences and the law of eloquence was thus accustomed to sit who after having unravelled all the mysteries of natural and civil wisdom fulfilled the decree of nature that things joined should be loosed in the year of our lord      and of his age    to the memory of so great a man this was erected by thomas meautys who reverenced him while living and admires him dead    the manor of kingsbury was sometimes the residence of the saxon monarchs whence its name it had a castle which was kept up till king stephens time when it was demolished and the site given to the abbey  the duchess dowager of marlborough has a seat here built by the late duke upon the river verlam which runs through the garden and who also built handsome almshouses at the entrance of the town  the following remarkable inscription and character is cut upon the pedestal of a fine statue of the late queen anne carved by the noted mr rysbrach and erected at st albans at the expense of the duchess in gratitude to the memory of that excellent princess  queen anne was very graceful and majestic in her person religious without affectation she always meant well she had no false ambition which appeared by her never complaining at king williams being preferred to the crown before her when it was taken from the king her father for following such counsels and pursuing such measures as rendered the revolution necessary it was her greatest affliction to be forced to act against him even for security her journey to nottingham was never concerted but occasioned by the great consternation she was under at the kings sudden return from salisbury  she always paid the greatest respect to king william and queen mary never insisted upon any one circumstance of grandeur more than what was established in her family by king charles ii though after the revolution she was presumptive heir to the crown and after the death of her sister was in the place of prince of wales  upon her accession to the throne the civil list was not increased the late earl of godolphin lord high treasurer of england often said that from accidents in the customs and lenity in the collection it did not arise one year with another to more than five hundred thousand pounds a year  she had no vanity in her expenses nor bought any one jewel in the whole time of her reign  she paid out of her civil list many pensions granted in former reigns which have since been thrown upon the public  when a war was necessary to secure europe against the power of france she contributed in one year toward the war out of her civil list one hundred thousand pounds in ease of her subjects  she granted the revenue arising from the first fruits to augment the provisions of the poorer clergy  she never refused her private charity to proper objects  till a few years before her death she never had but twenty thousand pounds a year for her privy purse at the latter end of her reign it did not exceed twentysix thousand pounds a year which was much to her honor because it is subject to no account and as to her robes it will appear by the records in the exchequer that in nine years she spent only thirtytwo thousand and fifty pounds including the coronation expense  she was extremely wellbred treated her chief ladies and servants as if they had been her equals her behavior to all that approached her was decent and full of dignity and showed condescension without art or meanness  all this i know to be true  sarah marlborough  mdccxxxviii  at colney is also a very handsome seat of sir henrypope blunts standing about a quarter of a mile north of the road it seems to be very large and the fields and meadows about it make it very pleasant in summer  having thus gone over the first part i proposed of this country which lies south and southwest of st albans road i shall now bend my course northeast toward hertford and from thence northwest to take in such part of the middle division as lie between the two capital roads on that side of hertford reserving that which lies east of it for my return toward london  the next town in my way is hatfield    computed miles from london it is a market town but much more famous is hatfield house which lies near it from whence edward vi and queen elizabeth were both conducted to the throne having resided here for some time king james made an exchange of this manor in the fourth year of his reign for that of theobalds as hereafter mentioned with sir robert cecil afterward earl of salisbury who built this magnificent house and made the vineyard in the park through which the river lee has its course adorning that garden the rectory of hatfield is esteemed one of the best in england winwich in lancashire and another in durham have larger revenues but this has a better situation  saundridge which lies a little northwest of hatfield deserves to be mentioned as it gave title of baron to the late great duke of marlborough and it now belongs to his illustrious relict a descendant of the family of jennings of this place but one thing must be observed withal that when i was there last the steeple lay buried in its own rubbish as it had done for  0 years together and the bells hung in the church behind the door and this i suppose continues to be its present state  northmymms stands a little east of colney and is remarkable for having in its neighborhood the seat of the late sir joseph jekyll master of the rolls in right of his lady who was heir to her late brother the great lord summers it has a most delightful prospect the body of that noble lord lies interred in the chancel of the church here without any inscription in allusion as one would expect to his motto prodesse quam conspici this seat is now the property of his grace the duke of leeds who has put a great part of the house and gardens in good repair and is his retirement from london during any short interval that may happen in the sessions of parliament  we come now to hertford the county town  0 computed miles from london a corporation governed by a mayor and burgesses it is pleasantly situated in a wholesome air and a dry vale having a good weekly market well stored with corn and all sort of provisions it is very ancient and is built in the form of a y with a castle in the middle of the two horns it contains several streets and lanes well filled with handsome newbuilt houses in edward iiis time it had petitioned to be disburdend of the expense of sending two members to parliament on their inability to pay their representatives wages but    jac i they petitioned to be restored to their right and succeeded  there is a free grammar school for the children of this town erected by richard hale esquire in king james is reign the house being rebuilt a few years ago is

elizabeth culling heiress of a family of that name  the manor of gobions lies a little north of hertford and will be for ever famous on occasion of its being the familyseat of the great sir thomas more lord high chancellor of england in the reign of henry viii who took off his head for refusing to acknowledge his supremacy it is now the property of sir jeremy sambroke bart who for the beauty of its gardens as well as the house has made the place one of the most remarkable curiosities in england  a little still farther north at wotton is the mansion house of the botelers nobly situated on a rising ground and watered with small streams which fall into the bean on the south of it it stands in a park beautifully consisting of hills and flats and renowned for as good timber as the island produces about  0 years since one tree was sold for    l    horses were had to draw one part of it when slit and out of it the cutwater to the royal sovereign was made another called the walkingstick might some years ago have been sold for fifty guineas but was decaying when i was there by the burrowing of rabbets under it there is a good free school in this village for poor children with some of

isles and the chancel has a chapel on each side in the steeple is a ring of six bells here is a good free school as well for petit as grammar scholars  walkern is near it northeast on the river bean i mention it on account of the poor jane wenman who within these  0 years was tried for a witch the last we hope that ever will undergo such a trial in england for the old obsolete law against witches was very lately repealed mr justice powell got a reprieve for the poor creature after the jury had found her guilty contrary to his directions she lived several years afterward on an allowance from the parish the poor wretch had been frighted into a confession that she was a witch and thereupon was committed by sir harry chauncy of yardlybury who would fain have had her retract and pacify her accusers this gentleman was one of the deprived judges of king james ii but it is said he never sat as judge but one day he wrote the antiquities of hertfordshire  it is reported likewise that another woman being tried before judge powell who among other things that constituted her a witch had laid to her charge that she could fly ay said the judge and is this true do you say you can fly yes i can said she  so you may if you will then replied the judge i have no law against it and at the trial of jane wenman the court being full of fine ladies the old judge very gallantly told the jury they must not look out for witches among the old women but among the young  i passed by beningtonplace the seat of the ancient family of the caesars there was formerly a castle there the hill on which it stood still remains deep ditched  at siffivernes in codicote parish in the year      was a most prodigious walnuttree covering    poles of ground the weight of the boughs at last cleft the trunk to the ground mr penn then lord of the manor had    loads of planks out of it a gunstock maker at london had as much as cost  0 l carriage there were  0 loads more of roots and branches this was attested by edward wingate before a neighboring justice of peace to whom mr penn declared he had been offered  0 l for the tree and jasper docura of the parish attested that when he was    years old the compass of both his arms would not reach round it at eight times  hitchin is a market town lying in a bottom out of any great road distant from london  0 computed miles and within three miles of bedfordshire it is governed by a bailiff and four constables and was formerly famous for the staple commodities of this kingdom the church is large dedicated to st mary it consists of the nave and two ails with two chapels or chancels the steeple has a ring of six bells but is low and disproportionate to the chancel in the north ayle window are paintings of faith hope and charity and of the four cardinal virtues and in the next north window the beatitudes the front has the twelve apostles round it but they have been sufferers from the booted saints of fortyone there are many monuments in it a good free school and other charitable benefactions have been made to the town  i could not miss taking notice of hexton on the northwest edge of the county next bedfordshire where was a battle between the danes and saxons some remains of which are visible between this place and luton as large barrows etc half a mile to the south of this town is a fortified piece of ground called ravensborough castle the camp is a sort of oblong containing about    acres the fortification entire nature has so well strengthened it that  000 men may defend it against a very great army it is encompassed with a valley and a very steep hill inaccessible by an army anywhere but at the point of entrance which is by a gradual ascent of a quarter of a mile  the beryslade a house possessed by john cross esquire though low and in the dirt is now an agreeable summer house which it owes chiefly to st faiths well a fine spring at ravensburg a moory piece of ground where the spring rises is cut into canals which are stocked with trouts many of them    inches long these having been used to take their food from the masters hand out of a bowl with a long handle to it come rolling up to the surface the bottom is white either from chalk or sand and so transparent that every fish may be seen that comes out of its hole to preserve them from groping the banks are wharfed and in some places supported with timber so that the fish can shelter themselves underneath and a man must have his head and shoulders in water who stoops down to them from hence the water feeds a large canal in the garden stored with carp and tench and there might be made basins or canals to any dimensions  near hexton is a square roman camp upon a promontory just big enough for the purpose and under it is a fine spring  lilibo is a fine plot of ground upon a hill where a horserace is kept it lies a little south of hexton just by the ikening  near pirton church has been a castle of the saxons or normans with a keep  i proceeded next to baldock situated on the ikeningstreet as it leads from dunstable to royston it is a large market town    computed miles from london it is of chief note for its many maltsters the church stands in the middle of the town it is a handsome highbuilt edifice with a ring of six good bells it has three chancels but the two outward are rather chapels the ikeningstreet about baldock now appears but like a fieldway between baldock and icleford it goes through an intrenchment consisting of the remains of a british town now called wilburyhill icleford retains the name of the street which at this place passes a rivulet with a strong ford wanting reparation  this street quite to the thames in oxfordshire goes at the bottom of a continued ridge of hills called the chiltern being chalk and the natural and civil boundary between the counties of hertford and bedford very steep northward  as the ikeningstreet and the fosse traversed the kingdom from southwest to northeast parallel to each other and watlingstreet crossed these quite the contrary way with an equal obliquity the hermanstreet passed directly north and south this word is saxon and signifies a soldier or warrior which name it obtained from being a military way  it begins at newhaven at the mouth of the river ouse in sussex and passes on the west side of that river through radmil then through lewis by isfield after which it seems to pass over the river at sharnbridge and so proceeds to east grinstead but is lost in passing through the great woods then through surry it goes by stanestreet croydon stretham and by its pointing we may conclude was originally designed to pass the thames at the ferry called stangate by lambeth where it coincides with the watlingstreet there the road went before london became considerable but since that period the traces of the roads near that capital have grown very obscure the original road perhaps passes through unfrequented ways near enfield and harmanstreet which seems from thence to have borrowed its name  on the eastern side of enfield chase by bushhill is a circular british camp upon an eminence declining southwest but the ancient road appears upon a common on this side hertford by ballspark and passes the river below hertford then goes through warepark and falls into the present road on this side buntingford and so to royston where it crosses the ikeningstreet coming from tring through dunstable going into suffolk these are the principal places upon the two roads which we thought fit to mention together  at baldock i crossed the north road and got into the third division i proposed next cambridgeshire and essex and when i have passed through it i will return back again south and take a view of such towns as lie on the east side of the middle division as i have not been at already  in the year      between caldecot and henxworth several roman antiquities were dug up workmen digging gravel for the repair of the great northern road struck upon some earthen vessels or large urns full of ashes and burnt bones but rotten near them a human skeleton with the head toward the southeast the feet northwest several bodies were found in the same position not above a foot under the surface of the earth and with urns great or small near them and pateras of fine red earth some with the impression of the maker at the bottom also glass lacrymatories ampullas a brass tribulus six small glasses two large beads of a green color and other fragments  i went through the village of ashwell which stands not far from caldecot on the source of the rhee by the borders of cambridgeshire which breaks out of a rock here from many springs with such force as to form a stream remarkably clear but so cold that it gripes horses not used to drink it the water here bubbles out at as many places and as abundantly and in just such a bottom under a hill as does the isis or thames in gloucestershire in domesday book this village is called a borough having fourteen burgesses and a market anciently also it had four fairs mr camden thinks the village roman and at half a mile distance south of this source of the rhee is a spot of ground taken in by a vallum and generally thought to be one of the castra exploratorum of the romans it is called arbury banks and consists of about    acres and roman coins have been found here but still it wants several requisites that go to a roman camp which i have not room to particularize ashwellfield affords a stone quarry out of which the stones of most of the churches of this side and the neighboring part of bedfordshire have been dug the church has a handsome chancel three large ails a lofty tower at the west end with a ring of six bells and a chapel on the north side the chancel  i now come to royston situated upon the utmost northern border of hertfordshire insomuch that part of it is in cambridgeshire    computed miles from london the fields about this towns have upon almost every eminence a barrow and they lie very thick by the ikeningstreet east of this town here was a monastery founded in honor of st thomas a becket as also an hospital both swallowed up in the dissolution of henry viii but the priorychurch was purchased by the inhabitants and made a parish church of it consists of a nave and an ayle on each side and a square tower with a ring of five bells in it  the town became populous on erecting the present postroad through it which before ran along the erminestreet through barkw  iggleswade it is now a good town and well  and has a very great cornmarket on wednesdays and is full of good inns in the year      a schoolhouse was erected here by contribution of the town and country  two miles both ways of royston is chalky soil about puckeridge it is gravelly in other places adjoining are camps and roman antiquities at hadstock is the skin of a danish king nailed upon the church doors as reported  royston was a roman town before roisia built her religious house here for roman coins have been dug up near the spot there seems to be the stamp of roisias cross still remaining at the corner of the inn just where the two roads meet the earl of oxford digging canals at wimple when he had that seat found many bodies and rusty pieces of iron the remains of some battle  and now i bend my course southward toward london  the church of therfield which lies among the hills a little south of royston is obliged to francis lord bishop of ely once rector of it who paved the chancel with freestone the area of the altar with marble wainscoted the walls made it into the form of a choir and ceiled it with fretwork it is a rectory of great value and is rated in the first fruits office at  0 l a year till lately was at therfield furniture of all sorts for the use of poor peoples weddings such as was at braughing but they are now lost or converted to other uses even literally to ploughshares and peasehooks  barkway is a market town the church stands in the midst of the town with an ayle on each side and a tower with five bells and a turretclock the creation of the world is painted on one of the windows in one pane at top is a bodily representation of the deity as a man in a loose rbe down to his feet with the globe before him and the motto under de operae primae diei the next pane has the same with hands expanded standing on the firmament in the midst of the water under which de opere secundae diei the third has the same figure amongst green trees and herbs the legend lost and three other panes in order under these the painting of the fourth is lost the fifth has the same figure with birds flying about it a piece of the sixth remains where fowls and beasts are brought to adam to be named another window in the north isle has st george slaying a dragon a bishop etc  the roman road called erminestreet passes through the parish of amsty and all the way upon it we find remains of camps and stations exactly according to the itinerary the castle formerly here was said to be built by eustace earl of bologne at the conquerors command and it is not improbable that there were fortifications before it consisted of a keep or round artificial hill yet remaining with a large and deep fosse about it the mount probably made from the ditch the barons in king johns time made another retrenchment south of it which would contain a garrison as numerous as the castle would hold henry iii obliged nicolas de avestic to demolish the additional fortification and keep up only the old one  the church was built in the reign of henry iii as is said out of the stones of the demolished fortifications made additional to the castle it is certainly very old and built with a low tower in the middle and two ails the chancel perhaps was rebuilt with the materials of the keep being of later date it is large and lofty and has stalls as if for a choir  buntingford is the next town and lies in the cambridge road noted for a great thoroughfare    computed miles from london and owes its being as a town to the present postroad through it to the north the first mention of it is in the reign of edward iii who gave a market and a fair to it it is situated in layston parish but has a chapel of brick built by contribution for the inhabitants here dr seth ward bishop of salisbury who died jan        built a neat brickhouse near the chapel for four poor men and four poor women who had lived handsomely and came to decay through misfortunes each of which has two rooms below and two above buntingford free school owes much also to the same worthy prelate who had his education in it he built      an hospital at salisbury for ten poor widows of clergymen was a benefactor to layston gave a good sum of money to make salisbury river navigable  00 l to be laid out in land for putting out three poor children apprentices two out of alseden and one out of layston alternately in short the good bishop seems to have thought that the revenues he reaped from the church ought to have some other more public designation than to lift out of obscurity a private family  braughing lies a little on the east of the road was anciently next to verulam the most considerable place in the county and is thought to have been the roman caesaromagum situated    miles from london as by antoninuss itinerary it still has some ruins of its ancient eminence giving name to the deanery and the hundred on the west side the erminstreet now the road to cambridge we find the ruins of a roman camp the church is an handsome building and has a ring of five good bells  near the churchyard is an old house at present inhabited by poor families which was given with all sorts of furniture for weddings they brought hither their provisions and had a large kitchen with a caldron large spits and drippingpan a large room for merriment a lodgingroom with a bridebed and good linen some of which furniture was in being a few years ago  this provision was also at therfield and the kitchen utensils but lately lost  we proceeded through puckridge a little hamlet town but a great thoroughfare standing on the erminstreet where there are several good inns for travelers and came to standon a small market town the church has three ails the floor of the chancel is seven steps above that of the church and the altar three steps above the chancelfloor  here we turned short to the east to visit bishopstortford lying on the borders of essex    miles from london the conqueror gave this town and castle to the bishop of london whence its praenomen and king john seized and demolished it for the offense of the then bishop who was one of those who published the popes interdict against the nation the town in the same reign was incorporated and returned members to seven successive parliaments the bishop was restored by the same prince and satisfaction made him for demolishing the castle the hill or keep of the castle is artificial made of earth carried thither with a breastwork at top of stones and mortar a bank of earth leads from it through the moory ground on which it was situated to the northeast there is a large wall from the top of the hill yet remaining the bishops prison was in being in bishop bonners time though all the old buildings are since demolished but the castleguard is still paid by several places to the bishop besides other quitrents  the town is large and well built it is a thoroughfare from london to cambridge new market and st edmundsbury and full of convenient inns it is built in the form of a cross having four streets turned to the cardinal points and the river stort runs through it  the church dedicated to st michael is lofty and stands on high ground it has a fine ring of eight bells there were anciently three guilds and a chantry founded here in the church are nine stalls on a side for a choir on the north side the church is a gallery for the young gentlemen of the school built by contribution upon it sir john hobarts arms who was educated there and a great benefactor to this work  at the west end is another gallery built a few years ago upon which is an organ and it is observable that there was an organ in this church so long ago as in the reign of henry vii a new font stands before it with a pavement of black and white marble enclosed with iron ralis  there are a great number of monuments in the church particularly one in the north ayle for seven children of edward maphesden who died of the smallpox with a latin inscription deploring that heavy dispensation  several benefactions are bestowed on the poor of this town particularly two almshouses in pottersstreet but the greatest ornament of the town is the school built    years ago by contribution of the gentlemen of hertfordshire and essex at the request of dr thomas took late master who also procured several sums for completing it from the young gentlemen educated here when this gentleman engaged in it it was at the lowest ebb of reputation but he raised it to a great degree of fame and considerably increased the trade of the town by the beneficial concourse that it brought thither he revived the annual schoolfeast and charged his own estate with a yearly present to the preacher on that occasion he died may        after upwards of  0 years successful and diligent labors here by his interest and care the gallery in the church for the use of the school was erected he gave a chalice of  0 l value to the church and was a great benefactor to the school library which is a very good one and was first set on foot by the reverend mr thomas leigh b d who was vicar of the church anno    0  the school stands in the high street with the west front to the churchyard consisting of three rooms which with the staircase make a square building the grammar school takes up half of it all the front to the street the other two are the library and writingschool these stand upon arches under which are a market and shops which are the property of the parish and here the school was built at the desire of the inhabitants who got by it a covering for their market and at the same time an ornament to their town  every gentleman at leaving the school presents a book to the library  hadham parva stands a little north of bishopstortford and is of chief note for being the buryingplace of the capels earls of essex  the manor of rye in the parish of stanstedabbots is famous for the plot called thence the ryehouse plot said to be formed for assassinating king charles ii in his return from new market for which several persons suffered and among the rest the tenant of the place rumball a man of a daring and intrepid spirit  honesdon separated from essex by the stort deserves to be mentioned for three reasons first for its noble situation upon a gravelly rising ground overlooking the meadows  dly for being the residence of the children of king henry viii in whose hands it was then on account of its good air and vicinity to london and  dly for the seat of robert chester esquire built within these few years enclosed with a park it stands upon a beautiful hill overlooking the meadows the river stort and part of essex from the back front from the other it has a prospect over great part of hertfordshire and is seen from cheshunt common on one hand as st pauls is from the other at the entrance of the avenue it has a large basin through which runs a small stream and there is a graceful plantation of trees with variety of slopes adorned with statues the same stream afterward feeds a canal  we pursued our way directly south and came to sawbridgeworth or sabsworth among several ancient monuments in the church is an handsome one erected to the memory of general lumly brother to the then earl of scarborough with an inscription greatly to his honor as follows  here lies the honorable henry lumley esquire only brother to thomas earl of scarborough who was in every battle and at every siege as colonel lieutenant general or general of the horse with king william or the duke of marlborough in twenty campaigns in ireland flanders and germany where he was honored esteemed and beloved by our own army by our allies and even by the enemies for his singular politeness and humanity as well as for all his military virtues and capacity he sat long in parliament always zealous for the honor of the crown and for the good of his country and knew no party but that of truth justice and honor he died governor of the isle of jersey the   th of october      in the   d year of his age  the manor house of pishbury in sabsworth parish deserves to be mentioned on account of its remarkable strength though built in queen elizabeths time and lofty rooms it is situated on a clean soil has handsome avenues to it with the river stort behind which communicates with the canals in the gardens it is in the possession of the family of gardener  we then crossed the country directly west to ware situated  0 miles from london on the river lee in its course from milford the town stands low upon a level with the river it is a place of great trade for all sorts of grain but chiefly malt which is conveyed in great quantities to london by the river lee which is navigable from hence and the barges bring coals etc  it consists of one principal street a mile long and other back streets and lanes at an inn in this town is the famous great bed which is    feet square  ware being  0 miles from london is the second post town from thence on the northern road the next is royston    miles further several almshouses and a free school and other charities belong to this town  thomas bide esquire lord of the manor has a house pleasantly situated in the park here to which is an ascent of every side also a vineyard newly planted one late improvement besides many others is a cut from the rib which by that means turns that stream through the park on the south side which is a fine nursery and protection for trouts  in the north part of the town was situated the priory now in the possession of the family of hadsley  an eminent tradesman of ware having lost by death a favorite mare which he had had many years in consideration of her good services made in march      a grand burying for her and invited near  00 people to it he and his wife going next the carcass as chief mourners were followed by the rest of the company in couples and about four oclock she was interred in harelanefield near the town with great pomp after which the company returned and were treated with plum cake and strong beer at the mourners house who expressed great concern for the loss of the valuable creature  at blakes ware the most eastern part of the parish is a seat of william plummer esquire with a stream called the ash on the east front which feeds a canal and a garden by the riverside the chief gardens are seen from the western front which being upon a declivity afford an handsome prospect that way  a little south of ware lies amwell a village famous for giving rise to the new river which proceeding in a direct course by the church receives a spring which flows with great abundance it is  0 miles from london but the course of the river is computed at    it was begun by sir hugh middleton but he being ruined by the project the city of london undertook it and by aid of an act of parliament brought it to perfection the yearly profit of the river has some years ago been computed at  0000 l and the expense in supporting and keeping it up is said to amount to half the profit twas divided originally into    shares one moiety whereof belonged to private persons and the other to the crown for king james i for the sake of his palace at theobalds was a great promoter of it the crowns moiety is since come into private hands who however have no part in the management for the corporation consists of    of the proprietors of the first    shares  this river in fact draws most of its water from the lee which being the property of the city of london that corporation opposed a bill brought into parliament for giving further powers to the new river company to benefit itself by the lee river but the opposition availed not and in the session       the bill passed into a law  the governors of the new river company agreed with the proprietors of the lands on the river lee for a cut of two cubick feet of water from the said river at a certain rate and after the agreement they told them they would double the price for a fourfoot cut which the proprietors agreed to not considering the great disproportion of the two cuts and this cut of the river lee supplies the largest share of the new river water  we kept along the great road through hoddesdon which is a considerable market town and noted also as a thoroughfare till we came to broxbourn which lies near it on the new river a small but pleasant village situated on a rising ground having pleasant meadows down to the river lee on the lefthand of the village is broxbournbury the seat of the lord monson the house is large and in the old gothic style and situated in the middle of the park which has been planted and beautified of late there are also new offices erected at a little distance from the house in a quadrangle on the same plan with the kings meuse at charing cross they are placed behind a large plantation of trees so that they do not appear until you are near upon them yet are at a convenient distance from the mansion house which i was informed his lordship also proposes to rebuild  the manor of theobalds is in this neighborhood where formerly was built a magnificent seat by lord treasurer burleigh who gave it his younger son sir robert cecil and he exchanged it for that of hatfield at the desire of king james i who made it his sporting seat and here ended his life from this place charles i set out to erect his standard at nottingham king charles ii made a grant of it to monck duke of albemarle and to his male issue which failing in his son christopher king william gave it to bentinck earl of portland in whose grandson the present duke it still continues in the late civil wars the palace was plundered and defaced and is become a poor village from a royal residence the great park which was enclosed within a wall of  0 miles compass by king james is now converted into farms the place is however popular and the new river runs just by and sometimes through the gardens of the inhabitants in this neighborhood richard cromwell the abdicated protector passed the last part of his life in a very private manner  walthamcross is the next and as you enter middlesex by the north road the last place in hertfordshire standing just on the edge of middlesex it is noted for and takes its name from the cross built by king edward i in honor of his beloved queen eleanor whose corpse in its way from lincolnshire to westminster rested here as a cross was built at every stage where it rested and charing cross was the last that princesss effigies placed round the pillar and the arms of her royal consort as well as her own viz england castile leon and poictou are still remaining though much defaced  and thus much for the county of hertford with which i conclude myself sir  yours etc  letter iv containing a description of part of buckinghamshire of the county of oxford and part of wilts sir i now proceed to give you an account of my next journey through part of bucks into oxfordshire and shall touch upon some parts of wiltshire of which i have notyet taken notice  on the right hand as we ride from london to uxbridge or to colebrook we see harrow the church of which standing on the summit of an hill and having a very high spire they tell us king charles ii ridiculing the warm disputes among some critical scripturalists of those times concerning the visible church of christ upon earth used to say this was it  from uxbridge we proceeded on the road toward oxford and came to beaconsfield a small town on the road to oxford full of good inns and situated on a dry hill famous for the residence of mr edmund waller eminent for his poetical talent  then we went on to wickham commonly called high or chipping wycoomb from coomb a british word for valley this is a large town consisting of one great principal street branching out into diverse small ones it is full of good houses and inns being a great thoroughfare from london to oxford  not far from wickham lies amersham or agmondesham a small market town very ancient and a little beyond it you go through chesham a little inconsiderable market town and likewise wendover a mean dirty corporate town from hence we proceeded to aylesbury which is the largest and best town in the county  it stands on a hill but the country round it is low and dirty it consists of several large streets and has a handsome built markethouse which stands in a kind of quadrangle it has also a townhouse where the assizes and sessions and other public meetings of the county are held provisions are here cheap and plentiful which is owing to the rich vale adjoining it was a strong town in the beginning of the saxons time and a manor royal in that of the conquerors who parcelld it out under this odd tenure that the tenants should find litter or straw for the kings bedchambers three times a year if he came that way so often and provide him three eels in winter and three green geese in summer which would be but a mean entertainment at bed and board for a king in these days  all round this town is a large track of the richest land in england extended for many miles almost from tame on the edge of oxfordshire to leighton in bedfordshire and is called from this very town the vale of aylesbury it is famous for fattening cattle and sheep and it is frequent that they sell a ram here for breeding for ten pounds here it was that conversing with some gentlemen who understood country affairs for all gentlemen hereabouts are graziers though all the graziers are not gentlemen they showed me one remarkable enclosed field of pastureground which was let for   00 l per ann to a grazier and i knew the tenant very well whose name was houghton who confirmed the truth of it  the late duke of wharton had a very fine seat at winchenden and another much finer nearer windsor called ubourn but the catastrophe that has befallen this once flourishing and truly noble family is too melancholy and too well known to be animadverted upon here  near this place lies chilton famous for giving birth to that steady patriot the lord chief justice crook who strenuously opposed the arbitrary measures of levying ship money without the authority of parliament  southwest of aylesbury lies the market town of tame situated on the side of a meadow and almost encompassed with rivulets it consists of one long broad street the church is large and fine in form of a cross near which are the ruins of a priory a pot of roman coin was found here about    years since  the them joins the other branch named also the thames at dorchester in oxfordshire in this vale of aylesbury flourished the great and ancient family of hampden for many ages in the enjoyment of very large estates which like that of wharton are now dissipated  at the confluence of the them and isis stands dorchester a town of note among the ancient romans and in the year     was made a bishops see till remigius in  0   removed it to lincoln it has a very large church and a fine large stone bridge of great length and antiquity  east of aylesbury lies ivingo a pleasant market town situate among woods in a nook or kind of peninsula which runs in between bedfordshire and hertfordshire  we passed forward northwest through winlow a small market town to buckingham the countytown situated in a low fruitful ground surrounded by the ouze on all sides but the north it is governed by a bailiff and capital burgesses the castle is now old and ruinous and the buildings of the town are also old it has three stone bridges over the river and a well built church and a chapel built by archbishop becket which is now used for a free school several papermills are erected on the ouze and the town is divided into two parts one where the church stands and the other where the townhall is the county gaol and court are kept here and sometimes the assizes  going still farther northward we come to the following towns  stony stratford is remarkable for standing on the roman causeway called watlingstreet it is an ancient and wellknown thoroughfare town in the chester road from london it is large and well built of stone has two churches in it and a cross erected by edward i to the honor of his queen eleanor and has a good stone bridge over the river the principal manufacture as well in the neighborhood as in the town is bonelace  newportpagnell is a large well built populous town seated on the river ouze over which it has two large stone bridges it carries on a great trade in bonelace and the same manufacture imploys also the neighboring villages  oulney is a pretty good town where also is carried on a considerable manufacture of bonelace it lies on the extremity of the county  we then fell down back again to buckingham and following the great road northwest we came to brackley in northamptonshire situate on the river ouze an ancient large corporate town in which are two parish churches it had formerly a college but it is now used for a free school it is governed by a mayor and aldermen and the market used to be the staple for wool in that county but it is now removed  we next came to banbury in oxfordshire on the river charwell it is a large market town under the government of a mayor and aldermen it has a considerable trade especially in cheese as all the country round it is a rich feeding meadowground here the famous makeking earl of warwick surprised the earl of pembroke and his brother of the party of edward iv and beheaded them  on the borders of this county westward from this town in warwickshire was the famous battle of edgehill fought between the forces of king charles i and those of the parliament where though the victory was dubious yet the advantage in the event inclined to the kings side for he thereupon took lord says house at broughton and banbury castle in which were  00 foot and a troop of horse  edgehill lies at the west end of the vale of redhorse and gives a most extensive prospect it is steep to the north and on the top of it at warmlington is a strong large entrenchment said to be danish but looks more like british on the descent of the hill between radway and keynton was fought the aforementioned battle here also they show where the slain were buried and have a tradition that king john had a palace and resided at keyntor  there was likewise at cropredy bridge an encounter between the royalists and the parliamentarians under wallers command  west of edgehill stands shipton a little town which has a very large market  banbury gave title of earl to the noble family of knolles which it seems became extinct in      when the last earl died but his wife marrying nicolas lord vaux had a son by him who took the name of knolles and the title of earl but was never summoned to parliament nor his son after him who is now living and commonly called lord banbury  from hence we rode southward to deddington a large town but a very small market it is governed by a bailiff and did formerly return members to parliament  we turned a little east and came to bicester a straggling indifferent town but remarkable for having had once a famous city in its neighborhood called aldchester long since passed over by the plough and where many roman coins stones and other antiquities are found which was undoubtedly the maima of ravennas bicester is famous for excellent malt liquor and has had formerly a religious house  islip lying directly in our way to oxford we passed through it it is remarkable for the birth of edward the confessor and that dr south as well as other eminent divines were ministers here there are some remains of an ancient palace still left  from hence i came to oxford famous for several things but chiefly for its being the most flourishing and considerable university in the world  there has been a long contest between the two english universities about the priority of their foundations which perhaps will never be decided and so i pass it over  it is out of question that in the largeness of the place the beauty of situation the number of inhabitants and of scholars oxford has the advantage in short oxford has several things as an university which cambridge has not and cambridge has several things in it which cannot be found in oxford for example  the theater the museum or chamber of rarities the bodleian library the number of colleges and the magnificence of their buildings are on the side of oxford yet kings college chapel and college is in favor of cambridge being one of the finest structures of its kind that can be seen and the new buildings erected lately there make that whole university still more considerable in this way  oxford is a noble flourishing city so possessed of all that can contribute to make the residence of the scholars easy and comfortable that no spot of ground in england goes beyond it it is situated in a delightful plain on the bank of a fine navigable river in a plentiful country and at an easy distance from london  the city itself is large populous and rich and as it is adorned by the most beautiful buildings of colleges and halls it makes the most noble figure of any city of its bigness in europe  we shall present our readers with a list of the colleges and halls in this famous city with a brief history of them but must observe that as it would exceed our limits to give an account of the particular benefactions by which their revenues and buildings are so splendidly augmented we shall only mention such of those benefactions as have been conferred within so few years back that they are not likely to be found in other authors  of the colleges and halls in oxford   university college is situate near the east gate of the city it is so very ancient that we are left in the dark as to the time of its foundation that it was in being before the year     is certain but how much sooner is not evident king alfred could not be so properly called the founder of this university as the restorer after the danish devastations in the year      this college was recovered into a state of liberty and independency by a sum of money which william of durham had left for the maintenance of a society of students in oxford from whom it was some time called durhamhall and by other benefactions it increased to what it now is it has one master twelve fellows ten scholars two exhibitioners etc  before the very noble benefaction of dr radcliffe it had one large beautiful quadrangle or square court the south side of which is divided into a handsome hall and chapel in a niche before the said quadrangle is a statue of the late queen anne and in a niche on the inside of the new quadrangle since

provost six fellows six scholars etc  the buildings lately added now adding and the fine additions left to it by the said gentleman will give this college which had been in no very good condition for some time a very advantageous figure in the university and it already makes a very stately and splendid appearance and will be enabled to make a still better for on the  d of october    0 died at her seat near gloucester mrs eaton one of the three coheiresses of dr birom eaton formerly principal of this college when gloucesterhall this lady has left a very great estate partly to her relations and

bequeathed the corpse of this lady was honored by the attendance of the vice chancellor and all the heads of houses in the university   0 hertford college this is a college of a very late erection indeed for it was but in sept    0 that his majestys royal charter passed the broad seal to erect harthall as it was before called into a college to consist of a principal as before four seniors and eight junior fellows so that at last the reverend dr richard newton the worthy principal after an opposition of several years given by some who ought to have assisted his generous view has obtained a point which lay very near his heart though not till several of his worthy friends who would have contributed largely to its endowment had it been effected in their time are demised which must necessarily be a great disadvantage to the good design  this college as it now must be called stands in the parish of st peters in the east it is supposed to have its name from the first syllable of elias hartfords surname who was once owner of it walter stapledon bishop of exeter having bought it converted it anno      into an academical seminary by the name of stapledonhall and endowed it with maintenance for twelve scholars which he removed afterward to exeter college on building the same and then this hall resumed its own name it has a stipend or exhibition belonging to it of more than    l per annum  it consists of one quadrangle not very regular and the present worthy principal has made several and had projected still greater additions to it which would have taken place long ago but for the reasons above given  these are the twenty colleges of which at present this famous university consists there are besides five halls which are places unendowd though not destitute of exhibitions the students at these subsist at their own charge are under the government of a principal and viceprincipal and pay the former for their lodging etc the principals are nominated by the chancellor except the principal of edmundhall their visitor is the chancellor  i will give a brief account of each of these and    alban hall it is situate on the south side of the town and had its name from robert st alban once proprietor of the place it became academical about the year    0  the front makes but a tolerable appearance but the inside falls short even of that    edmund hall is situate in the parish of st peters in the east and has its name probably from one edmund a citizen of oxford proprietor of the place anno      it was purchased by queens college and converted to its present use  it makes one quadrangle on the east side of which stands a very neat chapel and library built some years since by the reverend mr stephen penton its principal    st mary hall situate in the parish of st mary has its name either from that church which with this hall came to belong to oriel college by a grant of king edward ii anno      or from oriel college heretofore called st mary hall  it consists of one quadrangle not very regular dr john hudson principal built here handsome lodgings at his own expense    newinn hall is situate in the northwest part of the town it was called trilleckhall from two brothers proprietors of it of that name one bishop of hereford and the other bishop of rochester afterward the founder of new college bought it and gave it to that college anno      and from that time it was called newinn hall  the building is ancient and irregular    st mary magdalen hall situate near magdalen college was built by william wainfleet bishop of winchester anno    0 for a grammar school but it having room for academical students and some additions having been made to it it became an academical society it enjoys fifteen exhibitions five of   l per annum and ten of  0 l  the front is the most considerable part of it but it has a pretty good library    what additions have been made to some of the colleges by means of the wills of dr ratcliffe and dr clarke which i have just referred to will to avoid repetition where i am so pressed for room be best seen in abstracts of the said wills which may serve as a supplement to the foregoing accounts of the colleges dr ratcliffs is to the following effect  he left an establishment of  00 l per ann for two young physicians to travel to be enjoyed by them for ten years after which or in case of death others were to succeed them for ever  the remainder of the estate charged to secure this annual sum he left to university college oxon for purchasing perpetual advowsons for the members of the same  to st bartholomews hospital london he left  00 l per ann for ever toward mending their diet as his will expresses it and  00 l per ann more for ever for buying of linen  five hundred pounds to build the front of university college answerable to what was before built and for building the masters lodgings therein and chambers for his two traveling fellows  forty thousand pounds for building a library in oxon and purchasing the houses between st marys and the schools in catstreet for that purpose and when built he bequeathed   0 l per annum to the library keeper and  00 l a year for ever to buy books for the same  he charged all his real and personal estate with the payment of these great benefactions and other large family bequests and willed that the residue should be applied to such charitable purposes as his executors should think best  he willed that  00 l a year for ever should be applied to keep in repair the said library to commence payment in thirty years after his death  all the livings in his gift he willed should be bestowed on members of university college and if wanting there to fellows of lincoln college  to his executors who were william bromley esquire sir george beaumont bart thomas sclater esquire and anthony keck esquire all since deceased he left  00 l each and a power of nominating two successors to each of them as they respectively died    his will bears date sept the   th      and the doctor died nov   the same year  we shall now add that every thing being done in pursuance of this will which the time since his death would permit it may be easily conceived what a glorious addition the buildings finished and finishing by its direction must be to this renowned university  george clarke ll d was several years representative in parliament for the university of oxford and died october         of whose will take the following abstract  he bequeathed to the library keeper of worcester college  0 l per ann and to a young gownsman to attend to reach down books   l  four thousand pounds for building nine chambers at worcester college and finishing the chapel and hall there six of these chambers to be for six additional fellows of that college who are to have    l each per ann the other three to be for so many additional scholars at    l per ann each  fifty pounds per ann to be laid out in books for the said college library  he orders his trustees as soon as they can to purchase the ground adjoining to worcester college for enlarging its site and conveniences  to the university he gives the wholelength pictures of king william and queen mary to be hung in the gallery over the schools the halflengths of lord chancellor clarendon and his son the earl of rochester to be hung in the delegates room at the clarendon

he wills may be kept in the musaeum ashmoleanum  to the worcester college library all his printed books and prints and such manuscripts as his trustees shall think fit also to the same all the designs of inigo jones for whitehall which he takes notice are very valuable  to the same college he gives a large twoeard silver cup doublegilt weighing     ounces  to the warden and college of all souls whereof he was fellow all the furniture in his collegechamber and all that in the lodgings he had built there with his prints therein and pictures over the doors and chimneypieces the ceilingpiece over the staircase hercules in the garden and st luke in two columns to be used in the place they now are by the said warden and his successors  to the use of the fellows of the said college the rooms under the great dining room the great dining room itself and the great bedchamber and garrets over them  to all souls college he bequeaths also his  th turn of presenting to the vicarage of yarnton for the benefit of such of its chaplains as have but a slender provision and  0 l among the collegeservants  an augmentation as it shall rise out of one of his estates to the allowance of the two chaplains of all souls whom he hopes the society will appoint their librarians  to queens college he gives the heads of six queens of england    you will refer sir to the accounts i have already given of the colleges and to the above abstracts of dr radcliffs and dr clarkes wills and you will have a view of the state of these colleges even when the works are finished as directed by those gentlemen and which will hold for years to come without material alteration except in case of new benefactions  i shall now give a summary of what a traveller may observe further in oxford en passant and refer the more curious inquirer to the histories of the place for a more ample and particular account than i have room to give  besides these colleges and halls there are some public buildings which make a most glorious appearance the first and greatest of all is the theater a building not to be equaled by any thing of its kind and bigness in the world sir christopher wren was the director of the work archbishop sheldon paid for it and gave it to the university there is a world of decoration in the front of it and more beautiful additions by way of ornament and the inside roof finely painted and decorated is never enough to be admired  the bodleian library is an ornament in itself worthy of this famous university i have not room for its history at large but shall briefly observe that the first public library in oxford was erected in durham college now trinity by richard bishop of durham lord treasurer to edward iii it was afterward joined to another founded by cobham bishop of winchester and both enlarged by the bounty of humphry duke of gloucester founder of the divinity schools but these libraries being lost and the books embezzled and the place where they were deposited quite ruinous sir thomas bodley a wealthy and learned knight having at a vast expense collected books and manuscripts from all parts of the world placed them in the old libraryroom built by the good duke humphry  this great work was brought to an head the  th of nov   0  and has continued increasing by the benefactions of great and learned men to this day such as archbishop laud the earl of pembroke oliver cromwell seldom digby and other great names  over it is a spacious gallery adorned with pictures of founders benefactors etc and with the antique marbles which were the learned part of the inexhaustible collection of the earl of arundel which have been illustrated with the accurate comments of seldom and prideaux here are some of the most valuable greek monuments now in the world over the porch upon an handsome pedestal of black marble stands the brass effigies of the earl of pembroke their noble and generous chancellor given by the late earl molded by rubens also a very large collection of greek roman british saxon english and other coins presented by sir t roe and other hands and that indefatigable and learned collector of books and valuable manuscripts dr tanner bishop of st asaph who died december         bequeathed the most curious part of his fine collection to this noble library  in the year    0 by the death of mrs crew relict of george crew esquire an estate of  0 l per annum is fallen to the head librarians post which before was very inconsiderable though it required a constant residence this was a legacy of the late right reverend and right honorable nathanael crew lord bishop of durham who was such a good benefactor to lincoln college as we have mentioned  other curious things in oxford are the schools which are now beautifully repaired and the names and arms of old benefactors renewed and repainted the museum the chamber of rarities the collection of coins medals pictures and ancient inscriptions the printing house the physickgarden the university and other churches the convocationhouse etc all worthy of a particular description had i room to give it  the university is governed by a chancellor chosen by scrutiny or collection of votes he is generally one of the first noblemen of the kingdom  by a highsteward chosen by the chancellor  by a vice chancellor who must be one of the heads of a college recommended to the university by the chancellor  by two proctors chosen annually by turn out of the colleges  the other officers are the public orator and the keeper of the archives beadles virger etc  but though i have said so much of the university i must not quite forget the city let me then observe that before baliol college they show the stone in the street which marks the place of the martyrdom of archbishop cranmer and bishop ridley then upon the banks of the ditch without the city walls which went along where the theater now stands  beyond the river stood oseny abbey founded      upon the bridge is a tower called friar bacon s study from that famous and learned monk  over another bridge on the isis we went to see ruleigh abbey where some ruins still remain turned to a common brewhouse  of the castle remains a square high tower by the riverside and a lofty mount or keep walled at top with a staircase going downward  the whitefriers was a royal palace and near a green called beaumonds they showed us the bottom of a tower upon the spot where the valiant richard i was born  without the town on all hands are to be seen the fortifications erected in the late civil wars  as to the city though the colleges make up twothirds of it and are still elbowing for more room yet it is large and regular the streets are spacious clean and strait the place pleasant and healthful the inhabitants genteel and courteous the churches many and elegant especially allhallows and taking it altogether and including the grandeur and endowment of the colleges their chapels halls libraries quadrangles piazzas gardens walks groves etc it must be considered as the first university in the world as i have before mentioned  on the left hand on the other side the river the last remains of godstow nunnery are situated among the sweet meadows here fair rosamond had a remarkably fine tomb but before the dissolution scarce could her ashes rest whose beauty was thought guilty as one says even after death  i cannot leave oxford without making one observation with regard to those who insist that it was to the piety of the popish times which we owe the first institution of the university itself the foundation and endowment of the particular colleges and the encouragement arising to learning from thence all which i readily grant but would have them remember too that though those foundations stood as they tell us  00 years and that the reformation as they say is not above  00 years standing yet learning has more increased and the universities flourished more more great scholars been produced greater libraries been raised and more fine buildings been erected in these  00 years than in the  00 years of popery and i might add as many great benefactions have been given notwithstanding this very momentous difference that the protestants gifts are merely acts of charity to the world and acts of bounty in reverence to learning and learned men without the grand incitement of the state of their own souls and those of their fathers which were to be prayed out of purgatory and get a ready admission into heaven  oxford was for many years advantaged by the neighborhood of the royal court while several kings of england being taken with the fine situation of woodstock made their palace there the place of their summer retreat  dr plott allows it to have been a royal house ever since king alfred and a manuscript in the cotton library confirms it and that king henry i was not the founder of it but only rebuilt it and as for henry ii who kept his fair rosamond in it he made only some additions to it for the entertainment and security of his beautiful mistress notwithstanding which the queen having got access to her in the kings absence as tradition informs us dispatched her by poison  when i was first at woodstock some years ago i saw part of the old palace and the famous labyrinth of fair rosamond but now these are destroyed her bathingplace or well as it is called is left a quadrangular receptacle of pure water immediately flowing from a little spring under the hill overshadowd with trees near which are some ruins of walls and arches king ethelred called a parliament here it has been a royal seat as i have said from most ancient times henry i enclosed the park across this valley was a remarkably fine echo that would repeat a whole hexameter but impaired by the removal of these buildings a stately bridge or rialto rather now leads along the grand approach to the present castle one arch is above   0 feet diameter a cascade of water falls from a lake down some stone steps into the canal that runs under it  the new palace of blenheim is a vast and magnificent pile of building a royal gift to the high merit of the invincible duke of marlborough the lofty hall is painted by sir james thornhill the ceiling by la guerre the rooms are finely enriched with marble chimneypieces and furniture but more by the incomparable paintings and hangings which latter represent the principal glories of the dukes life among the pictures are many of rubenss best and largest pieces that celebrated one of himself his wife and child among others vandykes king charles i upon a dun horse of great value and the famous loves of the gods by titian a present from the king of sardinia the gallery is worthy admiration lined with marble pilasters and whole pillars of one piece supporting a most costly and curious entablature excellent for matter and workmanship the windowframes of the same and a basement of black marble quite round before it is stretched out a most agreeable prospect of the fine woods beyond the great valleys what is of the most elegant taste in the whole house is of the duchesss own designing the chapel is equal to the rest the garden is a very large plot of ground taken out of the park and may still be said to be a part of it wellcontrivd by sinking the outer wall into a fosse to give a view quite round and take off the odious appearance of confinement and limitation to the eye it is within well adorned with walks greens espaliers and vistas to diverse remarkable objects that offer themselves in the circumjacent country over the pediment of this front of the house is a curious marble busto of lewis xiv bigger than the life taken from the gate of the citadel of tournay the orangery is a pretty room near the gate of the palace is the house where our famous chaucer was born at the entrance into the castle from the town her grace has erected a noble triumphal arch to the memory of the duke and has set up a vast obelisk in the principal avenue of the park whereon is inscribed the best account of the dukes actions and character that ever was penned in the same compass and if done by the masterly hand of that extraordinary genius to whom i have heard it attributed must be a double triumph to the memory of the duke since his merits extorted so noble a testimony from a person who was once engaged in measures quite opposite to those which derived upon his grace so exalted a reputation and who was thought to be at that time one of his principal adversaries  the inscription does so much honor to the memory of the duke and at the same time to the british nation that i cannot deny to myself the pleasure of inserting it here as follows the castle of blenheim was founded by queen anne french and bavarians blenheim danube who by wisdom justice candor and address europe france europe philip a grandson of the house of france united to the interests directed by the policy supported by the arms of that crown was placed on the throne of spain king william iii beheld this formidable union of two great and once rival monarchies at the end of a life spent in defending the liberties of europe he saw them in their greatest danger he provided for their security in the most effectual manner he took the duke of marlborough into his service  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary states general of the united provinces  the duke contracted several alliance before the death of king william he confirmed and improved these he contracted others after the accession of queen anne and reunited the confederacy which had been dissolved at the end of a former war in a stricter and firmer league  captain general and commander in chief  the duke led to the field the army of the allies he took with surprising rapidity venlo ruremonde stevenswaert and liege he extended and secured the frontiers of the dutch the enemies whom he found insulting at the gates of nimeghen were driven to seek for shelter behind their lines he forced bonne huy limburgh in another campaign he opened the communication of the rhine as well as the maes he added all the country between these rivers to his former conquests the army of france favored by the defection of the elector of bavaria had penetrated into the heart of the empire this mighty body lay exposed to immediate ruin in that memorable crisis the duke of marlborough led his troops with unexampled celerity secrecy order from the ocean to the danube he saw he attacked nor stopped but to conquer the enemy he forced the bavarians sustained by the french in their strong intrenchments at schellenberg he passed the danube a second royal army composed of the best troops of france was sent to reinforce the first that of the confederates was divided with one part of it the siege of ingolstadt was carried on with the other the duke gave battle to the united strength of france and bavaria on the  d day of august   0  he gained a more glorious victory than the histories of any age can boast the heaps of slain were dreadful proofs of his valor a marshal of france whole legions of french his prisoners proclaimed his mercy bavaria was subdued ratisbon augsbourg ulm meminghen all the usurpations of the enemy were recovered the liberty of the diet the peace of the empire were restored from the danube the duke turned his victorious arms toward the rhine and the moselle landau treves traerbach were taken in the course of one campaign the very nature of the war was changed the invaders of other states were reduced to defend their own the frontier of france was exposed in its weakest part to the efforts of the allies  that he might improve this advantage that he might push the sum of things to a speedy decision the duke of marlborough led his troops early in the following year once more to the moselle they whom he had saved a few months before neglected to second him now they who might have been his companions in conquest refused to join him when he saw the generous designs he had formed frustrated by private interest by pique by jealousy he returned with speed to the maes he returned and fortune and victory returned with him liege was relieved huy retaken the french who had pressed the army of the states general with superior numbers retired behind intrenchments which they deemed impregnable the duke forced these intrenchments with inconsiderable loss on the  th day of july   0  he defeated a great part of the army which defended them the rest escaped by a precipitate retreat if advantages proportionable to this success were not immediately obtained let the failure be ascribed to that misfortune which attends most confederacies a division of opinions where one alone should judge a division of power where one alone should command the disappointment itself did honor to the duke it became the wonder of mankind how he could do so much under those restraints which had hindered him from doing more  powers more absolute were given him afterward the increase of his powers multiplied his victories at the opening of the next campaign when all his army was not yet assembled when it was hardly known that he had taken the field the noise of his triumphs was heard over europe on the   th of may   0  he attacked the french at ramillies in the space of two hours the whole army was put to flight the vigor and conduct with which he improved this success were equal to those wherewith he gained it louvain brussels malines liere ghent oudenard antwerp damme bruges courtray surrendered ostend menin dendermond and aeth were taken brabant and flanders were recovered places which had resisted the greatest generals for months for years provinces disputed for ages were the conquests of a summer nor was the duke content to triumph alone solicitous for the general interest his care extended to the remotest scenes of the war he chose to lessen his own army that he might enable the leaders of other armies to conquer to this it must be ascribed that turin was relieved the duke of savoy reinstated the french driven with confusion out of italy  these victories gave the confederates an opportunity of carrying on the war on every side into the dominions of france but she continued to enjoy a kind of peaceful neutrality in germany from italy she was once alarmed and had no more to fear the entire reduction of his power whose ambition had caused whose strength supported the war seemed reserved for him alone who had so triumphantly begun the glorious work  the barrier of france on the side of the low countries had been forming for more than half a century what art power expense could do had been done to render it impenetrable yet here she was most exposed for here the duke of marlborough threatened to attack her  to cover what they had gained by surprise or had been yielded to them by treachery the french marched to the banks of the schelde at their head were the princes of the blood and their most fortunate general the duke of vendosme thus commanded thus posted they hoped to check the victor in his course vain were their hopes the duke of marlborough passed the river in their sight he defeated their whole army the approach of night concealed the proximity of ghent favored their flight they neglected nothing to repair their loss to defend their frontier new generals new armies appeared in the netherlands all contributed to inhance the glory none were able to retard the progress of the confederate army  lisle the bulwark of this barrier was besieged a numerous garrison and a marshal of france defended the place prince eugene of savoy commanded the duke of marlborough covered and sustained the siege the rivers were seized and the communication with holland interrupted the duke opened new communications with great labor and much greater art through countries overrun by the enemy the necessary convoys arrived in safety one alone was attacked the troops which attacked it were beat the defense of lisle was animated by assurances of relief  the french assembled all their force they marched toward the town the duke of marlborough offered them battle without suspending the siege they abandoned the enterprise they came to save the town they were spectators of its fall  from this conquest the duke hastened to others the posts taken by the enemy on the schelde were surprised that river was passed the second time and notwithstanding the great preparations made to prevent it without opposition  brussels besieged by the elector of bavaria was relieved ghent surrendered to the duke in the middle of a winter remarkably severe an army little inferior to his own marched out of the place  as soon as the season of the year permitted him to open another campaign the duke besieged and took tournay he invested mons near this city the french army covered by thick woods defended by noble intrenchments waited to molest nor presumed to offer battle even this was not attempted by them with impunity on the last day of august   0  the duke attacked them in their camp all was employed nothing availed against the resolution of such a general against the fury of such troops the battle was bloody the event decisive the woods were pierced the fortifications trampled down the enemy fled the town was taken doway bethune air st venant bouchain underwent the same fate in two succeeding years their vigorous resistance could not save them the army of france durst not attempt to relieve them it seemed preserved to defend the capital of the monarchy  the prospect of this extreme distress was neither distant nor dubious the french acknowleged their conqueror and sued for peace  these are the actions of the late duke of marlborough british nation had several recitals of clauses in acts of parliament made to do honor to this immortal commander are engraven on the same superb pillar inscribed on this pillar british name and language last  at woodstock they make the fine steel chains for watches and other things of polished steel  from woodstock i went northwest to chippingnorton which must have been once a town of great trade by the number of merchants as they are called on the brasses over their monuments and besides the name chipping denotes as much there are marks of a castle by the church and roman coins are frequently found here the church is a good building and after a curious model  hence we rode to see rowldrich stones a little stonehenge being a circle of great stones standing upright some of them from five to seven feet high and probably the vestigia of an old british temple as that was and mr toland positively asserts that they were so  at tidmerton parish is a large camp of an orbicular form on the summit of an hill which is doubly entrenched and able to contain a great army  when i was at banbury i should have mentioned bloxham which lies north of it where is a fine church the steeple of an odd but agreeable make  near bloxham is also the famous parish of brightwell of which it was observed that there had not been an alehouse nor a dissenter from the church nor any quarrel among the inhabitants that rose so high as to a suit of law within the memory of man but they could not say it was so still especially as to the alehouse part though very much is still preserved as to the unity and good neighborhood of the parishioners and their conformity to the church  being now on the side of warwickshire as is said before i still went south and passing by the four shire stones we saw where the counties of oxford warwick and gloucester join all in a point one stone standing in each county and the fourth touching all three  entering gloucestershire here westward we came after a miles ride to moretonhenmarsh a small town which had formerly a market but now discontinued it lies on the great road to worcester and the famous roman fosseway which coming out of warwickshire enters this county at lemington which lies northeast of this town strikes through it and also through stow and northleach down to cirencester southward  hence we come to the famous cotswolddowns so eminent for the best of sheep and finest wool in england fame tells us that some of these sheep were sent by king richard i into spain and that from hence the breed of their sheep was raised which now produce so fine a wool that we are obliged to fetch it from thence at a great price for making our finest broad clothes  upon these downs we had a clear view of the aforementioned famous fosse which evidently crosses all the middle part of england and is to be seen and known though in no place plainer than here quite from the bath to warwick and thence to leicester to newark to lincoln and on to barton upon the bank of humber  we observed also how several cross roads as ancient as the fosse joined it or branched out of it some of which the people have by ancient usage though corruptly called also fosses for example  the ackmanstreet which is an ancient saxon road leading from buckinghamshire through oxfordshire to the fosse and so to the bath this joins the fosse between burford and cirencester also grimesdyke from oxfordshire wattlebank or avesditch from the same and the wouldway called also the fosse crossing from gloucester to cirencester  many seats of the nobility are to be found in these parts cornbury lord clarendons ditchley lord litchfields hathorp the late duke of shrewsburys new built of stone very beautifully  the lech the coln the churn and the isis all rise in the cotswould hills and joining together make a full stream at lechlade near this place and become one river there and are called the thames which begins there to be navigable and barges may be seen at the quay taking in goods for london which makes lechlade very populous of which town more byandby  stow on the would which is the next town we came to is but indifferent to look at but is or rather has been remarkable for its two annual fairs famous for hops cheese and sheep of which it is said that above  0000 are generally sold at one fair and that the toll of these fairs and the markets amount to  0 l a year the parish is very large being    miles in compass and consists of meadow arable and pasture here is a good large rectory church standing on a hill with a high tower on the south side of it which is seen a great distance off here is also an hospital almshouse and free school all well endowed besides other charities  northleche is also a market town governed by a bailiff and two constables and is named from the river leche which runs through it here is a vicarage church large and spacious having ails on each side and handsome windows with a large tower here is a grammar school free for all the boys of the town endowed with  0 l a year and it is said that the founder falling afterward into misfortunes solicited for the masters place of his own school but could not obtain it from the trustees  here we quitted the roman fosse and went eastward to burford in oxfordshire king henry ii gave this town a charter guildam and omnes consuetudines quas habent liberi burgenses de oxenford but they are almost all now lost however it retains some marks of a corporation still being governed by two bailiffs and other inferior officers it is famous for saddles and lying near the downs draws great profit from the horseraces which are frequent here at this place was convened a synod in     against the error of the british churches in the observance of easter  at battleedge near this town cuthred king of the west saxons beat ethelbald king of the mercians in a pitched battle and threw off his yoke the inhabitants celebrate yearly on midsummereve a kind of festival which they say commenced in honor of this battle it was here the learned dr heylin descended originally from an ancient family in wales was born and the famous speaker lenthal had a seat and died here  being so near witney we could not forbear taking a ride to see a town so famous for the manufactures of blanketing and rugs which thrive here in a most extraordinary manner here are at work   0 looms continually for which above  000 people from eight years old and upward are daily employed in carding spinning etc and consume above  00 packs of wool weekly the blankets are usually  0 or    quarters wide and very white which some attribute to the abstersive nitrous waters of the river windrush wherewith they are scoured but others believe it is owing to a peculiar way of loose spinning they use here and others again are of opinion that it proceeds from both but however that be this town has engrossed the whole trade in that commodity and increases daily in its reputation they likewise make here the duffield stuffs a yard and three quarters wide which are carried to new england and virginia and now much worn even here in winter here are likewise a great many fellmongers who having dressed and stained their sheepskins make them into jackets and breeches and sell them at bampton from whence they are dispersed all over the neighboring counties here is a good free school and a fine library belonging to it  witney is an ancient town and of good repute before the conquest but it is a long straggling uncouth place though full of inhabitants twas one of the manors which alwinus bishop of winchester gave to the church of st swithins there on queen emmas happily passing over the fire ordeal  at astal a village in the road between burford and witney is a barrow which stands very high and is supposed to be the sepulcher of some person of great note  southward lies bampton on the borders of the county next berkshire it is an ancient market town likewise in repute before the conquest it is noted for the greatest market for fellmongerwares in england which come from witney and for nothing else that i know of saving that the people talked much of a family of the woods that dwelt here and at brisenorton who hear always a great knocking before any of them die  turning here west we entered gloucestershire again and came to lechlade which lies on the great road to gloucester it is probable that it was anciently a roman town upon the thames for a very plain roman road runs from hence to cirencester some say that it was once a famous university for teaching latin as creeklade was for greek  the ancient building lately discovered by digging in a meadow near lechlade deserves a particular mention it is  0 feet long  0 broad and four high supported with  00 brick pillars curiously inlaid with stones of diverse colors of tesseraick work and supposed to be a roman bath  not far from it are the two towns called sarney so named in british from the roman causways for sarn in that ancient language and at present imports a paved way the river lech runs through it and discharges itself into the thames a great number of barges go from hence to london  from lechlade we proceeded west to fairford a small market town through which runs the river coln which has two large bridges over it a great many medals and urns have been often dug up here and there are several barrows in the adjoining fields which seem to have been a scene of warlike actions the monuments of the slain interred here  a great many charities are still subsisting in this town but what it is most noted for is its church and the admirable painting in its windows of which take the following description and history  john tame a merchant of london purchased this manor of king henry vii to whom it descended from the beauchamps earls of warwick and having taken a prizeship bound for rome wherein he found a great quantity of painted glass he brought both the glass and the workmen into england the glass was such a curiosity that mr tame built this church at fairford dedicating it to the virgin mary which is in length     feet and    in breadth and has three chancels a good vestry and a noble tower arising from the midst of it adorned with pinacles and the windows of the church    in number he caused to be glazed with this invaluable prize which remains entire to this day the admiration of all that see it  mrs farmer a daughter of the lord lemster gave  00 l to be laid out in mending and wiring the windows this has preserved them from accidents and in the grand rebellion the impropriator mr oldworth and others to their great praise be it remembered took down the glass and secured it in some secret place thereby preserving it from fanatic rage the painting was the design of albert durer a famous italian master and the coloring in the drapery and some of the figures is so well performed that vandyke affirmed the pencil could not exceed it  the subject is all scripture history viz the serpent tempting eve god appearing in the burning bush to moses when a shepherd the angel conducting joshua to war gideons fleece the queen of shebas visit to solomon king david judging the amalekite regicide samson slaying the philistines killing the lion and his being betrayed by dalilah solomons judgment between the two harlots and the figures of the twelve major prophets  but the greatest part is taken up with stories of the new testament the angel appearing to zacharias joseph and mary contracted the visitation of mary by the angel and her visiting her cousin elizabeth our savior born in a stable the shepherds and magi visiting him there herod waiting the return of the wise men christ circumcised the purification of the holy virgin simeon with our savior in his arms josephs flight into egypt herod slaying the young children of bethlehem the assumption of the virgin and joseph and her seeking jesus at the feast our saviors transfiguration mary anointing his head the disciples going to embalm him and the angel relating to them his resurrection christs appearance to mary magdalen his riding to jerusalem on an ass zaccheus and the people strewing palmbranches and children crying hosanna his praying in the garden judas betraying him pilate judging him and washing his hands from the guilt the crucifixion between two thieves the women standing by and the soldiers watching him joseph of arimathea begging the body and receiving it his burial by nicodemus and others the darkness at the passion and michael contending with the devil  christs traveling to emmaus and his appearance to the eleven and afterward to thomas the disciples going a fishing and christs appearing to them with the breaking of the net and broiling of the fish christs ascension and the descent of the holy ghost in cloven tongues  in the west window is the last judgment curiously designed and well executed containing a vast number of incidents relating thereto  in the rest of the windows are many historical passages that happened after christs ascension viz the twelve apostles at large with the article of the creed they are said to be severally the authors of the four evangelists as writing the gospels four principal fathers of the church viz st jerome st gregory st ambrose and st austin the worthies that have preserved the christian church in four upperwindows of the middle ayle on the south side and the persecutors thereof in the four opposite windows  i have been as brief as possible in this description being so much confined in my limits but a curious traveller will be highly delighted with this noble work and i shall only add that john tame esquire the pious and worthy founder who died in the year   00 lies buried on the north side of the church under a raised marble monument  on the churn one of the rivers i have just named stands cirencester or cicester for brevity the ancient corinium of the romans and said to be rebuilt by cissa a viceroy under one of the saxon kings a great and populous city then enclosed with walls and a ditch of vast compass which may be traced quite round the foundation of the wall is also very visible in most places a good part of this circuit is now pasture corn fields and gardens besides the site of the present town antiquities are dug up here every day old foundations houses and streets and many mosaic pavements with rings intaglias and coins innumerable especially in one great garden called lewis grounds which might have been the praetorium or generals quarters for llys in british signifies a palace large quantities of carved stones are carried off yearly in carts to mend the highways besides what have been used in building a fine mosaic pavement was dug up here anno      with many coins one mr richard bishop lately dug up in his garden a vault    feet long and    broad supported with square pillars of roman brick three feet and an half high on which was a strong floor of terrace near it are now several other vaults on which cherrytrees grow these might have been the foundations of a temple for in the same place they found several stones of the shafts of pillars six feet long and large stone bases with cornices very handsomely molded and carved with modilions and other ornaments which are now converted into swinetroughs and pavements before the door capitals of these pillars were likewise found a mosaic pavement near it and entire is now the floor of his privy  half a mile west of the town on the north side of the fosse road at a place called quern other antiquities are to be seen worth an antiquarys attention but i must not take up too much room in describing them  little of the abbey is now lest besides two old and indifferent gatehouses the church is a very handsome building the windows are full of painted glass and it has a fine lofty tower east of the town about a quarter of a mile is starbury mount a barrow where roman coins have been dug up west behind lord bathursts garden is grismunds mount of which several fables are told  cirencester is still a very good town populous and rich full of clothiers and driving a great trade in wool which is brought from the inland counties of leicester northampton and lincoln where the largest sheep in england feed and where are but few manufactures the vast quantities sold here are almost incredible the wool is bought up here chiefly by the clothiers of wiltshire and gloucestershire for the supply of that great cloathingtrade which i have mentioned already they talk of  000 packs in a year  the town is governed by two high constables it has two weekly markets one on monday for corn cattle and provisions and on friday for wool chiefly it has also five fairs three for all sorts of commodities and two for cloth only here is a fine large beautiful church with two ails supported by strong pillars the chancel is handsomely decorated it has five chapels adjoining to it and has a tower very neat and lofty with an excellent ring of bells in it the windows show some beautiful remains of exquisite painted glass there is a free school and diverse hospitals and almshouses in this parish  the churn runs from hence down southward to creeklade in wiltshire which is said to have been anciently a very noted place containing   00 houses and that an university was here founded by the ancient britons for teaching greek as i have said as lechlade was for latin which university was removed as they pretend by the saxons to oxon but i doubt these are monkish accounts for creeklade which they would have to signify a greek town is a corruption of the british word kerigg gwlade i e a stony country the churn and the rey fall here into the thames here is a good free school  northwest of cirencester upon a hill stands stroud a little market town noted for clothing and particularly for dying excellent scarlet the church is  0 feet long and  0 broad the chancel is    feet long and    wide at the west end of the church rises a high spire steeple and a tower in the middle  north of it stands paynswick a market town situate in the wholsomest air in the county on the river stroud where the cloathingtrade is also carried on the church is a vicarage and very handsome with two chancels a north ayle and a neat spire  lower to the southwest of cirencester stands minching hampton so called because it belonged to the minching nuns at caen in normandy here is a good rectory church worth  00 l a year large in the form of a cross with ails on each side and a tower with battlements rising in the middle in the north ayle are a great many inscriptions of benefactions and in the south ayle is a statue lying crossleggd with a sword and shield by him and his wife lying at his feet  then we came to tetbury one of the clothing towns i mentioned a considerable market town situate on a rising ground in a healthy air but scarce of water in summer it is well built has a large markethouse well frequented for yarn and there is a lesser markethouse for cheese bacon and other commodities it is governed by a bailiff and at the end of the town is a long bridge whereof one half is in wiltshire the church is a vicarage worth   0 l a year it is a good building large and handsome in which are diverse monuments here is a free school and an almshouse it had formerly a castle built by dunwallo malmufius a british prince the town seems to be well furnished with every thing but water which is so scarce that the inhabitants are obliged to buy it at the rate sometimes of    d for a hogshead in this parish rises the river avon which runs through bristol and afterward falls into the severn  a little to the north of this town is a meadow called maudlin meadow because as i was told it belongs to magdalen college in oxford here the inhabitants showed me the head of a spring which flowing from thence runs along a hedgetrough and some tops of the wood that grows in the hedge rotting and falling into this rill of water are by it turned into stone i took up a great many of them which are generally in the shape of the pipes as they are commonly called which the perukemakers curl their hair upon and of a whitish stony substance i broke diverse of them and in the middle found generally a stick of wood some as big as a goosequill others larger some had but a thin stony crust about them in others the stick was no biggar than a large needle again some had no stick in them but only a hole through them like that of a tobacco pipe and in some others i could perceive no woody substance nor hole at all but the whole was a soft kind of stone  hence i guess that the sand which the water brings down with it gathers and crusts about those sticks and that in time the stick consumes and the stony or sandy substance fills up and supplies its place and i would hence recommend it as an inquiry whether those other transmutations of this kind that we meet with in the natural history of this and other nations be not brought about in the like manner  and now i am dipped into this work of nature let me digress a little and take notice of the astroites or starstones found at lassington in this county which have that peculiar quality of motion when put into vinegar  in the fields near badminton are found cylindrical and spherical stones almost as big as cannon balls and on the hills about aldely are found stones of the same kind with those i found about watchet in somersetshire resembling all kinds of shellfish these i must confess are of the two more astonishing because they are found on the hills for if they were as fracastorius conjectures animals ingendered in the sea no good account of their being here found can be given unless we suppose them brought hither by the general deluge  the water of the river stroud in this county is esteemed the best for dying scarlets which draws many clothiers to settle in that neighborhood and lest i should be thought too tedious let me but just mention the diamonds  bristol stones rather found near the banks of the river avon that soft easytobewrought stone at great banington called puffstone prodigiously strong and lasting a great deal af of which has been used in the repairs of westminster abbey  wickwar a small market town but a very ancient corporation governed by a mayor is the next the church is a large edifice with two chancels the tower is at the west end and is high adorned with pinacles here is a free school  chipping sodbury lies a little farther in the road an ancient boroughtown under a mayor aldermen and burgesses as it is a great thoroughfare to bristol it is full of good inns it has several streets besides lanes and a good market and a large spacious church which however is but a chapel of ease to old sodbury here is the greatest cheesemarket in england except atherstone in warwickshire  here we dropped the road and fell down southward directly to marshfield another of the clothing towns i spoke of it consists of one street of old buildings near a mile long it has a market and drives also a great trade in malt and is noted for good cakes it is governed by a bailiff here is a good vicarage church with several monuments and inscriptions in the ails and the chancel here is an almshouse well endowed and a chapel to it  we crossed the great road from london to bristol here as at cirencester we did that from london to gloucester and keeping still the fosseway arrived at bath but here i shall conclude this letter and am sir  yours etc  letter v containing a description of part of the counties of somerset gloucester warwick worcester hereford and monmouth sir i closed my last letter with my arrival at bath in somersetshire and i shall now proceed with giving you an account of what is most remarkable in it  the antiquity of this city and of the famous baths in it must be allowed to be very great even though we should doubt of what is insisted on in the inscription under the figure of king bladud placed in the kings bath which says that this prince whom mr camden calls blayden or bladen cloyth i e southsayer found out the use of these baths  00 years before our saviors time  bath is a spot of ground which our countrymen ought to esteem as a particular favor of heaven it lies in a great valley surrounded with an amphitheatrical view of hills and its situation on the west side of the island is a considerable addition to its delights as being the less liable to the rude shocks of tempests but the romans were induced prudently to make a station here by the admirable hot springs the walls are almost entire and perhaps the work of the romans except the upper part which seems repaired with the ruins of roman buildings for the lewisholes are still left in many of the stones and to the shame of the repairers many roman inscriptions some sawn across to fit the size of the place the level of the city is risen to the top of the first walls through the negligence of the magistracy who in this and all other great towns connive at the servants throwing dirt and ashes into the streets these walls enclose but a small compass of a pentagonal form there are four gates on four sides and a postern on the other from the southwest angle have been an additional wall and ditch carried out to the river by which short work the approach of an enemy on two sides is intercepted unless they pass the river the small compass of the city has made the inhabitants crowd up the streets to an unseemly and inconvenient narrowness it is however handsomely built mostly of new stone which is very white and good the great additions made and still making to the buildings here i shall mention byandby  it was of old a resort for cripples and diseased persons and we see the crutches hang up at the several baths as the thankofferings of those who came hither lame and went away cured but now we may say it is a resort of the sound as well as the sick and a place that helps the indolent and the gay to commit that worst of murders that is to say to kill time  to such it is indeed a constant round of diversion in the morning the young lady is brought in a close chair dressed in her bathingcloaths to the crossbath there the music plays her into the bath and the women who tend her present her with a little floating wooden dish like a basin in which the lady puts a handkerchief and a nosegay and of late the snuff box is added she then traverses the bath if a novice with a guide if otherwise by herself and having amused herself near an hour calls for her chair and returns to her lodgings  the rest of the diversion is at mrs hayess formerly harrisons a stately room and mrs wiltshires who has now the apartments that were the late mrs lindseys where not long since was the bowlinggreen and perhaps mr leake who keeps one of the finest booksellers shops in europe has more than a chance for half an hour of each persons company nowandthen and to be sure a subscription which is but five shillings the season for taking home what book you please but persons of quality generally subscribe gold and i think it is the very best money laid out in the place for those who go for pleasure or amusement only in the afternoon there is frequently a play though the decorations are mean and indeed the performances too in the evening people assemble at the great rooms and there are balls twice a week it is also the fashion of the place for the company to go every day pretty constantly to hear divine service at the great church and at st marys chapel in queenssquare where are prayers twice a day  it is remarkable that for many hundreds of years the medicinal virtues of these waters have been useful to the diseased people by batheing only whereas of late years they are found to be no less healthful in many cases taken inwardly insomuch that more come to drink than to bathe nor are the cures they perform this way less valuable than the outward application  gaming used to obtain here as at all public places to a scandalous degree but the act prohibiting that pernicious practice has a good deal checked its progress this act passed in the   th of king george ii and suppresses on the penalty of  00 l and  0 l the adventures the following games by name viz the ace of hearts pharaoh basset hazard also all sales raffles lotteries mathematical machines etc sales by lotteries are declared void and what is put up by them forfeited nor are convictions to be vacated for want of form  but this act being eluded by new games set up a clause was inserted in the horseracing act anno    geo ii prohibiting passage and all other games with dice except what are played on the backgamon tables  as to the more particular nature and virtues of the waters i have been favored by a very eminent physician with the following curious account of tham and their original of bath waters the bath waters certainly owe their heat to a mixture and fermentation of two different sources distilling from the tops of two different mountains  clarton and landsdown meeting in the valley where the town stands for all hills are nests of metals or minerals and their bellies are cavernous and hollow it is not therefore improbable that on clarton down there should lie the sulphurous matter which must rise by impregnation from that excellent stone quarry which hardens in the air and grows cased with a nitrous coat by time and cold weather and is so readily cut out and carved into any the most exquisite shapes this the discovery and property of the worthy charitable and pious ralph allen esquire for all mineral waters owe their virtue to an impregnation of rain water generated from the clouds which are compressed in their course by mountains or eminences and fall on the respective included mineral and every one knows that a due mixture of sulphur and filings of iron moistened with water will produce any degree of heat this quarry therefore must have a large quantity of sulphurous or bituminous matter in its composition as will be evident to a natural philosopher from these mentioned qualities of the stone neither is it improbable that the ferruginous or irontinctured water takes its rise from lansdown quarry the stone on it being hard and on the top flinty black and acrimonious as iron ore is known to be these two mountains thus tinged by rain water falling from the proper heights meet in some caverns in the valley and there fermenting produce that hot milky soft salutiferous beverage called bath water far beyond any hot mineral waters for its delicacy and supportable though comfortable heat to any other such water hitherto discovered on the habitable globe as it possesses that milkiness detergency and middling heat so friendly adapted to weakened animal constitutions which all other hot waters want in the due degree either being too hot or too cold to do any great good in cases where they are proper these waters are beneficial in almost all chronical distempers and can hurt in none except in hemorrhages inflammations or bad lungs unless they be overdosed in quantity or too high and too hot a regimen be joined with them for they always procure a great appetite and good spirits if cautiously managed but if high meats and strong liquors be indulged they will create inflammatory disorders however in weak stomachs decayed appetites colicks low spirits in the intervals of the fits of the gout and stone in rheumatisms palsies nervous disorders and in a word all those called the cold diseases but most eminently in all the disorders of the chyliferous tube or the stomach and belly not inflamed they are more kindly and beneficial than any medicine known in nature and introduce a natural warmth and a new internal heat into decayed wornout superannuated constitutions and if a light regimen due exercise and good hours be joined with them they would truly work wonders but by the neglect of these their efficacy is often lost and their credit brought into question    great additions have been made to the buildings here within these few years particularly by the duke of chandos  without the walls a stately new square is erected with a fine chapel and the middle is enclosed by rails and handsomely laid out within  in the center is a lofty obelisk  0 feet high from the foundation and terminated in a point level with ones eye is the enclosed inscription in memory frederick prince of wales consort richard nash esquire  the bathstone which i have mentioned before affords a fine opportunity to imbellish and give a noble look to the buildings here and at a very cheap rate for the front of the houses on the north side of the square cost no more than  00 l though it is above  00 feet in extent and enriched with columns and pilasters in the corinthian order all the danger is that they will overbuild themselves now they are got into the humor and make it less worth while to those who let lodgings the principal business of the place but then people of fortune settling there will make amends for it since no less than  0 or  0 families are already become constant inhabitants and others are daily taking houses  the grove too near the abbeychurch now called orangesquare in compliment to the prince of orange when there has several handsome newbuilt houses and a monumental stone is erected with an inscription in honor to the prince of orange and the place his highness having been obliged to visit bath for his health just before he married the princess royal of england and received great benefit by the waters this likewise was erected by the famous mr nash to whose good management and behavior bath is greatly indebted every one submitting with delight to the regulations he imposes with regard to decorum and the economy of the place  the inscription on the stone above is as follows in memoriam sanitatis principi auriaco aquarum thermalium potu favente deo ovante britannia feliciter restitutae thus translated in memory of the happy restoration of the health of the prince of orange by the drinking of the bath waters through the favor of god and to the extreme joy of britain       general wade one of the representatives in parliament for this city has given a fine altarpiece to the great church there he has also been at the charge of having the picture drawn of every one of his electors the members of the corporation and set up round the town hall and his own too he has suffered to be put up over the entrance as if he would make good that pass and keep them all to duty at the upperend of the hall are lately set up the pictures of the prince and princess of wales a present made by their royal highnesses to the corporation who likewise before presented it with a fine large wrought silver cup and waiter gilt  there is a very great narrowness of spirit in most of the inhabitants at bath but indeed it is the same in all public places of resort they have but their seasons and they are so hungry by that time they come about that they look upon a new comer as a person to be shared and divided among them for this reason you will always find them with both hands open to receive and not one to communicate or do a generous office without a benefit in possession or reversion and when they receive a favor at your hands it is with such an air as if it were their due and they quitted scores with you by their acceptance of it  the abbeychurch is a venerable pile and has many monuments in it but the principal front is almost blasphemously decorated if it may be called decorated with the figures of god the father and saints and angels the work of superstition this cathedral though beautiful is but small and on the spot probably stood the roman temple of minerva patroness of the baths before it was an handsome square area but of late years deformed with houses  on the south side are the justly renowned hot springs collected into a square area called the kings bath the corporation erected within these few years that pretty neat building before it called the pumproom for the company to meet in who drink the water conveyed hither by a marble pump from the bottom of the springs where it is near boilinghot  this water is admirably grateful to the stomach striking the roof of the mouth with a fine sulphurous and steely taste like that of the german spaw or pyrmont though you drink off a large pintglass it is so far from creating a heaviness or nausea that you immediately perceive yourself more alert at first it operates by stool and especially urine it is of sovereign efficacy to strengthen the bowels restore their lost tone and renew the vital heat but i have already mentioned its excellent qualities  the kings bath is an oblong square the walls full of niches perhaps the romans work there are twelve on the north side eight on the east and west about four larger arches on the south at every corner are the steps to descend into it and a parapet or balustrade with a walk round it  the springs were doubtless separated from common springs by the romans and fenced in with a durable wall there goes a probable tradition of subterranean canals of their making to carry off the other waters lest they should mix with these and destroy the heat  it is remarkable that at the cleansing of the springs when they set down a new pump they constantly find great quantities of hazelnuts as in many other places among subterraneous timber these dr stukeley doubts not are the remainder of the universal deluge which the hebrew historian tell us was in autumn providence by that means securing the revival of the vegetable world  in the bath people stand up to the chin men and women and stew mostly in the way of gallantry  many are the diseases which here find a remedy when judiciously applied as i observed above the confleunce hither is greater in summer than in winter though the latter of the two seems the more preferable season for medicinal purposes  behind the southern wall of the kings bath is a less square named the queens bath with a tabernacle of four pillars in the midst this is of more temperate warmth as borrowing its water from the other there are likewise pumps and pumpingrooms for pouring hot streams on any part of the body which in many cases is very salutary  in the southwest part of the town are two other baths not to be disregarded  the hotbath is not much inferior in heat to the kings bath it is a small parallelogram with a stone tabernacle of four pillars in the midst  the crossbath near it is triangular and had a cross in the middle hard by is an hospital built and endowed by a prelate of this see the water in these two places rises near the level of the streets  on the south side of the cathedral are some parts of the abbey left and the gate house belonging to it  within these few years by a contribution a cold bath for the benefit of the infirm was made at a spring beyond the bridge  two roman inscriptions have been set in the eastern wall of the cathedral fronting the walks which besides the injuries of the weather are exposed to the mischievous sport of boys who throw stones at them  the several baths are very indifferently kept as their use so much increases but a fine design is now on foot to make convenient slips with dressingrooms and apartments for pumping on people without going into the bath and for enlarging the pumproom so as to hold four or five pumps  the greatest decency is observed here by both sexes and while mr nash lives it must be always so there is a very good convenience of chairs of which there are great plenty and very genteel ones to go to any part within the walls and even to the adjoining buildings without for   d provided the distance does not exceed  00 yards but if it does the fare is   s and for this the chairmen are obliged to go a mile in short it is a delightful place enough when you are in it but a dreadful one to come at down high hills in some places like precipices but health or pleasure obliges people to dispense with this difficulty  bath being environed with hills there are few pleasant walks out of the town or even rides without clambering much to landsdownhill or that called clartondown  it is for this reason that very few people care to keep coaches here and the hill up to lansdown particularly is so steep that the late queen anne was extremely frighted in going up her coachman stopping to give the horses breath and the coach wanting a dragstaff it ran back in spite of all the coachmans skill the horses not being brought to strain the harness again or pull together for a good while and the coach putting the guards behind in great confusion at last some of the servants setting their heads and shoulders to the wheels stopped them by mere force  the general hospital now near finished in this city for the reception of the sick poor all over the kingdom is a very noble design the first stone of it was laid the  th of july      it is built where the old playhouse stood and is a noble pile of building  00 feet in front and  0 feet deep it is capable of receiving   0 poor cripples its chief benefactor is mr allen of whom we shall say more anon who gave all the wallstone freestone ready wrought pavingstone and lime used in it the prince and princess of wales have likewise been great promoters of the work  a very great design is now also begun in this city of which the following is a brief account  on the  0th of march      0 the first stone of a new square was laid in the gardens adjoining to the public walks the principal side of this square is to have the appearance of one house   0 feet in front and   0 feet in depth but is to be divided into  0 houses each front is to have    windows and each end    two of the other sides are to serve as wings to the principal side each wing is to contain    houses upon a perfect square of   0 feet and the front of these wings are every one to have    windows so that when the whole building is viewed in front it will show     windows extend  0 0 feet and from the distant hills look like one grand palace the three piles of building will be adorned with above  00 columns and pilasters in the corinthian order  upon the corner of every pile there will be a tower and in every front will be a centrehouse and a pediment  a noble house for public assemblies is to be erected by subscription in this square the ballroom will be like an egyptian hall and contain in length  0 feet and breadth    feet the assemblyroom will be  0 feet long there will be a garden for the ladies to walk in a bowlinggreen for the gentlemen a grand parade of  00 yards long a terrace  00 yards in circumference a portico of the same dimensions with diverse other walks in common for all people and so disposed that gentlemen and ladies may walk at any season of the year at any hour of the day and in any weather so that by these great improvements bath will be rendered one of the most agreeable places in the world for facing this square a bridge with an arch of  0  feet opening will be built over the river by which people of distinction may go to the downs as into their own gardens for the air and exercise  the river avon runs by the back of the town and on the banks of it mr allen who is the genius of the place and whose works and inventions there next to the waters are better worth the attention of the curious than any thing in bath has a fine wharf and other convenient places to shape to work to imbark the stones of many tons weight which he digs from the quarry on the adjacent hill this he does by an admirable machine which runs down the hill by grooves placed in the ground without horses or any other help than one man to guide it who also by a particular spring can stop it in the steepest part of the hill and in the swiftest part of its motion these stones he can carry by the avon to bristol whence they may be transported to any other part of england and the new works of st bartholomews hospital london are built with them he is building for himself a very magnificent house of this stone with a fine chapel and noble stables and offices and has delightful gardens laid out with a profusion of fancy yet with great economy as to the expense for in short mr allen is contented with the situation of his house and gardens and indeed well he may for it is a very fine one and instead of forcing nature by a great expense to bend to art he pursues only what the natural site points out to him and by so doing will make it one of the cheapest and at the same time one of the most beautiful seats in england he levels no hills but enjoys the beauty of the prospects they afford he cuts down no woods but strikes through them fine walks and nexttonatural mazes and has by that means a delightful grove always filled with birds which afford the rural ear a music transcending all others nor does he want for fine conveniences of water and as he is a gentleman who is not entered into the present fashionable schemes of ridiculing religion and scripture he has a figure of moses striking the rock and the water gushing out of it which forms a sort of natural cascade whence his basin is supplied and is a pretty allusion to his producing all his works from the stone quarry in his neighborhood this is the same mr allen who first invented the crosspost so useful for the conveyance of letters to places which before were in that particular at the greatest uncertainty the taste of this gentleman in his gardening etc is so aptly described by mrs chandler of the place in an ingenious poem called the description of bath that the following quotation from it must be acceptable thy taste refined appears in yonder wood not nature tortured but by art improved where covered walks with open vistas meet an area here and there a shady seat a thousand sweets in mingled odours flow from blooming flowers which on the borders grow in numerous streams the murmuring waters thrill uniting all obedient to thy will till by thy art in one canal combined they through the wood in various mazes wind from thence the foaming waves fall rapid down in bold cascades and lash the rugged stone but here their fury lost the calmer scene delights the softer muse and sul serene an ample basin center of the place in lymph transparent holds the scaly race its glassy face from every ruffle free reflects the image of each neighboring tree on which the feathered choir s melodious throng by love inspired unite in tuneful song their tuneful song the echoing woods resound and falling waters add a solemn sound sure this the muses haunt it is hallowed ground   at walcot has been a camp and many roman antiquities have been found lord winchelsea has an urn a patera and other things taken out of a stone coffin wherein was a childs body half a mile off the bath  when one is upon kingsdown and has passed all the steeps and difficulties of the ascent there is a plain and pleasant country for many miles into gloucestershire and two very noble houses the one built by mr blathwait late secretary at war and the other is called badmington a mansion of the duke of beaufort  nor must we forget to mention the handsome monument erected by order of the late lord lansdown to the honor of sir bevil granville his lordships ancestor with an inscription recording the action in which he fell it is built on the brow of lansdownhill on the very spot as near as possible where that brave gentleman was killed in the action between him and sir william waller in the late civil wars of which lord clarendon and others give account  i ought not to omit that in the session of parliament       an act passed for enlarging the terms and powers granted by two former acts of parliament for repairing and enlarging the highways between the top of kingsdownhill and the city of bath and for amending several other roads leading from bristol and other places to bath and for cleansing paving and enlightening the streets and regulating the chairmen there and for keeping a regular nightly watch within the said city and liberties all which when effected according to the intention of the act will be a great convenience to bath and to persons resorting to it  i will just mention also that at chippingnortonlane near bath was a fight between the forces of king james ii and those of the duke of monmouth in which the latter had the advantage and if they had pursued it would have gained a complete victory an old elmtree standing near stantondrew in a road leading three ways afforded a sad testimony of the event of the dukes enterprise for it was all overspread with the heads and limbs of the unfortunate persons engaged in his cause who suffered by the sentence of the merciless jefferies  about twyfordton not far from bath is a fallow field called marsburyfield with but little quantity of earth upon the rock this was very full of fossile shells which had preserved their natural color of blue and white as perfectly as at first  in chu parish is bowditch so called from its circular form it was a large camp on a hill trebly fortified whence you may behold the isles of flatholm and steepholm in the sea here is a petrifying spring this country abounds with coalpits the slates which lie upon it and have not received their due quantity of sulphur so as to make perfect coal are most curiously marked with impressions of plants particularly those of fern this is indeed a rock full of springs a very bad road for traveling consisting of short and steep valleys narrow lanes intricate dark and hard the ground is very rich and bears much wood the neatness of the houses even of the poorer sort of people is remarkable being generally whited over and imbellishd with little gardens we come in ten miles from bath to the city of bristol the greatest the richest and the best port of trade in great britain london only excepted  bristol has been formerly a place of strength and had a castle in which king stephen was kept prisoner some time by maud the empress it was besieged in the civil wars and made a good defense the castle stood till the time of oliver cromwell who demolished it it is a countytown and one of king henry viiis new bishoprics  the merchants of this city have not only the greatest trade but they trade with a more entire independency upon london than any other town in britain and it is evident in this particular viz that whatsoever exportations they make to any part of the world they are able to bring the full returns back to their own port and can dispose of them there which is not the case in any other port in england where they are often obliged either to ship part of the effects in the ports abroad on the ships bound to london or to consign their own vessels to london in order both to get freight and dispose of their own cargoes  but the bristol merchants as they have a very great trade abroad so they have always buyers at home for their returns and that such buyers that no cargo is too big for them to this purpose the shopkeepers in bristol who in general are wholesalemen have so great an inland trade among all the western counties that they maintain carriers just as the london tradesmen do to all the principal countries and towns from southampton in the south even to the banks of the trent north although they have no navigable river that way  add to this that as well by sea as by the navigation of two great rivers the wye and the severn they have the whole trade of south wales as it were to themselves and the greatest part of that of north wales and as to their trade to ireland it is prodigiously increased since the revolution notwithstanding the great trade which of late the merchants of liverpool also drive with that kingdom  the greatest inconveniences of bristol are its situation its narrow streets and the narrowness of its river and we might mention also another narrow that is the minds of the generality of its people for let me tell you the merchants of bristol though very rich are not like the merchants of london the latter may be said as of old of the merchants of tire to vie with the princes of the earth whereas the former being raised by good fortune and prizes taken in the wars from masters of ships and blunt tars have imbibed the manners of these rough gentlemen so strongly that they transmit it to their descendants only with a little more of the sordid than is generally to be found among the british sailors and i would advise the rich ones among them if they would be a little more polite and generous than they usually are to travel but not out of england neither i mean only to london that is from the second great trading town to the first and they will see examples worth their imitation as well for princely spirit as upright and generous dealings  the corporation being very tenacious in not admitting persons to trade in their liberty who are not freemen there are not so many new buildings and improvements of streets etc at bristol as would otherwise be as for the city itself there is hardly room to set another house in it the great square called queens formerly the mead where the ground was subject to the hazard of inundations is now so raised that it is free from that inconvenience it is very handsomely built and inhabited and a fine equestrian statue of king william iii erected in the middle of it done by the famous rysbrack  the quay along the river is very noble and well filled with all sorts of merchandise and a handsome row of houses fronts it and i was informed when i was there last that in order to make the back of this city more commodious than ever the corporation have purchased several houses adjoining to the backgate in order to pull them down and make all flush from the conduit on the back clear round to the quay which when finished will be one of the completest harbors in europe this quay is reckoned the longest in england it has a crane on it the workmanship of the late ingenious mr padmore which is not to be equalled in europe the merchants are greatly benefited by it in the extraordinary dispatch it gives to the discharging of their ships  collegegreen is deemed the healthiest situation in the city  there is erected within these few years an assembly room for entertainment and amusement of the gay as at other considerable places for luxury must always follow riches it is a very handsome building and stands in the way from the city to the hotwell  the old theater at stokescroft is also altered into a commodious room for an assembly which is held every tuesday during the winter  there were when i was there no less than fifteen glasshouses in bristol which is more than are in the city of london they use indeed themselves a very great number of glass bottles which they send filled with beer cider and wine to the west indies much more than goes from london also vast numbers of bottles are now used for sending the water of st vincents rock not only all over england but we may say all over the world  this hotwell or water of st vincents rock is without the city at the confluence of the two little rivers and on the northside of the stream not many years since this spring lay open at the foot of the rock and was covered by the salt water at every tide and yet it preserved both its warmth and virtue entire  the rock though hard to admiration has since that been worked down partly by labor and partly blown in pieces by gunpowder and an handsome large house is built upon it where they have good apartments for entertaining distempered persons the well is secured and a good pump is fixed in it so that they have the water pure and unmixed from the spring itself and they export vast quantities for this water keeps its virtue better than that of bath  the following curious account of the bristol waters i am indebted for to the same eminent physician who favored me with the learned account of the nature and efficacy of the bath and tunbridge waters  the bristol waters he says seem only a natural limewater or pure element impregnated with a natural unburnt limestone all the hills and mountains round that water are nothing but a quarry of natural unburnt limestone which is daily dug up there for building and manifests itself to the senses this makes these bristol waters one of the purest best and most salutary mere aqueous elements on the globe to cool all overheated bowels and to lessen all preternatural discharges but the small milkwarmth in them when immediately pumped up upon the wells being drained of the influx of the tide shows there is some other principle in them besides natural limestone and that in nature can be no other than some weak impregnation of sulphur with nitre or sea salt or perhaps a slight touch of iron the stones are some reddish some blackish that are dug out of the mountains circumjacent but all of them natural limestone these reddish and blackish colors in the stones necessarily imply sulphur and iron and these three principles by chemical processes and mixtures are discovered in some small proportion in the waters they are excellent in all scorbutic and nervous atrophies in hecticks weak lungs all inflammations in whatever part all preternatural evacuations in short in all acrid juices and viscid blood being a natural simple alcali and in the first stages of a phthisis pulmonum and if early had recourse to and long continued under a low cooling nutritive regimen they would probably stop the growth and causes of most chronical distempers  there are    parishes in the city but    churches including the cathedral and the church of st mark there are besides those churches several meeting houses for the different sectaries viz independents quakers and baptists  the cathedral is far from extraordinary  several of the churches are very neat and beautifully decorated and worthy a travellers attention that of st mary radcliffe or redcliff is a noble and stately edifice it is very large and spacious and has a fine steeple or tower  in it is a very ancient monument for mr william cannings burgess and merchant of bristol the founder of the church and a great benefactor otherwise to the city of bristol  on one part of the monument is a latin inscription full of abbreviations and on the other side in english an inscription to his praise which i have not room to insert  here is also an inscription on the monument of sir william penn knt vice admiral of england the father of the great william penn one of the heads of the quakers who was a native of the city of bristol  a great face of seriousness and religion appears at bristol and the magistrates are laudably strict in exacting the observation of the sabbath considering the general dissoluteness that has broken in almost everywhere else  one thing they deserve high commendation for and that is the neatness observed in keeping their churches and the care they take in preserving the monuments and inscriptions of those buried in em a practice scandalously neglected almost everywhere else in england and even at places we might mention where money another scandalous practice is exacted for seeing them this care of the monuments of the dead brings many visitors to their churches of traveling strangers who are always pleased with it and make comparisons in its favor though very little to the credit of some others who are more negligent it is indeed strange that the heirs and families of the deceased should not think themselves more concerned than they generally are to keep up the monuments of their ancestors with great piety and at a great expense the next heir or the most obliged rears a monument to the deceased and it is dedicated too professedly to posterity in a very little while the monument is covered with dust and cobwebs and the inscription often effaced common decency does not succeed to this piety and it becomes a monument of the ingratitude or neglect of the survivors rather than an honor to the deceased  methinks vanity alone the common inducement to these erections should inspire another manner of acting i cannot account for it any other way but that from the prince to the peasant as a family generally lies together in one vault or tomb very few are willing to see or think of their coffins and hence it is that some men often look upon their very heirs as memento moris unhappy narrowness of mind equally to be lamented and despised  bristol is supposed to have an hundred thousand inhabitants in the city and within three miles of its circumference and they say above three thousand sail of ships belong to that port  it is very remarkable that this city is so well supplied with coals that though they are all brought by land carriage yet they are generally laid down at the doors of the inhabitants at seven eight or nine shillings per chaldron  the situation of the city is low but on the side of a rising hill the ground plat of it is said very much to resemble that of old rome being circular with a something greater diameter one way than another but enough to make it oval and the river cutting off one small part as it were a sixth or less from the rest  the bridge over the avon is exceeding strong the arches very high because of the depth of water and the buildings so close upon it that in passing the bridge you see nothing but an entire fullbuilt street the tide of flood rises here near six fathom and runs very strong  they draw all their heavy goods here on sleds or sledges which they call geehoes without wheels this kills a multitude of horses and the pavement is worn so smooth by them that in wet weather the streets are very slippery and in frosty weather it is dangerous walking  the noble charities of mr edward colston a worthy merchant of bristol and his foundations are an honor to the place and to the memory of that excellent man and i am sorry that my narrow limits will not permit me to give a particular account of them  but i ought not to omit that one of his charities only cost him   000 l and that is the noble hospital or almshouse erected by him in the year      upon his own ground on st michaelshill the front and two sides are faced with freestone it contains a chapel neatly adorned    apartments and other conveniences for    men and    women the elder brother receives   s and each of the others   s weekly besides an allowance for coal etc to a clergyman is paid the sum of  0 l yearly for reading the common prayer twice every day except when prayers are read in st michaels church at which every member of this almshouse is to attend  in the year      he also purchased a piece of ground in templestreet and built at his own charge a school and dwelling house for a master to instruct  0 boys in writing arithmetic and the church catechism the boys are likewise to be clothed  and his other charities and benefactions were without number  on st peters day june         was opened at the mint an infirmary for this city for the reception of the sick lame and distressed poor after the example of those in london winchester etc it is denominated st peters hospital and very liberal contributions have been made to it and particularly we are told that john elbridge esquire comptroller of the customs in this city who died february       besides many other charitable donations bequeathed  000 l to this infirmary besides endowing a charity school on st michaels hill which he built several years before his death for educating and clothing a certain number of poor girls  large pieces of ground are cleared for building a market and a magnificent exchange the former in high street and the latter in cornstreet the old buildings which have been destroyed for that purpose have cost the chamber of this city upwards of twenty thousand pounds and on the  0th of march    0  the first stone of the exchange was laid by the mayor with great ceremony with several pieces of gold and silver coin under it and this inscription on the stone regnante georgio ii pio felici augusto libertatis and rei mercatoriae domi forisque vindice primarium lapidem hujusce aedificii suffragio civium and aere publico extructi posuit henricus comb praetor a c mdccxl that is in the reign of george ii pious prosperous august vindicator at home and abroad of liberty and trade henry comb mayor placed the first stone of this structure erected by the votes of the citizens and at the public expense a d    0  this edifice when finished will be one of the completest of its kind in europe  the old library in king street is rebuilding in a very handsome manner as is also merchanttaylorshall in broadstreet a freestone building near  0 feet long and breadth proportionable  from this city i had thoughts of coasting the marshes or border of wales especially south wales by tracing the rivers wye and lug in monmouth and herefordshire but changed my mind on occasion of the danger of the ferries over the severn in the mean time i resolved to follow the course of this famous river by which i should necessarily see the richest most fertile and most agreeable part of england the banks of the thames only excepted  from bristol west you enter the county of gloucester and keeping the avon in view you see kingroad where the ships generally take their departure as ours at london do from gravesend and hungroad and where they notify their arrival as ours for london do in the downs the one lies within the avon the other in the severn sea indeed great part of bristol is in the bounds of gloucestershire though it be a county of itself from hence going away a little northwest we come to the pill a convenient road for shipping and where therefore they generally run back for ireland or for wales there is also a little farther an ugly dangerous and very inconvenient ferry over the severn to the mouth of wye namely at aust which i shall mention again presently  as we turn north toward gloucester we lose the sight of the avon and in about two miles exchange it for an open view of the severn sea which you see on the west side and which seems as broad as the ocean there except that you see two small islands in it and that looking n w you discern plainly the coast of south wales and particularly a little nearer hand the shore of monmouthshire then as you go on the shores begin to draw toward one another and the coasts to lie parallel so that the severn appears to be a plain river or an aestuarium somewhat like the humber or as the thames is at the nore being   to   and   miles over and is indeed a most raging and furious kind of sea this is occasioned by those violent tides called the bore which flow here sometimes   or   feet at once rolling forward like a mighty wave so that the stern of a vessel shall on a sudden be lifted up   or   feet upon the water when the head of it is fast aground  after coasting the shore about   miles farther the road being by the low salt marshes kept at a distance from the river we came to aust ferry from a little dirty village called aust near which you come to take boat  this ferry lands you at beachly in monmouthshire so that on the outside it is called aust passage and on the other side beachly passage from whence you go by land two little miles to chepstow a large port town on the river wye but of that part i shall say more in its place  here is a good neat chapel with an high tower at the west end adorned with pinacles  this place is memorable from a circumstance in the reign of king edw i who being here invited lewellin prince of wales who was on the other side to come over and confer with him and settle some matters in dispute between them but the prince refused and the king thereupon crossed over to him who in a rapture of generosity leaped into the water to receive the king in his boat telling him his humility had conquered his pride and his wisdom triumphed over his folly  when we came to aust the hither side of the passage the sea was so broad the fame of the bore of the tide so formidable the wind also made the water so rough and which was worse the boats to carry over both man and horse appeared so very mean that in short none of us cared to venture so we came back and resolved to keep on the road to gloucester  thornbury is a market town and has a customary mayor and    aldermen and was given in the conquerors time to the famous fitzhammon here are the foundations of a large castle designed but never finished by the duke of buckingham in king henry viiis time here is a spacious church built cathedralwise it has fine wide ails and   chancels with a high and beautiful tower here is a free school and   small almshouses  on the right lies wotton a pretty market town governed by a mayor elected annually at the court leet it is famous for its clothing trade the church which is a vicarage is large and has two wide ails and an high handsome tower adorned with battlements and pinacles there are in it diverse tombs monuments and inscriptions chiefly for the family of berkley here is a free school and some charityhouses  directly north of this town lies dursley a good clothing and market town governed by a bailiff and   constables and has been formerly noted for sharp overreaching people from whence arose a proverbial saying of a sharp man he is a man of dursley the church is good has   ails and an handsome spire  turning northwest we came to berkley a noted town so called from berk a beech and leas pasture it is the largest parish in the county and consists of rich meadowgrounds and above  0 parishes depend on this manor for which a feefarm rent was paid in king henry iis time of  00 l    s   d which shows the vast extent and value of this estate it belongs to the present earl of berkley who is also baron of dursley adjoining to this town is the strong castle of berkley a magnificent though antique building and the ancient seat of this noble family from whence it derives its name as well as title ever since the time of king henry ii who gave it to robert fitzharding who assumed the name of berkley and from whom the present earl is lineally descended king edw ii of england as all our learned writers agree was murdered in this castle as king richard ii was in that of pontefract in yorkshire but i refer to our histories for these horrid facts they show the apartments where they say that king was kept a prisoner but they do not admit that he was killed there the place is rather ancient than pleasant or healthful lying low and near the water here is a large spacious church with an ayle on each side and a chapel adjoining which is the burialplace of the family a neat vestry and a strong high tower  on the right of the road is stanley a little market town where was formerly a priory the ruins whereof appear still the church is built in the form of a cross with a tower in the middle  a great improvement has been lately made in these parts for the earl of berkley has just finished    0 a great bulwark at frampton upon severn near this place called hockcrib the design of which is to enforce the river severn by artspoint into its former chanel it is said his lordship intends to build another four miles below the former by which he will undoubtedly gain a large tract of land contiguous to what is called the new grounds inferior to none in england for the richness of its soil  from hence we saw across the river the ancient forest of dean which once contained  0000 acres of land being twenty miles long and so full of wood that it was very dangerous to travel through it its oak was famous for shipping the glory of our own and so much the envy of other nations that the famous spanish armada had it in special charge to burn it the great number of iron forges near it has greatly lessened though not consumed the wood which is still preserved with great care it is subject to forestlaws and the ironminers have here a court also  from hence to gloucester we see nothing considerable but a most fertile rich country and a fine river but narrower as you go northward till a little before we come to gloucester it ceases to be navigable by ships of burden but continues to be so by large barges above an hundred miles farther not reckoning the turnings and windings of the river besides that it receives several large and navigable rivers into it  gloucester called by the britons caerglow i e fine city and in imitation of it glevum by the romans abounds much with crosses and statues of the kings of england and has an handsome prospect of steeples some without a church for in the late civil wars when it held out vigorously against king charles i and was then very strong it suffered much for its eleven churches were then reduced to five and all its walls and works were demolished the city is still tolerably built and here is a large stone bridge over the severn the first next the sea here are several markethouses supported with pillars one a very old one of stone in gothic architecture ancient and uncommon now turned into a cistern for water  the old proverb as sure as gods at gloucester certainly alluded to the vast number of churches and religious foundations here for you can scarce walk past  0 doors but somewhat of that sort occurs  the cathedral is an old venerable pile the western part is old and mean but from the tower which is very handsome you have a most glorious prospect eastward through the choir finely vaulted at top and the ladies chapel to the east window which is very magnificent on the northside lies that unfortunate king edw ii in an alabaster tomb and out of the abundance of pious offerings to his remains the religious built this choir and the votaries to his shrine for some time after his death could hardly find room in the town so changeable are the tempers of men and so little a space is required to dispose the minds of the fluctuating many to hosannah or crucify  before the high altar in the middle of the church lies the equally unfortunate prince robert eldest son of the conqueror after a miserable life for many years before his death but his monument remains and his bones are at rest which is more than can be said of the monument of his younger brother king henry i who as the second brother william rufus had done robbed him of his right and no traces of his monument are left at readingabbey where he was buried with his queen he lies in a wooden tomb with his coat of arms painted and upon it his effigies in irish oak crossleggd like a jerusalem knight the famous strongbow who subdued ireland lies buried in the chapter house  the cloisters in this cathedral are exquisitely beautiful in the style of the chapel of kingscollege cambridge there are large remains in the city of abbeys of black and white friars a mile or two distant is robin hoods hill as it is called which affords now a pleasant walk for the citizens and from which they are attempting to supply the city with water which it much wants by this city the rickning way runs from the severns mouth into yorkshire  the inhabitants boast much of the antiquity of their first cathedral which they pretend had bishops and preachers here anno     the first cathedral we say for it has been as reported thrice destroyed by fire  william the conqueror gave this city and castle to the famous robert fitzhammon afterward lord of glamorgan edol one of the british nobles who attended king vortigern to the congress appointed by hengist was earl of this place he was a man of great personal strength and seeing the saxons drawing forth their concealed weapons he disarmed one of them and fought valiantly but being overpowered by numbers he escaped to this city after having killed  0 saxons with his own hands afterward in a battle fought against the saxons near the river don he fixed his eye upon hengist and never quitted him till he took him prisoner and struck off his head  in the little isle of alney near this town the famous single combat was fought between edmund ironside and canute the dane for the whole kingdom in sight of both their armies  the city is governed by a mayor    aldermen and    commoncouncilmen it has also an highsteward who is usually a nobleman and a recorder they are allowed the highest marks of magistratical honor scarlet gowns the sword and cap of maintenance and   sergeants at mace here are    companies the masters whereof attend the mayor on all public occasions in their gowns and with streamers it has a large quay and wharf on the river for trade and a customhouse here is also a town hall for the assizes and public business which they call the boothhall and great part of the castle is still standing  the first protestant bishop of this church was that truly reverend and religious divine dr john hooper who was burnt to death in the cemetery of his own cathedral in the reign of queen mary  the whisperingplace in this cathedral formerly passed for a kind of wonder among the vulgar but since experience has taught the easilycomprehended reason of the thing and there is now the like in the church of st paul london  here is great provision for the poor by hospitals particularly bartholomews hospital maintains    men and women to whom belong a minister physician and surgeon and sir thomas rich bart a native of this place gave  000 l by will for a bluecoat hospital wherein are educated  0 poor boys and  0 poor men and  0 women are maintained and clothed annually besides these and three more there are many benefactions to encourage young tradesmen and place out boys apprentices and they have lately erected an infirmary here after the laudable example of that of winchester etc  at lassington near gloucester are found certain stones about the breadth of a silver penny and thickness of a halfcrown called astroites or starstones being finepointed like a star and flat they are of a greyish color and the flat sides are naturally finely engraven as it were but i have taken notice of these before  from gloucester we kept eastward and soon came to cheltenham a market town where is still a pretty good trade carried on in malt but not so considerable as formerly here is a good church in the form of a cross with ails on each side and a spire rising in the middle noted for a good ring of bells but what is more remarkable is that the minister is to be nominated by and must be a fellow of jesuscollege oxon though the vicarage is but  0 l a year but approved of by the earl of gainsborough and he cannot hold it more than six years here is a free school an hospital and some other charities  the mineral waters lately discovered at cheltenham which are of the scarborough kind are what will make this place still more and more remarkable and frequented an eminent physician has obliged me with the following account of their nature and qualities  these waters he observes were first found out by the flocks of all the neighboring pigeons going constantly thither to provoke their appetites as well as to quench the uncommon thirst of these salacious hot birds i have been informed says he by a physician of credit and experience who had made all the common trials on them and observed their effects on many persons of various constitutions and in different distempers who had drank them that on evaporation they were found to contain in a gallon eight drachms of a nitrous salt with two drachms of an alcalious earth that they were compounded of a large quantity of nitre to which they owed their purgative virtue a light sulphur which the fetid dejections manifested and a volatile steel discoverable by a transparent blue color when mixed with an infusion of nutgalls alcalious spirits have no effect on them but they ferment with acids he further adds that there might be found some other materials in their composition perhaps if more minutely examined and tortured but that these mentioned principles were evident and incontestable and were sufficient to account for all their effects and operation the others if there be any being of little efficacy in the operation they empty the bowels according to their dose but gently mildly and easily without sickness nausea gripes or causing great lowness far beyond any artificial purges whatsoever they give a good appetite an easy digestion and quiet nights in all nephritick and gouty cases when not under the fit in all rheumatick scrophulous scorbutic or leprous cases but especially in spermatic urinary or haemorrhoidal cases he thinks them sovereign and not to be matched in a word in all inflammatory cases of whatever kind and whatever part he thinks them one of the most salutary means which can be used those of pretty strong nerves and firm constitutions bear them with high spirits great pleasure and profit but they do not at all suit with those of weak nerves paralytick hypochondriack or hysteric disorders or those who are subject to any kind of fits cramps or convulsions they ruffle such too much as generally all purgatives do he thinks they have a great affinity to the scarborough waters and might do great cures in most chronical distempers if exercise and a proper regimen were directed with them  following the road toward warwick directly we arrived at winchcomb a small market town situate in a bottom in the midst of good pasture and arable lands but of no great account the church is a good building has two ails a large chancel and a lofty tower adorned with battlements and pinacles it is remarkable that it is a curacy worth no more than  0 l a year though the impropriation is worth  00 l annually here was formerly a very rich abbey whereof the abbot was mitred founded by offa king of mercia  here we turned from the road and struck nw to tewksbury encompassed with   rivers the avon and carran on the n the severn on the w and the swyliate on the s it is governed by   bailiffs and    burgesses and its neighborhood to cotswolddowns makes the clothing trade flourish here it is a large and very populous town situate upon the warwickshire river avon so called to distinguish it from the bristol avon and others the town was long famous for its mustardballs as also for a great manufacture of stockens as are also campden in this county and pershore in worcestershire  the great old church at tewksbury may be called one of the largest churches in england that is not collegiate or cathedral it is very high has two spacious ails a stately tower and a large chancel the communion table is one entire marble stone near    feet long and   and broad  the town is famous for the decisive battle fought between the houses of lancaster and york in the reign of king edward iv of the latter house who was conqueror  as tewksbury lies on the borders of worcestershire we soon entered that county and came to upton an ancient market town of some note upon the severn over which it has a good bridge roman coins are frequently dug up here  on the left westward of this town and which parts this county from that of hereford are malvern hills which consist of large mountains prodigiously high and lofty gradually rising one above another for about   miles together on these hills are two villages called great malvern and little malvern at the distance of about two miles from each other each having had formerly an abbey of benedictines the last lying in a dismal cavity between the hills on the very top of these hills may be seen the ruins of a prodigious ditch which gilbert earl of gloucester dug to separate his possessions from those of the church of hereford on these hills are   medicinal springs called holy wells one is good for the eyes and putrid fetid livers and the other for cancers  from upton we traveled northeast and came to pershore which lies on the lower london road to worcester it is said to be so called from the great number of pear trees which thrive plentifully here it is a pleasant market town lying on the avon and famous for the stocken trade as i have mentioned before  eastward of this town stands evesham situate on a gentle ascent from the same river over which it has a bridge of   stately arches it is an ancient mayortown and has the privilege to try felons it is memorable for the decisive battle wherein simon montfort and the barons were defeated by prince edward afterward king edward i who thereby released his father out of captivity here are   churches with small spire steeples but neither of them has any bells which have been removed to a famous tower built by abbot litchfield and stands near these churches  all around this town lies that fruitful and plentiful country called from this place the vale of evesham which runs all along the banks of the avon from tewksbury to pershore and to stratford upon avon in the south part of warwickshire which river is so far navigable  the parish church of stratford is very old in it we saw the monument of the inimitable shakespeare whose dramatick performances set him at the head of the british theater and will make him renowned to the end of time his busto is in the wall on the northside of the church and a flat gravestone covers the body in the ayle just under him on which gravestone these lines are written good friend for jesus sake forbear to move the dust that rests here blessed be the man that spares these stones and cursed be he that moves my bones   over the avon at stratford is built a fair stone bridge of    arches with a long causeway at the west end of it walled on both sides  the navigation of this river avon is an exceeding advantage to all this part of the country and also to the commerce of the city of bristol for by this river they drive a very great trade for sugar oil wine tobacco iron lead and in a word all heavy goods which are usually carried by water almost as far as warwick and in return the corn and especially cheese are carried back from gloucestershire and warwickshire to bristol for gloucester cheese is excellent of the kind and this county drives a great trade in it  this vale extending itself in warwickshire and under the ridge of little mountains called edgehill is there called the vale of redhorse all the grounds put together make a most pleasant corn country especially remarkable for the goodness of the air and fertility of the soil  not far from stretford on the borders of this county of worcester is alcester a market town much frequented by dealers in corn it is of great antiquity as appears by old foundations of buildings made of roman brick and gold silver and brass coins found here the old roman way called ikenildstreet passes through the town  gloucestershire must not be passed over without some account of another pleasant and fruitful vale which crosses part of the country from east to west on that side of the cotswold and which is called stroudwater famous not only for the finest cloths but for dying those cloths of the beautifulest scarlets and other grand colors that are anywhere in england perhaps in any part of the world here i saw two pieces of broadcloth made one scarlet the other crimson in grain which were sent as presents the one to the late king george whilst elector and the other to his present majesty which were very graciously accepted the cloth was valued at    s per yard and was well worth it for nothing so rich of that kind had been ever made in england before as i was informed  the clothiers lie all along the banks of this river for near  0 miles and in the town of stroud which lies in the middle of it as also at paynswick which i have mentioned before the river makes its way to the severn about five miles below gloucester  from tewksbury north it is    miles to worcester along the banks of the severn where i was wonderfully delighted with the hedgerows lined all the way with apple and pear trees full of fruit and those so common that any passengers as they travel the road may gather and eat what they please here also as well as in gloucestershire you meet with cider in the publickhouses sold as beer and ale is in other parts of england and as cheap  we saw at a distance in a most agreeable situation the seat of sir herbert perrot pakington a baronet of a very ancient family  on the other side of the severn at whitleycourt five miles from bewdly and seven from worcester the lord foley has a seat situate in a large park  worcester the branonium of the romans seems to have been built by them to curb the silures on the other side of the severn and in imitation of the roman name the britons called it caer wrangon it is situate in a valley on the severn which though generally rapid elsewhere glides on here very gently it is a large populous ancient well built city and the best paved in england the foregatestreet is the most regular and beautiful that can be seen out of london the guild hall is a very fine building but the statues on the outside disgrace it  there is a good old stone bridge over the severn which stands exceeding high from the surface of the water and has a tower upon it said to be built by the romans but as the stream of the severn is contracted here by the buildings on either side there is evident occasion sometimes for the height of the bridge the waters rising to an incredible degree in the wintertime  the commandery here formerly belonging to st johns of jerusalem is now possessed by mr wild and is a fine old house of timber in the form of a court the hall roofd with irish oak makes one side of it built for the reception of pilgrims the windows are adorned with imagery and coats armorial of stained glass it stands just without the south gate of the city in the london road where the heat of the famous battle happened between king charles ii and oliver cromwell and they frequently find bones of the slain on digging in the garden above in the park is to be seen a great work of four bastions called the royal mount whence a vallum and ditch run both ways to incompass this side of the city here it is probable the storm began when the royalists were driven back into the city with great slaughter and the king escaped being made a prisoner in the narrow street at this gate by a loaded cart of hay purposely overthrown which gave him time to retire at the opposite gate to boscobel or white ladys  a mile and half above the south gate on the top of the hall is the celebrated perrywood where cromwells army lay and which affords a fine prospect over the county  the cathedral is an ancient building the body of the church makes no extraordinary appearance on the outside the tower is low without any spire only four very small pinacles on the corners and yet it has some little beauty in it more than the church itself the upper part has some images in it but decayed by time in it is buried the restless king john not where now his monument stands which is in the choir before the high altar but under a little stone before the altar of the eastermost wall of the church on each side of him on the ground lie the effigies of the two bishops his chief saints wolston and oswald from whose neighborhood he hoped to be safe the image of the king probably lay here also upon the ground now elevated upon a tomb in the said choir  on the south side of the high altar is a large and handsome stone chapel over the monument of prince arthur eldest son of henry vii who died at ludlow as his tombstone specifies anno   0  and whose relict catharine infanta of spain his brother henry viii marrying after  0 years wedlock was divorced from to make way for anna bolen the choir of this chapel is exquisite workmanship but suffered much in the late civil wars  here is also among other noted monuments one for that famous countess of salisbury who dancing before edward iii in his great hall at windsor dropped her garter which the king taking up honored it so much as the idle story goes as to make it the denominating ensign of the most noble order of the garter but this i have refuted under my account of windsor though that the countess did drop her garter is fact and the king might gallantly to silence the jests and railleries of the court wear it during the entertainment instead of his garter of the order but the motto was given in allusion to the order of knighthood and not of the garter  the monument is very fine and there is this remarkable in it that there are several angels cut in stone about it strewing garters over the tomb  there are several other ancient monuments in this church which i have not room to mention  the cloisters are very perfect and the chapter house is large supported as to its arched roof by one umbilical pillar it is now become a library is well furnished and has many good ancient mss  there is a large old gatehouse standing and near it the castle with a very high artificial mount or keep nigh the river  the bridge i have mentioned has six arches and the banks of the severn look very beautiful on each side being enriched with pleasant meadows  this city is governed by a mayor and aldermen it has two chamberlains a recorder a town clerk two coroners a sword bearer four sergeants at mace and a sheriff being like gloucester a county of itself divided into seven wards in which are twelve parish churches  the inhabitants are generally esteemed rich being full of business occasioned chiefly by the cloathingtrade of which the city and the country round carries on a great share as well for the turkey as the home trade the number of hands which it imploys in this town and adjoinng villages in spinning carding rowing fulling weaving etc is almost incredible one part of the town is wholly possessed by welsh people who speak their own language and are employed in this manufacture so that this city which was formerly so great a grievance to the great ones of that principality now administers subsistence to a vast number of the meaner ones  it is adorned by a capacious and beautiful structure called the public workhouse in which children of both sexes are trained up to the knowledge of trade and the practice of religion and virtue by whose labor also the aged and decrepid are supported this laudable institution continued several years to the great benefit of the city till at last the guardians of it having contracted a debt of upwards of  00 l they returned the poor back to their respective parishes and the whole charity being frustrated and put an end to the corporation let out the building for a hopmarket warehouses etc to pay the incurred debt either principal or interest  hereupon their worthy representative samuel sandys esquire and other gentlemen procured an act of parliament for restoring it to its first laudable end which act took place from june    0 and will be a lasting monument to the honor of the disinterested and publickspirited gentleman to whose unwearied application and inflexible resolution it was owing for it must be observed that alienated charities are some of the hardest things in the world to be restored  opposite to this workhouse robert berkley of spetchley esquire erected a fine hospital for twelve poor men and gave  000 l to build it and  000 l to endow it  here are besides three grammarschools and seven almshouses all liberally endowed st nicolas church in this city has been lately rebuilt and is a neat and commodious edifice  and the church of all saints in this town being in so ruinous a condition that part of it actually fell down and the rest being ready to fall an act passed sess       for taking down and rebuilding the same  from worcester i made some excursions to visit the towns and country northward and first came to droitwych a corporate bailiwicktown which has four churches and is pretty wealthy it is famous for excellent white salt which is made here from the summer to the winter solstice no but they may make salt all the year long but they fear to overstock the market it appears by doomsdaybook they made salt here before the conquest the salt springs are very good and productive of plenty of brine and the town lies on the river salwarp  proceeding directly on in the road we arrived at broomsgrove a large bailiwicktown likewise on the river salwarp where the clothingtrade is pretty briskly carried on it is the center of four roads one leads to coventry and leicester another to warwick and so to london a third to worcester and the fourth to shrewsbury  between worcester and spetchley was st oswalds hospital demolished in the reign of queen elizabeth but dr fell bishop of oxford after the restoration recovered much of the possessions and erected a fair and large hospital which comfortably maintains twelve poor men  kidderminster is a town in this county of worcester very considerable for its woollen trade particularly the weaving of what they call lindseywoolsey in which the inhabitants are almost wholly employed it is a large but yet compact and populous town situated on the stour and governed by a bailiff twelve capital burgesses twentyfive commoncouncilmen etc in its church is a crossleggd monument of sir thomas acton  stourbridge is also situate upon the river stour over which it has a very good bridge whence its name this town deals greatly in glass manufacture of all sorts and also in iron works of all sorts and is vastly improved of late years both in houses and inhabitants at swinford near stourbridge is a noble hospital for sixty boys erected by the first founder of the noble family of foley which deserves the attention of a traveller and the praise of all men at stourbridge also fine stone pots are made for glassmakers to melt their metal in also crucibles etc the clay of which these things are made being almost peculiar to the place  birmingham is a very populous town and full of iron manufactories especially of the smaller sorts in which the inhabitants so greatly excel that their works are carried to all parts of the world in great quantities the town is of late years greatly improved and enlarged by many new buildings both public and private particularly a new church built by virtue of an act of parliament passed in the  th of queen anne which is dedicated to st philip this town is in warwickshire on the borders of this county situated on the side of a hill and has a most plentiful market  a little below worcester westward the severn receives a river of a long deep course which comes from shropshire called the teme on which stands a small market town called tenbury but of little note i passed this river formerly in my way to ludlow at broadway a little village but now i went by the way of bewdley on the side of shropshire  in this course we saw two fine seats not very far from the severn viz the lord foleys and the earl of bradfords as we did before a most delicious house belonging to the lord conway indeed this part of the county and all the county of salop is filled with fine seats of the nobility and gentry which we have not room to describe  bewdley or beaulieu i e fine place said to be so called from its pleasant and delightful situation upon the side of a hill declining to the severn is a small bailiff market town well supplied with corn malt leather and caps which the dutch seamen buy called monmouth caps and noted for the palace which king henry vii built here for his son prince arthur called tickenhall it had a very fine park about it which with the house was destroyed by the furious enthusiasts in the civil war  a mile off is ribsford the seat of lord herbert of cherbury pleasantly surrounded with woods here is a good picture of william the first earl of pembroke  the ends of the hills toward the river are generally rocks and blackstonhill has an hermitage cut out of it with a chapel and several apartments near it is a pretty rock upon the edge of the water covered with oaks and many curious plants  not far from cherbury park is the parish of roch where the famous augustines oak stood so called from a conference held under it by augustine and the british bishops about the celebration of easter and preaching gods word and administering baptism after the rites of the church of rome which the british bishops refused  i thought once to have returned to worcester and so proceeded to herefordshire and down to monmouth and so round the coast of wales but being desirous to take in first the south part of shropshire i followed the severn up north and came to bridgenorth a very ancient and noted town said to be built by queen aethelfleda in the time of the heptarchy it consists of two towns the high and the low which are separated by the severn but united by a fair stone bridge of seven arches which has a gate and gate house the situation is pleasant the air healthy the prospect delightful and commodious for trade it has been fortified with walls and a castle which are now in ruins and the area in the last is converted to a fine bowlinggreen the streets are many and well paved it is governed by a bailiff twentyfour aldermen and other inferior officers it is noted for good gunmakers and its stocken manufacture it has a wellreplenished market and five fairs annually two whereof hold three days which are much resorted to and abound with horses black cattle sheep butter cheese bacon linen cloth and hops in great plenty here are two churches and though the parishes are large and the town very populous are very indifferently endowed and so is the free school there is a hollow way cut through the rock leading from the high town to the bridge of the depth of  0 feet in some parts of it and likewise many vaults and dwellings are hewn out of the rock  from hence we advanced in the direct road to shrewsbury and came to great wenlock an ancient incorporated town governed by a bailiff and burgesses but noted for nothing extraordinary  leaving shrewsbury for my observation at my return from wales through cheshire we turned short here and fell down southward to ludlow famed more for its beauty than antiquity for it seems the castle which was so truly magnificent was built by roger de montgomery in the conquerors time  but before i speak more of this castle i shall observe that on the extremity of this county in a kind of promontory which runs in between montgomeryshire and radnorshire upon the clun lies  bishops castle a small market bailiwick town and not very far from it just at the entrance into montgomeryshire is a noted place called bishopsott where is an acre of ground surrounded with an intrenchment the clun meets the teme at ludlow and both united run to clebury a small town on the borders of worcestershire where it falls as i mentioned before into the severn  the castle of ludlow shows plainly in its decay what it was in its flourishing estate it is the palace of the prince of wales in right of his principality  its situation is indeed most beautiful there is a most spacious plain or lawn in its front which formerly continued near two miles but much of it is now enclosed the country round it is exceeding pleasant fertile populous and the soil rich nothing can be added by nature to make it a place fit for a royal palace it is built in the northwest angle of the town upon a rock commanding a delightful prospect northward and on the west is shaded by a lofty hill and washed by the river the battlements are of great height and thickness with towers at convenient distances that half which is within the walls of the town is secured with a deep ditch the other is founded on a solid rock a chapel here has abundance of coats of arms upon the panels as has the hall together with lances spears firelocks and old armor  it will be no wonder that this noble castle is in the very perfection of decay when we acquaint our readers that the present inhabitants live upon the sale of the ancient materials all the fine courts the royal apartments halls and rooms of state lie open abandoned and some of them falling down for since the courts of the president and marches are taken away here is nothing that requires the attendance of any public people so that time the great devourer of the works of men begins to eat into the very stone walls and to spread the face of ruin upon the whole fabric over several of the stabledoors are the arms of queen elizabeth the earls of pembroke etc  the town of ludlow is likewise fortified with walls through which are seven gates it is well built and a place of good trade but to be sure it is not the better for the ruinous state of the castle and the abolishing of the court held there for the marches it stands on the edge of the two counties shropshire and worcestershire but is itself in the first  on the south side of the town runs the teme over which is a good bridge the river has several dams across it in the nature of cataracts whereby abundance of mills are turned and great is the roar of the superfluous waters  ludlow has a very good church with an handsome tower and a pleasant ring of six bells the windows are full of painted glass pretty entire  there are some old monuments of the lords presidents etc and an inscription upon the north wall of the choir relating to prince arthur elder brother to king henry viii who died here and in this spot his bowels were deposited it is said that his heart was taken up some time ago in a leaden box  in the eastern angle of the choir is a closet anciently called the godhouse where the priests secured their consecrated utensils the window is strongly barred on the outside the church is dedicated to st laurence and in the marketplace is a cistern or conduit on the top of which is a long stone cross bearing a niche in which is the image of that saint  west of the church was a college now converted to a private house there was a rich priory out of the town on the north side of which are but few ruins to be seen except a small church which formerly belonged to it the welsh call this town lie twysoy i e the princes court mr camden calls the river teme the temd and another river which joins it just at this town the corve whence the rich flat country below the town is called corvesdale it is governed by two bailiffs twelve aldermen a recorder twentyfive commoncouncilmen and other inferior officers and has the particular privilege of trying and executing criminals it has an almshouse for  0 poor people  king henry viii established here the court of the president and council of the marches beforementioned and all causes of nisi prius or of civil right were tried here before the lord president and council but this court being grown a great grievance to the public was entirely taken away by act of parliament in the first year of king william and queen mary  from ludlow we took our course still due south to lemster or leominster a large market town on the river lug over which it has several bridges it is governed by a bailiff the church which is very large has been in a manner rebuilt and is now very beautiful this town is noted for its fine wool and the best wheat and consequently the finest bread and also for the best barley whence lemster bread and weobly ale are become a proverbial saying  it is a town of brisk trade in wool hatmaking leather etc and lies in a valley exceedingly luxuriant three rivers of a very swift current go through the town besides others very near the inhabitants make great use of these by mills and other machinery in the various branches of their trade on the northside of the church was a considerable priory two ails of which belong now to the church and two others of more lightsome work have been added the mayor has a long black rod to walk with tipped with silver there are some poor remains of the priory chiefly a little chapel which probably belonged to the priors family underneath it runs a pretty rivulet which used to grind his corn now converted to a fullingmill near it are very large ponds for fish which used to furnish the monks on fasting days there was a fine gate house pulled down not long ago near the ambry or almery close where they gave their scraps away to the poor  pembridge weobly and kyneton lie southwest of lemster and form in their situation a kind of triangle they are all market towns and the first is pretty considerable for the clothing trade the second for ale but the third for nothing that i know of  the county on our right as we came from ludlow is very fruitful and pleasant and is called the hundred of wigmore from which the earl of oxford takes the title of baron here we saw the two ancient castles of brampton brian and wigmore both belonging to the late earls grandfather sir edward harley brampton is a stately pile but not kept in full repair the parks are fine and full of large timber  we were now on the borders of wales properly so called for from the windows of bramptoncastle you have a fair prospect into the county of radnor which is as it were under its walls nay even this whole county of hereford was a part of wales and so deemed for many ages the people of this county too boast that they were a part of the ancient silures who for so many ages withstood the roman arms and could never be entirely conquered they are a diligent and laborious people chiefly addicted to husbandry and they boast that they have the finest wool the best hops and the richest cider in all britain and possibly with some reason for the wool about leominster and in the hundred of wigmore and the golden vale as it is called for its richness on the banks of the river dove all in this county is as fine as any in england the southdown wool not excepted as for hops they plant abundance all over this county and they are very good and for cider it is the common drink of the county and is so very good and so cheap that we never found fault though we could get no other drink for twenty miles together great quantities of this cider are sent to london even by landcarriage though so very remote which is an evidence in its favor beyond contradiction  one would hardly expect so pleasant and fruitful a country as this so near the barren mountains of wales but it is certain that not any of our southern counties the neighborhood of london excepted come up to the fertility of this county  from lemster it is ten miles to hereford the chief city not of this county only but of all the counties west of the severn in the time of the late civil wars it was very strong and being well fortified and as well defended supported a tedious and very severe siege for besides the parliaments forces who could never reduce it the scots army was called to the work who lay before it till they laid above  000 of their bones there and at last it was rather surrendered by the fatal issue of the war than by the attack of the besiegers  it had before this six parishchurches but two of them were demolished at that time it has an hospital liberally endowed for    poor people  the city of hereford probably sprung from the ruins of the roman ariconium now kenchester three miles off higher up the river wye but not very near it which may be a reason for its decay  kenchester stands upon a little brook called the ine which thence encompassing the walls of hereford falls into the wye  archenfield seems to retain the name of ariconium nothing remains of its splendour but a piece of a temple probably with a nich which is five feet high and three broad within built of brick stone and indissoluble mortar there are many large foundations near it a very fine mosaic floor a few years ago was found entire which was soon torn to pieces by the ignorant country people a bath was here found by sir john hoskyns about seven feet square the pipes of lead entire those of brick were a foot long three inches square let artificially into one another over these i suppose was a pavement  this as dr stukeley observes is an excellent invention for heating a room and might well be introduced among us in wintertime  in another place is a hollow where burnt wheat has been taken up all around the city you may easily trace the walls some stones being left everywhere though overgrown by hedges and timbertrees the situation of the place is a gentle eminence of a squarish form the earth black and rich overgrown with brambles oaktrees full of stones foundations and cavities where they have been digging and found many coins etc colonel dantsey has paved a cellar with square bricks dug up here the earl of coningsby has adorned the floor of his evidenceroom with them  this city is overlooked and sheltered toward the north with a prodigious mountain of steep ascent on the top stands a vast camp with works altogeter inaccessible which is called credonhill at the summit you are presented with the most glorious and extensive prospect as far as st michaels mount in monmouthshire crowned with two tops and of considerable resort among zealots of the romish persuasion who believe this holy hill was sent hither by st patrick out of ireland and that it works wonders in several cases  on the other side is the vast black mountain which separates brecknockshire from this county the town underneath appears like a little copse dinderhill whereon is a roman camp stands on the contrary bank of the wye  and upon the lug are suttonwalls another vast roman camp upon a hill overlooking a beautiful vale which was the regal residence of the powerful king offa but chiefly remarkable for the murder of young king ethelbert whom he allured thither under pretext of courting his daughter and who was buried in the neighboring church of marden situate in a marsh by the riverside hence his body was afterward conveyed to hereford and enshrined but the particular place cannot be found  in the north wing of the cathedral of hereford is the shrine where the body of cantilupe the great miraclemonger in the west of england was deposited which wing was built by himself and on the wall his picture is painted all round are the marks of hooks where the banners lamps relics and the like presents were hung up and the riches of this place were doubtless very considerable for it is well guarded against the assaults of thieves the shrine is of stone carved round with knights in armor  the church is very old and stately the spire is not high but handsome and there is a fine tower at the west end the roof ails and chapel have been added to the more ancient part by successive bishops as also the towers cloisters etc the choir though plain is handsome and there is a very good organ  the chapter house which was very beautiful was destroyed in the civil wars about four windows are left standing and the springing of the stone arches between are of fine ribwork which composed the roof of that sort of architecture wherewith kingscollegechapel was built two windows were pulled down by bishop bisse which he used in new fitting up the episcopal palace under the windows in every compartiment was painted a king bishop saint virgin or the like some of which were distinct enough though so long exposed to the weather  here are a great number of monuments of bishops and many valuable brasses and tombs  between the cathedral and palace is a most venerable pile built and roofd with stone consisting of two chapels one above the other the upper dedicated to st magdalen the lower which is some steps underground to st catharine  the castle was a noble work built by one of the edwards before the conquest strongly walled and ditchd there is a very lofty artificial keep having a well faced with good stone and by the side of the ditch a spring consecrated to st ethelbert with an old stone arch  without the walls are the ruins of blackfriars monastery and a pretty stone cross entire round which the cloisters were originally built as now the cloisters of the cathedral enclose another such these crosses were in the nature of a pulpit whence a monk preached to the people in the open air as now practiced in the cloisters of some colleges in the universities once a year  the neighboring hill called dynmaur or the great hill makes amends for the tediousness of climbing it by the pleasure we receive from its woody crest and extensive prospect  at the city of hereford we could not but inquire into the truth of the story so famous that the right reverend bishop gibson has mentioned it in his continuation of camden of the removing the two great stones near sutton which the people confirmed to us the story is thus  between sutton and hereford in a common meadow called the wergins were placed two large stones for a watermark one erected upright and the other laid athwart in the late civil wars about the year      they removed to about twelvescore paces distance and nobody knew how which gave occasion to a vulgar notion that they were carried thither by the devil when they were set in their places again one of them required nine yoke of oxen to draw it  lidbury lies eastward of hereford near the south end of the malvern hills it is a fine well built market town situate in rich clayey grounds and much inhabited by clothiers here is an hospital for the poor well endowed  not far from lidbury is colwal near which upon the waste as a countryman was digging a ditch about his cottage he found a crown or a coronet of gold with gems set deep in it it was of a size large enough to be drawn over the arm with the sleeve the stones of it are said to have been so valuable as to be sold by a jeweller for one thousand five hundred pounds  hereford though a large and populous city may yet be said to be old meanbuilt and very dirty lying low and on the bank of the wye which sometimes incommodes them very much by the violent freshes that come down from the mountains of wales for all the rivers of this county except the diffrindoe come out of wales  one thing remarkable which we must not omit is that the college still retains its foundation laws and the residentiaries are obliged to celibacy but otherwise they live a very happy easy and plentiful life being furnished upon the foot of the foundation besides their ecclesiastical stipends  in the beginning of the year      they began to pull down the old gothic chapel belonging to the bishops palace at hereford in order to erect a pile in a politer taste for the public service the demolished chapel was said to be as old as the conquest  between leominster and this city is another hampton court the seat of the late earl of coningsby that lord was from an irish peer made an english one by his late majesty king george i and having no son his daughter was created by the same prince in the lifetime of her father baroness and viscountess coningsby of hampton court in order that her descendants might be entitled to a peerage she married sir michael newton bart and knight of the bath this is a fine seat built by henry bolinbroke duke of lancaster afterward king henry iv in the form of a castle situate in a valley upon a rapid river under coverture of dynmaur the gardens are very pleasant terminated by vast woods covering all the sloping side of the hill there is a plentiful supply of water on all sides of the house for fountains basins and canals within are excellent pictures of the earls ancestors and others by holben dobson vandyke sir p lully etc an original of the founder king henry iv of queen elizabeth the duchess of portsmouth etc  the windows of the chapel are well painted there are some statues of the coningsbies  here are two new stone staircases after a geometrical method the recordroom is attop of a tower arched with stone paved with roman brick and has an iron door from the top of the house goes a staircase which they say has a subterraneous conveyance into dynmaur wood  the park is very fine eight miles in circumference and contains about   00 head of deer there are extensive prospects on one side reaching into wiltshire on the other over the welsh mountains lawns groves canals hills and plains there is a pool three quarters of a mile long very broad and included between two great woods the dam which forms it and is made over a valley cost  00 l and was finished in a fortnight by  00 hands a new river is cut quite through the park the chanel of which for a long way together is hewn out of the rock this serves to enrich vast tracts of lands which before were barren here also are new gardens and canals laid out and new plantations of timber in proper places  warrens decoys sheepwalks pastures for cattle etc supply the house with all sorts of conveniences and necessaries without having recourse to a market  westward of hereford the golden vale beforementioned extends itself along the river door which runs through the midst of it and is called by the britons duffrin door it is called the golden vale from its pleasant fertility in the spring when it is covered over with a yellow livery of flowers it is encompassed with hills which are crowned with woods  from hereford keeping the bank of wye as near as we could we came to ross a good old town famous for cider a great manufacture of ironware and its trade on the river wye  from hence we came at about eight miles more into monmouthshire formerly a welsh but now an english county and to the town of monmouth it is a place of great antiquity and is fair large and well built situate at the conflux of the wye and munnow whence the town has its name it stands in the angle where the rivers join and has a bridge over each river and a third over the river trothy which comes in just below the other  this town shows marks of great antiquity and by the remains of walls lines curtains and bastions that it has been very strong and by its situation that it may be made so again it is a boroughtown governed by two bailiffs commoncouncilmen and town clerk it has a very considerable cornmarket it was famed for the strength of the castle in the time of william i and is the birthplace of our renowned king henry v conqueror of france and likewise of one of our ancient historians jeoffry of monmouth a fabulous writer at present it is not very flourishing yet it drives a considerable trade with the city of bristol by the navigation of the wye  this river having received two large streams the munnow and the trother becomes a very noble river and with a deep chanel and a full current hurries away toward the sea carrying also vessels of a considerable burden hereabouts  near monmouth the duke of beaufort has a fine seat called troyhouse  lower down upon the wye in this shire stands chepstow the seaport for all the towns seated on this river and the lug and where their commerce seems to center hither ships of good burden may come up and the tide runs with the same impetuous current as at bristol the flood rising ordinarily from six fathom to six and a half at chepstow bridge which is a noble one indeed built of timber and no less than  0 feet high from the surface of the water when the tide is out and that this was not a needless height was evident in january      when the water rose at the bridge upwards of  0 feet and very much damaged it one man lost above   0 head of cattle which with other damages it did there and in the adjacent places were computed at   or  000 l chepstow has a well frequented market especially for corn the bridge as half of it is in gloucestershire is maintained at the expense of both counties  two miles from this town is the famous passage over the severn on this side called bleachly and on the other aust as i have mentioned before here offas dyke begins and passing through radnorshire extends itself up to flintshire and so to the river dee which parts wales from cheshire  we turned northwards and arrived at abergavenny which is a large well built and wellinhabited market town situate at the mouth of the gavenny running into the usk it carries on a considerable trade in flanels which the country people manufacture at home and bring hither to sell it is a great thoroughfare from the western parts of wales to bristol and bath by chepstow and to gloucester by monmouth and so crossing the river through colford and the forest of dean  the fuel in this county is pitcoal and is very cheap insomuch that they sell a horseload for twopence at the pitmouth and it is common in the meanest cot to see a good fire  great quantities of corn are exported out of this county and it is frequent that the bristol merchants send their ships hither to load for portugal and other foreign countries and indeed it is noted for producing as good wheat and other grain as any county in the kingdom and yet it is very surpriseing that lands here never sell for more than  0 or    years purchase the current language of the county is welsh among the vulgar but the gentlemen speak english generally  as i am now just upon entering wales i will conclude this letter with assuring you that i am  sir yours etc  letter vi containing a description of the greatest part of the principality of wales sir i thought i should not pay the principality the respect it so well deserves if i did not begin a letter with the description of it it being the country of that brave people who had an original right to the whole island and made so noble a stand in defense of their liberties and independency and at last rather than submit to a foreign yoke chose to be free in this remote and inaccessible part of it  the two first counties which border west upon monmouthshire are brecknock and glamorgan and are very mountainous on the east side which gives a traveller a terrible apprehension of the country he is this way entering into and an expectation of meeting with nothing that is agreeable but he is not long before he is undeceived and finds the reward of his trouble in that part of monmouthshire which joins the two counties begins the rising of the hills kyrtonbeacon tumberlow blorench penvail and skirridan are some of the names of these horrid mountains and are all in this shire and i could not but fansy myself in view of mount brennus littlebarnard and greatbarnard among the alps  we now entered south wales which contains the shires of glamorgan brecknock radnor caermarthen pembroke and cardigan  brecknockshire is a mere inland county as radnor is the english jestingly and i think not very improperly call it breakneckshire it is mountainous to an extremity except on the side of radnor where it is something more low and level it is well watered by the wye and the uske two rivers mentioned before upon the latter stands the town of brecknock the capital of the county well built and the assizes are kept at it it is very ancient and indeed to mention it here once for all there are more tokens of antiquity to be seen everywhere in wales than in any particular part of england except the counties of cumberland and northumberland here we saw brecknockmere a large or long lake of water two or three miles over of which they have a great many fables not worth relating the best of them is that a certain river called the lheweni runs through it and keeps its color in midchanel distinguished from the water of the lake and as they say never mingles with it they take abundance of good fish in this lake so that like the river theisse in hungary they say it is twothirds water and onethird fish the country people affirm that once a city stood here but that by the judgment of heaven for the sins of its inhabitants it sunk into the earth and the water rose up in the place of it i observe the same story is mentioned by mr camden with some difference in the particulars i believe my share of it but it is remarkable that mr camden having lost the old city loventium mentioned by ptolemy to be hereabouts is willing to account for it by this odd story  it was among the mountains of this county that the famous glendower sheltered himself and taking arms on the deposing richard ii proclaimed himself prince of wales they show us several little refuges of his in the mountains whither he retreated and from whence again he made such bold excursions into england as to have put henry iv to very great difficulties  though this county be so mountainous provisions are exceeding plentiful and also very good all over the country nor are these mountains useless even to the city of london as i have noted of other counties for from hence they send yearly great herds of black cattle to england and which are known to fill our fairs and markets even that of smithfield itself  the yellow mountains of radnorshire are the same and their product of cattle is the same nor did i meet with any thing worth noticing except monuments of antiquity the stories of vortigern and roger of mortimer are in every old womans mouth here there is here a great cataract or waterfall of the river wye at a place called rhajadr gwy in welsh which signifies the cataract or waterfall of the wye but we did not go to see it by reason there was a great flood out at that time which made the way dangerous there seemed to us a kind of desert too on that side which is scarce passable by strangers so we made it our north boundary for this part of our journey  we shall only add that radnor is the shire town and has a castle that presteigne in radnorshire is a well built town and the assizes are held there  entering glamorganshire from radnor and brecknock we beheld monuchdennyhill on our left and the black mountains on the right and all a ridge of horrid rocks and precipices between over which if we had not had good guides we should never have found our way and indeed we began to repent our curiosity in going out of the common road as not having met with any thing worth the trouble and the country looking so full of horror we thought to have given over the enterprise and have left wales out of our circuit but after a day and a night engaging thus with rocks and mountains our guide brought us down into a most agreeable vale opening to the south and a pleasant river running through it called the taaffe and following its course we came in the evening to the ancient city of landaff and town of caerdiff standing almost together  landaff in glamorganshire is the seat of the episcopal see and a city but so small that it has not a market but caerdiff which is lower on the river is the port and town of trade and has a very good harbor opening into the severn sea about four miles below the town  the cathedral is a neat building and very ancient they boast that this church was a house of religious worship many years before any other was founded in the island and that the christian religion flourished in its primitive purity from the year     till the pelagian heresy overspread this country which being afterward rooted out they placed st dobricius as the first bishop in this town of landaff then called launtn the bishop of landaff had formerly the title of archbishop the three first bishops were afterward sainted for their eminent holiness of life and the miracles they are said to have wrought it is observable the cathedral was anciently but  0 foot long and  0 broad and had neither steeple nor bells nor had they any other cathedral from the year     to the year   0  when bishop urban built the present church with some houses for the clergy adjoining in the nature of a cloister  though the church is ancient yet the building is good and the choir neat and pretty well kept  the south part of glamorganshire is pleasant agreeable and very populous insomuch that it is called the garden of wales its soil is fertile and rich and the low grounds are so well covered with grass and stocked with cattle that they supply the city of bristol with butter in very great quantities salted and barreld up just as suffolk does the city of london  caerphylicastle in glamorganshire is one of the noblest pieces of ruins in the whole island it was larger than any castle in england that of windsor excepted and from what remains of it was as beautiful in its architecture as it is remarkable in its ruins  neath is a port where the coaltrade is pretty considerable though it stands up within land  swanzy is also a seaport and a very considerable town for trade with a very good harbor here is also a very great trade for coals and culm which they export to all the ports of somerset devon and cornwall and even to ireland so that sometimes may be seen a hundred sail of ships at a time loading coals here which greatly enriches the country and particularly this town it stands on the river twye or taw it is very remarkable that most of the rivers in this county chime upon the letters t and y as taaf tawy tuy towy tyevy  there are lately mineral waters found out at swanzy which are reported to be of great efficacy in fluxes and haemorrhages of all sorts consumptions if not too far gone diabetes palsies rheumatisms dropsies and other distempers are said to fall before these styptick and restorative waters they may certainly have very good effects in many difficult cases but it is doing an injury to the reputation of any medicine in the world to make it a catholicon and good for every thing  kynfigcastle is now the seat and estate of the lord mansel who has here also a very noble income from the collieries which formerly denominated sir edward mansel one of the richest commoners in wales the family was innobled by her late majesty queen anne  in this neighborhood near margan mynydd we saw the famous monument mentioned by mr camden on a hill with the inscription which the vulgar are so terrified at that nobody cares to read it for they have a tradition from father to son that whoever ventures to read it will die within a month we did not scruple the adventure but when we came to try the letters were so defaced by time that we were effectually secured from the danger the inscription not being any thing near so legible as it seems it was in mr camdens time  the stone pillar is about   or   feet high and one foot thick standing on the top of this hill there are several other such monuments in radnorshire and other counties in wales as likewise in scotland  having thus touched on what is most curious on this coast we passed through the land of gowre and going still west we came to caermarthen or kaervyrdhin as the welsh call it the capital of the county of kaermardhinshire  this is an ancient and a very handsome town pleasantly situated on the river towy which is navigable up to the town for vessels of a moderate burden and over which is a large bridge the town is well built and populous it is lately much increased and is still increasing and the county round it is the most fruitful of any part of wales and continues to be so through all the middle of the county and a great way into the next nor is this county so mountainous and wild as the rest of this part of wales but it abounds in corn and in fine flourishing meadows as good as most are in britain and in which are fed a very great number of good cattle  the chancery and exchequer for the south part of the principality were usually kept at this town till the jurisdiction of the court and marches of wales was taken away this town was also famous for the birth of the old british prophet merlin of whom so many things are fabled and who flourished in the year   0 and here also the old britons often kept their parliaments or assemblies of their wise men and made their laws the town was fortified in former times but the walls are not to be seen now and scarcely the ruins of them the people in this town and country are reckoned the wealthiest and politest in wales  here we saw near kilymaen llwyd on a great mountain a circle of mighty stones very much like stonehenge in wiltshire or rather like the rollrich stones in oxfordshire and though the people call it bruarth arthur or king arthurs throne we see no reason to believe that it had any relation to him  the next county west is pembrokeshire the most extreme part of wales on this side it is a rich fertile and plentiful country lying on the seacoast where it has the benefit of milfordhaven one of the greatest and best ports in britain mr camden says it contains    creeks   great bays and    good roads for shipping all distinguished as such by their names and some say a thousand sail of ships may ride in it  part of pembrokeshire is inhabited by the descendants of the flemings placed there by king henry i and that county is called little england beyond wales  before we quitted the coast we saw tenbigk the most agreeable town on all the seacoast of south wales except pembroke being a very good road for shipping and well frequented here is a great fishery for herring in its season a great colliery or rather export of coals and they also drive a very considerable trade to ireland  from hence the land bearing far into the sea makes a promontory called st govenshead or point but as we found nothing of moment there we crossed over the isthmus to pembroke which stands on the east shore of the great haven of milford  this is the largest and richest and at this time the most flourishing town of south wales except carmarthen here are a great many gentlemen and merchants and some of the latter are men of good business and they told us there were near  00 sail of ships belonged to the town small and great in a word all this part of wales is a rich and flourishing country very pleasant fertile and well cultivated  this is the place also made particularly famous for the landing of king henry vii then earl of richmond  from hence being resolved to see the utmost extent of the county west we ferryd over the haven and went to haverford by some called haverfordwest a county in itself and from thence to st davids haverford is a good town strong well built clean and populous  from hence to st davids the country begins to look dry barren and mountainous  st davids is now a bishops see only but was formerly an archbishops which was transferred to dole in britany where it still remains  the venerable aspect of this cathedral church shows that it has been a beautiful building the west end or body of the church is tolerable the choir is kept neat the south isle without the choir and the virgin marys chapel which makes the eastend of the church are in a manner demolished and the roofs of both fallen in  there have been a great many eminent persons buried here besides such whose monuments are defaced by time here is st davids monument to whom the church is dedicated the monument of the earl of richmond as also of the famous owen tudor here are also four ancient monuments of knightstemplars known by their figures lying crossleggd but their names are not known and there are six several monuments of bishops who presided over this church besides st david  this saint they tell us was uncle to king arthur that he lived to     years of age that he was bishop of this church sixtyfive years being born in the year     and died anno     that he built twelve monasteries and performed abundance of miracles  there was a very handsome house for the bishop with a college all built in a close by themselves but they are now in ruins  here the weather being very clear we had a full view of ireland though at a very great distance the land here is called st davidshead they reckon up     bishops of this see since it began to the year    0  a late bishop of this see was dr thomas watson of whom the world has heard so much being deprived after a long debate on a charge of simony i shall not inquire into the merits of the case but he bestowed great sums on charitable designs  from hence we turned north keeping the sea in our west prospect and a rugged mountainous country on the east where the hills even darkened the air with their height as we went on we past by newport on the river nevern a town having a good harbor and consequently a good trade with ireland  here we left pembrokeshire and after about    miles came to cardigan a wellinhabited town on the river tyvy over which it has a fair stone bridge it is a very noble river indeed and famous for its plenty of the best and largest salmon in britain  the country people told us that they had formerly beavers here which bred in the lakes among the mountains and coming down the stream of tyvy destroyed the young frye of salmon and therefore the country people destroyed em we thought they only meant the otter till i found afterward that mr camden mentions also that there had been beavers seen here formerly  this town of cardigan was once possessed by the great robert fitzstephen who was the first briton that ever attempted the conquest of ireland and had such success with a handful of men as afterward gave the english a footing there which they never quitted afterward till they quite reduced the country and made it as it were a province to england  the town is large and populous has a fair church and is walled about and fortified with a castle but that part is now not much minded it has a good trade with ireland and is enriched very much as is all this part of the country by the famous lead mines formerly discovered by sir carbery price which are the greatest and perhaps the richest in england and particularly as they require so little labor and charge to come at the ore which in many places lies within a fathom or two of the surface and in some even bare to the very top there are also silver mines in this county  going north from the tyvy about    miles we came to aberystwith that is to say the town at the mouth of the river ystwith it is a populous but a dark smoaky place and we fansyd the people looked as if they had lived continually in coal or lead mines however they are rich  the county of cardigan is in no wise comparable to either of those welsh counties which we have already passed through there being a great deal of barren lands in it however it is so full of cattle that it is said to be the nursery or breedingplace for the whole kingdom of england south by trent but this is not a proof of its fertility for though the feeding of cattle indeed requires a rich soil the breeding them does not the mountains and moors being as proper for that purpose as richer land  now we entered north wales only i should add that as we passed we had a sight of the famous plymlymonhill out of the east side of which rise the severn and the wye and out of the west side of it rise the rydall and the ystwyth this mountain is exceeding high and though it is hard to say which is the highest hill in wales yet i think this bids fair for it nor is the county for  0 miles round it any thing but a continued ridge of mountains so that for a few days we seemed to be conversing in the upper regions for we were often above the clouds a great way and the names of some of these hills seemed as barbarous to us who spoke no welsh as the hills themselves  passing these mountains north we entered north wales which contains the counties of montgomery merioneth caernarvon denbeigh and flint shires and the isle of anglesea  in passing montgomeryshire we were so tired with hills and mountains that we wished heartily we had kept close to the sea shore but we had not much mended the matter if we had as i understood afterward the river severn is the principal beauty of this county which rising out of the plymlymon mountain as i have said receives in a short course so many other rivers into its bosom that it becomes navigable before it gets out of the county at welshpool on the edge of shropshire  montgomery is a fashionable place and has many fair dwellings in it and some very good families  the vales and meadows upon the banks of the severn are exceedingly ornamental and profitable and it is said that the water of the severn like that of nile when it overflows impregnates the valleys by the slime it leaves behind it all the country is very fruitful wherever this river runs the town of montgomery lies not far from this river on the outer edge of the county next to herefordshire this was it seems a great frontier town in the wars between the english and the welsh and was beautified and fortified by king henry iii but it is not now so very considerable though a good town still pleasantly situated and has a castle  this county has been long noted for an excellent breed of welsh horses which though not very large are exceeding valuable and much esteemed all over england all the north and west part of the county is mountainous and stony we saw a great many old monuments in this country and roman camps wherever we came and especially if we met any persons curious in such things we found they had many roman coins  merionethshire or merionydshire lies west from montgomeryshire on the irish sea or rather the ocean for st georges chanel does not begin till further north and it is extended on the coast for near    miles in length all still mountainous and craggy the principal river is the tovy which rises among the unpassable mountains which range along the center of this part of wales and which we look at with astonishment for their prodigious height some of the hills have particular names but otherwise we called them all the black mountains and they well deserve the name some think it is from the unpassable mountains of this county that we have an old saying that the devil lives in the middle of wales though i know there is another meaning given to it in a word mr camden calls these parts the alps of wales  there are but few large towns in all this part nor is it very populous much of it being scarce habitable but it is said there are more sheep in it than in all the rest of wales on the sea shore however we saw harleigh or harlechcastle which is still a garrison and kept for the guard of the coast but it is of no other strength than what its situation gives it  in the middle of these vast mountains and forming a very large lake viz near its first sources rises the river dee of which i shall speak again in its proper place  here among almost innumerable summits and rising peaks of nameless hills we saw the famous kaderidricks which some are of opinion is the highest mountain in britain another called rarauvaur another called mowywynda and still every hill we saw we thought higher than all that ever we saw before  we inquired here after that strange phenomenon which was not only seen but fatally experienced by the country round this place namely of a livid fire coming off from the sea and setting on fire houses barns stacks of hay and corn and poisoning the herbage in the field of which there is a full account given in the philosophical transactions and as we had it confirmed by the general voice of the people i shall take notice that the transactions particularly observe that the eclipses of the sun in aries have been very fatal to this place and that the years      and      when the sun was eclipsed in that sign it suffered very much by fire and after the latter eclipse of the two the fire spread so far that about  00 houses in the town and suburbs of caernarvon were consumed  this mountainous country runs away north through merionethshire and almost through caernarvonshire where snowdenhill of a monstrous height according to its name had snow on the top in the beginning of june but it does not continue the year round as some have asserted  these unpassable heights were doubtless the refuges of the britons when in their continual wars with the romans and saxons they were overpowered  that side of the county of caernarvon which borders on the sea is not so mountainous and is both more fertile and more populous the principal place in this part is caernarvon a good town with a castle built by edward i to curb and reduce the wild people of the mountains and secure the passage into anglesea that prince also kept his court often here and here his eldest son and successor edward ii was born who was therefore called edward of caernarvon this edward was the first of the sons of the kings of england vested with the title of prince of wales and here were kept the chancery and exchequer of the princes of wales for the north part of the principality as it was at caermarthen for the south part it is a small but strong town clean and well built and considering the place the people are very courteous and obliging to strangers it is seated on the firth or inlet called meneu parting the isle of anglesea or mona from the main land and here is a ferry over to the island called abermenaiferry and from thence a direct road to holyhead whithe we went for no other purpose than to have another view of ireland though we were disappointed the weather being bad and stormy  whoever travels critically over these mountains of south wales and merionethshire will think stonehenge in wiltshire and rollrich stones in oxforashire no more wonders seeing there are so many such in these provinces that they are not thought strange of at all nor is it doubted but they were generally monuments of the dead as also are the single stones of immense bulk of which we saw so many that we gave over remarking em some measured from     to  0 and one    feet high being a whole stone but so great that the most of the wonder is where they were found and how dragged to the place since besides the steep ascents to some of the hills on which they stand it would be hardly possible to move some of them now with  0 yoke of oxen and yet a great many of these stones are found confusedly lying one upon another on the utmost summit or top of the glyder and other hills in merioneth or caernarvonshire to which it is next to impossible that all the power of art and strength of man and beast could carry them and the vulgar make no difficulty of saying the devil set them up there  one of these monumental stones is to be seen a little way from harleighcastle it is a large stone lying flat supported by three other stones at three of the four angles though the stone is rather oval than square it is almost    feet long the breadth unequal but in some places it is from   to   feet broad and it may be supposed has been both longer and broader it is in some places about two feet thick but in others it is worn almost to an edge by time the three stones that support it are about  0 inches square it is supposed there have been four two of which that support the thickest end are near   feet high the other not above three feet being supposed to be settled in the ground so that the stone lies sloping like the roof of a barn there is another of these to be seen in the isle of anglesea the flat stone is much larger and thicker than this but we did not go to see it there are also two circles of stones in that island such as stonehenge but larger  this is a particular kind of monument and therefore i took notice of it but the others are generally single stones of vast magnitude set up on one end columnwise which being so very large are likely to remain till the end of time but are generally without any inscription or regular shape or any mark to intimate for whom or for what they were so placed  these mountains are indeed so like the alps that except the language of the people one could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from grenoble to susa or rather through the country of the grisons the lakes also which are so numerous here make the similitude the greater nor are the fables which the country people tell of these lakes much unlike the stories which we meet with among the switzers of the famous lakes in their country mr camdens continuator tells us of  0 or  0 lakes in caernarvonshire only we did not count em but i believe if we had we should have found them to be more rather than less  here we met with the char fish the same kind which we saw in lancashire and also in the lakes of switzerland and nowhere else that i have heard of in europe the welsh call it the torgch  there is nothing of note to be seen in the isle of anglesea but the town and the castle of beaumaris which was also built by king edward i and called beaumarsh or the fine plain for here the country is very level and plain and the land is fruitful and pleasant the castle was very large as may be seen by its remains and that it was strong the situation will tell also but it is now of no use  as we went to holyhead by the south part of the island from newborough and came back through the middle to beaumaris we saw the whole extent of it and indeed it is a much pleasanter country than any part of north wales that we had yet seen and particularly is very fruitful in corn and cattle  here we crossed the straight of meneu again and came to bangor at the place where king edward i intended to have built a great stone bridge it would indeed have been a work fit for so great a king but the bottom being doubtful and the sea in that place sometimes very raging and strong the workmen thought it impracticable and though the king was very positive in his design for a great while yet he was prevailed with at last to decline it  bangor is a town noted for its antiquity it is a bishops see but has an old meanlooking and almost despicable cathedral church  this church boasts of being one of the most ancient in britain the people say the most ancient and that st daniel to whom it was dedicated was first bishop here in the year     they allow that the pagans perhaps of anglesea ruined the church and possessed the bishopric after it was built for above one hundred years nor is there any account of it from the year     to  00  after this the bishopric was ruined again by one of its own bishops whose name was bulkeley who as the monasticon says not only sold the revenues but even the very bells for which sacrilege it is said he was struck blind  it is certainly at present no rich bishopric yet the bishops are generally allowed to hold some other good benefice in commendam and the preferment seems to be a grateful introduction to the clergy as the bishops are generally translated from hence to a more profitable one and very few gentlemen of the function have died bishops of bangor so that in some sense a bishop of this see may be said to be immortal  from bangor we went north keeping the sea on our left hand to conway this is the poorest but pleasantest town in all this county for the bigness of it it is seated on the bank of a fine river which is not only pleasant and beautiful but is a noble harbor for ships had they any occasion for them there the stream is deep and safe and the river broad as the thames at deptford it only wants a trade suitable to so good a port for it infinitely outdoes chester and liverpool too  in this passage we went over the famous precipice called penmaenmaur which i think fame has made abundance more frightful than it is for though the rock is indeed very high and if any one should fall from it he would be dashed in pieces yet on the other hand there is no danger of it a wall being built all the way on the edge of the precipice to secure passengers those who have been at the hill or pass of enterkin in scotland know very well the danger there is much greater than here and the frequent loss of lives both of man and horse will testify the same  we have but little remarkable in the road from conway to holywell but craggs and rocks all along the north shore of denbeigh till we came to denbeigh the county town which has a castle of great strength it is a large populous place and has a good trade carried on by tanners and glovers this town carries something in its countenance of its neighborhood to england but that which was most surprising after such a tiresome and fatiguing journey over the inhospitable mountains of merioneth and caernarvonshire was that descending now from the hills we came into a most pleasant fruitful populous and delicious vale full o villages and towns the fields shining with corn just ready for the reapers the meadows green and flowery and a fine river of a mild and gentle stream running through it nor is it a small or casua intermission but we had a prospect of the country open before us for above  0 miles in length and from   to   miles in breadth all smiling with the same kind of complexion which made us think ourselves in england again all on a sudden  in this pleasant vale turning north from denbeigh and following the stream of the river we came to st asaph in flintshire a small city with a cathedral being a bishopric of tolerable good value though the church is old it is but a poor place and illbuilt although the country is so pleasant and rich all round it there are some old monuments in this church but none of any note nor could we read the welsh inscriptions  from hence we came to holywell the story of it is that the pious virgin st winifred being ravished and murdered this healing water sprung out of her body when buried the romanists believe it as it is evident from their thronging hither to receive benefit from the healing virtue of the water which they do not hope for as medicinal but as miraculous and think it heals them by virtue of the intercession and influence of this famous virgin st winifrid  the chapel dedicated to this holy virgin is cut out of a solid rock and numbers of pilgrims resort to it with great devotion under this chapel the water gushes out into a great stream and the place where it breaks out is formed like a basin or cistern in which they bathe the water is intensly cold and indeed there is no great miracle in that point considering the rocks it flows from where it is impregnated by diverse minerals the virtue of which and not of the saint i suppose work the greatest part of the cures that may be supposed to be effected there  there is a little town near the well which may indeed be said to have risen from the confluence of people thither for almost all the houses are either public houses or let into lodgings and the priests who attend here and are very numerous appear in disguise sometimes they are physicians sometimes surgeons sometimes gentlemen and sometimes patients or any thing as occasion presents nobody takes notice of them as to their religion though they are well known no not the roman catholics themselves but in private they have their proper oratories in certain places whither the votaries resort and good manners has prevailed so far that no protestant let him know what he will takes notice of it or inquires where one goes or has been gone  the principal towns in flintshire are   flint the shire town but so small that it has not a market   st asaph beforementioned   caerwys the chief market town of the county  from hence we passed by flintcastle a known place but of no consequence now and directly to wrexham deemed the largest town in north wales having heard much of a fine church there but we were greatly disappointed there is indeed a very large tower or steeple as some call it adorned with imagery but far from fine the work is mean the statues without any fancy or spirit and as the stone is of a reddish crumbling kind like the cathedral at chester time has made it look gross and rough  there are a great many ancient monuments in this church and in the churchyard also but none of note and almost all the inscriptions are in welsh the church is large but they must be much mistaken who tell us it is one of the finest in england for it falls short in that respect of even those churches which are as old as itself  this town is large well built and populous and besides the church there are two large meeting houses in one of which we were told they preach in welsh one part of the day and in english the other here is a great market for flannel which the factors buy up of the poor welsh people who manufacture it and thence it is sent to london and is a considerable manufacture through all this part of the country by which the poor are very profitably employed  we could not omit seeing the once famous banchor which malmsbury confounds with the episcopal bangor and were pleased to see there a fine stone bridge over the dee this was once a city and the monastery was so famous that in the time of the british kings it was said to contain   00 monks who in their turns  viz  00 each hour of the    reading prayers and singing psalms continually divine service was performed day and night without intermission but now not so much as the ruins are to be seen and as all the people in the little village that takes place of it spoke welsh we could find no body that could give us any intelligence so effectually had time erasd the very foundations of the place  this is said to be the birthplace of that archheretick pelagius who from hence began to broach his heretical opinions which afterward so terribly overspread the church camden observes that this bangor is situated in the county of flint  but before i have entirely done with the principality give me leave to observe briefly a few things with relation to this journey and the gentlemen of wales  though this journey and especially over such monstrous hills and precipices as those in merioneth and some other shires was a little heavy to us yet were we well supported through it for we generally found their provisions very good and cheap and pretty good accommodations in the inns  the welsh gentlemen are very hospitable and the people in general very obliging and conversable especially to strangers when we let them know we traveled merely in curiosity to view the country their civility was heightened to such a degree that nothing could be more friendly and they were willing to tell us every thing that belonged to their country and to show us all that we desired to see  they value themselves much upon their ancient heroes as caractacus owen ap tudor prince lewellin and particularly upon the antiquity of their families and laugh at a pedigree that cannot be traced higher than the conquest it must be owned that the gentlemen justly claim a very ancient descent and have preserved their families entire for many ages they receive you well into their houses treat you very handsomely are very generous and indeed nothing is wanting within doors and what is more they have generally very good estates to support their hospitality but they are very jealous of affronts and soon provoked to anger which is seldom allayed without satisfaction and then become as soon reconciled again  i will now put an end to this letter with assureing you that  i am etc  letter vii containing a description of part of cheshire northamptonshire and leicestershire sir i continued at chester for some time except that i made two or three excursions into the neighboring country and particularly into that part of shropshire which i had not viewed as i went as also into the north and northwest parts of cheshire but i should first acquaint you that malpas through which i came from wales is situate on a high hill and was formerly strengthened by a castle which is now in ruins the church is a stately building and stands on the most eminent part of the town it has   rectors who do duty alternately the town consists of   streets and is well paved has a good market a grammar school and an hospital  the first trip i made was into the cestria chersonesus as i think we may properly call it it is bounded by the two great firths or arms of the sea the one called the mouth of the dee and the other of the two rivers mersey and weaver which form it into a peninsula it is about    miles long   or   over and has not one market town in it though it is exceeding rich and fertile occasioned possibly by the neighborhood of two such great towns as chester and liverpool  going down from chester by the rhoodee as they call it that is the marshes of the river dee and coasting the river after it is grown broader than the marshes the first place of any note which we come to is nesson where in the late irish war most of the troops embarked for that grand expedition from hence the vessels go away to highlake where they ride safe in their way as the ships from london lie in the downs till the wind presents for their respective voyages  but to return to chester it is a fine old city and colony of the romans and many antiquities have been found in it it has four churches beside the cathedral which is a pile venerable for antiquity but in no extraordinary condition there are shadows of many pictures on the wall but defaced at the west end in niches are some images of the earls palatine of chester the adjoining abbey is quite ruined the walls round the city are kept in very good repair at the charge of the corporation and afford a pleasant airy walk the exchange is a neat building supported by columns    feet high of one stone each over it is the cityhall a wellcontrived court of judicature the castle was formerly the palace where the earls assembled their parliaments and enacted laws independent of the kings of england determining all causes themselves it has always a garrison kept in it the piazzas or rows as they call them do not in my opinion add any thing to the beauty of the city but on the contrary serve to make it look both old and indifferent these rows are certain long galleries up one pair of stairs which run along the side of the streets before all the houses though joined to them and as is pretended they are to keep the people dry in walking along this they do indeed effectually but then they take away all the view of the houses from the street nor can a stranger that was to ride through chester see any shops in the city besides they make the shops themselves dark and the way in them is dark dirty and uneven  the best ornament of the city is that the streets are very broad and fair and run through the whole city in strait lines crossing in the middle of it as at chichester the walls afford a very pleasant walk as i have said round the city and within the battlements from whence you may see the circumjacent country and particularly on the side of the rhoodee which is a fine large low green on the bank of the dee which in winter is often under water by the inundations of the river beyond the rhoodee may be seen from the walls of chester the county of flint and the mountains of wales  the castle is a good firm building and strong though not fortified with many outworks there is always a good garrison kept in it it is said this castle was built or at least repaired by hugh lupus the famous earl of chester nephew to william the conqueror as was also the church the body of whom was lately  anno      discovered as is supposed in an old ruinous building called the chapter house  it was first wrapped in leather and then enclosed in a stone coffin the skull and all the bones were very fresh and in their proper position and what is more remarkable the string which tied the ankles together was whole and entire although it was then upwards of   0 years since the interrment  chester is but a modern bishopric being so made in the year      when king henry viii divided it from lichfield they tell us that king edgar who conquered all this part of britain and was rowed up the dee in his royal barge by seven or as some say eight kings himself steering the helm founded the great church which lupus finished and endowed  here is a noble stone bridge over the dee very high and strong built and it is needful it should be so for the dee is a most furious stream at some seasons and brings a vast weight of water with it from the mountains of wales  chester has long given title of earl to the prince of wales eldest son of the king  chester was formerly an harbor for shipping but the sea had long ago withdrawn itself and the river dee was so choked up that vessels of burden could not come within some miles of it so that an act of parliament passed in the year      for rendering it navigable and in pursuance thereof the undertakers raised a sum of     0 l which they have expended in cutting and perfecting a new chanel for the river dee of near ten miles in length and in making proper dams and sluices into which they have turned the said river so that it is actually navigable at this time for ships and vessels of considerable burdens to the quay or key of chester where they load and unload goods and merchandise this success encouraged the undertakers to apply to parliament    0  for further powers to complete the same and for uniting the said undertakers into a company for that laudable purpose  this county though so remote from london is one of those which contributes much to its support as well as to that of several other parts of england by its excellent cheese which they make here in such quantities that as i am told from very good authority the city of london only takes off   000 tons every year besides vast quantities which they send to bristol and york and also to scotland and ireland so that the quantity of cheese made here must be prodigiously great indeed the whole county is employed in it and part of its neighborhood too for though it goes by the name of cheshire cheese yet great quantities of it are made in such parts of shropshire staffordshire and lancashire as border upon cheshire  the soil is extraordinarily good and the grass has a peculiar richness in it which disposes the kine to give a great quantity of milk which is very sweet and good and this cheese manufacture increases every day raises the value of the lands and encourages the farmers to keep vast stocks of cows which of themselves contribute to improve and enrich the land  while we were stationd as i may say at chester i made a trip to several places round about it and particularly to the fine old seat of the lord delamere and the spacious forest which gives title to that noble family they say here was formerly an old city now called the chamber on the forest probably some fort or camp to secure the road from hence is so fine a prospect of the welsh mountains that i never before beheld such a noble scene of nature beestoncastle is on our left built upon a precipice this forest is noted for great plenty of red and fallow deer and is a great relief for fish fowl and turf to the neighboring towns whereof there are a great many small ones about this forest and through the upper part of it the weaver takes its course the chief town hereabout is frdesham famous formerly for a castle and the seat of the family of the savages which however is but a mean market town near this place is also the famous seat of rocksavage built on the ascent of an hill belonging to the same family whereof the last was the late earl rivers  on the south side of the park stands beestoncastle upon an hill environed with mountains and yet overlooks almost the whole county it is very strong covers a great extent of ground and is adorned with many towers it gives name to an ancient family in this county  from chester we kept directly on east to middlewich a large market town with a spacious church but chiefly noted for making salt where are two excellent brineseeths  we followed the weaver directly north to northwich also famous for brinesprings and for making great quantities of the finest salt by boiling the water in large iron pans of small depth as fast as the salt crystallizes they rake it out and dry it in wicker baskets of a conick form the duty it brings in is very considerable  within these fifty years on the south side of the town they discovered a great many mines of rocksalt which they continually dig up and send in great lumps to the maritime ports where it is dissolved and made into eating salt we were let down by a bucket   0 feet deep to the bottom of the salt quarry a most pleasant subterraneous prospect looking like a cathedral supported by rows of pillars and roof of crystal all of the same rock transparent and glittering from the numerous candles of the workmen laboring with their steel pickaxes in digging it away this rockwork extends to several acres  there is a good church at northwich with a fine roof and semicircular choir  at lawtonyates they bore  0 yards deep for the salt spring at hassal    at wheelock    about middlewich less at northwich it rises to open day which seems to intimate that the salt spring runs between layers of the earth in an horizontal line upon boring it rises with great impetuosity so that the workmen have scarce time to get out of the wells this is all along the side of a brook that comes from a remarkable hill called mawcop upon the edge of staffordshire so that the ground rises above the true level in the mentioned proportion  from northwich we traveled northeast and came to knutsford a good town and finely situated a brook runs through it and divides it into two it has a market and townhouse and a pretty good parochial church  altringham and stockport two small market towns lie higher up northward the first near and the other upon the borders of lancashire and hearing of nothing remarkable in them we turned southeast from knutsford to macclesfield which they call in this county maxfield  macclesfield is situate in the forest of the same name a town of great antiquity and very fair and spacious it is under the government of a mayor and enjoys many particular privileges by virtue of the court and liberties of the forest it has a good church with a high spire steeple and a college adjoining to it in which are buried a great many of the savages and here is also a good free school and a thriving manufacture of buttons  from hence we veerd about and came southwest to congleton near the borders of staffordshire a fair mayortown and wellwaterd on all sides it has two churches and is noted for a good trade in gloves  we then came to the market town of sandbach which is delightfully situated on a branch of the weaver it has a fair church and in the marketplace stand two crosses of stone with the history of christs passion engraven on them the ale here is deservedly famed  from sandbach we went on southward and came to the great london road at namptwich which stands upon it this town is well built and the streets look fair having a great many gentlemens houses in them the church is a noble edifice in the form of a cross with the steeple rising from the middle but the maintenance of the minister is mean and pitiful the inhabitants are rich and carry on a good trade in most sort of commodities but principally in making salt and cheese the latter exceeding all that is made in the county as the soil this way is esteemed the best and as it is said was called by king edward i the vale royal  thus having made my circuit round the county i shall go from hence south to whitchurch in shropshire but i must first note two things of cheshire   that there is no part of england where there are equal numbers of gentry of such ancient and noble extraction mr camden is very particular in their names and descents to whom therefore i must refer   that it is a county palatine and has been so for many ages and its government is distinct from any other and very particular it is administered by a chamberlain a judge special who is called chief justice of chester two barons of the exchequer three sergeants at law a sheriff an attorney an escheator and all proper and usual subordinate officers and the jurisdiction of all these offices is kept up and preserved very strictly only we are to note that the judge special as he is called tries only civil causes not criminal which are left to the ordinary judges of england who go the circuits here as in other places  whitchurch is a pleasant large and populous town and has a very good church in which is the famous monument of the great talbot first e of shrewsbury who was called in his time the english achilles and who was so renowned in the wars of france that no man in that kingdom dared to encounter him singlehanded he had engraven on one side of his sword sum talboti and on the reverse pro vincere inimicos meos his epitaph is as follows in capital letters orate pro anima praenobilis domini domini iohannis talbott quondam comitis salopiae domini talbott domini furnivall domini verdon domini strange de blackmere et mareschalli franciae qui obiit in bello apvd bvrdews vii ivlii mccccliii  this town has a good market and a great many gentry near it whereof some are roman catholics they tell us that this town when king charles i removed his standard from nottingham to shrewsbury raised a whole regiment for his service  from hence we turned south and passing by wem the title given by king james ii to his lord chancellor jefferies thence we came to elsmere which gives title of baron to the duke of bridgwater and is famous for a great lake or mere which gives the town its name and which the people pretend has in some places no bottom this place is remarkable for good fish  and further on west on the confines of denbighshire stands oswestry a bailiwick market town famous formerly for the sale of welsh cottons and flanels but now only for the last it is enclosed with a wall and a ditch and fortified with a castle and has a good church without the gate covered with lead from hence we came the same night to shrewsbury  shrewsbury is supposed to have been built out of the ruins of the ancient uriconium in the reign of william the conqueror roger earl of montgomery built a castle here on the north side and a stately abbey some ruins of which are still to be seen it is a beautiful large pleasant populous and rich town full of gentry and yet full of trade too for here likewise is a great manufacture as well of flanel as also of white broadcloth which inriches all the country round it  the severn in part surrounds this town just as the thames does the isle of dogs so that it makes the form of an horseshoe over it are two fine stone bridges upon one of which is built a very noble gate and over the arch of the gate the statue of the great llewellin the idol of the welsh and their last prince of wales  this is really a town of mirth and gallantry something like bury in suffolk or durham in the north but much bigger than either of them or indeed than both together  over the markethouse is kept a kind of hall for the manufactures which are sold here weekly in very great quantities they speak all english in the town but on a market day you would think you were in wales  here is the greatest market the greatest plenty of good provisions and the cheapest that is to be met with in all the western part of england the severn supplies them here with excellent salmon but it is also brought in great plenty from the dee which is not far off and abounds with a very good kind and is generally larger than in the severn as an example of the cheapness of provisions we paid here in a public inn but a groat a night for hay and sixpence a peck for oats for our horses which is cheaper than we found it in the cheapest part of the north of england all our other provisions were in proportion and there is no doubt but the cheapness of provisions joined to the pleasantness and healthiness of the place draws a great many families hither who love to live within the compass of their estates  mr camden calls it a city and it is indeed equal to several good cities in england and superior to some near this place was fought the bloody battle between henry hotspur and henry iv king of england in which the former was killed and all his army overthrown and the place is called battlefield to this day  here are five churches two of them with lofty spires st chads and st marys are said to be anciently collegiate there are abundance of ancient monuments in them all which i have not room to mention  this town will for ever be famous for the reception it gave to king charles i who after setting up his standard at nottingham and finding no encouragement there removed to shrewsbury being invited by the gentry of the town and country round where he was received with such a general affection and hearty zeal that his majesty recovered himself from the discouragement of his first step at nottingham and raised and completed a strong army in less time than could be imagined insomuch that to the surprise of the parliament and indeed of all the world he was in the field before them and advanced upon them so fast that he met them twothirds onward of his way to london and gave them battle at edgehill near banbury  but the fate of the war turning afterward against the king the weight of it fell heavy upon this town and almost ruined it  but they are now fully recovered and it is one of the most flourishing towns in england the walls and gates are yet standing but useless and the old castle is gone to ruin as is the case of almost all the old castles in england  it should not be forgotten that notwithstanding the healthiness of the place here broke out first that unaccountable plague called the sweating sickness anno      which spread itself through the whole kingdom and afterward into several foreign nations  here is a good free school the most considerable in this part of england built and endowed by q elizabeth with a very sufficient maintenance for a chief or headmaster and three undermasters or ushers the buildings are very spacious and particularly the library which has a great many books in it the schoolmasters have also very handsome houses to dwell in so that the whole has the face of a college  there was a fine school here before erected by the townspeople and maintained several years by their contribution but the queen took the matter into her own hands and built the whole fabric new from the ground endowing it liberally out of her own royal bounty  here i was showed a very visible and remarkable appearance of the great ancient road or way called watlingstreet which comes from london to this town and goes on from hence to the utmost coast of wales remains of a stone bridge are to be seen in the bottom of the river when the water is low this road is raised a good height above the soil and so strait that upon an eminence you may see it ten or fifteen miles before you and as much behind over many hilltops answering one the other as a vista of trees  we lodged at an inn called iveseybank on the borders between staffordshire and shropshire about a mile off in a large wood stands boscobelhouse or whiteladies as some call it where the pendrils lived who preserved king charles ii after worcester battle and famous for the royal oak the granddaughter of that william pendril still lived in the house when i was there the floor of the garret which is a popish chapel formerly a nunnery in possession of the family of cooksey being matted prevents any suspicion of a little cavity with a trapdoor over the staircase where the king was hid his bed was artfully placed behind some wainscot that shut up very close a descendant of the cookseys still keeps the gloves and garters which his majesty left behind him  the said chapel is still standing and has some painted saints upon the wall at one end  a bowshot from the house just by a horsetrack passing through the wood stood the royal oak into which the king and col carlos climbed by means of the henroost ladder when they thought it no longer safe to stay in the house the family reaching them victuals with the nuthook it happened as the people related it to us that whilst the king and colonel were in the tree a party of the enemys horse sent to search the house came whistling and talking along this road and when they were just under the tree an owl flew out of a neighboring tree and hovered along the ground as if her wings were broken which the soldiers merrily pursued  the tree is now enclosed within a brick wall the inside whereof is covered with laurel of which we may say as ovid did of that of the augustan palace  mediamque tuebere quercum for the oak is in the middle almost cut away by travelers whose curiosity leads them to see it close by the side grows a young thriving plant from one of its acorns  after the restoration the king reviewing the place no doubt with very different emotions to what he had when he was in it gathered some of the acorns and set them in st jamess park or garden and used to water them himself if we may judge of the value the king put upon his preservation and royal person it was worth  00 l per annum and one should think a king if worth any thing worth that for so much he gave to pendril and it now remains in the family over the door of the enclosure is this inscription cut in marble felicissimam arborem quam in asylum potentissimi regis caroli ii deus o m per quem reges regnant hic crescere voluit tam in perpetuam rei tantae memoriam quam specimen firmae in reges fidei muro cinctam posteris commendant basilius and jana fitzherbert quercus amica jovi that is basil and jane fitzherbert recommend to posterity this most fortunate tree which the allgacious and almighty god by whom kings reign ordained here to grow to be the asylum of the most potent prince king charles ii and have begirt it with a wall as well in perpetual remembrance of so great an event as a testimony of their firm allegiance to kings  the oak beloved by jove   ten miles southeast of shrewsbury stands great wenlock an ancient borough and good market town the noted wrekenhill stands higher up north of it between the watlingstreet and the severn and within a mile of wroxeter the famous roman station it ascends gradually from a pleasant level ground strikes out a pretty great length and is well adorned with trees it is the highest ground in all the county and gives a fine prospect all around it  following the watling street north we came to a small market town called wellington of very little note and still keeping the street we arrived at newport on the borders of staffordshire a little market town where is one of the noblest foundations for a school in the whole kingdom endowed by one adams an haberdasher of london to the value of  000 l the school is  0 feet long    wide and the same in height a library a house for both the master and usher  0 l a year to the first and  0 l to the other and a garden to each house of an acre and two acres for the boys to play in near it he has likewise built an almshouse and gave   0 l toward building the townhouse over the schooldoor is this distich scripsisti haeredem patriam tibi quae dedit ortum scriberis ergo tuae jure pater patriae that is thy country is thy heir and therefore we justly esteem thy countrys parent thee   between this town and drayton a small market town higher up northward and likewise on the borders of staffordshire is bloreheath famous for a battle fought between the house of york and that of lancaster wherein nevil earl of salisbury for the former with  000 men only beat lord audley with  0000 men after a most bloody engagement  entering staffordshire we quitted the said streetway a little to the left to see stafford the countytown and the most considerable except litchfield in the county in the way we passed through a small but ancient town called penkrige vulgarly pankrage probably the pennerucium of the romans where happened to be a fair we were surprised to see the prodigious number of the finest and most beautiful horses that can anywhere be seen brought hither from yorkshire the bishopric of durham and all the horsebreeding counties in england we were told there were not less than an hundred jockeys or horsekopers as they call them there from london to buy horses for sale also an incredible number of gentlemen attended with their grooms to buy hunters and good road horses in a word i believe i may mark it for the greatest horsefair in the world for horses of value and especially those we call saddlehorses though there were great numbers of fine large stonehorses for coach and draught too  from hence we came in two hours easy riding to stafford on the river sow it is an ancient town and gives name to the county but we thought to have found in it something more worth going so much out of the way for it is however neat and well built and pleasantly seated in low grounds and is lately much increased and grown rich by the clothingtrade it is governed by a mayor and other inferior officers consists of two parishes and has a good free school it is said this town retains the ancient custom of borough english which is that the youngest sons inherit the lands of their fathers within the town here is likewise a fine square marketplace where stands the shirehall and the streets are well paved  we tarried here a few days in order to visit the towns lying on each side of it with more attention and convenience  eccleshall lies northwest of stafford and is a pretty market town noted for pedlerywares and a little market town called stone lies upon the trent   line stands still further north  trent it is governd by a mayor two justices two bailiffs and common council and holds pleas under  0 s the streets are large broad and paved but the houses are low and generally thatched the clothingtrade flourishes here and the town is surrounded with coalpits here are the ruins of an old castle the coals here are cut out in slices and shine with all the various colors of a peacocks tail and therefore are called peacockcoals  dr plot as an instance of the growth of stones mentions that near this place was found a stone with a mans skull teeth and all enclosed in it and here is an excellent device for the taming of shrews they put a bridle into the scolds mouth which deprives her of the power of speech by which she is led about the town and exposed to public shame till she promises amendment  betley a little market town lies west of newcastle upon the borders of cheshire  breewood is a pretty market town lying southwest of stafford and due south stands  wolverhampton a very ancient town situate on an hill which is well built paved and inhabited here the trade of lockmaking is carried on to great perfection in its church are several old monuments and a brass statue of sir richard leveson who engaged the spaniards under sir francis drake the pulpit is very old and of stone and in the churchyard is a very old stone cross from the hill on which the town is situated run four weak springs of different qualities which is the only water they have to supply this large and populous town  walsal east of wolverhampton is a good pleasant corporatetown governed by a mayor and situate on the top of an hill this place is famous for ironmines and ironworks such as spurs bridlebits stirrups buckles etc in which there is a considerable trade carried on  upon the extremity of the county south just on the borders of worcestershire is situate upon a high mountain the famous ancient castle of dudley a building of great extent with trenches about it cut out of a rock and has a high tower upon it on the south side it was built by dodo a saxon in  00 great part of it is in ruins and the rest is converted into a noble seat where the lord dudley and ward resides the castle overtops all the trees that surround it and has a most extensive prospect over five shires and into part of wales in the hall of this castle is a table all of one entire plank which before it was fitted up there was    yards long and   yard in breadth but being too long for the hall   yards and   inches of it was cut off and made a table for the hall of a neighboring gentleman what a prodigious oak must this have been that had a length of    yards and a diameter of one yard from one end to the other  the town of dudley lies near it but in worcestershire and is only remarkable for being in a different county from the castle  the people in this county have been more particularly famous than any other for good footmanship and there have been and still are among them some of the fleetest runners in england which must be owing to their exercising themselves to it from their childhood for running footraces seems to be the general sport or diversion of the country  near stafford we saw ingestre where the late walter chetwynd esquire built or rather rebuilt a very fine church at his own charge and where the late lord chetwynd has with a profusion of expense laid out the finest park and gardens that are in this part of england  i am now at the utmost extent of my proposed limits for this circuit for ingestre parks reach to the very banks of the trent so i turned to the right and intending for litchfield in the way we saw beaudesert a famous old seat said to be built by hugh lupus earl of chester the name indeed intimates it to be of norman or french original at present it is in the noble family of paget earl of uxbridge who is styled baron of beaudesert the park is very fine and its situation exceeding pleasant but the house is ancient in the park is a famous piece of antiquity viz a large camp or fortification surrounded with a double trench very large and deep  from hence it is about four or five miles to the city of litchfield the principal next to chester of all the northwest part of england nor indeed is there any other but this and coventry in the whole road from london to carlisle which is on the edge of scotland  at rugely which is an handsome well built town finely situated near the trent we came into the great lancashire and cheshire road or the northwest road from london which passing through this city from warringtonbridge in cheshire falls into the watlingstreet mentioned before about three miles southeast from the town and crosses another ancient causeway or road called icknildstreet about a mile out of the city so that litchfield lies as it were at the joining of all those great roads but instead of going directly to litchfield we struck out of the road and went northeast to bromley a pretty market town and from thence east to tutbury on the skirts of derbyshire it has a small market town with a castle in it  some miles southward stands burton upon trent where the clothingtrade is carried on with great advantage it is famous for its noble bridge over the trent consisting of    arches and of the length of     yards it is built of freestone cut and squared  from hence we returned southwest to litchfield which is a fine neat well built and pretty large city it rose from the ruins of the roman etocetum a mile off now called chesterfieldwall from some relics of its fortifications there is a kind of slow sluggish water which runs or rather glides heavily through it and so on for four or five miles farther into the trent but takes a swifter motion as soon as it is out of the town this water parts the city into two one part is called the town and the other the close in the first is the marketplace a fine school and a very handsome hospital well endowed this part is much the largest and most populous but the other is the fairest has the best buildings in it and among the rest the cathedral church one of the finest and most beautiful in england  there are two fine causeways which join the city and the close with sluices to let the water pass but those were cut through in the time of the late intestine wars in england and the close which is walled about and was then fortified for the king was very strong and stood out several attacks against cromwells men and was not at last taken without great loss of blood on both sides being gallantly defended and at last taken by storm  there are in the close besides the houses of the clergy residentiaries a great many very well built and wellinhabited houses which made litchfield a place of good company above all the towns in this or the neighboring counties of warwickshire or derbyshire  the sea is very ancient and was once archiepiscopal made so by king offa and eadulph the archbishop was metropolitan of all the kingdom of the mercians and east angles but it did not hold it then it suffered another diminution by having the sea of chester taken away which was once part of this  they told us here a long story of st chad formerly bishop of this church and how he lived an eremitical life here by the spring near stow church in a little hovel or cell but the bishops since that time fare better and make shift with a very fine palace in the close and the residentiaries live in proportion to them  they have another legendary story also at litchfield namely that a thousand poor people being instructed in the christian faith by the care of offa king of the mercians were all martyred here in one field by the pagans and that in the field where they were so murdered king oswy of northumberland caused a great church to be built and from thence the city bears for its device an open field with mangled carcasses lying dispersed about in it as if murdered and left unburied  the church for the elegancy and regularity of the building may be esteemed one of the most complete in england the west end is richly decorated with the statues of all the kings who reigned in jerusalem from david to the captivity but it is too flat and wants projection or as architects call it relief to give it boldness the two towers are much too low for their breadth and look very heavy for want of windows especially where the bells hang the circular staircases projecting octagonally at one angle only of each without any of the other three angles answering is a great irregularity but the spires above them are carried up in an exceeding beautiful taste much beyond any other gothic spires that i have seen the middle tower and spire of this church are much higher than those at the west end and are equally beautiful  the spire designed for the middle of westminsterabbey is an imitation of the middle spire of this church  the great window over the middle door is very large and its pediment finely adorned a large cross finishing the top of it  the imagery and carved work on the front as above suffered much in the late unhappy times and they told us the cross over the west window was frequently shot at by the rude soldiers but that they could not shoot it down  the saints of those days also entirely ruined all the ornaments of the inside with the brass inscriptions tombs etc it is built in the midst of a bog for security and held out some fierce attacks for king charles i and what the outside suffered has been very well repaired since the restoration as well by the famous bishop hacket as by the bounty of several noble and generous benefactors  the monasticon makes mention of a shrine given here for the holy st chad or st cedda which cost  00000 l but i conceive that to smell as much of the legend as the miracles of st chad himself since such a gift at that time must be equal to two millions of our money  ancient camps are found in the neighborhood of litchfield  from litchfield we came to tamworth a fine pleasant trading town eminent for good ale and good company of the middling sort and also for a fine charity of the famous bookseller mr guy who built and endowed the noble hospital in southwark called by his name the town stands on the river tame which runs through it and divides it into two parts one part whereof is in this county and the other in warwickshire it is a bailiwick town and a place of good account though it has been much more considerable here was anciently a palace of the mercian kings and there is still remaining a square trench called the kings dyke this town was given by the conqueror to the marmyons who built the castle here and were hereditary champions of england from whom that office descended to the dymokes of lincolnshire  from tamworth we came to suttoncolefield a little town situated in an excellent air and among pleasant woods though but in a barren soil and then we came into the great road again at coleshill in warwickshire a small but very handsome market town from whence we came to coventry the sister city to litchfield and joined in the title of see which was for some little time seated here but afterward returned to litchfield  coventry is a city of large extent and populous and drives a very great trade the manufacture of tammies is their chief employ and next to that weaving of ribbons of the meanest kind chiefly black the buildings are very old and in some places very much decayed the timberbuilt houses project forwards into the street toward one another insomuch that in the narrow streets they almost touch at the top a method of building formerly much practiced in london  the tale of the lady godiva who rode naked through the high street of this city to purchase its exemption from oppressive taxes is held for so certain a truth that they will not have it questioned upon any account whatsoever and in memory of it the inhabitants make a procession yearly with a naked figure of a woman riding on horseback through the city and the picture of the poor fellow who peeped out of the window to see her is still kept up looking out of a garret in the high street of the city but mr camden says positively nobody looked at her at all two parliaments have been held in this city both remarkably denominated one in the  th of king henry iv called parliamentum indoctorum the other in the   th of king henry vi called parliamentum diabolicum because of the attainder passed in it against the house of york and its partisans  at the restoration of king charles ii the walls and towers of the city were demolished by that princes command and only the gates of it left standing by which the beauty and strength of the rest may be guessed at  this city is a county incorporate of itself and has a great many towns within its liberties holds pleas and is governed by a mayor  0 aldermen and subofficers but it had only two parish churches that of the holy trinity and the church of st michael which were unable to hold half the inhabitants till the year      when an act passed for making the church of bablack in coventry a parish church and for appointing a district or parish thereto and for enabling the master and usher of the free grammar school within the said city to be the rector and lecturer of the said parish church for all time to come this is called in the act the parish church of st john the baptist in the city of coventry besides these three churches and parishes it has four steeples and the cross is notedly one of its greatest ornaments the roads are kept well paved to it for a mile round here is a good free school founded by john hales esquire by the name of the school of king henry viii the master of which is to be for the future the minister of the new parish church as i have mentioned it has a good library and there is also an hospital for the poor but here is no cathedral as some have falsely said neither is the great church so called either collegiate or conventual but only a monastery or priory  yet this city contended a great while for thi honor but could not carry it in king henry viiis time the priory being dissolved the church which they would have called a cathedral was reduced to a private parish church and continues so to this day it is also an archdeaconry and the bishop is styled bishop of litchfield and coventry  the spire of the great church is however very beautiful and  00 yards high there is another good church in the same yard the cross a fine gothic work    feet high and in niches are the statues of several of the english kings at the southend of the town stands a tall spire by itself being what is left of the gray friars conventual church the townhouse is worth seeing the windows of it are painted glass representing some of the old kings earls etc who have been benefactors to the town  and a copy of latin verses are there to be read in praise of their royal benefactors in which are named the edwards the henrys the black prince queen elizabeth the duke of northumberland and the great earl of leicester  from coventry we could by no means pass the town of warwick the distance too being but about six miles and a very pleasant way on the banks of the river avon it is famous for being the residence of the great guy earl of warwick of whom tradition has delivered down to us so many hyperbolical accounts that it is hardly possible to distinguish his real actions from what are fabulous he flourished in the reign of athelstane and decided the fate of the kingdom by compact in single combat with colbrond the dane a man of gigantick stature whom he slew and afterward led a hermits life till his death they show us here his castle his helmet his sword and tell abundance of things of him which have some appearance of history though not much authority to support them so i leave that part to the curious searchers into antiquity who may consult mr camden rous dugdale and other antiquaries on that subject who tell us the castle was built before our saviors time and has been a place of great consideration ever since  as to warwick it is really a fine town pleasantly situated on the bank of the avon over which is a large and stately bridge the avon being now grown a pretty large river warwick has suffered much from all quarters it was once destroyed by the picts and scots after which the famous caractacus who at the head of the silures opposed the romans so long rebuilt it erecting there also a palace for himself then the romans under ostorius and after them the saxons greatly damaged it and lastly the ravaging danes ruined it  though it was a corporation by prescription yet it took a charter from philip and mary and since from james i and is now governed by a bailiff and    burgesses it has a handsome stonebuilt markethouse upheld by pillars and here is a good free school and a wellendowd hospital for decayed gentlemen though it has been always accounted a handsome well built town yet the face of it is now quite altered and improved for having been almost wholly reduced to a heap of rubbish by a terrible fire which happened the fifth day of september      by the mere accident of a spark being blown from a stick as it was carried cross a lane to the damage of   000 l it was rebuilt by act of parliament and that in so noble and beautiful a manner that few towns in england make so fine an appearance  the church and lofty tower is newbuilt except the east end which is old and very good work there are many fine brass monuments of the earls of warwick and others also one of the earl of essex queen elizabeths unhappy favorite and many chapels and confessionaries in the chapter house on the northside is a tomb of the lord brook the castle stands upon the river avon on a solid rock from whose bowels that and the whole town may be said to have been dug the terrace of the castle like that of windsor overlooks a beautiful country and sees the avon running at the foot of the precipice from above  0 feet perpendicular height for the solid rock from the river on which it stands it  0 feet high but on the northside it is even with the town the building is old but has been often repaired and beautified and it is now a very agreeable structure both within and without the apartments are very nicely contrived and the communication of the remotest parts of the building one with another is so well preserved by galleries and by the great hall which is very magnificent that one finds no irregularity in the whole building notwithstanding its ancient plan as it was a castle built for strength rather than a palace to dwell in for pleasure  a stone bridge with a dozen arches is at the castle across is a stonework dam where the water falls over it as a cascade under the castle wall it is fenced with a deep mound and strong embattled double walls and lofty towers on one side the area is a very high mount there are good apartments and lodgings next the river the residence of the lord brook the priory on the northeast of the town overlooks a pleasant woody vale there are a great many curious original pictures in the castle by vandyke and other good hands of kings queens and other noble personages both english and foreign  a mile out of town on the side of a hill is a pretty retired cell called guycliff in an old chapel is guys statue eight feet high the fence of the court is entire rock in which are cut stables and outhouses they showed us the rough cave where they say the famous guy died an hermit  while i was stationd as i may say at warwick i took a turn about the country to view such places of note as lay something out of my intended rout and first passing a rivulet i came to the ancient tripontium placed in a pleasant little valley the sides of which are pretty steep the road on the opposite hill looks perfectly like a perspectivescene at the theater this is a roman station rightly placed at dovebridge upon the avon running by rugby to warwick the stream here divides into two with a bridge over each upon one is a short inscription in stone showing the three counties which repair it  near this place at legersashby in northamptonshire has been an old town as they say destroyed by the danes catesby who hatched the powder plot owned the town  we went on to daventry a considerable market town governed by a mayor aldermen steward and    freemen it lies on the great road to chester and is consequently a great thoroughfare and well furnished with good inns for it subsists chiefly by the great concourse of travelers that pass that way it lies also on the old watlingstreet way the road was turned to pass through the town and runs on to dunsmoreheath where it crosses the fosse and one branch goes on to coventry and the other joins the fosse and goes on to a place called highcross of which further anon where it falls into the old watlingstreet and both meet again near litchfield  it is a most pleasant curiosity to observe the course of these old famous highways the ikenild way the watlingstreet and the fosse in which one sees so lively a representatation of the ancient british roman and saxon governments that one cannot help recalling those times to the imagination and though i am confined to such narrow limits in this work yet a circuit or tour through england would be very imperfect if i should take no notice of these ways seeing in tracing them we necessarily come to the principal towns either that are or have been in every county and likewise in mentioning their remains we give some account of them as in their present state which falls directly in with my design  from daventry we went a little out of the road to see a great camp called burrowhill upon the north end of an eminence covered over with fern and and goss here used to be kept a horserace they say this was a danish camp and every thing hereabouts is attributed to the danes because of the neighboring daventry which they suppose to be built by them the road hereabouts too being overgrown with daneweed they fansy it sprung from the blood of the danes slain in battle and that if upon a certain day in the year you cut it it bleeds originally it seems to have been roman but perhaps newmodelld by the danes  in norton town road a cornu ammonis lies neglected too big to bring away  at weedon is shown the site of king wolfheres palace the saxon kings of this province residing here the pastures called the ashes are the roman camp st werberg daughter of king wolfhere and abbess to the nunnery in this place had here a chapel abundance of very fine stone and many roman coins have been dug up weedon now contains two parishes and has been a market town  towcester is a considerable town between two rivulets which encompass it almost round  old stretford stands on the opposite side of the owse to stonystratford in the fields thereabouts are found many roman coins  a little north of the horseshoeinn stood queen eleanors cross which was pulled down in the civil wars  to the west of stretford stands whaddonhall upon very high ground affording a most beautiful prospect this manor formerly belonged to the lords gray one of whom a knight of the garter is buried in the church here is the original picture of dr willis the progenitor of the present possessor with many of his mss letters consultations lectures and other works unpublishd the poets spencer and the duke of bucks honored this place with their residence still higher stands stukely the church is very entire though built before the conquest in the plain ancient manner  i now come to northampton the handsomest town in all this part of england but here as at warwick the beauty of it is owing to its disaster for it was so effectually burnt down that very few houses were left standing and although the fire began in the daytime the flame spread itself with such fury and speed that they tell us a townsman being two miles off upon a hill on the south side of the town saw the fire at one end of it just as it began and before he could reach the town with all the speed he could the other end was in flames also it is now finely rebuilt with brick and stone and the streets made spacious and wide it has four churches two hospitals and a charityschool well endowed the marketplace is square and spacious the assizehouse is built after the corinthian order allhallows church is a pretty edifice with a cupola and a noble portico before it of   lofty ionick columns upon the balustrade is a statue of king charles ii it is situate on the river nine over which there are two handsome bridges and is walled in and on the west side are the remains of an old castle upon an eminence it is governed by a mayor two bailiffs a recorder etc all saints church beforementioned stands in a center where four large spacious streets terminate the public buildings are esteemed the finest that can be seen in any countytown in england being all newbuilt but that writer took very little notice of northampton or rather had never seen it who told us of a cathedral a chapter house and a cloister  the great inn called the george at the corner of the high street looks more like a palace than an inn and cost above  000 l building and so generous was the owner that as we were told when he had built it he gave it to the poor of the town  this is counted the center of all the horsemarkets and horsefairs in england there being here no less than four fairs in a year and indeed northampton is reckoned the navel of england here they buy horses of all sorts as well for the saddle as for the coach and cart and hitherll the jockeys from london resort to purchase horses  near northampton is the ancient royal house of holmeby which was formerly in great esteem and by its situation is capable of being made a truly royal palace but the melancholy reflection of the imprisonment of king charles i in this house and his being violently taken hence again by the rebels has cast a kind of disgrace upon the place so that it has been forsaken the house and estate was purchased by the duchess of marlborough and became part of the jointure which was settled on the marchioness of blandford it is at present possessed by a farmer who has pulled down part of the outhouses and converted the remaining part into barns stables etc  a little way off of northampton is naseby where the bloody and fatal battle was fought between the royalists and parliamentarians upon a fine plain where at present stands a windmill and on it are the marks of several great holes where the slain were buried and near this is guildsborough so named from a roman camp of a square form and deep ditch called the burrows  the town of towcester is of large extent and very populous and having but one parish church which is two miles distant from the hamlet of althorpe and foxcoate in which there was a chapel of ase but officiated in only once a month by the vicar of towcester though it is computed there are  00 souls in the said hamlet who in the wintertime cannot attend divine service at towcester and several benefactions having been given in case the said hamlet should be erected into a parish for all these reasons an act passed sess      for making the chapel in the hamlet of althorpe and foxcte a parish church and for appointing a district or parish thereto and according to the condition of one of the benefactions enabling the master of the free grammar school within the said hamlet to be vicar of the new parish church  the seat of the earl of pomfret near towcester is a stately building and stands pleasantly amidst good plantations of wood vistas and fine prospects in the grand view to the back front beyond the garden is a large and long canal several curious pictures are in the house but what inhances the glory of this seat is the vast number of greek and roman marbles statues bustos basreliefs urns altars etc part of the invaluable collection of the great earl of arundel and which are worthy of a journey through half the globe to behold the hall is a fine lofty room and the great stairs are painted in fresco by sir james thornhill  towcester is a pretty town of roman antiquity through which in a strait line runs the watlingstreet the inhabitants of all ages are here employed in a silken manufacture and lacemaking the town consists of one long street and is almost entirely encompassed with water  the house late the earl of sunderlands at althorpe now belonging to the hon john spencer esquire brother to his grace the present duke of marlborough who is earl of sunderland has within these few years changed its face to much advantage this ancient seat was rebuilt with great improvement by robert earl of sunderland grandfather to the present duke of marlborough and is particularly noted for a magnificent gallery furnished with a large collection of curious paintings by the best hands  the park is laid out and planted after the manner of that at greenwich and was designed by le notre the same person who planted st jamess park and cassioberry as also several other parks and gardens in england  there is a noble piece of water here on which is lately built a fine vessel completely equipped as his grace the duke of bedford has also at his seat at woburnabbey there is likewise on this water a fine venetian gondola canoes etc but this water is situated too near the house and occasions so great a damp that some of the pictures in the gallery are mildewd thereby  at a convenient distance from the house is lately built a handsome square of offices and near these is a large kitchengarden finely walled and planted in which is a handsome building for the residence of the gardener which is a model of an italian villa  from hence we went north toward harborough and in the way in the midst of deep dismal roads the dirtiest and worst in all that part of the country we saw boughton the noble seat of the duke of montagu a house built by the first duke very much after the model of the palace of versailles the treble wings projecting and expanded forming a court or space wider and wider in proper stades answerable to the wings the body of the house closing the whole view  the hall is a very noble room on the ceiling is a convocation of the gods admirably painted as are many suites of rooms staircases galleries etc beside the great number of portraits and other curious pictures the gardens contain  0 acres adorned with statues flowerpots urns of marble and metal many very large basins with variety of fountains playing aviaries reservoirs fish ponds canals wildernesses terraces etc the cascade is very fine and a whole river running through the length of the gardens is diversified most agreeably to complete its beauty  the park is walled round with brick and so finely planted with trees and in such an excellent order that i saw nothing more beautiful no not in italy itself except that the walks of trees were not orange and lemon and citron as it is in naples and the abruzzo and other southern parts of italy  a mile off is geddington where in a trivium stands one of the stone crosses built by king edward i in memory of his queen eleanor these are said to be the places where the corpse of that princess rested and crosses erected viz lincoln newark leicester geddington northampton stonystratford dunstable st albans waltham cheapside charing cross  on willoughby side of the road is an hillock called crosshill where the country people observe an anniversary festival willoughby brook plays in delightful meanders along a valley between cornfields with a moderate water unless raised by rains here several brass and silver coins have been found and some of gold the people have a notion of great riches being hid underground and there is a vulgar report that under one balk or mere that is division between the ploughed fields there is as much money as would purchase the whole lordship but they dare not dig they pretend for fear of spirits mosaic pavements coins pothooks fireshovels etc have been also found  in willoughby town is an handsome cross of one stone five yards long the parliament soldiers had tied ropes about it to pull it down but the vicar quenched their zeal with some strong beer after having harangued them concerning its innocence  at cossington near the river wrek is a vast barrow   0 feet long   0 broad  0 high or near it very handsomely worked up on the sides and very steep it is called shipleyhill from a great captain of that name who they say was here buried on the top are several oblong doubled trenches cut in the turf where the lads and lasses of the adjacent villages meet on eastermonday to recreate themselves with cakes and ale  at erdborough is a strong roman camp  00 feet long of a delightful prospect near it is a petrifying spring  but i must not omit as i had like to have done the town of wellingborough in the county of northampton  it was a large well built and wellinhabited town with a fine church and free school a dreadful fire which happened here in july      has made the town still more beautiful though the occasion was too melancholy to be wished for it began at a dyers house in the town about two in the afternoon and in the space of six hours consumed near   0 houses besides outhouses barns stables etc amounting in the whole to upwards of  00 mostly in the south and east parts of the town the wind being high and but little water to be had the fire was so fierce and violent that it seemed to break out at twenty places at once and the inhabitants were in such confusion that but few of them had time to save any goods and many only the clothes on their backs as it happened chiefly among the trading men and farmers the loss upon them was very heavy but it was a good deal alleviated by the signal charity of the neighboring gentlemen and others which saved many of the poor sufferers from perishing for want  in the month of march following this dreadful fire another happened at findon two miles from wellingborough which consumed    houses  from boughton we went on to harborough a good market town and great thoroughfare intending to go forward to leicester but curiosity turned us west a little to see an old town called lutterworth famous for being the birthplace of john wickliff the first preacher of the reformation in england whose disciples were afterward called lollards  the church was lately beautified and paved with a costly pavement of checkered stone and the pews are new and every thing in it both in church and chancel except the pulpit of thick oakplanks sixsquare which is preserved on account of its being wickliffs pulpit  being thus got a little out of our way we turned west into the watlingstreet way at highcross where the fosse crosses it and which i suppose occasioned the name leaving rugby in warwickshire a small town noted only for a great number of butchers on the southwest of us at this cross we seemed to be in the center and highest ground of england for from hence rivers run every way the fosse went across the backside of our inn and so toward bath here are diverse roman antiquities its ancient appellation was benonis the late earl of denbigh and the gentlemen in the neighborhood erected here a cross of an handsome design but of mouldering stone through the deceit of the architect it consists of four dorick columns regarding the four roads with a gilded globe and cross attop upon a sundial on two sides between the four tuscan pillars which compose a sort of pedestal are these inscriptions vicinarum provinciarum vervicensis scilicet and leicestrensis ornamenta proceres patriciique auspiciis illustrissimi basilii comitis de denbigh hanc columnam statuendam curaverunt in gratam pariter and perpetuam memoriam jani tandem a serenissima anna clausi a d mdccxii thus translated the noblemen and gentry ornaments of the neighboring counties of warwick and leicester at the instances of the right honorable basil earl of denbigh have caused this pillar to be erected in grateful as well as perpetual remembrance of peace at length restored by her majesty queen anne in the year of our lord mdccxii  the inscription on the other side runs thus si veterum romanorum vestigia quaeras hic cernas viator hic enim celeberrimae illorum viae militares sese mutuo secantes ad extremos usque britanniae limits prcurrunt hic stativa sua habuerunt vennones and ad primum abhinc lapidem castra sua ad stratam and ad fossam tumulum claudius quidam cohortis praefectus habuisse videtur which may be thus rendered if traveller you search for the footsteps of the ancient romans here you may behold them for here their most celebrated military ways crossing one another extend to the utmost boundaries of britain here the vennones kept their quarters and at the distance of one mile from hence claudius a certain commander of a cohort seems to have had a camp toward the the watlingstreet simply called the street by way of eminence street and toward the fosse a tomb  the watlingstreet measuring from chester through london and dover makes a strait line with rome which seems to have been so contrived by the great founders that in traveling upon it they might have the satisfaction of reflecting that they were going upon the line which led to the capital of the empire  to proceed we kept the streetway till we came into the leicester road which we followed east to hinkley a market town situate on a hill very pleasantly this town is noted for a large handsome church and a high spiresteeple all of stone in which is a chime of excellent bells  from hence we turned northwest and came to nuneaton an ordinary manufacturing town on the river anchor and then northward to atherston and so made a kind of serpentizing tour of it along the borders of the two counties of warwick and leicester sometimes in one and sometimes in the other  atherston is a market town famous for a great cheesefair on the  th of september from whence the cheesefactors carry the vast quantities of cheese they buy to sturbridge fair which begins about the same time but holds much longer and here it is sold again for the supply of the counties of essex suffolk and norfolk  a little northwest of atherston stands polesworth formerly a market town but since the dissolution of a famous nunnery which was there the market was discontinued  from atherston we turned east again into leicestershire to see bosworthfield famous for the great battle which put an end to the reign of richard iii and to the long and bloody contention between the red rose and the white or the two royal houses of york and lancaster which as fame tells us had cost the lives of    princes    earls and dukes  000 noblemen knights and gentlemen and  00000 of the common people we viewed the spot of ground where the battle was fought and at the town they showed us several pieces of swords heads of lances barbs of arrows pieces of poleaxes and suchlike instruments of death which they said were found by the country people in the several grounds near the place of battle as they had occasion to dig or trench or plough up the ground  within three miles of this place is an ancient market town of the same name lying on a hill in a very healthy and pleasant air the soil all round it is fruitful both for tillage and pasture  hence i passed directly north to ashby de la zouch on the skirts of derbyshire a very pleasant town lying between two parks it consists but of one street in which stands a pretty stone cross the church is large and handsome and it is famous for four good horsefairs in the year  we then passed southeast into leicestershire the earl of stamford has a good old huntingseat on this side of the country called bradgate and a fine park at grooby but they were too much out of our way so we came on through a fine forest to leicester  leicester is an ancient large and populous town containing five parishes it is the capital of the county of that name and stands on the river soar which rises not far from highcross just mentioned it is a borough and corporation town whereof the chief magistrate is a mayor who is assisted by a recorder aldermen and common council here are three markets weekly well supplied with provisions a considerable manufacture is carried on here and in several of the market towns around for weaving of stockens by frames and one would scarce think it possible so small an article of trade could employ such multitudes of people as it does for the whole county seems to be busied in it as also nottingham and derby of which hereafter  the county of leicester is in part also taken up in country business more particularly in breeding and feeding cattle most of the gentlemen are grasiers and in some places the grasiers are so rich that they grow gentlemen it is not an uncommon thing for grasiers here to rent farms from  00 l to  000 l a year  the sheep bred in this county and lincolnshire which joins to it are without comparison the largest and bear not only the greatest weight of flesh on their bones but also the greatest fleeces of wool on their backs of any sheep in england and hence it is that these counties becomes vast magazines of wool for the rest of the nation nor is the wool less fine because of the great quantity but as it is the longest staple as the clothiers call it so it is the finest wool in the whole island some few places excepted such as leominster in herefordshire the south downs in sussex and such little places where the quantity is small and insignificant compared to this part of the country for the sheepbreeding country reaches from the river anchor on the border of warwickshire to the humber at the farthest end of lincolnshire which is near  00 miles in length and from the bank of trent in lincolnshire and leicestershire to the bank of ouse bordering on bucks bedford cambridge and huntingdon shires above  0 miles in breadth  these are the funds of sheep which furnish the city of london with their large mutton in such prodigious quantities there are indeed a few sheep of a large breed which are brought up from romney marsh and the adjoining low grounds in kent and sussex but they are few and indeed scarce worth naming compared to what are produced in these counties  the horses bred or rather fed here are the largest in england being generally the great black coach and drayhorses of which so great a number are continually sent up to london that one would think so little a spot as this of leicestershire could not possibly produce so many but the adjoining counties of northampton and bedford have of late come into the same business the chief supply however is from this county from whence the other counties rather buy them and feed them up as jockeys and chapmen than breed them up from their beginning  in the southwest part of the country rise four considerable secondrate rivers which run every one a directly contrary course in a most remarkable manner    the avon which runs by rugby and goes away to warwick southwest  of this river the poet elegantly sings yet rolling avon still maintains its stream swelled with the glories of the roman name strange power of fate unshaken moles must waste while things that ever move for ever last     the soar which runs by leicester and goes away to the trent northwest    the anchor which runs by nuneaton and goes away to atherston north and so on to tamworth west    the welland which runs by harborough and goes away to stamford northeast  i ought not to omit observing that as the town of leicester was formerly very strong and well fortified being advantageously situated for that purpose the river covering it half way about so it was again fortified in the late unhappy wars and being garrisoned by the parliament forces was assaulted by the royalists who after an obstinate defense took it sword in hand which occasioned a terrible slaughter they preserve here a most remarkable piece of antiquity being a piece of mosaic work at the bottom of a cellar it is the story of acteon and his being killed by his own hounds wrought as a pavement in a most exquisite manner the stones are only of two colors white and brown and very small  the castle here before it was dismantled was a prodigious building it was the court of the great henry duke of lancaster who added to it    acres of ground which he enclosed with a very strong wall of square stone    feet high and called it his novum opus vulgarly now the newark where the best houses in or near leicester are and do still continue extraparochial the hall and kitchen of this place remain still entire as testimonies of the grandeur of the whole the former being so lofty and spacious that the courts of justice which in assizetime are held there are at such a distance as to give no disturbance to one another there are several gateways to enter this palace and that which faces the east has an arch that is deemed a curious piece of architecture over which in the tower is kept the magazine for the militia of the county  beneath this castle was a very fair collegiate hospital in the church whereof henry earl of lancaster and henry his son the first duke of it were buried the hospital was built by the duke in his old age and appropriated for the maintenance of  00 poor people in which also he placed a dean and twelve canons prebendaries with as many vicars and other ministers and ten able women to serve and assist the poor and weak this with divine service therein does in some measure still subsist by certain stipends paid out of the duchy of lancaster another hospital built by sir william wigston in the reign of king henry viii is in a very flourishing condition there  leicester is the ratae coritanorum of the romans the trace of the roman wall is discoverable without difficulty especially in the gardens about senvygate with a ditch which is very visible this was repaired by edelfleda a noble saxon lady in the year     the old work called jewrywall is composed of ragstone and roman brick  not far off is a place called holybones where abundance of bones of oxen have been dug up which were the remains of the roman sacrifices  at leicester many roman coins are found a pot full of them was dug up at the entrance into whitefriers there are also many great foundations at st mary de prees abbey a body was dug up supposed to be cardinal wolseys  since its dissolution it has been made a dwelling house which has nothing left but the naked walls and the spot of the abbey is turned into a garden the only thing worth seeing in it is a pleasant terracewalk supported by an embattled wall with lunets hanging over the river and shaded with trees  in the time of the saxons st margarets church was an episcopal see and was very fine here say some king richard iii was buried  half a mile southward from leicester upon the edge of the meadows is a long ditch called rawdikes on the banks of which according to tradition king charles i stood to behold the storm of the town that prince lay at the vicaragehouse at elston  southeast of leicester lies billesden a market town of no note and further south still is hallaton another town noted for its poverty in the midst of a rich soil  the fosseway leads from hence through the northwest part of this county but entering nottinghamshire it inclines northeast through the vale of belvoir or as it is commonly called of bever to newark in all this long tract we pass through a rich and fertile country having in our coast northeastward the noble river trent for twenty miles together often in our view  but some miles north of leicester the river wrek which comes from the northeast and the stour which runs northwest form a kind of y the stour from leicester southward making the tail in the course lastmentioned we passed through montsorrel and loughborough both market towns lying on the fosse which runs nearly parallel with the stour and makes one side of the y the first is situate under a great eminence and has a good stone bridge over the stour and the other is seated among rich meadowground and is a fine agreeable town and on the wrek which makes the other side of the y stand melton mowbray a large well built considerable market town situate in a fertile soil almost surrounded with a little river called the eye over which it has two fine bridges and also waltham on the would  i e on the downs which is but a mean market town  belvoircastle standing within lincolnshire but on the edge of leicestershire is a truly noble situation though on a very high precipice it is the ancient seat of the dukes of rutland a family risen by just degrees to an immense height both of honor and wealth i shall mention the house again in my return out of lincolnshire  bingham in nottinghamshire lying in our way to newark we passed through it it is but a small market town but is noted for a parsonage of great value  at newark one can hardly see without regret the ruins of that famous castle which through all the civil war in england kept a strong garrison for the king to the last and so cut off the greatest pass into the north that is in the whole kingdom nor was it ever taken till the king pressed by the calamity of his affairs put himself into the hands of the scots army which lay before it and then commanded the governor to deliver it up after which it was demolished that the great road might lie open and free and it remains in rubbish to this day  the castle was built here by alexander bishop of lincoln in the reign of king stephen and the town took its name from that new work  this town was certainly raised from the neighboring roman cities and has been walled about with their remains the northern gate is composed of stones seemingly of a roman cut and perhaps they had a town here for many antiquities are found about it here are two fine stone crosses a gentleman digging to plant some tree by the fosse road side discovered four urns in a strait line and at equal distances in one of which was a brass lar or housholdgod an inch and half long but much consumed by rust  newark is a very handsome well built town situate on the trent under the government of a mayor and    aldermen the marketplace is a noble square and the church is large and spacious with a curious spire which were not grantham so near might pass for the finest and highest in all this part of england the trent divides itself here and makes an island and the bridges lead just to the foot of the castle wall so that while this place was in the hands of any party as i have before hinted there was no traveling but by their leave but all the traveling into the north at that time was by nottingham bridge  i am sir yours etc  the end of the second volume index to the second volume a abbot of glastenbury his prodigious state and riches page     0 his inn
