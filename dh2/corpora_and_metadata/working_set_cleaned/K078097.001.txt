murmur won his eye to sleep but left his fancy waking in a dream the god of day with full meridian blaze seemed to assume his function over the skies when lo the earth divided through the cleft a gush of radiance dimmed the noontide sun in structure all of diamond self poised amid redundant light a chariot hung triumphal twelve transparent horses breathed beams from their nostrils dancing beams of day shook from their manes in lineaments of man changed to immortal there the mighty soul of spartas king apparent shone his wounds shot forth a splendor like the clustring stars which on orions chest

starting in his ken discerns no other than the real scene of shadows brown from close embowring wood than distant mountains and the spangled face of heaven reflected from the silver stream but pensive

oracular is worshipped here they traced barbarian violence profane consumed were hamlets temples levelled to the dust the statues broken each religious bower a burning mass of embers wrapped in smoke with cinders strewn so glows the region round portentous aetna or vesuvius dire deaths flaming cauldrons when their stony ribs and minral bowels liquefied by fire overwhelm the fields by nature left

timon comes sage priest of phoebus magistrate unsoild the public host of athens to the plain descending swift with followers who bear his buckler spear and armor on his head were ashes sprinkled rent his garb presaged some black disaster what malignant dart of fortune wounds thee aeschylus aloud while by the hand cecropias host he pressed to him the delphian from deserted roofs depopulated streets i come to hail thee bound by hospitable ties my friend thee dear to phoebus by minerva graced thy countrys goddess me thou often saw a parent blessed in amaranthas bloom yet ripe in virtue her presenting prayer with votive flowers before minervas shrine this very hour barbarians have enthralled borne in my sight precipitate away o wife lamented gathered in thy prime by ruthless pluto in elysian groves how shall i meet thee and the tidings bear of thy lost child to servitude a prey to violation doomed yet more the rage of these invaders who have spoiled our fields defaced our temples driven to sheltering caves to pathless cliffs our populace dismayed is now ascending to insult the fane with sacrilegious violence to seize the accumulated offerings by the great and good from age to age devoted there he scarce had finished when the earth beneath rocked from her center in convulsive throes from pole to pole the ethereal concave groaned night from her cavern with gigantic steps bestrode the region lifting high as heaven her broad infernal palm whose umbrage hides the throne of light while glancing through the rifts of her black mande overlaid with clouds blue vapors traild their fires the double head of tall parnassus reeling from the crag unloosd two fragments mountainous in bulk they roll to delphi with a crashing sound like thunder nigh whose burst of ruin strikes the shattered ear with horror thus the bard unmoved while round him every face is pale not on our heads these menaces are thrown by ireful nature and portentous heaven the unrighteous now the oppressor of mankind the sacrilegious in this awful hour alone should feel dismay my delphian host who knows but thundering joves prophetic son now vindicates his altar in his name now calls the turbid elements to war what shrieks of terror fill thy native streets the hills with barbarous dissonance of cries the caverns howl athenians be prepared best so when armed then timon case thy limbs

punishment the foes unnervd distracted unresisting deemed the warriors two celestials from above cased in vulcanian panoply to wage the war of gods the whole athenian train in equal fervor with barbarian blood distain their weapons so from forests drear when barren winter binds the foodful earth enraged by famine trooping wolves invade a helpless village unwithstood they range with greedy fangs and dye with human gore the snowenvelopd ways the delphian race by fear so lately to the neighboring hills and caves restrained forsake their sheltering holds in clusters rushing on the foes dismayed accomplish their defeat the athenian chief triumphant red with massacre admits a persian youth to mercy who his shield and sword surrenders persian do thou hope thy flowring bloom shall ripen to enjoy a length of days severe his victor spoke then to my questions utter words sincere reveal thy name thy fathers where encamps the host of xerxes whither does he point his inroad next to violate

ah little now avails the illustrious current of argestes blood to me a captive less the name i bear of artamanes by the kings decree that we were sent that i unwilling came is truth sincere our leader slain the heaps of these disfigured carcases have made their last atonement to the insulted god the king in rich orchomenus i left who through boeotia meditates to march against the athenians he alas

the bard in these sententious strains not endless sunshine is the lot of man nor ever blooming seasons night succeeds the day as day the night rude winter frowns fair summer smiles thus variable the mind not less than human fortune feels the strife of truth and error which alternate reign the arbiters of nature dark the deed a deed of gloomy night when envy forced the best athenian from his natal roof but light will soon return though sparta break her promise pledged though false boeotia prop a foreign throne still athens will sustain herself and greece will retribution pay to aristides and her morn dispel the mist of error with a glorious blaze no more  my duty calls me to the fane they move and passing by minervas grove two monuments of terror see there stopped the massy fragments from parnassus rent an act of nature by some latent cause disturbed tremendous over barbarian ranks the ruins down the sacred way had rolled leaving its surface horrible to sight such as might startle wars

enjoined by holy form to scenes far different sweet castalias fount and grove resorts with pure ablution to redeem from dust and slaughter his polluted limbs to holy eyes obscene beside the fane

achaias wide expanse of coast with towers and cities crowned the marble fount on either side is skirted thick by groves of ancient laurel with luxuriant arms in glossy green attired there phoebus pride of parian quarries stands a form divine in act to draw an arrow from the case loose hanging over his shoulder and in look serene but stern his worshippers to guard as if the pythian serpent were in sight he meditates the combat here disarmed his limbs from all the impurities of mars the athenian purges menial care supplies a garment silverwhite an olive branch his suppliant hand sustains he seeks the fane he mounts the steps magnificent the gates on sounding hinges turn their brazen valves across an area vast with solemn shade of massy columns bordered slow he moves his manly frame procumbent at the mouth of that abyss oracular whose fume breathes wild sensation through the pythian maid with hands outstretchd he offers up this prayer o vanquisher of python seed of jove whose eleutherian might the tyrant dreads bright power of day dispenser of that fire which kindles genius in the human breast god of that light diffusing through the soul the rays of truth and knowledge

towers must perish jove severe so wills yet granting at his daughters suit her people refuge under walls of wood but shun the myriads of terrific horse which on your fields an eastern mars will range she ceased the athenian notes her answer down to one the most entrusted of his train he gives the tablet back to athens fly he said the son of neocles alone by his unbounded faculties can pierce the hidden sense of these mysterious strains all which of xerxes thou have heard report i must depart to elis  must thou go dejected timon then what safety here for me remains barbarians will return my countrymen disheartened as before resort to caverns though the god has saved his shrine the rest of phocis lies a prey boeotia locris doris to the foe yet what have i o aeschylus to dread i have no other child for savage force to violate in amarantha lost my joy my hope are vanished and the hand which lays me breathless will befriend me best the athenian here unmanly is despair a noxious weed whose growth my delphian host let courage wither phoebus has denounced the waste of athens hopeful i forebode that prouder walls and battlements will lift their heads for ages and that eye of greece with inextinguishable ray surpass its former luster quit this dangerous place with us embarking borrow help from time safe counselor to wisdom you the race of holy delphi should the foe return again dispersing to your caves rely on your protecting god not versed alone in holy rites in arms and council tried a chief like timon fame forbids to hide his dignity in caverns  timon here thou shall conduct me thou my friendly star meantime selected messengers i send the needful barks at cirrha to prepare now from the temple under timons roof admitted vigorous with refection due of rest and food to cirrha they proceed with artamanes ready are the barks the gale propitious calm the watery plain when like the feathered sojourners who leave their late abode on winters bleak approach to wing their flight for climates more benign these with extended canvas quit the port and doubling round achaia cut the main to sacred pisa on their way the harp of aeschylus preluding to the strain which on his banks alpheus was to hear relieves the sailor toiling at his oar enchants the wind retentive of the sounds which harmonize his breath if round the keel of sweet arion dolphins ever played or blithsome nereids to the pleasing mood of orpheus danced while argo ploughd the deep they now had felt controulment as in bonds not on their pliant azureglossy fins disporting light but rigid with amaze at this majestic muse yet sounding verse in solemn cadence to the deeptond lyre which could the boisterous mariner subdue the ear of timon languid by despair rejects attentive to his grief alone which sighs within society is pain even with his friend a solitary couch he seeks recumbent not reposing there consumes the hours in pertinacious woe which sheds no tear if wearied nature sinks his sleep is troubled visions of the night appal his spirit starting he forsakes a thorny pillow rushes on the deck with lamentations to the midnight moon alarmed the athenian chief approaching seized on timons hand with earnest looks inquired why thus complaining he disturbs the calm from his own pillow chacing due repose ah i have seen my daughter he replies have seen her twice  where seen her all distressed the athenian questions  on a rock she stood a naked rock the parent wild exclaims unloosd her zone dishevelled was her hair the ravisher was nigh on sight of me who no assistance from the shore could reach o father father i am shamed deflowerd but here will end my sorrows and disgrace she said and plunged precipitate i saw her body swallowed by the greedy surge unwept deprived of sepulture to float illusion all the bard consoling spoke the phantom offspring of distempered sleep a second time the frantic fire pursues did amarantha meet my aching sight then like an eastern concubine attired her head was blazoned with barbaric gems with golden gloss her wanton garment waved with her despoiler hand in hand she walked disclaimed her father and her fathers gods oh then i wished her on the waves again to parch in winds or sat some vultures beak the youthful captive artamanes roused stands nigh in generous tears to him the bard ingenuous persian check thy tears and lend thy hand benign committed to his couch him watch and fuccour  hourly was performed the pious office noblest delphians round assist in tears while now the moonlight twice danced on the billows on the second morn they land in elis fame had gone before promulgating the valor which avenged the delphian god prophetic light to man even more than jove in ammons libyan shrine or dodonaean groves a shining car waits on the shore a herald there salutes the warrior bard divine athenian hail hail righteous captain of a righteous band these olive crowns to thee and them i bear so have the sage hellanodics ordained who to their just tribunal through my voice invite thy presence aeschylus receives the victors chaplet and ascends the car along alpheus to the olympian lists he passes through spectators all arrayed in garlands too and numerous like the flowers embellishing the rivers fragrant sides or like the pebbles in his murmuring bed the approach of aeschylus is known between two rows of victors in their olive crowns he over the sanded area greets the thrones where graced with scepters magisterial sat the elean judges standing on the car to them uprising from their seats he spoke if to have fought for delphi and her god deserve this chaplet what superior praise to him is due who voluntary died for lacedaemon but he claims no more than emulation from the sons of greece like him to save their countries and their laws he has his honors in the blessed abodes from him i come deputed hear in me leonidas a vision as of gods to me late slumbering on ilissus rose in semblance rose leonidas begirt with all the virtuous partners in his fate before me earth divided through the cleft a gushing radiance dimmed the eye of noon in structure all of diamond selfpoisd amid redundant light a chariot hung triumphal twelve transparent horses breathed beams from their nostrils dancing beams of day shook from their manes in lineaments of man changed to immortal with a shape enlarged a stature lengthened there the mighty soul of spartas king apparent shone his wounds shot forth a starlike splendor round in cars triumphal too arrangd the stately forms of those whom virtue led to share his doom and consecrate thermopylae to fame to me these words the glorious shape addressed go to the sage hellanodics the just elean judges of olympian palms in that wide concourse celebrate my death let my example general greece inspire to face her danger let the spartan shield protect the athenians else i died in vain attention mute the hellanodics command the thickning crowd is hushed the bard proceeds while inspiration swells his copious breast flames in his eye and thunders from his voice parnassian phoebus he invoked the power of prophecy and song his aid is due in celebration of the man who heard the oracle from delphi and obeyed a king derived from hercules must die for lacedaemon who obedient heard leonidas he left his household gods his wife beloved his offspring at the gate of greece thermopylae he fought he fell with him what heroes alpheus maron bled there agis there dioneces the seer megistias bold diomedon the youth of dithyrambus thespias hoary chief demophilus for you they all expired rise greeks revenge their fall in that revenge your laws your manners and religion save you who aspire to these olympic wreaths the brightest guerdon to a grecian brow yet will you linger till barbaric arms annihilate the olympiad not to die leonidas invites no greeks to live surmounting foes enervate by the dread his death impressed to fill your cup of life with virtuous glory to enjoy your hopes in peace in years and merit then mature be his companions in eternal bliss such was the substance but in swelling phrase at large full tide of poesy and zeal flowed his hightond enthusiastic song end of the first book the athenaid book the second the inspiring measures close to arms to arms innumerable mouths concurrent sound to arms to arms reply the pillard isles of joves olympian temple down his banks to distant neptune glad alpheus wafts the glorious clamor through the assembly vast meantime an elevated form is seen with gracious gesture animating look approaching now before the elean thrones of solemn judgment he majestic stands known for the man by themis placed in rank above his fellow mortals archon once of athens now an exile him the chief among the grave hellanodics addressed hail aristides on the olympian games thy presence throws new dignity what crown can they provide to equal thy desert while others court the prize of strength and skill activity and valor in the lists of virtue only aristides strives with him on earth competitor is none him jove sole perfect judge of gods and men can recompense alone he scornful views ambitious heroes who assume the names of thunderbearers vanquishers of towns and ravagers of kingdoms vain attempt in feeble man to imitate in power the inimitable gods on thee he casts an eye delighted thee by every tongue proclaimed the just thee emulating heaven where mortals may in goodness yet our voice shall what we can decree dispraise to those whose envy wronged that sacred head of thine forbear that censure aristides spoke though liberty may err through jealous care that jealous care far oftner saves a state than injures private worth that i forgave my condemnation be my witness jove whom i departing from my native soil implored that athens never might feel the loss of aristides to confirm that prayer i have employed my exile not in quest of splendid refuge in the courts of kings but through each city with unwearied steps have passed exhorting stimulating greece to bold defense i gladly am forestalled here by a noble countryman whose arm at marathon was famed whose attic lays immortalize the brave i now invoke not with less fervor though in humbler phrase the patriots there triumphant even in death the manes of leonidas of all whose generous blood newspilt in freedoms cause thermopylae beholds to spread abroad their glorious spirit and exalt your minds above the sense of danger now the weal of general greece a general effort claims march to the plain ye doric warriors mount your decks the athenians with united arms support no longer in that isthmian fence your trust reposing were the wall of brass were adamant the rampart if the power of athens once extinguished leave your coasts defenseless soon to pelops isle the foe like death a thousand avenues will find he ceased a second acclamation rends the sky again the olympian temple groans in replication and alphean banks reverberate the sound the attic bard meantime oerspent with labor of the mind and voice loud straining to the tranquil porch of jove is lightly borne nor knows the hands benevolent and pious which sustain his languid burden till these friendly words in tones remembered dissipate his trance does aeschylus forget me o recall melissas brother and oileus son whose locrian

illustrious medon hail how fares melissa how thy native land she rests i hope on oeta still secure returns the locrian when laconias king was slain and i commanded to retreat charged with a solemn notice to her state that he expired obedient to the laws my life devoted to avenge his blood i saved oerpowring xerxes soon reduced the locrians dorians every northern greek in time my fathers

minor king son of divine leonidas disdains our just complaint the ephori confine to this contracted region all their care save aemnestus generous often he mourned in vain his torpid colleagues he reproved disgusted there i joined these solemn games where in contention of the warlike spear i proved a victor olivebound my head on future fields its freedom shall maintain else with my late preservers fate in view shall dying roll this chaplet in the dust repair with me to athens cries the bard sage is that counsel aristides near subjoins time presses aeschylus embark aeginas hospitable round supplies my place of rest  now swift the athenian band with medons seek their delphian barks again while aristides holds an inland course still to his country meditating good of his own wrongs forgetful as he roamd from state to state his eloquence instilled the love of freedom horror at her loss unchanging hatred to monarchal sway with concord valor fortitude and zeal for greece in danger from his wonted seat in heaven so phoebus patient and resigned an exile wandered on the earth below beneficent and helpful there diffused his light of science with salubrious skill imparted health and taught the varied use of lenient roots and plants the delphian keels meantime are loosened from elean sands with sails outstretchd for athens on his couch still timon lies despairing near him watch the chiefs humane in kind officious care the persian captive from his forehead wipes the dews of anguish with a sudden start him now the delphian erring thus bespoke oh alexander thou have lost my son thy dear betrothed the land of phocis lost her noblest virgin reach my arms  i see the ravisher before me though he frowns begirt with savage multitudes my sword shall reach his barbarous heart here medon turns to aeschylus the sight of delphis chief so nobly excellent so honored loved by all resorting to consult his god a sight once grateful pierces now my soul with agony how often has music soothed distempered bosoms let thy tuneful chords medicinally sweet apply their aid to him the bard my harmony his ear but late rejected meliboeus try the softer sounds which pan has taught the swains a modulation by melissa taught i will essay the obedient swain replies he said and lightly touched his warbling flute like fountains rilling or mellifluous notes of birds a soft and lulling flow attund the ambient air at first the afflicted man paused in attention soon a trickling tear bedewed his beard the remedy was changed to pain and thus he recommencd his moan thou amarantha too could wake the soul of music melting in thy parents ear refining joyful seasons or the hours of care beguiling in a foreign clime hang up thy harp sad captive let thy hand forget her skill nor charm barbarian minds but hark i hear the ruffian slave he calls resume thy harp some chosen hymn of greece such as delighted phoebus chaunt to me me now thy god o alexander fly redeem thy love apollo who could hurl parnassian summits on a host of foes make me thy instrument of wrath my nerves convert to pierceless adamant my lance point with thy fathers lightning me thy priest sprung from an old heroic sacred line thou should avenge but vengeance is too late my daughter yields a minstrel to her lord to her deflowrer with obsequious art the grecian chords she prostitutes and smiles to see my sufferings  during this distress with canvas pressed the squadron bounds along by coryphasium by messenes gulf in nestors pylian kingdom by the peak of taenarus projecting over a cave nights gloomy chamber fabled to descend low as plutonian regions thrice the morn serenely smiled ere maleas top their sails oershades laconian promontory bleak the residence of storms five distant masts are now descried when aeschylus bespake the locrian chief not friendly are those decks our navy since thermopylae was forced to salamis retiring leaves the foes at large to range the sea thy counsel give to some laconian harbor shall we steer or wait their coming here oileus son thou art my leader thee propitious mars on land and main with equal powers endues how can i counsel stranger to the waves at thy commandment to retreat or fight behold me ready  then by mars replies the warrior bard as no resistless force bears down against us yet insulting hoists a threatening signal delphians rest the oar provide your arms athenians locrians arm this said his pinnace launched in haste conveyed his orders round to form the embattled line six were the vessels lo a stately bark in regal pendants leads the opponent van as when a vernal suns precarious beam is intercepted by a sudden cloud whose turgid folds are overcharged with hail some palace broad impenetrably roofd defies the clattring ineffectual drift which harmless melts away  so flew a shower of missive arms of arrows javelins darts with pebbles whirling from the forceful sling on grecian helms and implicated shields but innocently fell now side to side the chieftains grappled and gigantic death to either deck outstretchd his purple feet malignant art no engine has devised to man destructive like his own fell hand in serried fight but slaughter now began to pause in wonder while the asian chief whose blazoned armor beamed with gold engaged cecropias hardy vetran foot to foot with falchion falchion shield encountring shield so in the season when lascivious heat burns in their veins two branchingheaded stags of all the herd competitors for sway long with entangled horns persist in strife nor yield nor vanquish stand in gaze the rest expecting which by conquest shall assume the mastery of all now timon roused with meliboeus and the captive youth starts from his pillow they attain the poop which instant boarded from an eastern ship by hostile arms is held brave medon quits his former station aeschylus he leaves a firm defender there his falchion keen aloft he waves as some tremendous shark who with voracious jaws resistless foams along the main and finny tribes devours or drives before him on the sunbright waves where late secure they wantoned  medons might prevailing thus the steerage heaps with dead though not in time

that stormy shore and hold a distant course over timons fate the athenian now finds leisure to lament with medon medon with responsive grief for meliboeus by return of dawn the waters calmed invite the vigorous oars to recommence their progress coasting down laconias seabeat verge they wear the day then resting moor in cynosuras port from aeschylus in sighs these accents broke here aesculapius by his powerful art which dared revive departed breath in man offending pluto thunderpiercd by jove lodged his own clay in cynosuras mold o now to immortality preferred kind god of medicine would thou hear my suit thou should restore leonidas to warm unfeeling sparta then thy delphian sire the menaced doom of athens would revoke nor i besprinkle with indignant tears laconias shore o locrian guest i called thy welcome feet to athens thou may view for so the oracle to me denounced her towers in dust  minervas towers to fall has phoebus doomed the locrian chief exclaimed i who have lost my country yet can find a tear for athens i attest the gods as in one vessel aeschylus we steer together now thy fortune i will share and down her stream however the tempest roar with thee embarked will never quit thy side the tragic bard unbends his mournful brow thus answring generous medon i confess approaching nearer to my seat of birth i dropped a tear of anguish nature wept at sad forebodings of destruction there but know a true athenian never desponds abandoned by allies condemned by heaven to see their city burnt that gallant race will yet assert their liberty will save even faithless

partakes not with her wearied clay in sleep repose the cavern to her view appears in vast dimension to enlarge the sides retire the ascending roof expands all changed to crystal where pellucid walls expose to sight the universe around thus did a dream invade the mighty breast of that long matchless conqueror who gave italias clime a spoil to punic mars when on the margin of iberus lay the slumbering chief and eagerly to birth the vast conception of his pregnant mind was struggling now mardonius to himself seems roving over the metamorphosd cave orbicular above an opening broad admits a flood of light and gentlest breath of odorifrous winds amid the blaze full on the center of a pavement spread beyond whatever portentous egypt saw in thebes or memphis fame presiding there gigantic

detested athens shall they share the clemency of xerxes in despite of this our theban host who faithful gives such wholesome counsel sovereign when i brought thy condescension late to spartas king among the grim assembly in his tent diomedon demophilus i saw with dithyrambus men preferring death to amity with thee commanders all of these malignant cities  xerxes here approving leontiades thy words i hear masistius thee my servant loves mardonius always victor in my name yet learn at last o satrap who do wear the fullest honors to partake with me what i inherit from darius hate inflexible

near the banks of desolate cephissus halting sat the king retarding nights affrighted steeds the conflagration wide of crumbling towers of ruined temples of the crackling groves of villages and towns

eastern waves thy shores affronted with their hostile beaks and burnt thy town of sardis at my call ghost of my father lift thy awful brow remembring now the athenians see thy son on their presumptuous heads retaliate flames deprived of burial shall their bodies leave pale specter here to wail their city fallen and wander through its ruins  closing here his barbarous lips the tyrant

meditating there fresh woes to men than oedipus more wise the interpreter of oracles is nigh soon will the son of neocles expel thee from thy hold by policy too deep for thy barbarian council to explore before the prytanaeum stops the car now savage bands enclose that reverend seat of judgment there mardonius waits the king pleased with his care salutes him thou have long sweat under harness

named thy ruling admiral the kings of tire of sidon carias princess and the rest i held a council they concurred to fight and by one effort terminate the war all but the queen from whose ingenuous mouth will i though differing faithfully relate each argument each word  mardonius tell the king she said what peril i foresee from this attempt his ships defeated leave his host endangered ever bold the greeks are desperate now the want of sustenance will soon disperse them to their several homes the seas entire dominion to the king will then be left whole armies then embarked through inlets free may pour on pelops isle whose coast i newly have explored with care mardonius thou art eager do not trust in multitude full many in the fleet are false are cowards let our sovereign shun precipitation short delay at least is safe a naval combat lost is bane a greater bane delay argestes here who reading artful in the royal eye determination for a naval fight his malice thus on artemisia vents my liege forgets that carias queen derives her blood from grecian fountains is it strange she should confine thy formidable hand and so preserve her kindred  stern the king though i reject her counsel to forbear the fight none better will that fight sustain than she whose zeal fidelity approved and valor none can equal but the son of gobryas go mardonius see the fleet prepared by morning let argestes burn the citadel and temples i confer on him that office  uttring this he turned apart forlorn argestes hence presaged decline of regal favor centring all in gobryas son who fiercely thus pursued thou

eclipsed at intervals are heard the hollow sound of columns prostrate laid the crash of levelled walls of sinking roofs in massy ruin consternation cold benumbs the greek spectators all aghast except the athenians whose unshaken minds to this expected fate resigned their homes for independence gigantean ranged from ship to ship despair she drives ashore the timid leaders changing late resolves for generous combat into base retreat to seek the shelter of their native ports they clamor loud the admiral convenes a council him themistocles addressed now eurybiades to whose command i voluntary yielded from thy charge not less for athens than for general greece i claim a righteous and heroic part the promised fight in these auspicious streights which rendring vain the multitude of foes assure success but separate this fleet a hundred openings may barbarians choose to pelops region not on every spot an isthmian wall is placed deprived of all if to your succor we athenians lose all claim ye greeks be valiant for yourselves see attica in flames the temples razed the tombs defaced the venerable dust of our forefathers soatterd in the wind would you avoid calamities like these to sound instruction lean the almighty gods wise counsels bless with prosperous events to its own folly wilful blindness leave proud adimantus on his birth elate the admiral of corinth envying long cecropias name and power arose and spoke for public safety when in council meet men who have countries silence best becomes him who has none shall such presume to vote too patient spartan nay to dictate here who cannot tell us they possess a home for attica in flames her temples razed her tombs disfigured for the ignoble dust of thy forefathers scattered in the wind thou lowborn son of neocles must greece her welfare hazard on a single day which unsuccessful endless ruin brings cleander heard troezenes youthful chief warm was his bosom eloquent his tongue strongnervd his limbs well exercised in arms preventing thus themistocles he spoke though blood corinthian be of noblest dye baseborn the soul when folly is her sire absurdity and malice no reply deserve from thee athenian thee more wise more valiant more distinguished in thyself than all the vaunted progeny of gods did you not mourn ye deities to see a nation you created with their soil forsake that ancient land or not admire your greatest work the conduct of that man who such a race from such endearing homes wives husbands elders infants maidens youths in generous quest of liberty could lead do you not look indignant down to hear such venomous reproaches on his worth a wrong to greece her savior him i call as yet i trust his dictates will prevail while he declaimed themistocles who scorned the insolent corinthian sat and scanned the looks of all his penetrating fight could read the thoughts of men the major part he saw averse to battle spartas chief uncertain cold and slow affecting here decisive looks and scorn of more debate thus brief he closed athenians still possess a city buoyant on two hundred keels thou admiral of sparta frame thy choice fight and athenians shall thy arm sustain retreat athenians shall retreat to shores which bid them welcome to hesperian shores for them by ancient oracles reserved safe from insulting foes from false allies and eleutherian jove will bless their flight so said your own leonidas who died for public welfare you that glorious death may render spartans fruitless to yourselves this said he left the council not to fly but with his wonted policy compel the greeks to battle at a secret cove he held in constant readiness a skiff in persian colors masked he there embarked the most entrusted of his household charged with these instructions now return my love sicinus born a persian of my house not as a slave long habitant but friend my childrens tutor in my trust supreme to xerxes navy sail accost her chief in words like these  themistocles who leads athenian squadrons is the monarchs friend approved by this intelligence the greeks in consternation shortly will resolve to separate and fly let asias fleet her numbers round in diligence extend investing every passage then confused this whole consederated force of greece will sooner yield than fight and xerxes close at once so perilous a war  he ceased meanwhile the council wasted precious hours till eurybiades at length alarmed lest all the athenians should retreat incensed postpond the issue to the ensuing day themistocles retiring to his tent there found his wife his stratagem on wings of execution left his mind serene relaxed in thought he trifled with his boy young child who playful on the mothers lap soon as of xerxes earnest she inquired with frowning graces on his brow of down clenchd fast his infant hands the dame pursues o that the greeks would emulate this child clench fast their weapons and confront the foe did we abandon our paternal homes our nuptial chambers from the cradle snatch our helpless babes did tender maidens join unanimous the cry embark embark for salamis and freedom to behold the men debating so the attic wives are told uncertain if to fight or serve who are the cowards rather traitors say we will assail them as the trojan dames did polymestor royal thief who broke the holiest ties for gold  take comfort love all shall be well themistocles replied yes i in thee have comfort she proceeds thou can devise some artifice to urge even dastards on sicinus thou have sent i ask not whither  in a smile her lord with thy permission then the gods remain my confidents to ease thee i proclaim this boy the first of greeks he governs thee thou me i athens who shall govern greece as i am sure to circumvent the foes retiring seek the town console the dames thy husband never was so high in hope she pleased departing spoke to govern thee requires an art which never woman knew nor man most artful thou controllest all yet callst nay often seem thyself controlled she distant thus he meditates alone true when i seem controlled by others most then most assured my enterprise succeeds o liberal nature science arts acquired i little value while thy light supplies profuse invention let capricious chance with obstacles and dangers gird me round i can surmount them all nor peace nor war nor all the swift vicissitudes of time ever gave emergency a birth too strong for me to govern on this crisis hangs my future greatness whether joy or grief shall close the term of being none foreknow my penetrating spirit i will trust thus far prophetic for a time at least i will possess authority and power to fix a name enduring like the sun thus in his own strong faculties secure to rest he tranquil sunk and slept till dawn then early rose advancing from the shore a manly figure he observes the face wrapped in a mantle as dividing clouds reveal the unmuffled sun the mantle cast aside discovers the majestic front of aristides who the silence breaks dissensions past as puerile and vain now to forget and nobly strive who best shall serve his country aristides warns his ancient foe themistocles i hear thou givst the best of councils which the greeks reject through mean solicitude to fly weak men throughout these narrow seas the foe is stationd now preventing all escape themistocles though covetous of fame though envying power in others was not bred in horrid deserts not with savage milk of tigers nursed nor bore a ruthless heart he thus replied with gratitude this foe accepts thy welcome news thy proffered aid thy noble challenge in this glorious race be all our strife each other to surpass first know my inmost secrets if the streights are all invested with barbarian ships the act is mine of our intended flight i through sicinus have apprisd the foes of his success thee messenger i hail the exile then such policy denotes themistocles i praise the greeks have cause to bless thy conduct teach me now what task i can achieve to labor to advise with thee commanding solely to enjoy the secret pleasure of preserving greece is my pursuit the glory all be thine before the council show that honored face rejoins the chief report thy tidings there to preparation for immediate fight exhort such notice they would slight in me in thee all men believe  this said they moved them on their way myronides approached xanthippus cimon aeschylus and all the captains fixing reverential eyes on aristides this the wary son of neocles remarked he gains the town of salamis the council there is met to them the illustrious exile he presents at whose appearance all the assembly rise save adimantus fast by envy bound he sits morose illibral then the word as aristides was in act to speak thus takes boeotia attica reduced the dorians locrians you already know to me this morn intelligence arrived that thespia that platea were in flames all phocis conquered thus alone of greece the isle of pelops unsubdued remains for what is lost ye grecians must we face such mightier numbers while barbarian hate lurks in psyttalia watching for the wrecks of our defeated navy shall we pause now at the isthmus with united force to save a precious remnant landing there your sailors turn to soldiers oars to spears the only bulwark you have left defend then aristides ignominious flight necessity forbids aeginas shore last night i left from knowledge i report the hostile navy bars at either mouth the narrow straight between psyttalias isle and salamis where lie your anchored ships but shall the greeks be terrified what more can they solicit of propitious heaven than such deluded enemies to face who trust in numbers yet provoke the fight where multitude is fruitless  closing here the unassuming exile straight retired cleander entering heard while corinths chief blind with malignity and pride pursued her strength must greece for attica destroyed waste on the credit of a single tongue from athens banished swift cleander spoke is there in greece who doubts that righteous tongue save adimantus to suspect the truth of that illustrious exile were to prove ourselves both false and timid but enough of altercation from the fleet i come the words of aristides i confirm prepare to fight no passage have our ships but through embattled foes  the council rose in this tremendous season thronging round the accomplished son of neocles their hopes in his unerring conduct all repose thus on olympus round their father jove the deities collected when the war of earths gigantic offspring menaced

sublime in shifting strife by winds and billows governed may contend the sons of traffic on the solid plain the generous steed and soldier they alone thy glory must establish where no swell of fickle floods nor breath of casual gales assist the skilful coward and control by natures wanton but resistless might the brave mans arm unaided by her hand not one of these light mariners will face thy regal presence at the isthmian fence to that small part of yet unconquered greece the land of pelops seek the spartans there there let the slain leonidas revive with all his warriors whom thy power destroyed a second time their generous blood shall dye the sword of asia sons of those who tore the assyrian lydian scepters from their kings thy medes and persians whose triumphant arms from distant shores of hellespont have tamed such martial nations have thy trophies raised in athens bold aggressor they shall plant before thy sight on famed eurotas shore the imperial standard and repair the

triumphed whom to fame darius led and thou with recent wreaths o conqueror of athens have adorned since they are blameless though thy will decree thy own return and wisely would secure superfluous millions in their native homes before chill winter in his barren arms constrain the genial earth yet leave behind but thirty myriads of selected bands to my command i pledge my head that greece shall

king her infant train and this ingenuous youth with my best greetings say the athenian chief themistocles these pledges of his truth and friendship sends them rescued i restore him next will save his hellespontine bridge the greeks vindictive menace to destroy an enterprise of horror this my power my dictates singly can and shall impede till he in safety has regained his throne sandauce answers o thou generous greek to thee to thine may fortune never be cold but i partaker of imperial pomp in ease in safety nurtured who have deemed my state above the sorrows which torment inferior mortals when my soul reflects on this new lesson by misfortune taught reflects how lately on a field of blood young as i am i saw my husband fall my children doomed to sacrifice myself to endless bondage had not heaven achievd this marvel of compassion in a foe i o forgive me i suspect the lot of all even thine o prosperous godlike man may horomazes from thy head avert vicissitudes like mine may envious fate never bring sandauces gratitude to proof thou never want the pity thou have shown she ceased she wept when artamanes spoke her debt sandauce can discharge alone by grateful tears but i can promise more in persian thraldom lies a beauteous greek named amarantha delphian timons child for that bright maids redemption i am pledged to her afflicted sire thy goodness showerd on this excelling princess shall augment my zeal the obligation to repay by amaranthas freedom till that hour of retribution to thy virtues comes we will proclaim them nations shall admire themistocles and every heart abhor inhuman euphrantides now returned sicinus him they followed on her breast the lovely mother hushed her female babe but cold with horror at remembrance deep of her unmatched calamities that day she feebly falterd over the sandy beach while artamanes led in either hand the tripping boys themistocles remained in these reflections flowing from this proof of fortunes changes few in athens long sustain their greatness  but to muse on ills before they come both time and thought i waste content at present that esteem procured by this fair persian in her brothers court may prove a gain timothea now approached his hand affectionate she pressed and spoke how sudden thou my hospitable cares of their endearing object have deprived in woe how graceful is that eastern dame how young a mother on a widowed bed how early cast by fortune thou have sent sicinus with her everwatchful man some new contrivance thou do bring to birth thou smilst in silence listen then to me since aristides on this isle has shown that face revered when banished his recall the men of athens nay the women wish this by aminias to the assembled tribes laodice informs me will be moved in this expect myronides the brave xanthippus cimon aeschylus will join  so will thy husband interposed the chief i will forestall them not to others leave such merit with our people  she rejoined all will applaud thee now my anxious lord the second watch its measure has consumed the moon descends the sprightly birds are still dead sleep has laid the soldier on his shield the active sailor slumbers all forget the hardships rage and tumult of the day all but thyself reposing shall that mind continue ranging over the field of thought in pregnancy exhaustless till the lark salute the dayspring with his early song till thou unresting unrefreshd resume the statesmans troubles and the soldiers toils be counseled often the thunderbearing god to juno listens thou my voice obey he hears serene conducts her to repose as jove on ida by saturnia charmed confessed a rapture never felt before while lucid dew of odours from a cloud of gold distilled around him from the turf beneath his feet while hyacinths upsprung the unctuous lotos and the crocus gay to grace his secret tabernacle there of love celestial so the attic chief to his timothea in her chamber pure with bridal honors decked perfumed with flowers whatever the meads of salamis supplied his tender flame in winning language breathed whoever had whispered on our nuptial day that i should view thee in a time remote from that sweet era with superior joy i should have held him ignorant of love what is the cause timothea that i feel my bosom pierced by transport yet unknown that eastern fair delivered from distress appearing then the fairest of her sex thou do exceed timothea smiling spoke o thou artificer of sweetest wiles would thou seduce me into vain belief that i exceed sandauces youthful charms but would thou know my husband solemn here she modulates her accents would thou know why thou surveyst me with uncommon joy it is the conscience of a noble deed of gathered trophies never matched before creates this change the perils of this day were new to athens to thy race and me thy sword has rescued all increased thy fame thy heart exalted with increased delight through that bright medium of a happy mind thou look on every object  sure on me not less than others artless were these words by nature prompted natures noblest fire they ceased discourse her loftiness of mind his valor talents policy to love subside perhaps the first of human pairs who in the blessed assyrian garden met were not more happy in their first embrace than fair timothea and her conquering lord a pleasing stillness on the water sleeps the land is hushed from either host proceeds no sound no murmur with his precious charge embarked sicinus gently steers along the dip of oars in unison awake without alarming silence while the moon from her descending horizontal car shoots lambent silver on the humid blades which cleave the curling slood on carpets soft sandauces babes devoid of sorrow lie in sweet oblivious innocence composed to smiling slumber but the mothers breast admits no consolation when they skim psyttalias frith at memory severe of that disastrous isle she sudden sinks a lifeless image in the watchful arms of artamanes who had studied well her sorrows knew each tender thought and care humanity his tutor swift he calls sicinus friendly pilot stay thy course we must not leave autarctus in his gore behind lest grief incurable reside in this fair breast perhaps eternal shade in these extinguished eyes sicinus feels a sympathizing pain of persian stock himself a branch in attic soil maturd he stops the bark and lands the asian tents were still erect whence aristides comes in steel accoutred to salute the dawn then breaking him sicinus humbly greets requests obtains the body which conveyed on board he careful on the deck bespreads with canvass new impelled by active strokes of oars resumed the bounding vessel gains phalerons haven artemisia there whose vigilance augmented by defeat had kennd the bark while distant now arrests her further progress but no sooner hears the sad intelligence sicinus gives than swift descending where sandauce lay that mourning fair in friendly strains accosts o lift thy head thou daughter of a king our sovreigns sister sister to the man my soul revered to hyperanthes good the flower of asias princes in thy woes i sharing cordial cordially rejoice in thy redemption leave this doleful keel think of thy duty to approach the king thy other cares entrust to me  she said they row to shore to xerxes then retired the queen conducts sandauce and her train the princess thus to him amazed began a widowed sister late a wretched slave with these three orphans just redeemed from death sandauce greets her brother but her tongue would be disloyal to obtrude her tale her tedious tale of sorrows on his ear the preservation of her king demands his first attention that attention grant to him who comes deputed by a greek thy friend my guardian savior of those babes oh listen thy salvation from his lips receive fast bound by terror was the mouth of xerxes  then sicinus he who ranks among the greeks superior in command in talents prudence policy and arms themistocles these pledges of his truth and friendship sends them rescued he restores thee next will save thy hellespontine bridge the greeks vindictive menace to destroy an enterprise of horror which his power his dictates singly can and will impede till thou in safety have regained thy throne all from his presence straight the king commands save artemisia her in broken tones addresses queen of caria singly wise among my council pity not upbraid thy master suffering by his rash neglect of thy sage voice unutterable pangs he paused in torture prudent she replied without a cause the lord of nations droops mardonius well has counseled thy retreat who undertakes to finish what his sword has well begun through macedon and thrace this mighty war thy servant may succeed in whose behalf his masters thou will reap his fruits of glory if mardonius fail he the disgrace thy march commence by dawn appoint the fleets departure swift this night to guard with force collected and repaired the hellespontine bridge with grace accept the proffered service of the athenian chief load his returning messenger with gifts of royal price and o my gracious lord fraternal kindness on sandauce shower her gallant lord has perished in thy cause herself been menaced by a barbarous priest to see her children sacrificed a doom themistocles withstood and set them free as when a timid child perceives a cloud obscure the sky and hears the thunders peal he weeps he trembles but the cloud dispersed the clamor ceasing and the sun restored his wonted sport resumes forgetting fear so changed the monarch artemisia go he said the satraps instantly convene the athenian messenger argestes son again before us with sandauce call never will i deviate from thy counsels more first to sicinus entering he began say to thy sender i accept well pleased his service passed and proffers thou return to him ten golden talents thou shall bear thee from the depths of sorrow shall the king sandauce raise demand a present boon thou can not ask what xerxes will refuse by gratitude surmounting grief inspired moved to retaliate kindness in the shape herself had proved the generous suppliant thus in persian thraldom is a grecian maid of delphian lineage amarantha named her i demand of xerxes that my hand a captive daughter to a tender sire may render back from bondage free his head now in nicaea and thus far my debt of gratitude discharge in transport here admiring such perfection of the heart spoke artamanes ever live the king there is a captive whom the princess named  fly thou in search of this requested slave son of argestes interrupts the king let none withold her from sandauces power the female train before the cumbrous host shall move by dawn for thessaly there join the rest of asias dames behind us left on our late march the guard ten thousand horse thou artamanes shall command  he said they all retired a pensive grief oercasts sandauce moving with her children slow by slaves attended to the vacant tent autarctus late possessed argestes son observes her anguish penetrates her thoughts in guarded words then proffers this relief o fairest princess whose external form but half displays thy excellence of mind will thou forgive thy servant if he feels with thee a present sorrow which the heart fobids the tongue to name sandauce trust my pious service and those thoughts compose she weeping looks assent he speeds away but meets the body of autarctus borne by artemisias soldiers she at first with care concealed had ordered from the bark his precious relics these the noble youth with equal care delivers to that skill which with sabaean gums and scented growths of blessed arabia purifies the clay deprived of life and times consuming breath repels a regal car he next provides in full apparel of funereal pomp end of the seventh book the athenaid book the eighth the satraps now and leaders at the call of artemisia were collected round their monarch seated on his throne he spoke ye princes satraps heed our fixed decree our native asia wants her king by morn to susa we return but leave behind in greece mardonius and a chosen host of thirty myriads with command supreme with our imperial equipage and state him we invest to him submission pay as to our presence artemisia bear our sovereign pleasure to the naval chiefs that all abandon ever the dawn return phalerons port and hoist their sails to guard the hellespont but thou entrusted queen thy own tried squadron to spercheos bring whence thou must waft to ephesus a charge of high import the children of thy king he ceased a stranger cased in steel approached in look ferocious limbs and shape robust of stature huge the satraps looked amazed as were the immortals when the olympian steep ascending grim briareus first produced his mountainbulk and spread his hundred hands auxiliary to jove the warrior stood unbending far as nature would permit his rugged brow when crouching to the king o xerxes live for ever he began i am euboean demonax the prince of oreus late who earth and water sent acknowledging thy empire from my throne by cursed themistocles expelled i joined thy sheltering fleet at salamis i fought an aid of troops and treasure can replace me thy true vassal who will soon reduce the granary of athens to thy sway euboea fertile populous and rich the monarch thus mardonius thou have heard begin to use thy plenitude of power reject or favor at thy will this prayer mardonius then my sovereign liege the truth flows from his lips twelve thousand of thy host with mindarus commanding and of gold a hundred talents would be well bestowed on this important greek the king assents he rises all disperse mardonius now accosts the queen descending to the port alas how uncontrollable the will of xerxes must thou leave me since the day of salamis my best beloved of friends masistius whether by the waves devoured or slain or captive to my search is lost foe to inaction though composed and wise of courage prone to perilous attempts he would embark permitted by the king against my warm remonstrance would partake the naval conflict drooping while i doubt his preservation must i further lose thy fellowship auspicious generous queen yet stop a moment listen on the march to athens first reposing in a cave i had a dream perhaps a vision saw to me presaging glory  but success was wrapped in clouded mystery my heart teems with illboding thoughts yet shall not faint at least impart thy wishes ere thou sailst thy last instructions fortunate thy voice benign to me repeat one parting strain if i successful to thy presence bring the palms of conquest say accomplished queen thou will accept them with a gracious hand if unsuccessful i the forfeit pay of this frail being as becomes the brave say thou will praise mardonius sage and grave she answers first despair not to regain the good masistius at the worst endure that common lot the death of dearest friends with patience long thy courage i have praised now moderate the flame against a foe not less discreet than disciplined and bold nor let the gloom of superstition awe thy noble ardour on the sharpest sword the strongest arm on prudence martial skill not dreams and visions looks the goddess fame if artemisias wishes can avail be sure to prosper prospring here to soar above the flight of cyrus  she departs behind her like the sinking globe of day she leaves a trail of radiance on his soul but to protect him from returning shade her light should never forsake him never set over generous cares not thus argestes broods within his tent he meditates concealed by struggling pride tormented thus he strives to sooth her pangs i see my power eclipsed mardonius governs power thou fleeting gleam thee i possess no longer why regret when amaranthas beauty can exchange thy thorns for lilies to my own domain i will transport her sipylus has flowers to drop perfumes in amaranthas walk pactolus hermus my subjected streams shall furnish gold her gems shall india send to deck that form and i in pleasures folds forget ambition stranger to the peace which honor yields libidinous in thought the statesman thus would cheat his baffled pride accursed of men who borrowed from one vice his medicine for another both deform his ravaged bosom in alternate strife flagitious parent rivalling in love his eldest born prepostrous passion big with horror while the youngest loved by all by xerxes favored to mardonius dear he held in detestation for his worth nor knew the comfort of a virtuous child with different thoughts that sleepless youth employed the night serenely happy in the charge humanity imposed before the dawn his band is armed sandauce in her car among innumerable fair the chief in state and woe tears trickle at the sight of great autarctus in his funeral pomp down every cheek a solemn sadness reigns so often aurora sablesuited leads a train of clouds dissolving as they pass in silent showers through atticas waste fields through half boeotia ere his evening closed the second sun conducts them to the gates of ancient thebes they enter they ascend the citadel they find commanding there new from the ruins of unpeopled towns fierce mithridates with a kind embrace to him the gentle artamanes thus hail brother twice a captive since we last at delphi parted i would gladly know thy fortune tell me where that beauteous maid whom thou did carry from the delphian walls the grim barbarian spoiler quick replied cursed be her name her beauty which could melt a heart like mine accursed my fathers lust which seized my captive guarded by a troop of jealous eunuchs and attendants armed her in this citadel he still detains if i refign her may plataeas towers may thespias hostile walls by me overthrown a second time to brave me rise from dust oh unbecoming strife the brother cried which startles nature thanks to heaven the king has now decided amaranthas fate her to his royal sister he has given a promised boon sandauce by the foe restored to freedom will requite that grace by rendring up this damsel to her sire himself a prisoner in nicaeas fort then both release from bondage further know in thebes to morrow xerxes will appear on his retreat to susa i conduct this train of eastern dames by rising dawn to her protection will the princess take the delphian maiden then proceed these words sting mithridates an atrocious deed he meditates but artful thus conceals not to my father to the king i yield this said they parted mithridates held the town his brothers squadrons lay encamped without the walls the citadel contained a fane of juno there sandauce rests to oedipus devoted was a dome which artamanes entered while his heart ran cold and shudderd at a brother fell and treacherous sire competitors in love abominable strife his eyes he cast over all the structure lighted by the gleams of tapers blue attending he surveys insculpturd round the horrors which befell the house of laius there the illfated son his father slays incestuous there ascends his mothers chamber daughters he begets his sisters sons his brothers blameless he a man of virtues by despair oppressed rends forth his eyeballs on the pavement dashed there sevn dire captains leagued by horrid oaths which startled heaven are figured down to hell amphiaraus on his martial car through earths dividing entrails there descends here capaneus blaspheming jove expires amid vindictive lightnings mangled there eteocles and polynices fall each others victim to fraternal hate full of these hideous images the youth reclines disturbed unvisited by sleep till awful midnight broken slumber adds to his disquiet in a thrilling dream the eyeless ghost of oedipus ascends the vacant sockets where the orbs of sight once beamed are bleeding fresh a stygian pall infolds the withered pale sepulchral form the arms are stretched abroad forever thebes must thou to horror be the guilty stage it said and vanished by the phantom waked or by a sudden clash of mingling swords with skrieks and tumult artamanes rose unsheathed his sabre gripped his target fast and issued swift before his startled eyes a beauteous woman of majestic form in garb disordered and with ringlets fallen sustains aloft a poinard newly drawn from mithridates heart who sinking breathes his last beneath her feet so phoebe pierced orion so the groaning earth received his giant bulk which insolently dared attempt that child immaculate of jove with violence of love now spoke the fair if to defend her chastity and fame becomes a woman self approved at least i stand great timons daughter from a line heroic sprung in holy delphi born if to have slain a ruffian be a crime among the persians give me instant death such as becomes my dignity and sex her words her looks impressed on every heart amaze and tamed the savages combined with mithridates in his impious act so when majestic on the choral scene her tragic pomp melpomene displays in awe profound she hushes rudest minds while terror humbles tyrants gathered round were numbers now a thousand torches blazed sandauce last environed by her guard approached alarmed a wounded eunuch stepped before the princess i will cloth in truth my voice he said argestes to my care entrusted amarantha from that lord solicitations threatnings gifts she spurned while i admired sure virtue has a ray to strike the meanest eye tonight his son assailed our dwelling with my fellow slaves all butchered i defended long my charge by mithridates from the mansion forced her chastity the noble maid has saved her poniard stretched the ravisher in blood to artamanes weeping over the corse sandauce then to thy consoling words i often have listened listen thou to mine forgive the maid illustrious is her deed for every maid to imitate with me come amarantha thou art mine not long shall so continue at nicaeas fort i will restore thee to a joyful sire and both to freedom morning breaks the cars the troops attend the royal dame renews her progress seated at her footstool weeps in speechless gratitude the delphian fair by public duty artamanes roused not long remains this last farewell he sighs oh early fallen oh cut from proudest hopes thee horomazes may a brothers tears for him propitiate he has none to shed these silent ruins to our father show thou faithful eunuch may he feel like me his steed he mounts and rapidly oertakes the squadrons opening on cadmean plains now amarantha lifts her grateful head intent to speak but heavy on the front of her protectress heavier in her breast sat grief each sense devouring and her frame enfeebling which too delicately wrought endures not even remembrance of distress so new so strange in her exalted state to youth untried by evils she forgets her late benignant act till chance directs her eye to amarantha when her heart soothed by the conscience of a generous deed her faded cheeks relumines with a smile then spoke the prudent virgin persian queen sure such thou art what mavelous event gave thee a knowledge of my sire his place of residence and my disastrous fate sense of thy goodness from my breast would chase the memory of troubles if alas i did not see thy countenance overcast if thou repent thee of thy favor deem me undeserving send me to abide the punishment ordained by persian laws but if thy sorrows are thy own unmixed with my misfortunes let assiduous zeal let tenderest service of my grateful hand strive to relieve the burdens which oppress my benefactress in the captives hand sandauce drops her own in sighs replies o by thy aspect of superior mold to all i ever beheld of regal race resembling me in fortune lend an ear my soul conceives a melancholy wish that thou should hear my story i to thine alternate listen mournful converse soon between these fairest in their native climes began continued sevn diurnal rounds the sun performed till intercourse of grief communicated sighs unite their minds in tender friendship different yet their lots on amaranthas cheek the bloom revives a joyful sire perhaps a dear betrothed her fortune promised in sandauces train a husband followed on his funeral bier her fleeting hue a sickly paleness taints which artamanes with a sadning eye observes portent of malady now rose the eighth sad morn revealing to their sight nicaeas neighboring gate sandauce then to artamanes take this virtuous maid to her my promise to her father thine fulfill conduct her amarantha dear from thee i part rejoicing in thy joy amid thy comforts in a sires embrace or bliss more tender with a destined spouse forget not me autarchus near the tomb of ariana by these widowed hands deposited  she stops the weakened powers of health relax nor furnish sound to grief mute too is delphis maid the persian youth to leave a moment in her sickening state the princess feels a struggle but resolves in rapid haste her mandate to obey nicaeas gate he enters timon soon he finds receive thy daughter swift he spoke receive thy freedom from the bounteous hand of xerxes sister but a short farewell my urgent cares allow to set thee free at thy own time i hasten to enjoin the chief commander here he said and turned precipitate away unheard unmarked by timon who no other voice nor form than amaranthas heeds in carian steel now meliboeus from the gymnic school where he was daily exercised in arms approached to him in transport timon spoke behold my daughter  instant from the port appears aronces who proclaims the news of artemisia landed she had left phaleron stationd in the malian bay she waits the kings arrival not remote now with his army all advance to meet the carian queen when sudden clouds of dust the sky envelop loud the hollow sound of trampling hoofs is heard the portal passed by artamanes faced the southern sun an entrance eastward rudely is possessed by caspian horsemen in the hairy skins of goats all horrid round their brawny loins from shaggy belts keen cimeters depend wellfurnishd quivers rattle on their backs now fifty grimfacd savages dismount to seize on amarantha then his arm newtraind to battle meliboeus proves with native strength agility and fire he springs confronts the caspians from the first he lops the ruffian hand by different wounds five more lie prostrate as a vessel new compact and strong impetuous from the dock in her first launch divides the troubled waves on either side recoiling till the weight of reuniting waters stops her course and beats her lofty ribs so valor drives the warrior on till rallying numbers joined arrest his progress fearless yet he stands a while defensive timon from the dead lifts two forsaken cimeters both hands his indignation arms he sends to hell three miscreants gasping at his daughters feet with aiding thefeus so pirithous heaped with centaurs slain the lapithaean hall when in flagitious tumult they deformed the nuptial banquet and his fair espoused with violation menaced but the eye of amarantha marked the unequal fight her poniard drawn the only succor left she holds intrepid resolute on death no second thraldom when the auspicious sight of carias queen revives her fainting hopes stern artemisia rapid on the call of vigilant aronces now approached in awful tone the caspians sheath your blades ye fierce in look not courage or this arm her falchion here she waves shall hide these streets with your vile carrion despicable herd of rebels led by what presumptuous fiend dare you invade a fortress of your king even in my presence he perhaps in sight they hear they pause enclosed by thickning guards in multitude confiding urged by lust which lends a courage new argestes fell inciting loud his ruffians to persist strikes her indignant eye what wrath what hopes of just of longsought vengeance swell her breast as when the mother of a lion brood from wonted chase returning sees a wolf or treacherous tiger stealing toward her den who in her absence would securely prey on her defenseless whelps her eyeballs roll in fire she rushes on the insidious foe with fangs resistless he contends in vain his chest she rends asunder and his heart devours unsated so incensed the queen begirt by carians terrible in war to each barbarian terrible who saw their high exploits on salaminian waves rushed on argestes meliboeus brave marched by her side a second whom the god of arms might rank among his foremost sons the caspians shrunk by desperation bold the satrap spurred his courser on the queen and whirled a javelin shivering on her shield she on the forehead smote the restiff horse who rearing hurled his rider to the ground then points her dreadful weapon toward the breast of her detested foe intent to pierce the traitorous heart this invocation first she solemn utters manes of the brave whom he devoted on the malian fields unpitied victims of his hate to me to you my subjects this malignant head i immolate hence satrap once the chief in power and state in vice and falsehood chief seek rhadamanthus tell him while he frowns on his tribunal themis to my hand her sword resigned to cut thy treason short her vengeance levels now the mortal blow when dignity restrains her rise she said thou criminal unworthy by this arm to die preserve him carians to abide the ignominous lot by justice doomed to common villains meliboeus change thy name i clasp thee haliartus now my brother proved by gallant deeds at least no evidence but virtue i require for nobler union than congenial birth by friendships sacred ties to call thee mine she scarce had finished when a second troop of horsemen through the southern portal spread new terror in their front a splendid chief who wears a regal circle round he casts a searching eye impatient soon beholds bright amarantha where she stands beset by caspians strangers to their leaders fate persisting still in pertinacious strife against aronces and her manly sire then swift as sulfurous either when its flame divides a knotted oak or cleaves a tower flies on the ruffians do ye lift he cries your hands profane against the destined queen of macedon a carnage wide he spreads beneath his trampling steed and ponderous blade dismounting victor he unclasps his helm her dear betrothed to amarantha shows in alexander macedonias king never yet so comely so endearing looked a lover rescued from barbarian spoil she meets his arms while timon weeps in joy with meliboeus from a stage of blood the carian queen approached while thus the king his servent soul was opening oh my love my amarantha my affiancd love i feel but cannot paint my sorrows past my present joys the day the appointed day to solemnize our nuptial rites was nigh i left my kingdom flew to delphis walls thou wast not there what horror when i heard thou wast a captive by what barbarous hand none could inform me thence from march to march i trackd the persians tidings of thy fate no tongue could tell through attica i ranged boeotia phocis doris locris still was left to search disconsolate i joined the royal camp last evening there i heard of mithridates by thy virtue slain at thebes of cursed

fount of sorrow so we styled the place frequented often by arianas grief there often her head disconsolate she hung to feed incessant anguish never disclosed unless in sighing whispers to the stream her last abode is there the myrtles shed their odours round the virgin roses bloom i there have caused a monument to rise that passing strangers may her name revere and weep her fortune from her early grave may learn how heaven is jealous of its boons not long to flourish where they most excel a marble mansion new erected nigh her faithful slaves inhabit who attune to thrilling lutes a daily funeral song he leads he stops on gentlymoving air sweet measures glide this melancholy dirge to melting chords by sorrow touched is heard croppd is the rose of beauty in her bud bright virtues purest mansion is defaced like mithras beams her silken tresses shone in luster gentle as a vernal morn her eye revealed the beauties of her mind the slave the captive in her light rejoiced lament ye daughters of choaspes wail ye cissian maids your paragon is lost once like the freshblown lily in the vale in susa fair in radiancy of bloom like summer glowing till consuming love deformed her graces then her hue she changed to lilies pining in decay but kept the smile of kindness on her wasted cheek lament ye daughters of choaspes wail ye cissian maids your paragon is lost o ray of wisdom eye of virtue formed to spread superior light the dazzling brand of love malign obscured thy eagle sight thy vital flames are vanished ours remain as lamps to endless mourning in thy tomb till we rejoin thee in a land of bliss lament ye daughters of choaspes wail ye cissian maids your paragon is lost the song concludes sandauce from a bank of turf uprises resting on her slaves a pallid visage and a fainting step she brings before the sepulcher and spoke o ariana listen from thy tomb to me in woe thy sister as in blood by different fortunes both were doomed to waste an early bloom in sorrow o admit autarctus first a neighbor to thy clay me next who feel my vital thread unwind o heaven my humble spirit would submit to thy afflicting hand  but every fount of health is dried my frame

discolored hue in warm affection flushes at the sight of amarantha as a languid rose shrunk by the rigor of nocturnal frosts a while reviving at the tepid rays of wintry phoebus glows for me she sighed for me that bed of endless rest is made come thou neglectful of thy nuptial bliss to poor sandauces burial soon the hour when of the sun these sickly eyes must take their last farewell may call thy friendly hand to close their curtains in eternal night these words the grecian fair in sorrow tried in constancy unshaken swift returned thou shall not die avoid this mournful spot thou have

love and tender care again shall bless her patroness renew her youth in bloom in vigor never to leave her infants doubly orphans at their name the princess faints too sensitive a plant which on the lightest touch contracts the leaves and seems to wither in the fold of death her lovely weight artuchus to his tent conveys a litter gentle as it moves receives her soon her children by her side in macedonian chariots are disposed her female slaves and eunuchs now appears emathias prince to guard his matchless bride in arms complete resembling mars he rules the fiery courser artamanes swift this
