cato a tragedy  cato a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by her majestys servants  by mr addison  ecce spectaculum dignum ad quod respiciat intentus operi suo deus ecce par deo dignum vir fortis cum mala fortuna compositus non video inquam quid habeat in terris jupiter pulchrius si convertere animum velit quam ut spectet catonem jam partibus non semel fractis nihilominus inter ruinas publicas erectum sen de divin prove  london printed for j tonson at shakespeares head  against catherinestreet in the strand mdccxiii  prologue by mr pope spoken by mr wilks to wake the soul by tender strokes of art to raise the genius and to mend the heart to make mankind in conscious virtue bold live over each scene and be what they behold for this the tragicmuse first trod the stage commanding tears to stream through every age tyrants no more their savage nature kept and foes to virtue wondered how they wept our author shuns by vulgar springs to move the heros glory or the virgins love in pitying love we but our weakness show and wild ambition well deserves its woe here tears shall slow from a more generous cause such tears as patriots shed for dying laws he bids your breasts with ancient ardor rise and calls forth roman drops from british eyes virtue confessed in human shape he draws what plato thought and godlike cato was no common object to your sight displays but what with pleasure heaven it self surveys a brave man struggling in the storms of fate and greatly falling with a falling state while cato gives his little senate laws what bosom beats not in his countrys cause who sees him act but envies every deed who hears him groan and does not wish to bleed even when proud caesar midst triumphal cars the spoils of nations and the pomp of wars ignobly vain and impotently great showed rome her catos figure drawn in state as her dead fathers reverend image past the pomp was darkened and the day overcast the triumph ceased  tears gushed from every eye the worlds great victor past unheeded by her last good man dejected rome adored and honored caesars less than catos sword britains attend be worth like this approved and show you have the virtue to be moved with honest scorn the first famed cato viewed rome learning arts from greece whom she subdued our scene precariously subsists too long on french translation and italian song dare to have sense your selves assert the stage be justly warmed with your own native rage such plays alone should please a british ear as catos self had not disdained to hear dramatis personae men cato mr booth lueius a senator mr keen sempronius a senator mr mills juba prince of numidia mr wilks syphax general of the numidians mr cibber sons of cato portius mr powell marcus mr ryan decius ambassador from caesar mr bowman mutineers guards etc women marcia daughter to cato mrs oldfield lucia daughter to lucius mrs porter scene a large hall in the governors palace of utica cato act i scene i portius marcus por the dawn is overcast the morning lowrs and heavily in clouds brings on the day the great the important day big with the fate of cato and of rome  our fathers death would fill up all the guilt of civil war and close the scene of blood already caesar has ravaged more than half the globe and sees mankind grown thin by his destructive sword should he go further numbers would be wanting to form new battles and support his crimes ye gods what havoc does ambition make among your works  marc thy steady temper portius can look on guilt rebellion fraud and caesar in the calm lights of mild philosophy i am tortured even to madness when i think on the proud victor every time he is named pharsalia rises to my view  i see the insulting tyrant prancing over the field strowd with romes citizens and drenched in slaughter his horses hoofs wet with patrician blood oh portius is there not some chosen curse some hidden thunder in the stores of heaven red with uncommon wrath to blast the man who owes his greatness to his countrys ruin  por believe me marcus it is an impious greatness and mixed with too much horror to be envied how does the luster of our fathers actions through the dark cloud of iiis that cover him break out and burn with more triumphant brightness his sufferings shine and spread a glory round him greatly unfortunate he fights the cause of honor virtue liberty and rome his sword never fell but on the guilty head oppression tyranny and power usurped draw all the vengeance of his arm upon em  marc who knows not this but what can cato do against a world a base degenerate world that courts the yoke and bows the neck to caesar pent up in utica he vainly forms a poor epitome of roman greatness and covered with numidian guards directs a feeble army and an empty senate remnants of mighty battles fought in vain by heavens such virtues joined with such success distract my very soul our fathers fortune would almost tempt us to renounce his precepts  por remember what our father often has told us the ways of heaven are dark and intricate puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errors our understanding traces em in vain lost and bewildered in the fruitless search nor sees with how much art the windings run nor where the regular confusion ends  marc these are suggestions of a mind at ease oh portius did thou taste but half the griess that wring my soul thou could not talk thus calmly passion unpitied and successless love plant daggers in my heart and aggravate my other griefs were but my lucia kind   por thou see not that thy brother is thy rival but i must hide it for i know thy temper aside now marcus now thy virtues on the proof put forth thy utmost strength work every nerve and call up all thy father in thy soul to quell the tyrant love and guard thy heart on this weak side where most our nature fails would be a conquest worthy catos son  marc portius the council which i cannot take instead of healing but upbraids my weakness bid me for honor plunge into a war of thickest foes and rush on certain death then shall thou see that marcus is not slow to follow glory and confess his father love is not to be reasoned down or lost in high ambition and a thirst of greatness it is second life it grows into the soul warms every vein and beats in every pulse i feel it here my resolution melts   por behold young juba the numidian prince with how much care he forms himself to glory and breaks the fierceness of his native temper to copy out our fathers bright example he loves our sister marcia greatly loves her his eyes his looks his actions all betray it but still the smothered fondness burns within him when most it swells and labors for a vent then sense of honor and desire of fame drive the big passion back into his heart what shall an african shall jubas heir reproach great catos son and show the world a virtue wanting in a roman soul  marc portius no more your words leave stings behind em whenere did juba or did portius show a virtue that has cast me at a distance and thrown me out in the pursuits of honor  por marcus i know thy generous temper well fling but the appearance of dishonor on it it strait takes fire and mounts into a blaze  marc a brothers sufferings claim a brothers pity  por heaven knows i pity thee behold my eyes even whilst i speak  do they not swim in tears were but my heart as naked to thy view marcus would see it bleed in his behalf  marc why then do treat me with rebukes instead of kind condoling cares and friendly sorrow  por o marcus did i know the way to ease thy troubled heart and mitigate thy pains marcus believe me i could die to do it  marc thou best of brothers and thou best of friends pardon a weak distempered soul that swells with sudden gusts and sinks as soon in calms the sport of passions  but sempronius comes he must not find this softness hanging on me exit  scene ii sempronius solus conspiracies no sooner should be formed than executed what means portius here i like not that cold youth i must dissemble and speak a language foreign to my heart  sempronius portius semp good morrow portius let us once embrace once more embrace whilst yet we both are free tomorrow should we thus express our friendship each might receive a slave into his arms this sun perhaps this morning suns the last that ere shall rise on roman liberty  por my father has this morning called together to this poor hall his little roman senate the leavings of pharsalia to consult if yet he can oppose the mighty torrent that bears down rome and all her gods before it or must at length give up the world to caesar  semp not all the pomp and majesty of rome can raise her senate more than catos presence his virtues render our assembly awful they strike with something like religious fear and make even caesar tremble at the head of armies flushed with conquest o my portius could i but call that wondrous man my father would but thy sister marcia be propitious to thy friends vows i might be blessed indeed  por alas sempronius would thou talk of love to marcia whilst her fathers lifes in danger thou might as well court the pale trembling vestal when she beholds the holy flame expiring  semp the more i see the wonders of thy race the more i am charmed thou must take heed my portius the world has all its eyes on catos son thy fathers merit sets thee up to view and shows thee in the fairest point of light to make thy virtues or thy faults conspicuous  por well do thou seem to check my lingering here on this important hour  i will strait away and while the fathers of the senate meet in close debate to weigh the events of war i will animate the soldiers drooping courage with love of freedom and contempt of life i will thunder in their ears their countrys cause and try to rouse up all that is roman in em it is not in mortals to command success but well do more sempronius well deserve it exit  sempronius solus curse on the stripling how he apes his sire ambitiously sententious  but i wonder old syphax comes not his numidian genius is well disposed to mischief were he prompt and eager on it but he must be spurred and every moment quickened to the course cato has used me ill he has refused his daughter marcia to my ardent vows besides his baffled arms and ruined cause are bars to my ambition caesars favor that showers down greatness on his friends will raise me to romes first honors if i give up cato i claim in my reward his captive daughter but syphax comes   scene iii syphax sempronius syph  sempronius all is ready i have sounded my numidians man by man and find em ripe for a revolt they all complain aloud of catos discipline and wait but the command to change their master  semp believe me syphax there is no time to waste even whilst we speak our conqueror comes on and gathers ground upon us every moment alas thou know not caesars active soul with what a dreadful course he rushes on from war to war in vain has nature formed mountains and oceans to oppose his passage he bounds over all victorious in his march the alps and pyreneans sink before him through winds and waves and storms he works his way impatient for the battle one day more will set the victor thundering at our gates but tell me have thou yet drawn over young juba that still would recommend thee more to caesar and challenge better terms   syph  alas he is lost he is lost sempronius all his thoughts are full of catos virtues  but i will try once more for every instant i expect him here if yet i can subdue those stubborn principles of faith of honor and i know not what that have corrupted his numidian temper and struck the infection into all his soul  semp be sure to press upon him every motive jubas surrender since his fathers death would give up africa into caesars hands and make him lord of half the burning zone  syph but is it true sempronius that your senate is called together gods thou must be cautious cato has piercing eyes and will discern our frauds unless they are covered thick with art  semp let me alone good syphax i will conceal my thoughts in passion it is the surest way i will bellow out for rome and for my country and mouth at caesar till i shake the senate your cold hypocrisies a stale device a wornout trick would thou be thought in earnest cloth thy feigned zeal in rage in fire in fury  syph in troth you are able to instruct greyhairs and teach the wily african deceit  semp once more be sure to try thy skill on juba mean while i will hasten to my roman soldiers inflame the mutiny and underhand blow up their discontents till they break out unlooked for and discharge themselves on cato remember syphax we must work in haste o think what anxious moments pass between the birth of plots and their last fatal periods oh it is a dreadful interval of time filled up with horror all and big with death destruction hangs on every word we speak on every thought till the concluding stroke determines all and closes our design exit  syphax solus i will try if yet i can reduce to reason this headstrong youth and make him spurn at cato the time is short caesar comes rushing on us  but hold young juba sees me and approaches  scene iv juba syphax jub syphax i joy to meet thee thus alone i have observed of late thy looks are fallen overcast with gloomy cares and discontent then tell me syphax i conjure thee tell me what are the thoughts that knit thy brow in frowns and turn thine eye thus coldly on thy prince  syph it is not my talent to conceal my thoughts nor carry smiles and sunshine in my face when discontent sits heavy at my heart i have not yet so much the roman in me  jub why do thou cast out such ungenrous terms against the lords and sovreigns of the world do thou not see mankind fall down before em and own the force of their superior virtue is there a nation in the wilds of africa amidst our barren rocks and burning sands that does not tremble at the roman name  syph gods where is the worth that sets this people up above your own numidias tawny sons do they with tougher sinews bend the bow or flies the javelin swifter to its mark launched from the vigor of a roman arm who like our active african instructs the fiery steed and trains him to his hand or guides in troops the embattled elephant laden with war these these are arts my prince in which your zama does not stoop to rome  jub these all are virtues of a meaner rank perfections that are placed in bones and nerves a roman soul is bent on higher views to civilize the rude unpolished world and lay it under the restraint of laws to make man mild and sociable to man to cultivate the wild licentious savage with wisdom discipline and liberal arts the embellishments of life virtues like these make human nature shine reform the soul and break our fierce barbarians into men  syph patience kind heavens  excuse an old mans warmth what are these wondrous civilizing arts this roman polish and this smooth behavior that render man thus tractable and tame are they not only to disguise our passions to set our looks at variance with our thoughts to check the starts and sallies of the soul and break off all its commerce with the tongue in short to change us into other creatures than what our nature and the gods designed us  jub to strike thee dumb turn up thy eyes to cato there may thou see to what a godlike height the roman virtues lift up mortal man while good and just and anxious for his friends he is still severely bent against himself renouncing sleep and rest and food and ease he strives with thirst and hunger toil and heat and when his fortune sets before him all the pomps and pleasures that his soul can wish his rigid virtue will accept of none  syph believe me prince there is not an african that traverses our vast numidian deserts in quest of prey and lives upon his bow but better practices these boasted virtues coarse are his meals the fortune of the chase amidst the running stream he slakes his thirst toils all the day and at the approach of night on the first friendly bank he throws him down or rests his head upon a rock till morn then rises fresh pursues his wonted game and if the following day he chance to find a new repast or an untasted spring blesses his stars and thinks it luxury  jub thy prejudices syphax will not discern what virtues grow from ignorance and choice nor how the hero differs from the brute but grant that others could with equal glory look down on pleasures and the baits of sense where shall we find the man that bears affliction great and majestic in his griefs like cato heavens with what strength what steadiness of mind he triumphs in the midst of all his sufferings how does he rise against a load of woes and thank the gods that throw the weight upon him  syph it is pride rank pride and haughtiness of soul i think the romans call it stoicism had not your royal father thought so highly of roman virtue and of catos cause he had not fallen by a slaves hand inglorious nor would his slaughtered army now have lain on africks sands disfigutd with their wounds to gorge the wolves and vultures of numidia  jub why do thou call my sorrows up afresh my fathers name brings tears into my eyes  syph oh that you would profit by your fathers ills  jub what would thou have me do  syph abandon cato  jub syphax i should be more than twice an orphan by such a loss  syph ay there is the tie that binds you you long to call him father marcias charms work in your heart unseen and plead for cato no wonder you are deaf to all i say  jub syphax your zeal becomes importunate i have hitherto permitted it to rave and talk at large but learn to keep it in least it should take more freedom than i will give it  syph sir your great father never used me thus alas he is dead but can you ever forget the tender sorrows and the pangs of nature the fond embraces and repeated blessings which you drew from him in your last farewell still must i cherish the dear sad remembrance at once to torture and to please my soul the good old king at parting wrung my hand his eyes brimfull of tears then sighing cried prithee be careful of my son  his grief swelled up so high he could not utter more  jub alas thy story melts away my soul that best of fathers how shall i discharge the gratitude and duty which i owe him  syph by laying up his councils in your heart  jub his councils bade me yield to thy directions then syphax chide me in severest terms vent all thy passion and i will stand its shock calm and unruffled as a summersea when not a breath of wind flics over its surface  syph alas my prince i would guide you to your safety  jub i do believe thou would but tell me how  syph fly from the fate that follows caesars foes  jub my father scorned to do it  syph and therefore died  jub better to die ten thousand thousand deaths than wound my honor  syph rather say your love  jub syphax i have promised to preserve my temper why will thou urge me to confess a flame i long have stifled and would fain conceal  syph believe me prince it is hard to conquer love but easy to divert and break its force absence might cure it or a second mistress light up another flame and put out this the glowing dames of zamas royal court have faces flusht with more exalted charms the sun that rolls his chariot over their heads works up more fire and color in their cheeks were you with these my prince you would soon forget the pale unripend beauties of the north  jub it is not a set of features or complexion the tincture of a skin that i admire beauty soon grows familiar to the lover fades in his eye and palls upon the sense the virtuous marcia towers above her sex true she is fair oh how divinely fair but still the lovely maid improves her charms with inward greatness unaffected wisdom and sanctity of manners catos soul shines out in every thing she acts or speaks while winning mildness and attractive smiles dwell in her looks and with becoming grace soften the rigor of her fathers virtues  syph how does your tongue grow wanton in her praise but on my knees i beg you would consider   enter marcia and lucia jub hah syphax is it not she  she moves this way and with her lucia luciuss fair daughter my heart beats thick  i prithee syphax leave me  syph ten thousand curses fasten on em both now will this woman with a single glance undo what i have been laboring all this while exit  juba marcia lucia jub hail charming maid how does thy beauty smooth the face of war and make even horror smile at sight of thee my heart shakes off its sorrows i feel a dawn of joy break in upon me and for a while forget the approach of caesar  mac i should be grieved young prince to think my presence unbent your thoughts and slackened em to arms while warm with slaughter our victorious foe threatens aloud and calls you to the field  jub o marcia let me hope thy kind concerns and gentle wishes follow me to battle the thought will give new vigor to my arm add strength and weight to my descending sword and drive it in a tempest on the foe  marc my prayers and wishes always shall attend the friends of rome the glorious cause of virtue and men approved of by the gods and cato  jub that juba may deserve thy pious cares i will gaze for ever on thy godlike father transplanting one by one into my life his bright perfections till i shine like him  marc my father never at a time like this would lay out his great soul in words and waste such precious moments  jub thy reproofs are just thou virtuous maid i will hasten to my troops and fire their languid souls with catos virtue if ere i lead them to the field when all the war shall stand ranged in its just array and dreadful pomp then will i think on thee o lovely maid then will i think on thee and in the shock of charging hosts remember what glorious deeds should grace the man who hopes for marcias love exit  luc marcia youre too severe how could you chide the young goodnatured prince and drive him from you with so stern an air a prince that loves and dotes on you to death  mar it is therefore lucia that i chide him from me his air his voice his looks and honest soul speak all so movingly in his behalf i dare not trust my self to hear him talk  luc why will you fight against so sweet a passion and steel your heart to such a world of charms  mar how lucia would thou have me sink away in pleasing dreams and lose my self in love when every moment catos lifes at stake caesar comes armed with terror and revenge and aims his thunder at my fathers head should not the sad occasion swallow up my other cares and draw them all into it  luc why have not i this constancy of mind who have so many griefs to try its force sure nature formed me of her softest mould enfeebled all my soul with tender passions and sunk me even below my own weak sex pity and love by turns oppress my heart  mar lucia disburthen all thy cares on me and let me share thy most retired distress tell me who raises up this conflict in thee  luc i need not blush to name them when i tell thee they are marcias brothers and the sons of cato  mar they both behold thee with their sisters eyes and often have revealed their passion to me but tell me whose address thou favourst most i long to know and yet i dread to hear it  luc which is it marcia wishes for  mar for neither  and yet for both  the youths have equal share in marcias wishes and divide their sister but tell me which of them is lucias choice  luc marcia they both are high in my esteem but in my love  why will thou make me name him thou know it is a blind and foolish passion pleased and disgusted with it knows not what  mar o lucia i am perplexed o tell me which i must hereafter call my happy brother  luc suppose twere portius could you blame my choice o portius thou have stolen away my soul with what a graceful tenderness he loves and breaths the softest the sincerest vows complacency and truth and manly sweetness dwell ever on his tongue and smooth his thoughts marcus is overwarm his fond complaints have so much earnestness and passion in them i hear him with a secret kind of dread and tremble at his vehemence of temper  mar alas poor youth how can thou throw him from thee lucia thou know not half the love he bears thee whenever he speaks of thee his hearts in flames he sends out all his soul in every word and thinks and talks and looks like one transported unhappy youth how will thy coldness raise tempests and storms in his afflicted bosom i dread the consequence   luc you seem to plead against your brother portius   mar heaven forbid had portius been the unsuccessful lover the same compassion would have fallen on him  luc was ever virgin love distressed like mine portius himself often falls in tears before me as if he mourned his rivals ill success then bids me hide the motions of my heart nor show which way it turns so much he fears the sad effects that it would have on marcus  mar he knows too well how easily he is fired and would not plunge his brother in despair but waits for happier times and kinder moments  luc alas too late i find my self involved in endless griefs and labyrinths of woe born to afflict my marcias family and sow dissension in the hearts of brothers tormenting thought it cuts into my soul  mar let us not lucia aggravate our sorrows but to the gods permit the event of things our lives discolored with our present woes may still grow bright and smile with happier hours so the pure limpid stream when foul with stains of rushing torrents and descending rains works it self clear and as it runs refines till by degrees the floating mirror shines reflects each flower that on the border grows and a new heaven in its fair bosom shows exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i the senate sem rome still survives in this assembled senate let us remember we are catos friends and act like men who claim that glorious title  luc cato will soon be here and open to us the occasion of our meeting hark he comes a sound of trumpets may all the guardian gods of rome direct him  enter cato cato fathers we once again are met in council caesars approach has summoned us together and rome attends her fate from our resolves how shall we treat this bold aspiring man success still follows him and backs his crimes pharsalia gave him rome egypt has since received his yoke and the whole nile is caesars why should i mention jubas overthrow and scipios death numidias burning sands still smoke with blood it is time we should decree what course to take our foe advances on us and envies us even libyas sultry deserts fathers pronounce your thoughts are they still fixed to hold it out and fight it to the last or are your hearts subdued at length and wrought by time and ill success to a submission sempronius speak  semp my voice is still for war gods can a roman senate long debate which of the two to choose slavery or death no let us rise at once gird on our swords and at the head of our remaining troops attack the foe break through the thick array of his thronged legions and charge home upon him perhaps some arm more lucky than the rest may reach his heart and free the world from bondage rise fathers rise it is rome demands your help rise and revenge her slaughtered citizens or share their fate the corpse of half her senate manure the fields of thessaly while we sit here delibrating in cold debates if we should sacrifice our lives to honor or wear them out in servitude and chains rouse up for shame our brothers of pharsalia point at their wounds and cry aloud  to battle great pompeys shade complains that we are slow and scipios ghost walks unrevenged amongst us  cato let not a torrent of impetuous zeal transport thee thus beyond the bounds of reason true fortitude is seen in great exploits that justice warrants and that wisdom guides all else is towering frenzy and distraction are not the lives of those who draw the sword in romes defense entrusted to our care should we thus lead them to a field of slaughter might not the impartial world with reason say we lavisht at our deaths the blood of thousands to grace our fall and make our ruin glorious lucius we next would know what is your opinion  luc my thoughts i must confess are turned on peace already have our quarrels filled the world with widows and with orphans seythia mourns our guilty wars and earths remotest regions lie half unpeopled by the feuds of rome it is time to sheath the sword and spare mankind it is not caesar but the gods my fathers the gods declare against us and repel our vain attempts to urge the foe to battle prompted by blind revenge and wild despair were to refuse the awards of providence and not to rest in heavens determination already have we shown our love to rome now let us show submission to the gods we took up arms not to revenge our selves but free the commonwealth when this end fails arms have no further use our countrys cause that drew our swords now wrests em from our hands and bids us not delight in roman blood unprofitably shed what men could do is done already heaven and earth will witness if rome must fall that we are innocent  semp this smooth discourse and mild behavior often conceal a traitor  something whispers me all is not right  cato beware of lucius aside to cato  cato let us appear nor rash nor diffident immodrate valor swells into a fault and fear admitted into public councils betrays like treason let us shun em both fathers i cannot see that our affairs are grown thus desperate we have bulwarks round us within our walls are troops enured to toil in africks heats and seasoned to the sun numidias spacious kingdom lies behind us ready to rise at its young princes call while there is hope do not distrust the gods but wait at least till caesars near approach force us to yield twill never be too late to sue for chains and own a conqucror why should rome fall a moment ere her time no let us draw her term of freedom out in its full length and spin it to the last so shall we gain still one days liberty and let me perish but in catos judgment a day an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity in bondage  enter marcus marc fathers this moment as i watched the gates lodged on my post a herald is arrived from caesars camp and with him comes old decius the roman knight he carrys in his looks impatience and demands to speak with cato  cato by your permission fathers bid him enter exit marcus decius was once my friend but other prospects have loosed those ties and bound him fast to caesar

gratitude to cato who with so great a soul consults its safety and guards our lives while he neglects his own  semp sempronius gives no thanks on this account lucius seems fond of life but what is life it is not to stalk about and draw fresh air from time to time or gaze upon the sun it is to be free when liberty is gone life grows insipid and has lost its relish o could my dying hand but lodge a sword in caesars bosom and revenge my country by heavens i could enjoy the pangs of death and smile in agony  luc others perhaps may serve their country with as warm a zeal though it is not kindled

prolonged fathers farewell  the young numidian prince comes forward and expects to know our councils ex senators  enter juba cato juba the roman senate has resolved till time give better prospects still to keep the sword unsheathed and turn its edge on caesar  jub the resolution fits a roman senate but cato lend me for a while thy patience and condescend to hear a young man speak my father when some days before his death he ordered me to march for utica alas i thought not then his death so near wept over me pressed me in his aged arms and as his griefs gave way my son said he whatever fortune shall befall thy father be catos friend he will train thee up to great and virtuous deeds do but observe him well thou wilt shun misfortunes or thou wilt learn to bear em  cato juba thy father was a worthy prince and merited alas a better fate but heaven thought otherwise  juba my fathers fate in spite of all the fortitude that shines before my face in catos great example subdues my soul and fills my eyes with tears  cato it is an honest sorrow and becomes thee  juba my father drew respect from foreign climes the kings of africa sought him for their friend kings far remote that rule

divinity that stirs within us it is heaven its self that points out an hereafter and intimates eternity to man eternity thou pleasing dreadful thought through what variety of untried being through what new scenes and changes must we pass the wide the unbounded prospect lies before me but shadows clouds and darkness rest upon it here will i hold if there is a power above us and that there is all

passage accuse the lingering winds a sail arrived from pompeys son who through the realms of spain calls out for vengeance on his fathers death and rouses the whole nation up to arms were cato at their head once more might rome assert her rights and claim her liberty but hark what means that groan o give me way and let me fly into my fathers presence  luc cato amidst his slumbers thinks on

country with alarms and gives up rome a prey to roman arms produces fraud and cruelty and strife and robbs the guilty world of catos life exeunt omnes end of the fifth act epilogue by dr garth spoken by mrs porter what odd fantastic things we women do who would not listen when young lovers woo but die a maid yet have the choice of two ladies are often cruel to their cost to give you pain themselves they punish most vows of virginity should well be weighed too often they are cancelled though in convents made would you revenge such rash resolves  you may be spightful  and believe the thing we say we hate you when youre easily said nay how needless if you knew us were your fears let love have eyes and beauty will have ears our hearts are formed as you your selves would choose too proud to ask too humble to refuse we give to merit and to wealth we sell he sighs with most success that settles well the woes of wedlock with the joys we mix it is best repenting in a coach and six blame not our conduct since we but pursue those lively lessons we have learned from you your breasts no more the fire of beauty warms but wicked wealth usurps the power of charms what pains to get the gaudy thing you hate to swell in show and be a wretch in state at plays you ogle at the ring you bow even churches are no sanctuaries now there golden idols all your vows receive she is no goddess that has naught to give oh may once more the happy age appear when words were artless and the thoughts sincere when gold and grandeur were unenvied things and courts less coveted than groves and springs love then shall only mourn when truth complains and constancy feel transport in its chains sighs with success their own soft anguish tell and eyes shall utter what the lips conceal virtue again to its bright station climb and beauty fear no enemy but time the fair shall listen to desert alone and every lucia find a catos son finis
