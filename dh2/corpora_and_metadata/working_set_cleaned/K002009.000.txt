love in a village a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed by w griffin for j newbery and w nicoll in st pauls churchyard g kearsly in ludgate street t davies in russel street covent garden and j walter at charing cross mdcclxiii  to mr beard sir it is with great pleasure i embrace this opportunity to acknowledge the favors i have received from you among others i would mention in particular the warmth with which you espoused this piece in its passage to the stage but that i am afraid it would be thought a compliment to your good nature too much at the expense of your judgment  if this opera is considered merely as a piece of dramatic writing it will certainly be found to have very little merit in that light no one can think more indifferently of it than i do myself but i believe i may venture to assert on your opinion that some of the songs are tolerable that the music is more pleasing than has hitherto appeared in any composition of this kind and the words better adapted considering the nature of the airs which are not common ballads than could be expected supposing any degree of poetry to be preserved in the versification more than this few people expect in an opera and if some of the severer critics should be inclined to blame your indulgence to one of the first attempts of a young writer i am persuaded the public in general will applaud your endeavor to provide them with something new in a species of entertainment in which the performers at your theater so eminently excel  you may perceive sir that i yield a punctual observance to the injunctions you laid upon me when i threatened you with this address and make it rather a preface than a dedication and yet i must confess i can hardly reconcile those formalities which render it indelicate to pay praises where all the world allows them to be due nor can i easily conceive why a man should be so studious to deserve what he does not desire but since you will not allow me to offer any panegyric to you i must hasten to bestow one upon myself and let the public know which was my chief design in this introduction that i have the honor to be  sir your most obliged and most obedient servant the author  of the publishers of this opera may be had price one shilling thomas and sally or the sailors return a musical farce written by the same

in a village an hundred miles from the capital with a preposterous gouty father and a superannuated maiden aunt  i am heartily sick of my situation   ross and with reason  but it is in a great measure your own fault here is this mr eustace a man of character and family he likes you you like him you know one anothers minds and yet you will not resolve to make yourself happy with him  air ii whence

during her last illness at bath so that your father has never seen him   lucin never in his life my dear and i am confident he entertains not the least suspicion of my having any such connection my aunt indeed has her doubts and surmises but besides that my father will not allow any one to be wiser than himself it is an established maxim between these affectionate relations never to agree in any thing   ross except being absurd you must allow they sympathize perfectly in that  but now we are on the subject i desire to know what i am to do with this wicked old justice of peace this libidinous father of yours he follows me about the house like a tame goat   lucin nay i will assure you he has been a wag in his time  you must have a care of yourself   ross wretched me to fall into such hands

accident with an old fellow as wrong headed as himself and in a fit of absurd friendship agree to marry you to that old fellows son whom you had never seen without consulting your inclinations or allowing you a negative in case he should not prove agreeable    lucin why i should think it a little hard i confess  yet when i see you in the character of a chambermaid    ross it is the only character my dear in which i could hope to lie concealed and i can tell you i was reduced to the last extremity when in consequence of our old boardingschool friendship i applied to you to receive me in this capacity for we expected the parties the very next week    lucin but had not you a message from your intended spouse to let you know he was as little inclined to such illconcerted nuptials as you were   ross more than so he wrote to advise me by all means to contrive some method of breaking them off for he had rather return to his dear studies at oxford and after that what hopes could i have of being happy with him   lucin then you are not at all uneasy at the strange rout you must have occasioned at home i warrant during this month that you have been absent    ross oh dont mention it my dear i have had so many admirers since i commenced abigail that i am quite charmed with my situation  but hold who stalks yonder into the yard that the dogs are so glad to see   lucin daddy

trusty messenger hodge   ross no matter i will sit down in that arbor and listen to the singing of the birds you know i am fond of melancholy amusements   lucin so it seems indeed sure rossetta none of your admirers have made a hole in your heart you are not in love i hope   ross in love that is pleasant who do you suppose i should be in love with pray   lucin why let me see  what do you think of thomas our gardener there he is at the other end of the walk  he is a very pretty young man and the servants say he is always writing verses on you   ross indeed lucinda you are very silly   lucin indeed rossetta that blush makes you look very handsome   ross blush i am sure i dont blush   lucin ha ha ha   ross pshaw lucinda how can you be so ridiculous   lucin well dont be angry and i have

woodcock to be the superintendant of his pumpkins and cabbages because i would let my father see i chose to run any lengths rather than submit to what his obstinacy would have forced me a marriage against my inclination with a woman i never saw puts up the book and takes a wateringpot here i have been three weeks and in that time i am as much altered as if i had changed my nature with my habit

be cruel to fill her head with notions of what can never happen hums a tune psha rot these roses how they prick ones fingers   ross he takes no notice of me but so much the better i will be as indifferent as he is i am sure the poor lad likes me and if i was to give him any encouragement i suppose the next thing he talked of would be buying a ring and being asked in church  oh dear pride i

there is no room to doubt she takes a thousand opportunities to let me see it and yet when i speak to her she will hardly give me an answer and if i attempt the smallest familiarity is gone in an instant  i feel my passion for her grow every day more and more violent  well would i marry her would i make a mistress of her if i could two things called prudence and honor forbid either what am i pursuing then a shadow sure my evil genius laid this snare in my way however there is one comfort it is in my power to fly from it if so why do i hesitate i am distracted unable to determine any thing

care for him well but surely i am not in love let me examine my heart a little i saw him kissing one of the maids the other day i could have boxed his ears for it and have done nothing but find fault and quarrel with the girl ever since why was i uneasy at his toying with another woman what was it to me then i dream of him almost every night  but that may proceed from his being generally uppermost in my thoughts all day  oh worse and worse  well he is certainly a pretty lad he has something uncommon about him considering his rank and now let me only put the case if he was not a servant would i or would i not prefer him to all the men i ever saw why to be sure if he was not a servant  in short i will ask myself no more questions for the farther i examine the less reason i shall have to be

sort of a crabbed hand reads the letter  sir i am ashamed of giving you this trouble partly but i am informed there is an unthinking boy a son of mine now disguised and in your service in the capacity

please sir i will go and conduct him up to the house   j woodcock do so master hawthorn do so  but pray what sort of a man is this sir william meadows is he a wise man   hawth there is no occasion for a man that has five thousand pounds a year to be a conjurer but i suppose you ask that question because of this story about his son taking it for granted that wise parents make wise children   j woodcock no doubt of it master hawthorn no doubt of it  i warrant we shall find now that this young rascal has fallen in love with some minx against his fathers consent  why sir if i had as many children as king priam had that we read of at school in the destruction of troy not one of them would serve me so   hawth well well neighbor perhaps not but we should remember when we were young
