the traveller or a prospect of society  price one shilling and six pence  the traveller or a prospect of society a poem inscribed to the rev mr henry goldsmith by oliver goldsmith m b  london printed for j newbery in st pauls churchyard mdcclxv  to the rev henry goldsmith dear sir i am sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a dedication and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your name to my attempts which you decline giving with your own but as a part of this poem was formerly written to you from switzerland the whole can now with propriety be only inscribed to you it will also throw a light upon many parts of it when the reader understands that it is addressed to a man who despising fame and fortune has retired early to happiness and obscurity with an income of forty pounds a year  i now perceive my dear brother the wisdom of your humble choice you have entered upon a sacred office where the harvest is great and the laborers are but few while you have left the field of ambition where the laborers are many and the harvest not worth carrying away but of all kinds of ambition as things are now circumstanced perhaps that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest what from the increased refinement of the times from the diversity of judgments produced by opposing systems of criticism and from the more prevalent divisions of opinion influenced by party the strongest and happiest efforts can expect to please but in a very narrow circle though the poet were as sure of his aim as the imperial archer of antiquity who boasted that he never missed the heart yet would many of his shafts now fly at random for the heart is too often in the wrong place  poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations but in a country verging to the extremes of refinement painting and music come in for a share and as they offer the feeble mind a less laborious entertainment they at first rival poetry and at length supplant her they engross all favor to themselves and though but younger sisters seize upon the elders birthright  yet however this art may be neglected by the powerful it is still in greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it what criticisms have we not heard of late in favor of blank verse and pindaric odes chorusses anapests and iambics alliterative care and happy negligence every absurdity has now a champion to defend it and as he is generally much in the wrong so he has always much to say  but there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous i mean party party entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste a mind capable of relishing general beauty when once infected with this disease can only find pleasure in what contributes to increase the distemper like the tiger that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh the reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny makes ever after the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation such readers generally admire some halfwitted thing who wants to be thought a bold man having lost the character of a wise one him they dignify with the name of poet his lampoons are called satires his turbulence is said to be force and his phrenzy fire  what reception a poem may find which has neither abuse party nor blank verse to support it i cannot tell nor am i much solicitous to know my aims are right without espousing the cause of any party i have attempted to moderate the rage of all i have endeavored to show that there may be equal happiness in other states though differently governed from our own that each state has a peculiar principle of happiness and that this principle in each state and in our own in particular may be carried to a mischievous excess there are few can judge better than youself how far these positions are illustrated in this poem  i am sir your most affectionate brother oliver goldsmith  the traveller or a prospect of society remote unfriended melancholy slow or by the lazy scheld or wandering po or onward where the rude carinthian boor against the houseless stranger shuts the door or where campanias plain forsaken lies a weary waste expanded to the skies wherever i roam whatever realms to see my heart untravelld fondly turns to thee still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain and drags at each remove a lengthening chain eternal blessings crown my earliest friend and round his dwelling guardian saints attend blessed be that spot where cheerful guests retire to pause from toil and trim their evening fire blessed that abode where want and pain repair and every stranger finds a ready chair blessed be those feasts where mirth and peace abound where all the ruddy family around laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail or sigh with pity at some mournful tale or press the bashful stranger to his food and learn the luxury of doing good but me not destined such delights to share my prime of life in wandering spent and care impelled with steps unceasing to pursue some fleeting good that mocks me with the view that like the circle bounding earth and skies allures from far yet as i follow flies my fortune leads to traverse realms alone and find no spot of all the world my own even now where alpine solitudes ascend i sit me down a pensive hour to spend and placed on high above the storms career look downward where an hundred realms appear lakes forests cities plains extended wide the pomp of kings the shepherds humbler pride when thus creations charms around combine amidst the store twere thankless to repine twere affectation all and schooltaught pride to spurn the splendid things by heaven supplied let schooltaught pride dissemble all it can these little things are great to little man and wiser he whose sympathetic mind exults in all the good of all mankind ye glittering towns with wealth and splendor crowned ye fields where summer spreads profusion round ye lakes whose vessels catch the busy gale ye bending swains that dress the flowery vale for me your tributary stores combine creations heir the world the world is mine as some lone miser visiting his store bends at his treasure counts recounts it over hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still thus to my breast alternate passions rise pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies yet often a sigh prevails and sorrows fall to see the sum of human bliss so small and often i wish amidst the scene to find some spot to real happiness consigned where my worn soul each wandering hope at rest may gather bliss to see my fellows blessed yet where to find that happiest spot below who can direct when all pretend to know the shuddring tenant of the frigid zone boldly asserts that country for his own extols the treasures of his stormy seas and livelong nights of revelry and ease the naked negro panting at the line boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave and thanks his gods for all the good they gave nor less the patriots boast wherever we roam his first best country ever is at home and yet perhaps if states with states we scan or estimate their bliss on reasons plan though patriots flatter and though fools contend we still shall find uncertainty suspend find that each good by art or nature given to these or those but makes the balance even find that the bliss of all is much the same and patrioric boasting reasons shame nature a mother kind alike to all still grants her bliss at labors earnest call and though rough rocks or gloomy summits frown these rocks by custom turn to beds of down from art more various are the blessings sent wealth splendours honor liberty content yet these each others power so strong contest that either seems destructive of the rest hence every state to one loved blessing prone conforms and models life to that alone each to the favorite happiness attends and spurns the plan that aims at other ends till carried to excess in each domain this favorite good begets peculiar pain but let us view these truths with closer eyes and trace them through the prospect as it lies here for a while my proper cares resigned here let me sit in sorrow for mankind like yon neglected shrub at random cast that shades the steep and sighs at every blast far to the right where appennine ascends bright as the summer italy extends her uplands sloping deck the mountains side woods over woods in gay theatric pride while often some temples mouldering top between with venerable grandeur marks the scene could natures bounty satisfy the breast the sons of italy were surely blessed whatever fruits in different climes are found that proudly rise or humbly court the ground whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear whose bright succession decks the varied year whatever sweets salute the northern sky with vernal lives that blossom but to die these here disporting own the kindred soil nor ask luxuriance from the planters toil while seaborn gales their gelid wings expand to winnow fragrance round the smiling land but small the bliss that sense alone bestows and sensual bliss is all this nation knows in florid beauty groves and fields appear men seem the only growth that dwindles here contrasted faults through all their manners reign though poor luxurious though submissive vain though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue and even in penance planning sins anew all evils here contaminate the mind that opulence departed leaves behind for wealth was theirs nor far removed the date when commerce proudly flourished through the state at her command the palace learnt to rise again the longfalln column sought the skies the canvass glowed beyond even nature warm the pregnant quarry teemed with human form but more unsteady than the southern gale soon commerce turned on other shores her sail and late the nation found with fruitless skill their former strength was now plethoric ill yet though to fortune lost here still abide some splendid arts the wrecks of former pride from which the feeble heart and long fallen mind an easy compensation seem to find here may be seen in bloodless pomp arrayed the pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade processions formed for piety and love a mistress or a saint in every grove by sports like these are all their cares beguiled the sports of children satisfy the child at sports like these while foreign arms advance in passive ease they leave the world to chance when struggling virtue sinks by long control she leaves at last or feebly mans the soul while low delights succeeding fast behind in happier meanness occupy the mind as in those domes where caesars once bore sway defaced by time and tottering in decay amidst the ruin heedless of the dead the shelterseeking peasant builds his shed and wondering man could want the larger pile exults and owns his cottage with a smile my soul turn from them turn we to survey where rougher climes a nobler race display where the bleak swiss their stormy mansions tread and force a churlish soil for scanty bread no product here the barren hills afford but man and steel the soldier and his sword no vernal blooms their torpid rocks array but winter lingering chills the lap of may no zephyr fondly sooths the mountains breast but meteors glare and stormy glooms invest yet still even here content can spread a charm redress the clime and all its rage disarm though poor the peasants hut his feasts though small he sees his little lot the lot of all sees no contiguous palace rear its head to shame the meanness of his humble shed no costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal to make him loath his vegetable meal but calm and bred in ignorance and toil each wish contracting fits him to the soil cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose breasts the keen air and carrols as he goes with patient angle trolls the finny deep or drives his venurous plowshare to the steep or seeks the den where snow tracks mark the way and drags the struggling savage into day at night returning every labor sped he sits him down the monarch of a shed smiles by his cheerful fire and round surveys his childrens looks that brighten at the blaze while his loved partner boastful of her hoard displays the cleanly platter on the board and happily too some pilgrim thither led with many a tale repays the nightly bed thus every good his native wilds impart imprints the patriot passion on his heart dear is that shed to which his soul conforms and dear that hill which lifts him to the storms and as a babe when scaring sounds molest clings close and closer to the mothers breast so the loud torrent and the whirlwinds roar but bind him to his native mountains more these are the charms to barren states assigned their wants are few their wishes all confined yet let them only share the praises due if few their wants their pleasures are but few since every want that stimulates the breast becomes a source of pleasure when redrest hence from such lands each pleasing science flies that first excites desire and then supplies unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy to fill the languid pause with finer joy unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame their level life is but a smouldring fire nor quenched by want nor fand by strong desire unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer on some high festival of once a year in wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire till buried in debauch the bliss expire but not their joys alone thus coarsly flow their morals like their pleasures are but low for as refinement stops from sire to son unaltered unimprovd their manners run and loves and friendships finely pointed dart fall blunted from each indurated heart some sterner virtues over the mountains breast may sit like falcons cowring on the nest but all the gentler morals such as play through lifes more cultured walks and charm our way these far dispersed on timorous pinions fly to sport and flutter in a kinder sky to kinder skies where gentler manners reign we turn and france displays her bright domain gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease pleased with thyself whom all the world can please how often have i led thy sportive choir with tuneless pipe beside the murmuring loire where shading elms along the margin grew and freshend from the wave the zephyr flew and happily though my harsh touch faltering still but mocked all tune and marred the dancers skill yet would the village praise my wondrous power and dance forgetful of the noontide hour alike all ages dames of ancient days have led their children through the mirthful maze and the gay grandsire skilled in gestic lore has friskd beneath the burden of threescore so blessed a life these thoughtless realms display thus idly busy rolls their world away theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear for honor forms the social temper here honor that praise which real merit gains or even imaginary worth obtains here passes current paid from hand to hand it shifts in splendid traffic round the land from courts to camps to cottages it strays and all are taught an avarice of praise they please are pleased they give to get esteem till seeming blessed they grow to what they seem but while this softer art their bliss supplies it gives their follies also room to rise for praise too dearly loved or warmly sought enfeebles all internal strength of thought and the weak soul within itself unblest leans for all pleasure on anothers breast hence ostentation here with tawdry art pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart here vanity assumes her pert grimace and trims her robes of frize with copper lace here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer to boast one splendid banquet once a year the mind still turns where shifting fashion draws nor weighs the solid worth of self applause to men of other minds my fancy flies embosomd in the deep where holland lies methinks her patient sons before me stand where the broad ocean leans against the land and sedulous to stop the coming tide lift the tall rampires artificial pride that spreads its arms amidst the watery roar scoops out an empire and usurps the shore onward methinks and diligently slow the firm connected bulwark seems to go while ocean pent and rising over the pile sees an amphibious world beneath him smile the slow canal the yellow blossomed vale the willow tufted bank the gliding sail the crowded mart the cultivated plain a new creation rescued from his reign thus while around the wavesubjected soil impels the native to repeated toil industrious habits in each breast obtain and industry begets a love of gain hence all the good from opulence that springs with all those ills superfluous treasure brings are here displayed their muchloved wealth imparts convenience plenty elegance and arts but view them closer craft and fraud appear even liberty itself is bartered here at golds superior charms all freedom flies the needy sell it and the rich man buys a land of tyrants and a den of slaves here wretches seek dishonorable graves and calmly bent to servitude conform dull as their lakes that sleep beneath the storm heavens how unlike their belgic sires of old rough poor content ungovernably bold war in each breast and freedom on each brow how much unlike the sons of britain now fired at the sound my genius spreads her wing and flies where britain broods the western spring where lawns extend that scorn arcadian pride and brighter streams than famed hydaspis glide there all around the gentlest breezes stray there gentle music melts on every spray creations mildest charms are there combined extremes are only in the masters mind stern over each bosom reason holds her state with daring aims irregularly great i see the lords of human kind pass by pride in their port defiance in their eye intent on high designs a thoughtful band by forms unfashiond fresh from natures hand fierce in a native hardiness of soul true to imagined right above control while even the peasant boasts these rights to scan and learns to venerate himself as man thine freedom thine the blessings pictured here thine are those charms that dazzle and endear too blessed indeed were such without alloy but fostered even by freedom ills annoy that independence britons prize too high keeps man from man and breaks the social tie see though by circling deeps together held minds combat minds repelling and repelled ferments arise imprisoned factions roar represt ambition struggles round her shore whilst overwrought the general system feels its motions stopped or phrenzy fires the wheels nor this the worst as social bonds decay as duty love and honor fail to sway fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law still gather strength and force unwilling awe hence all obedience bows to these alone and talent sinks and merit weeps unknown till time may come when stripped of all her charms that land of scholars and that nurse of arms where noble stems transmit the patriot flame and monarchs toil and poets pant for fame one sink of level avarice shall lie and scholars soldiers kings unhonord die yet think not thus when freedoms ills i state i mean to flatter kings or court the great perish the wish for inly satisfied above their pomps i hold my ragged pride but when contending chiefs blockade the throne contracting regal power to stretch their own when i behold a factious band agree to call it freedom when themselves are free each wanton judge new penal statutes draw laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law the wealth of climes where savage nations roam pillaged from slaves to purchase slaves at home fear pity justice indignation start tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart till half a patriot half a coward grown i fly from petty tyrants to the throne yes brother curse with me that baleful hour when first ambition struck at regal power and thus polluting honor in its source gave wealth to sway the mind with double force have we not seen round britains peopled shore her useful sons exchanged for useless ore seen all her triumphs but destruction haste like flaring tapers brightening as they waste seen opulence her grandeur to maintain lead stern depopulation in her train and over fields where scattered hamlets rose in barren solitary pomp repose have we not seen at pleasures lordly call the smiling longfrequented village fall beheld the duteous son the fire decayed the modest matron and the blushing maid forced from their homes a melancholy train to traverse climes beyond the western main where wild oswego spreads her swamps around and niagara stuns with thundering sound even now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays through tangled forests and through dangerous ways where beasts with man divided empire claim and the brown indian takes a deadly aim there while above the giddy tempest flies and all around distressful yells arise the pensive exile bending with his woe to stop too fearful and too faint to go casts a fond look where englands glories shine and bids his bosom sympathize with mine vain very vain my weary search to find that bliss which only centers in the mind why have i strayed from pleasure and repose to seek a good each government bestows in every government though terrors reign though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain how small of all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings can cause or cure still to ourselves in every place consigned our own felicity we make or find with secret course which no loud storms annoy glides the smooth current of domestic joy the lifted ax the agonizing wheel lukes iron crown and damiens bed of steel to men remote from
