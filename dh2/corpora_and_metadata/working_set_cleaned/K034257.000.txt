a charge to the poets by william whitehead esquire poet laureat  quasi ex cathedra loquitur   london printed for r and j dodsley at tullyshead pallmall and sold by j hinxman at the globe in pater noster row mdcclxii  a charge to the poets full twenty years have rolled ye rhiming band since first i dipped in ink my trembling hand for much it trembled though thobliging few who judge with candor praised the the danger of writing verse first printed in the year      to which this poem may be considered as a sequel sketch i drew and echo answering from the public voice indulged as genius what i feared was choice at length arrived at those maturer years so rarely raised by hope or sunk by fears i rest in peace or scribble if i please in point of wealth not affluent but at ease in point of what the world and you call fame i judge but by conjecture much the same but whether right or wrong i judge to you it matters not the following fact is true from nobler names and great in each degree the pensiond laurel has devolved to me to me ye bards and what you will scarce conceive or at the best unwillingly believe however unworthily i wear the crown unasked it came and from a hand unknown then since my king and patron have thought fit to place me on the throne of modern wit my grave advice my brethren hear at large as bishops to their clergy give their charge though many a priest who listens might afford perhaps more solid counsel to my lord to you ye guardians of the sacred fount deans and archdeacons of the double mount that through our realms intestine broils may cease my first and last advice is keep the peace what is it to you that half the town admire false sense false strength false softness or false fire through heavens void concave let the meteors blaze he hurts his own who wounds anothers bays what is it to you that numbers place your name first fifth or twentieth in the lists of fame old time will settle all your claims at once record the genius and forget the dunce it boots us much to know observers say of what materials nature formed our clay from what strange beast prometheus plastic art purloind the particle which rules the heart if milky softness gliding through the veins incline the muse to panegyric strains insipid lays our kindest friends may lull be very moral yet be very dull if bile prevails and temper dictates satire our wit is spleen our virtue is ill nature with it is own malice armed we combat evil as zeal for gods sake sometimes plays the devil o mark it well does pride affect to reign the solitary tyrant of the brain or vanity exert her quickening flame stuck round with ears that listen after fame o to these points let strict regard be given nor e coelo descendit  juv know thyself in vain descend from heaven do critics teize you  with a smile i speak nor would suppose my brethren were so weak it is on ourselves and not our foes or friends our future fame or infamy depends let envy point or malice wing the darts they only wound us in our mortal parts besides it is much too late to go to school grown men will judge by natures noblest rule admire true beauties and slight faults excuse not learn to dance from this is not intended as a reflection on either the journals or the reviews they are not the masters but the scholars the grown gentlemen at whom the author smiles and who he thinks had much better not pretend to judge at all than borrow opinions which never sit easy upon them journals and reviews if fools traduce you and your works decry as many fools will rate your worth too high then balance the account and fairly take the cool report which men of judgment make in writing as in life he foils the foe who conscious of his strength forgives the blow they court the insult who but seem afraid and then by answering you promote the trade and give them what their own weak claims deny a chance for future laughter or a sigh you who as yet unsullied by the press hang over your labors in their virgin dress and you who late the public taste have hit and still enjoy the honeymoon of wit attentive hear me grace may still abound whoever preaches if the doctrines sound if nature prompts you or if friends persuade why write but never pursue it as a trade and soldom publish manuscripts disarm the censors frown and boast an added charm enhance their worth by ming to retire for what but few can prate of all admire who trade in verse alas as rarely find the public grateful as the muses kind from constant feasts like fated guests we steal and tired of tickling lose all power to feel it is novelty we want with that in view we praise stale matter so the bard be new or from known bards with exstucy receive each part new whim they almost blush to give a life of writing unless wondrous short no wit can brave no genius can support some soberer province for your business choose be that your helmet and your plume the muse through fames long rubric down from chaucers time few fortunes have been raised by lofty rhyme and when our toils success no longer crowns what shelter find we from a world in frowns over each distress which vice or folly brings though charity extend her healing wings no maudlin hospitals are yet assigned for slipshod muses of the vagrant kind where anthems might succeed to satires keen and hymns of penitence to songs obscene what refuge then remains  with gracious grin some practiced bookseller invites you in where luckless bards condemned to court the town not for their parents vices but their own write gay conundrums with an aching head or carn by defamation daily bread or friendless shirtless pennyless complain not of the worlds but caelias cold disdain lords of their workhouse see the tyrants sit brokers in books and scockjobbers in wit beneath whose lash obliged to write or fast our confessors and martyrs breathe their last and can ye bear such insolence  away for shame plough dig turn pedlars drive the dray with minds indignant each employment suits our fleets want sailors and our troops recruits and many a dirty street on thamess side is yet by stool and brush unoccupied time was when poets played the thorough game swore drank and blusterd and blasphemed for fame the first in brothels with their punk and muse your toast ye bards pamassus and the stews thank heaven the times are changed no poet now need roar for bacchus or to venus bow it is our own fault if fieldings lash we feel or like french wits begin with the bastile even in those days some few escaped their fate by better judgment or a longer date and rode like buoys triumphant over the tide poor otway in an alehouse dosd and died while happier southern though with spots of yore like platos hovering spirits crusted over lived every mortal vapor to remove and to our admiration joined our love light lie his funeral turf  for you who join his decent manners to his art divine would ye whilst round you toss the proud and vain convulsed with feeling or with giving pain indulge the muse in innocence and ease and tread the flowery path of life in peace avoid all authors  what the illusious few who shunning fame have taught her to pursue fair virtues heralds  yes i say again avoid all authors till you have read the men full many a peevish envious slandering elf is in his works benevolence itself for all mankind unknown his bosom heaves he only injures those with whom he lives read then the man does truth his actions guide exempt from petulance exempt from pride to social duties does his heart attend as son as father husband brother friend do those who know him love him if they do you have my permission you may love him too but chief avoid the boisterous roaring sparks the sons of fire  you will know them by their marks fond to be heard they always court a crowd and though it is borrowed nonsense talk it loud one epithet supplies their constant chime damned bad damned good damned low and damned sublime but most in quick short repartee they shine of local humor or from plays purloin each quaint stale scrap which every subject hits till fools almost imagine they are wits hear them on shakespeare there they foam they rage yet taste not half the beauties of his page nor see that art as well as nature strove to place him foremost in the aonian grove for there there only where the sisters meet his genius triumphs and the works complete or would ye sift more near these sons of fire it is garrick and not shakespeare they admire without his breath inspiring every thought they never perhaps had known what shakespeare wrote without his eager his becoming zeal to teach them though they scarce know why to feel a crude unmeaning mass had johnson been and a dead letter shakespeares noblest seen o come the time when diffidence again shall bind our youth in natures modest chain born in a happier age and happier clime old sophocles had merit in his time and so no doubt however we flout his plays had poor euripides in former days not like the moderns we confess but yet some seeming faults we surely might forget because twould puzzle even the wise to show whether those faults were real faults or no to all true merit give it is just applause the worst have beauties and the best have flaws greek french italian english great or small i own my frailty i admire them all there are mistaking prejudice for taste who on one species all their rapture waste though various as the flowers which paint the year in rainbow charms the changeful nine appear the different beauties coyly they admit and to one standard would confine our wit some mannerd verse delights while some can raise to fairy fiction their exstatic gaze admire pure poetry and revel there on sightless forms and pictures of the air some hate all rhyme some seriously deplore that milton wants that one enchantment more tired with the ambiguous tale or antique phrase over spensers happiest paintings loveliest lays some heedless pass while some with transport view each quaint old word which scarce eliza knew and eager as the fancied knights prepare the lance and combat in ideal war dragons of lust and giants of despair why be it so and what each thinks the test let each enjoy but not condemn the rest readers there are of every class prepared each village teems each hamlet has its bard who gives the tone and all the inferior fry like the great vulgar here will join the cry but be it mine with every bard to glow and taste his raptures genuine as they flow through all the muses wilds to rove along from plaintive elegy to epic song and if the sense be just the numbers clear and the true coloring of the work be there again subdued by truths ingenuous call i own my frailty i admire them all nor think i with the mob that nature now no longer warms the soil where laurels grow it is true our poets in repose delight and wiser than their fathers seldom write yet i but i forbear for prudent ends could name a list and half of them my friends for whom posterity it is wreaths shall twine and it is own bards neglect to honor mine their poets in their turn will grieve and swear perhaps with truth no patron lends an ear complaints of times when merit wants reward descend like similies from bard to bard we copy our distress from greece and rome as in our northern lays their flowrets bloom we feel their breezes with their heats we burn and plead prescription to rejoice or mourn all present times are bad then cast your eyes where fairy scenes of bliss in prospect rise as fond enthusiasts over the western main with eager ken prophetical in vain see the mixed multitudes from every land grow pure by blending virtuous by command till phoenixlike a new bright world of gold springs from the dregs and refuse of the old i am no enthusiast yet with joy can trace some gleams of sunshine for the tuneful race if monarchs listen when the muses woo attention wakes and nations listen too the bard grows rapturous who was dumb before and every freshplumd eagle learns to soar friend of the siner arts when egypt saw her second ptolemy give science law each genius wakened from his dead repose the column swelled the pile majestic rose exact proportion borrowed strength from ease and use was taught by elegance to please along the breathing walls as fancy flowed the sculpture softened and the picture glowed heroes revived in animated stone the groves grew vocal and the the seven poets patronised by ptolemy philadelphus are usually called by the name of that constellation pleiads shone old nilus raised his head and wondering cried long live the king my patron and my pride secure of endless praise behold i bear my grateful suffrage to my sovereigns ear though war shall rage though time shall level all yon colors sicken and yon columns fall though arts dear treasures feed the wasting flame and the proud volume sinks an empty name though plenty may desert this copious vale my streams be scattered or my fountain fail yet ptolemy has lived the world has known a king of arts a patron on a throne even utmost britain shall his name adore and boyn be sung when it has ceased to flow addison and nile be sung when nile shall flow no more one rule remains nor shun nor court the great your truest center is that middle state from whence with case the observing eye may go to all which soars above or sinks below it is yours all manners to have tried or known to adopt all virtues yet retain your own to stem the tide where thoughtless crowds are hurled the firm spectators of a bustling world thus armed proceed the breezes court your wing go range all helicon taste every spring from varying nature cull thinnoxious spoil and whilst amusement sooths the generous toil let puzzled critics with judicious spite descant on what you can or can not write true to yourselves not anxious for renown nor court the worlds applause nor dread it is frown guard your own breasts and be the bulwark there to know no envy and no malice fear at least you will find thus stoiclike prepared that verse and virtue are their own reward the end
