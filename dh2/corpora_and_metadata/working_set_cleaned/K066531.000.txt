observations civil and canonical on the marriage contract as entered into conformably to the rites and ceremonies of the church of england  by w kenrick ll d  mulier siquidem quae a viro secedit alterique adjungitur adultera judicatur nec amplius a viro suo recipietur virum autem etiamsi fornicatus fuerit aut adulteratus mulier relinquere haud potest zonar de can xi basilii london printed for s hooper no    on ludgate hill mdcclxxv  advertisement the licentiousness of the married women of the present day and the encouragement given them by the spiritual court in admitting their recrimination on their husbands in order to prevent divorce threaten such dreadful consequences to society that the publication of the succeeding observations originally written to serve a private purpose has been represented to their author as a laudable expedient that may possibly check in some measure that dissoluteness of manners which distinguishes the present from any former era and reflects the highest dishonor on our age and nation he would be wanting therefore in his duty to community should he withold from the public any thing that promises to contribute to so salutary a purpose even though the following strictures should be deemed among the feeblest efforts of his pen to the ladies he makes no apology for proving that infidelity in a husband is less criminal in the eye of the law than prostitution in a wise as he cannot suppose the profligacy of the former a tempting example to the latter unless he could subscribe to the poets severe satire on the sex when he says  every woman is at heart a rake pope observations civil and canonical etc according to the present practice of our ecclesiastical courts in cases of matrimonial infidelity if the party accused prove that the accuser has also committed adultery or even fornication which our modern practice has confounded with adultery contrary to the sense and spirit of the canons and the scriptures or divine law on which the ecclesiastical law is confessedly founded such proof is held a compensation for the crime of the accused and the accuser fails of course in the suit but this is contrary to the practice of the civil and canon law in other protestant countries and as it stood immediately after the reformation in england a divorce for adultery was then granted a vinculo matrimonii from the bonds of matrimony and it was the opinion of the church of england at the commencement of the reign of queen elizabeth that after a divorce for adultery the parties might marry again it is true that the despotic tribunal the star chamber whose very name is odious to the ears of a freeborn englishman did reverse this opinion that arbitrary and highflown prelate archbishop bancroft with the consent of the clergy got it there determined that adultery was only a cause of divorce a mensa et thoro from bed and board  but what was this less than acting against the spirit reversing the very principles of the reformation and recurring back again to the usages and practices of popery it is indeed remarkable that englishmen talk sometimes as ignorantly of their religious as of their civil liberty in extravagantly boasting the effects of the reformation  had indeed the reformatio legum projected in the reign of henry the eighth been carried into execution by any of his successors a more complete reform would have taken place in england as it did in holland and other protestant countries but as it is the reformation has but imperfectly entered into the constitution of the church of england and the institutes of our ecclesiastical law there having been few if any statutes since made respecting popery in which the saving of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction is not especially provided for it is indeed expressly mentioned in most of them that nothing therein shall take away or abridge the authority or jurisdiction of ecclesiastical censures but that the archbishops bishops and other ecclesiastical judges may proceed as before such laws were enacted what is this but carefully raking up the embers and most superstitiously preserving the idolatrous relicts of popery  the above practice is plainly the effect of the advantage which the prelate and priests abovementioned took of the failure of the intended reformation of the churchlaws to establish in the star chamber a doctrine diametrically opposite to the opinion of the learned and pious fathers of the reformation martin bucer in the tract he addressed to edward the sixth on this subject employs a whole chapter chap xxxii to prove from the best authorities as well of the primitive fathers as of the doctrines of the christian church that a manifest adultress ought to be divorced and cannot lawfully be retained in marriage by a christian  if law says that celebrated casuist milton aim at the firm establishment and preservation of matrimonal faith we know that cannot thrive under violent means but is the more violated it is not when two unfortunately met are by the canon forced to draw in that yoke an unmerciful days work of sorrow till death unharness em that then the law keeps marriage most unviolated and unbroken but when the law takes order that marriage be accountant and responsible to perform that society whether it be religious civil or corporal which may be conscionably required and claimed therein or else to be dissolved if it cannot be undergone this is to make marriage most indissoluble by making it a just and equal dealer a performer of those due helps which instituted the covenant it being otherwise a most unjust contract and no more to be maintained under tuition of the law than the vilest fraud or cheat or theft that may be committed the law can to no rational purpose forbid divorce it can only take care that the conditions of divorce be not injurious  for this as a real state of the case he appeals to the learned seldens tract on the law of nature and nations a work says he more useful and more worthy to be perused by whosoever studies to be a great man in wisdom equity and justice than all those decretals and sumless sums which the pontifical clerks have doted on ever since that unfortunate mother famously sinned thrice and died impenitent of her bringing into the world those two misbegotten infants and forever infants lombard and gratian him the compiler of canon iniquity the other the tubal cain of scholastic sophistry whose overspreading barbarism has not only infused their own bastardy upon the fruitfullest part of humane learning but obscured the clear light of nature and of nations by their calumnious dunceries  now if these authorities strengthened by those of the most rigid divines and moralists among the first reformers such as wickliff luther melancton erasmus and a long train of divines civilians and canonists down to grotius himself i say if these authorities will justify the setting aside that of justinian and the popish decretals in favor of valentinian and theodosius supported by almost all the primitive fathers the modern practice of refusing a divorce in cases of adultery must be allowed to be a barbarous and oppressive instance of the remains of priestcraft and popery the consequence of an imperfect reformation nor do the ancient authorities abovementioned want later confirmation as to their justice and propriety even blackstone himself in admitting that though the canon law which the common law most exceptionably follows only in this particular case deems so highly and with such mysterious reverence of the nuptial tie that it will not allow it to be unloosed for any cause whatever which arises after the union is made he yet plainly insinuates that such doctrine does not appear to him well grounded it is said proceeds this learned writer to be built on the divine revealed law though that expressly assigns incontinence as a cause why a man may put away his wife and marry another see blackstones commentaries on the laws of england book i chap xv   this argument may be carried still farther and the practice of admitting the plea of recrimination and of refusing a complete divorce a vinculo even in cases of adultery be proved totally inconsistent with the spirit and practice of the common and statute law by which the canon law should be controuled this indeed is the generallyreceived opinion although it is whimsically observable that there is a difference between the opinions of our most approved lawyers even on this point burn lays it down as a certain and universal rule that the civil and canon law in all cases is subordinate to the common and statute law this was the opinion also of judge hale and lord chief justice coke blackstone on the other hand tells you that the common law follows the canon law in cases of divorce for adultery though he himself allows elsewhere that it is beyond a doubt that the civil and canon laws though admitted in some cases by custom in some courts are only subordinate and leges sub graviori lege when doctors thus differ it is not to be wondered at that inferior practitioners are so ready on all occasions to give that opprobrious and illiberal toast the profitable uncertainty of the law   the star chamber whose decisions as i have observed our ecclesiastical courts now follow in this particular determined indeed that a man divorced from his wife for incontinency on her part should not marry again setting aside in the famous case of foliambe the second marriage of a man so circumstanced which it declared void but how does this practice agree with the common and statute law by the statute   j c    any person guilty of polygamy or marrying a second wife while the first be living is deemed guilty of felony in the same act however it is provided among other provisos that it shall not extend to any person who shall be at the time of such marriage divorced by any sentence in the ecclesiastical court now the commentators on this proviso all agree that the divorce therein intimated cannot mean the divorce a vinculo matrimonii for then without the aid of any proviso either party may freely marry but it must be intended of divorces merely a mensa et thoro  it is hence plain that the statute law by excepting persons marrying under such a predicament from the penalty inflicted on polygamy tacitly admits of such marriages which is plainly incompatible with the starchamber decision above mentioned to this may be added that in most cases the common and statute laws of england consider marriage as blackstone has it only as a civil contract or union  indeed the facility with which acts of parliament are obtained for divorces on the censures of the ecclesiastical court is a plain proof of the sense of the legislature respecting their propriety although it must be owned that the formality of obtaining such acts of parliament on these occasions is a restraint upon the subject which gives countenance to the difficulties the canonists throw in the way of persons suing out a divorce in the spiritual court these acts of parliament indeed put one in mind of the papal dispensations that were granted with like facility as salvos for the rigorous canons of the council of trent which prohibited divorce on any occasion whatever  it is sensibly enough observed by an anoymous writer who seems nevertheless but little acquainted with the practice of the canon law in england that according to the spirit of the canon law by some called a disgraceful vestige of monkish barbarism and popish tyranny marriage is still held so religiously sacramental as to be indissoluble even for incontinence the wedded pair must still as milton says spite of antipathy fadge together but this to the scandal of our laws continues the writer is not the case in any other protestant country and yet as if we were going to turn romanists and devolve again into a state of ignorance and barbarity we have lately seen the papal decisions respecting the marriage of adulterers and the impedimentum criminis of the schools receive the sanction of a british act of parliament but for heavens sake why not give a political toleration to a personal attachment when the ties are dissolved which rendered it criminal it is absurd to suppose that such an interdiction will operate to the prevention of adultery or that a solicitude about future rights of marriage will affect their present violation  an englishman and a protestant must be far from wishing to see any more examples of this kind so far indeed must a conscientious man tenacious of civil and religious liberty be from applauding these parliamentary concessions in favor of popery that he could rather wish to see a legislative revision of them and a fair investigation of the point whether the legal abolition by statute of that arbitrary tribunal the starchamber did not virtually annul both the precedents and practice of that court as well respecting ecclesiastical as civil matters in which case the matter of divorce would stand as it did just after the reformation and agreeable to the opinion of the church of england in the beginning of the reign of elizabeth dr burn indeed congratulates his contemporaries and says it is the glory of the present age that the contests between the courts of the common and the ecclesiastical law regarding their respective jurisdictions have subsided persecution says he has departed to its native hell and fair benevolence has come down from heaven the distinctions which were introduced during the plenitude of papal power have fallen away by degrees and we shall naturally recur to the state wherein popery took us up in which there was no thwarting between the two jurisdictions but they were amicably conjoined affording mutual help and ornament to each other  doubtless this is a consummation devoutly to be wished but before it is completed i conceive it will be necessary to make some essential alteration or more properly speaking reformation in the practice of the ecclesiastical courts respecting divorce     but to confine myself to the case of matrimony i shall enter into an investigation of the nature of the crime commonly called adultery and inquire how far the modern practice of our spiritual courts in granting or refusing divorces under pretense of that crime is conformable to the canons of the christian church and the laws of england  there is hardly a word in our language of more vague and indeterminate import than that of adultery our most accurate lexicographers have but ill explained it as a word nor have our lawyers defined it as a technical term with better success  adultery says the late learned editor of bailey is properly the sin of incontinency in married persons defiling the marriagebed it is adultery if but one of them be married in the married person fornication in the unmarried see baileys dictionary folio edited by dr scott under the word adultery also fornication under which latter head we have the following remark query whether fornication in the scripture use of the word is not distinct from concubinage and if so whether our modern acceptance of the word gives a just idea of it and by the way if adultery in the scripture use means only the cohabitation with anothers wife query if the modern use of this word also should not be reconsidered  now that the scripture use of these words should determine their sense in the spiritual court is evident because the decisions of that court are determined by the canons of the church confessedly founded on the divine law as it is laid down in the scriptures according to the decrees divinum jus in scripturis divinis habemus distinct       adultery says chambers adulterium in ancient law books called advowtry is a crime committed by married persons against the faith pledged to each other in marriage by having carnal commerce with some other or even by a person not married by having to do with another that is  it is very plain that these lexicographers by making use of the word person and one in the epicene gender have given but a very imperfect definition of the term the first says that if one of the parties concerned be married and the other not it is adultery in the married person and fornication only in the person unmarried but this differs with the sex of the party for though an unmarried woman lie with whom she will be not an adultress yet an unmarried man lying with a married woman is universally allowed to be an adulterer  again the latter says an unmarried person having carnal commerce with another that is married is guilty of adultery but this holds good only when the unmarried person is the male for to reverse the above proposition though an unmarried man lying with a married woman be allowedly an adulterer an unmarried woman lie with whom she will is never stigmatized as an adultress a married woman only can be an adultress the commission of the crime of adultery absolutely requires that the female party should be a wife and hence it is evident that as a single woman lying with a married man is no adulteress so a married man lying with a single woman is no adulterer there is no wife criminally concerned in the case  our lawyers as i observed are as palpably defective in their definitions as the lexicographers wood in his civil institute gives us the following definition and illustration for which he refers to the digest of justinian adultery adulterium quasi ad alterius thorum or ad alteram ire he might have added that an adulterer is also called in latin moechus from  ex  quod a domo sua aversus alio se convertat  is a carnal knowledge of another mans wife so that a wife only can be guilty of adultery and a married man that lies with a single woman is not guilty of that crime his guilt is only stuprum because in him there is no danger of a confusion in families no bastardy to inherit or rob the legitimate children wood inst book iii chap x   what strange inaccuracy adultery is the carnal knowledge of another mans wife so that a wife only can be guilty of adultery how can a wife only or how can she even at all have carnal knowledge of another mans wife this blunder however the author obviates by his subsequent explanation showing that he meant to say that no woman but a wife can be guilty of adultery and that no man is guilty of it who does not lie with another mans wife  from getting rid of this blunder our learned lawyer proceeds nevertheless to fall into another by the divine law says he adultery is every violation of the conjugal rites and marriage bed committed either by the man or woman lev  0 0 and so it is by the canons     c nemo etc let us turn now to the text to which we are referred and the man that commits adultery with another mans wife even he that commits adultery with his neighbors wife the adulterer and adulteress shall be put to death  what do we find here that shows the divine or canon law to be different from the civil it expressly speaks of the crime of lying with another mans wife why then is it suggested that any other violation of the conjugal rites is adultery  it is certainly a breach of the conjugal rites and of the faith pledged in marriage if the husband turn away his wife without just cause refusing to love to cherish and to hold her for better for worse in sickness and in health as he promises but this he may do without violating the marriage bed without being guilty of adultery or even fornication on the other hand he may be guilty of fornication without any violation of conjugal rites or breach of his matrimonial vow as i shall presently show  but here it must be understood that i speak only of persons married to each other according to the rites and ceremonies of the church of england and not of persons of the romish religion or other persuasions at the same time we are to take with us that the canons of the church by which the ecclesiastical courts are in these cases governed are no farther binding in those courts nor can such canons lawfully influence their decisions farther than they are supported by the divine law as it is laid down in the holy scriptures it is here also to be observed that though the courtschristian are governed by the canons of the church which are founded on scripture the scriptures do not as the canonists affect to believe thus in the case of divorce between the earl and countess of essex heard before the kings delegates in the   th year of james i the archbishop of canterbury began his arguments by saying in as much as we firmly believe that the scripture does directly or by consequence contain in it sufficient matter to decide all controversies especially in things appertaining to the church as that marriage among christians can be no less accounted than a sacred thing as being instituted by god himself in paradise honored by the presence of our savior himself declared by st paul to be a sign of the spiritual conjunctions between christ and his church  in reply to this his graces preamble however the kings answer declared the opinion to be puritanical and preposterous the orthodox proposition says he is that the scripture does directly or by consequence contain in it sufficient matter to decide all controversies in points of faith and salvation of which sort marriage cannot be accounted for one   contain sufficient rules to decide all controversies relative to matters agitated in those courts  the spiritual courts in this protestant country are to judge by the canons of the christian church as adopted at the reformation by the laws and the church of england not by the canons of the church of rome which the former can legally retain only so far as those canons are consistent with the holy scriptures  taking things in this light the whole practice of the spiritual courts in refusing a divorce a vinculo in cases of adultery is illegal antichristian and oppressive nor is this any novel doctrine calculated for the present purpose adultery was held a sufficient cause for divorce a vinculo in the times of henry viii edward vi and in the beginning of the reign of elizabeth in the debates of the house of lords on the celebrated case of lord ross bishop cozens proved beyond a doubt on the best authorities of the scriptures the primitive fathers and councils that adultery works a dissolution of marriage between christians his words are remarkable the first institution of marriage that the parties may be one flesh is by adultery dissolved when the adulteress makes herself one flesh with another man and thereby dissolves the first bond of her marriage  to this purpose the learned bishop quotes among other respectable authorities the argument of amesius which concludes thus by adultery the very essence of the contract is directly violated now the contract ceasing the bond depending on the contract ceases of course it is against all reason that the matrimonial duties should be for ever taken away yet the bond or obligation to those duties should continue  sergeant wright in his pleadings before the commons in the duke of norfolks case cast a very bold and just reflection on this practice of the spiritual court there is an exception to the general councils and canons in the refusal of a divorce a vinculo in cases of adultery mr speaker i say it is an ecclesiastical constitution which is contrary to the law of god  by what law then are our ecclesiastical courts in england governed by the canons of the church what church the church of rome or the church of england it cannot be the latter for to use the words of the learned bishop above mentioned i know not why they should be called the church of england that join with the council of trent and plead so much to uphold it rather than others who join with all the reformed churches and plead against that canon of the church of rome which has laid an anthema upon us if we do not agree with them  i shall not trouble the reader therefore with insignificant authorities from the popish canons with protestants of the church of england marriage is not a sacrament it is merely a civil contract as it is in other protestant countries in holland the ceremony of marriage is not celebrated merely by the priest but by the magistrate as it was in england during the interregnum by the justices of the peace which marriages were confirmed by act of parliament on the restoration the terms of which are prescribed in the ritual which is confirmed by act of parliament and though the meaning of these terms is to be explained in a scriptural sense yet that sense is to be determined by the divine law as laid down in the scriptures and not by the canon laws derived from popish councils or papal decrees  before i proceed however to consider the terms of the matrimonial contract as entered into by the members of the church of england i shall endeavor to elucidate a point which seems to have perplexed some of our ablest civilians respecting the nature and punishment of adultery  having explained what is meant by the crime of adultery the author of woods institute proceeds to enumerate the several punishments that have been inflicted on such criminals in different ages and countries he observes that by the constitution of constantine it was punished with death agreeable to the levitical law and for a good reason continues he because it might include the worst kind of robbery that of depriving innocent children of their lawful inheritance  but it is not made death in the wife by the novels of justinian she only undergoes a scourging and the loss of her dower and if afterward she is confined to a monastery the husband has liberty to receive his wife at any time within two years but by that law it is death in the husband see wood inst book iii chap x   on the apparent incompatibility of mildness and severity contained in this law our modern institutor has the following remark  the reason of this i cannot understand it is said that theodora the wife of justinian was the contriver of it some pretend that allowances ought to be made for the weakness of the sex but granting this effect of female influence on the auther of the novels fickle as he was in the light of a lawgiver he could never be so favorable to the fair sex and cruel to his own as to punish incontinence in the one with death and to excuse the other with only the loss of dower and a scourging especially if we consider that the civil consequences of the one and the other are so very disproportionate especially too as the affair of scourging was what the wife must of course be supposed to have been used to unless her husband neglecting solomons advice by sparing the rod had spoiled the child for the civil law gave the husband a very wholesome authority over his wife allowing him for some misdemeanors flagellibus et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem that is according to some translators to cane or lace her sides very handsomely an unpolished custom it is true prevailing at present i think only in russia under the government of an empress remarkable for her matrimonial obedience   but though wood could not comprehend the reason why the husband was punished with death when the wife escaped with scourging it is plain from this very circumstance that by adultery in the husband was not meant mere fornication or the simple act of incontinency it was the crime of lying with another mans wife a crime much more heinous in a married man who had a wife of his own to go to than in a single man who had none the crime of the married man being what our lawyers call double adultery and therefore it is no wonder it was severely and signally punished  at the same time we may learn from the code that adultery even in a husband was not thus severely punished unless it was committed knowingly and wilfully  if one lies with anothers wife not knowing her to be married as in the public stews this punishment ought not to be inflicted for though a man who attempts an unlawful thing shall be liable to the consequences of it yet those consequences ought to be of the same nature with the first design agreeably as he might have observed to the ancient maxim actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea as when one intends to kill titius and kills marius by mistake he shall die for it because he intended murder but he that intended to commit fornication with titia and ignorantly commits adultery with her not knowing her to be married ought not to be punished for adultery for a crime of a different nature was intended what if the man designed adultery with titia and it appears that titia is unmarried neither ought he in this case to be punished as an adulterer for the intention and the act ought to pursue each other at least in the general design wood inst page     see also justinians code it is hence extremely clear that the carnal commerce of a married man with a woman whom he does not know or has not reason to believe is married is not adultery in the man whether the woman be married or single while on the contrary a married woman is guilty of adultery by carnal commerce with any man but her husband because she cannot be inconscious of her own marriage and therefore must know that she is both principal and accomplice in the lying with another mans wife which is of the very essence as the schoolmen say of adultery  this distinction between adultery and simple fornication is perfectly conformable to the ancient canons of the christian church and the judgment of the ablest scholiasts before they were superseded by the modern innovations of popery thus theodore balsamon in his scholium on the   th apostolic canon says that if a married man has to do with a single woman he does not commit adultery but only fornication but if he lies with a married woman he is an adulterer whereas if a married woman has the carnal knowledge of any man whatever except her husband she commits adultery scias autem quod vir quidem si adhuc constante matrimonio cum aliqua muliere liberarem habeat fornicationem non adulterium committit non ita autem si cum ea quae viro conjuncta est tunc enim ut adulter punitur mulier autem si cum alio quocunque constante matrimonio coeat ut adultera punitur  see beveridges synodicon tom i p      the same doctrine is laid down also in the canons of st basil and appears to be universally received by the primitive fathers of the ancient greek and latin churches  nor was this doctrine merely preceptive it was confirmed by discipline for the husband was permitted nay enjoined to put away his wife for adultery but the woman was expressedly forbid to leave or put away her husband for fornication or even adultery  in the ninth canon of st basil it is declared on the authority also of hieremias that if a married woman goes astray with a man she shall not be returned to her husband but remain in her pollution for to live with an adulteress is absurd and impious si fuerit mulier cum alio viro non revertetur ad virum suum sed polluta polluetur qui habet adulteram stultus et impius  bas can ix at the same time the same canon declares and is strenuously seconded by the scholiasts that a married woman cannot lawfully leave or put away her husband though he be a fornicator and even an adulterer mulier siquidem quae a viro secedit alterique adjungitur adultera judicatur nec amplius a viro suo recipietur virum autem etiamsi fornicatus fuerit aut adulteratus mulier relinquere haud potest zonar de can ix basilii  the same scholiast in his note on the   th apostolic canon expresses himself also as follows if a married man have to do with a woman not his wife we judge him guilty of fornication but we have no canon that subjects him to the punishment of adultery if the woman he lies with be unmarried the wife therefore must receive the husband returning from fornication but the husband may turn his incontinent wife out of doors si vir uxori cohabitans cum altera fuerit fornicatorem talem judicamus non tamen habemus canonem quo adulterii crimini subjiciatur si sit in nonnuptam peccatum uxor itaque a fornicatione redeuntem maritum suum recipiet maritus vero pollutam ab aedibus suis excludet  beveridges synodicon ubi supra   i have already mentioned that martin bucer in his famous treatise on divorce addressed to edward the sixth devotes a whole chapter to prove it unlawful for a christian to cohabit with a known adultress not having his book i cannot cite any of his arguments but must content myself with the authority of milton for his having fully proved his point not that i need rely on it the mosaic law expressly commanded the husband to put away his wife on just cause of dislike and certain it is that not only the primitive fathers were of this opinion but the christian necessity of a mans casting off a known and even a suspected the spirited delicacy of julius caesar on this head is well known it is not enough that caesars wife be innocent she must not be suspected  the novels of justinian allowed the husband privilege to kill any person whom he but suspected of abusing his bed after he had given him three warnings in writing before witnesses not to converse with her for then if the person admonished neglected this notice and was found thrice in suspected places with her the husband was excused from the penalty of murder if he killed him see wood inst book iii chap x also just nov     c ult see also on this subject wagenseil de uxore adulterii suspecta   adultress was declared by several of the earlier councils it was indeed enjoined pro salute animae on pain of spiritual censure and corporal penance particularly by the councils of eliberis neocaesarea and nants the first decreed the husband excommunicate who kept his wife knowing her to be adultress and the last condemned him to a seven years penance  into what a dilemma therefore were christian husbands reduced by the popish council of trent which decreed the marriage bond indissoluble on any account whatever they could neither lawfully get rid of the adultress nor live lawfully with her  this doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage was a most excellent expedient for the church of rome by opening a channel for the trade of dispensations it added not a little both to her wealth and power but as we have no such dispensations in the church of england the protestant husbands in this kingdom are in a worse situation than the husbands of other christian countries while our spiritual courts remain so inexorably attached in this particular to the popish canons  the whole body of the legislature alone can relieve english husbands but the mode of relief by act of parliament is much more difficult and expensive than that of the papal dispensations add to this that the legislature seldom interferes in these cases till after the parties have obtained a divorce or passed at least under the costly ceremonies of attempting it in the ecclesiastical courts  there are indeed some instances on record in which the parliament has taken up such cases originally as in that of the duke of norfolk before mentioned in this case a divorce a vinculo was granted by parliament without any previous proceedings in the spiritual courts it is true the counsel in behalf of the duchess consisting of two able barristers sir thomas powys and mr dodd assisted by that celebrated civilian dr pinfold labored extremely hard to convince the lower house of the propriety of referring the cause to the ecclesiastical courts but their pleas were only those of precedent tending only to prove that those courts had on all occasions delayed protracted and as much as in them lay prevented the obtaining of divorces both in and out of parliament  the arguments of sir thomas powys and dr pinfold in particular evidently betrayed that the craft was thought to be in danger they had nothing material to urge against the divorce but much against its passing in parliament without the previous sanction of the spiritual court what is it said sir thomas that guards you from an infinite application of this nature but requiring persons to take the ordinary course first and to come round about to the parliament as the last remedy to carry the sentence perhaps farther than the ecclesiastical court can do but if persons can come up directly hither i am apt to think your lobby will be crowded with petitioners of this nature the next sessions though the sessions now are long and frequent this single business may be so great as to obstruct all other business i am sure a committee for adultery would have full employment  i know nothing can be said on the other side with good reason unless that which i heard in another place why they should not go to the ecclesiastical court which is that those courts cannot divorce a vinculo matrimonii therefore it would have been a vain thing this may be a good reason for them to come to you afterward but it is no reason for them to come here at first  in confirmation of this argument dr pinfold confirmed the assertion as to the practice and endeavored to justify it as being agreeable to our ecclesiastical constitution grounded on the sense of the ancient canons with all his abilities however he did it very lamely indeed there was no ground for his doing it better as will be seen by comparing the several authorities quoted in this tract in which i have been the more particular because i would not have the reader misled by great names   to this plea sergeant wright very pertinently replied mr speaker i am of counsel for the duke of norfolk who is your suppliant for this bill for redress against the highest injury that can be offered the rights of his marriage bed have been invaded and he comes for that relief here which no other court can afford him for the learned doctor on the other side tells you plainly from the canon law that there can be no divorce a vinculo matrimonii in their courts now to send us to a court for relief that they tell us before hand can give us none is in effect to tell us we shall have none at all  the parliament seemed sensible of the propriety of this reflection and gave the duke relief without sending him to the spiritual court they acted in the same manner in the case of the earl of macclesfield in whose favor an act was passed before sentence of divorce obtained in the ecclesiastical court  these with several other cases of a similar nature sufficiently show that the practice of the courtschristian in respect to divorce has long been repugnant to the wisdom and justice of the legislature  this will appear still farther on a retrospect to the case of the marquis of northampton in the reign of edward the sixth the marquis was married to a daughter of the earl of essex and she eloped from him and was prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts and there was sentence against her of divorce the marquis from thence took upon him to marry a daughter of the lord cobham and after four years marriage of her he obtained an act of parliament to ratisy the second marriage which act recites a settlement of divorce in the ecclesiastical court but though the act does recite the proceedings in the spiritual court it is plain the marquis married again in open defiance of their canons it is plain also that the legislature approved of such marriage as being conformable to the laws of god however incompatible with those of the church it is farther remarkable that on this occasion the house of peers was so unanimous that there were but two temporal and two spiritual lords dissentient on passing the bill the divorce also was not made any plea for passing the bill so that the act was expressly granted to deliver the marquis from the inquisitorial tyranny of the spiritual court  in the before mentioned case also of lord ross afterward earl of rutland we are told that notwithstanding he had obtained a divorce in the spiritual court no mention is made of it in the act  it is hence evident the legislature very justly conceives that adultery does really dissolve the marriage and therefore it permits the parties divorced to marry again though it leaves them absurdly open to the misconstructions of the canons and the merciless fangs of an ecclesiastical censor  is it not strange therefore that it should still continue to countenance such practice especially as it is evidently inconsistent with the sense and spirit of the common and statute law of the realm  i have already hinted that the statute against polygamy excepts the party who is divorced though but from bed and board by the spiritual court by which it is evident the legislature considered the second marriage of such party not only conformable to the law of god but also conformable to the common law of england quod non prohibetur permittitur  the suggestion therefore is not true which is laid down by modern practitioners viz that by the canon law which is approved and confirmed by the laws of this realm in this behalf it is not lawful for persons who are divorced in these cases to betake themselves to a second marriage whilst their former husband or wife is alive because the matrimonial bond once perfected cannot be dissolved by man but only by death see consetts translation of clarke part vi sect     now i again affirm and that on the best authorities see burns ecclesiastical law art polygamy also the authorities there quoted that the exceptive clause abovementioned in the statute of   j c    does in fact permit persons under the predicament here stated to marry again so that this practice of the canon law is not as it ought to be and is pretended approved and confirmed by the laws of this realm  it is true that the spiritual court may take notice of such marriages and annul them but nothing is more clear than that the exceptive clause in the statute proves such practice to be inconsistent with the common and statute law of the realm by which the decisions of the canon law ought confessedly in england to be controuled nay are expressly though not practically controuled for by two acts of parliament made in the   th of henry the viii and the  d and  th of edward the vi it is declared that no canons shall be allowed that be any way repugnant to the laws of god or the scripture the kings prerogative royal and the statutes of the land  as a farther confirmation of the sense of the laws in this particular the statue law imposes a most heavy fine on husbands who shall be reconciled to their wives and consent to receive them again after elopement or cohabitation with an adulterer by restoring such wives to their right of dower which they had forfeited by their adultery and yet not withstanding this an injured english husband is under the necessity from the modern practice of the spiritual courts either to live a life of celibacy deprived of the sweets of matrimonial society and a help meet for him according to gods holy ordinance or he must take back and continue to cherish an adulteress in his bosom at the peril of restoring her forfeited rights of alimony and dower and of bearing himself the severe reproaches of an enlightened conscience and the just contempt of the world do the popish inquisitions of spain italy or portugal impose a heavier yoke on the minds and bodies of men than this which is laid on them by the protestant spiritual courts in england assuredly not  but granting it expedient that the divorce a vinculo unless for causes existing before marriage should be subjected to the wisdom of parliament the practice of refusing the divorce a mensa et thoro to a husband in case of his wifes adultery on her plea of recrimination is in the highest degree injurious illegal and inquisitorial it is contrary not only to the apostolic and other canons of the christian church but also to the common and statute laws of this kingdom  it is laid down in the practice of the ecclesiastical courts as before mentioned that a compensation of the crime does hinder a divorce that is if the defendant does prove that the plaintiff has also committed adultery the defendant is to be absolved as to the matters requested in the libel of the plaintiff consett pract of eccl courts part vi s   p v   agreeable to this maxim dr pinfold in behalf of the duchess of norfolk pleaded that according to the text law de divortiis if the adultress can prove the same thing against her husband the fault of the one must be set against the fault of the other and he cannot have the advantage of his prayer but what is the precise meaning of all this prove the same thing what thing adultery or merely carnal copulation here is a strange want of discrimination if one fault be to be set against or make compensation for another they should both be proved exactly similar or acts of equal criminality the mere act of copulation supposing it criminal is no more adultery than the accidentallykilling a man would be murder it is the circumstances of the parties and intention of the person committing the act that constitute and distinguish the crime hence sergeant wright very properly replied the doctor has insisted on one thing which i think is very extraordinary he tells you by the rules of their law if the woman can recriminate and prove her husband guilty in such a case they must set the fault of one against the fault of the other  i wish the doctor could have told you the offense had been equal that the injury to families had been equal a man by his folly of this kind brings no spurious issue to inherit the lands of his wife but a woman deprives her husband of any legitimate issue for when she converses in this manner with another man the issue may be equally looked upon to be that mans if not more  to this pertinent plea no sufficient answer could be given sir thomas powys indeed endeavored to divert the force of it by aggravating the state of the case and making the idle supposition that the debauching a mans wife with the getting a bastard to inherit his estate is a less evil than the casual contagion of the venereal disease they ridicule says he the doctors notion of recrimination but i apprehend the doctor is right in it for it would be hard if a man should marry a young woman and give her an ill example in his own family i do not say it is so in this case no nor will the circumstance hardly ever be found in any other  and bring her acquainted with loose and ill company and by his example or provocation lead her into the same offense would that man deserve to be rewarded with a new wife and another portion because his first wife had only followed his example they say the offense is not equal because the man brings no children into the family i doubt it happens oftentimes to them that go abroad that they bring home that to their wives which sticks longer by them than their children  who does not see through the fallacy or rather inanity of this reply should a foolish husband indeed set his wife an ill example in his own family and bring her acquainted with his mistresses as here supposed he certainly would deserve his fate and the husbands crime might well be adjudged a compensation for that of the wife but when is this the case hardly ever not but that in such a case i could wish that by the laws of england justice might be done to all parties which perhaps can never be better done than by adopting some or other of the jurisprudential maxims or customs of the ancients by a law of ethelbert the seducer of a married woman was condemned to purchase for the injured husband another wife in the stead of her he had seduced perhaps in this case such a compensation might be just if the seducer did not buy a better or worse wife than he seduced otherwise indeed the maxims of the ecclesiastical courts may be right and it would be more just that the man should have his jade again admitting nevertheless that in all such cases the plea of female recrimination were justifiable i have already made it sufficiently clear that the mere carnal knowledge of a woman by a married man if such woman be not or be not by him known or believed to be married is not according to the canons of the christian church i say the christian church in contradiction to the romish church that mother of abominations and spouse of antichrist to be denominated or adjudged adultery so that a married woman accused of adultery by her husband must allege farther than that such husband has had carnal knowledge of loose women otherwise she offers not the adequate compensation required even by the professed rules of the court  i have indeed gone farther and shown that if she could even prove adultery in him that is his wilfully and knowingly lying with another mans wife that alone would not according to the apostolic and primitive canons be a sufficient ground for her leaving him not but that the primitive church did in some cases admit of a womans leaving or putting away her husband on good grounds of divorce  of these the most applicable to modern manners and pertinent to the present purpose are the three following  st when the husband by laying a trap for her assists or connives at her seduction and countenances her prostitution to another man  d when having accused her of adultery he cannot make good his accusation by sufficent proof it is to be here observed that in favor of the ladies of antiquity though not much to the credit of their modesty this sufficiency of proof was no very easy matter balsamon in his scholium on the eight canon of the council of neocaesarea tell us that by several laws a woman could not be convicted of adultery unless five witnesses would depose on oath they saw her in the precise act diversae leges jubent mulierem non aliter condemnari ut adulteram quam per apertas probationes id est per quinque testes jurantes se vidisse in ipso actu fieri adulterium vid beveregii pandecta canonum etc tom i page  0   d when he holds carnal commerce with another woman in his own house or neighborhood and being admonished by the wife or her relations still persists in such practice   si pudicitiae conjugis insidias struens aliis eam stuprandum tradere conatus fuerit    si maritus uxore adulterii accusata rem non probaverit    si alia cum muliere coeat eadem domo vel eadem civitate ac monitus ab uxore vel parentibus ejus non velit abstinere matt mon syn alp lit g chap     this latter case comes to the argument of sir thomas powys before quoted viz the setting a bad example to the wife the only circumstance in which the incontinence of the husband can make any compensation for that of the wife     we see here that the ancient canons very justly distinguished between the simple act of secret fornication which was regarded in a venial light and the open commission of such act in the presence or with the knowledge of the wife and for a very good reason because though such act in the husband abstractedly considered and unknown to the wife was judged a matter of indifference the keeping a strumpet in his own house or under her nose as the vulgar emphatically express it was justly held to be an insufferable insult which might possibly provoke her to revenge it by being on her part guilty of adultery which is a most heinous and abominable crime hence mere fornication in the husband so circumstanced became a reasonable cause of divorce to be pleaded by the wife  but to return to later principles and practice  it is certain that the modern and desultory use of the word adultery gives a kind of sanction to the practice of the spiritual court in mistaking for it mere fornication but courts of justice should abide by the precise and technical not the loose and popular meaning of words if their sentence be directed by the canons their proceedings in hearing the cause should be directed by the canons too i say therefore that if a wife against whom a suit is instituted for a divorce should recriminate the fullest proof she can bring against her husband of stuprum or fornication will not be such a compensation of her crime as should prevent his obtaining his suit  with regard to recrimination in general it may not also be improper to observe that being usually the effect of revenge it has for that reason been regularly prohibited in ancient practice  antecatagoria says wood a cross accusation is either by way of exception when one that is accused retorts the same crime upon the accuser or a different crime rather for his own defense than for a public punishment for the principal design is that the accuser should be silenced as an infamous person now if the accused person charges a lesser crime upon the accuser he must be stopped till he was cleared himself but if it is a crime of a higher nature that shall be heard first see wood inst book iv chap iv also the code in locis to which he has referred now taking simple fornication for adultery or even admitting real adultery proved against the husband it will hardly be pretended that adultery is a greater crime in the husband than the wife nay it will hardly be pretended that it is not a less with what kind of propriety then can a spiritual court admit the female plea of recrimination according to the modern practice  but farther to deprive the advocates for this practice even of a shadow of argument in its favor i shall proceed to consider the matrimonial vow or contract entered into by persons married according to the rites and ceremonies of the church of england not merely as a civil but also as a moral covenant and even in the latter light it will appear that the husband in being guilty of concubinage or mere fornication is not guilty of any breach of such matrimonial covenant for which he is justly liable to censure either in foro conscientiae or courtchristian although the wife in being guilty of adultery is liable to the censure of both  to determine whether a covenant or contract is broken it is first necessary to enquire fully into the sense and meaning of the terms of it for as cicero observes quae a ratione suscipitur de aliqua re institutio debet a definitione proficisci ut intelligatur quid sit id de quo disputetur de officiis   the troth plighted in marriage is expressed on the part of the man in the following words i n take thee n to my wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part according to gods holy ordinance and thereto i plight thee my troth  on the part of the woman the engagement is mutatis mutandis expressed in the same words except that the words and to obey are added after the word cherish in these few words of the most important concern however lies the difference between the matrimonial contract on the one part and the other on the side of the man and that of the woman  for by obedience is universally known and understood the acting in conformity to the known will of the person to whom such obedience is due so that if a husband does not by some open concession or palpable connivance permit the adultery of his wife she must necessarily be supposed to act in disobedience to her husband when she is guilty of violating the marriage bed for otherwise she can never conceive it to be consistent with her husbands will that she should prostitute herself to other men to get children for him to maintain or to inherit his substance  here then is a very essential difference between the terms of the vow or matrimonial contract on the side of the man and that of the woman the man promises the woman no such obedience he is not guilty therefore of conjugal infidelity by disobeying her or acting against her known will either by conversing with other women or any other act he may be cruel wicked and unjust but while he continues publicly to hold for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish his wife he may privately love and cherish as many other women as he pleases without being guilty of conjugal infidelity or breach of his matrimonial vow  it is supposed by some that the terms of the question put by the minister previous to plighting the troth and to which the husband assents are understood in the troth itself i mean and forsaking all other keep thee only unto her from which it is mistakenly conceived that the parties promise to have no carnal commerce with any other person  but that this promise of keeping only to each other can have no relation whatever to such commerce is evident because it is expressly founded on their forsaking all other for that purpose so that if we are to take the latter part of the sentence in the sense supposed we must take the former part so too and the consequence is a direct insinuation that both parties lived before in a state of concubinage or fornication which supposition would be absurd  it is evident that this passage means no more than what is expressed by the divine command at the first institution of marriage when it was said therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife genesis chap ii v    also matt chap xix v   from which all idea of carnal copulation is necessarily foreign the husband therefore does not bind himself either directly or indirectly by his marriagevow never to be guilty of an act of incontinence as the wife does by evident implication in swearing fealty and obedience  and here it is to be observed that in the question put by the minister to the woman the words serve him are added to those to obey him though omitted in the form of the troth thus the duty of a married woman is sworn service to a lord and master who binds himself only to provide for love and cherish his vassal or servant now it is in the very nature of all contracts between lord and vassal master and servant that the due discharge of the service of the vassal or servant is the condition of the obligation on the part of the lord and master  that this consideration should be more particularly attended to in the matrimonial suit and service than in any other feudal tenure will appear from hence that the lord has it not in his power to ensure the fidelity of his vassal as in other fiefs for though the divine lawgiver in his institution of marriage expressly says to the woman thou shall be under the power of thy husband we all know that the husband is with regard to the fealty of his wife and the honor of the marriage bed in the power of his wife the husband would be in a critical predicament indeed therefore if possessed of the right without the power he is to contend for the right of punishing wrong in her who without the right has the power to do as she pleases  we have indeed had lawyers absurd enough to pretend in justification of the practice of refusing divorces that the comparative words for better for worse are synonimous to the positive words good or bad virtuous or vicious and that the incontinence of the wife is therefore an adventitious circumstance like sickness or health to which the husband binds himself to submit by the terms of the contract but the fallacy of this is evident both man and woman bind themselves to live together according to gods holy ordinance which prohibits female incontinence  were it otherwise a woman might prostitute herself with the consent of her husband without breach of her matrimonial vow pleading the moral necessity of conforming to the will of her husband according to her sworn promise of obedience  i am well aware that the ministerial divine who repeats the form of solemnization of matrimony does in the preceding part of the service give a formal exposition of the causes for which matrimony was ordained which causes as there laid down may be supposed to constitute gods holy ordinance according to which married persons bind themselves by the oath and mutual troth plighted to each other to live  these causes are as follows  first it was ordained for the procreation of children to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the lord and to the praise of his holy name  secondly it was ordained for a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication that such persons as have not the gift of continency might marry and keep themselves undefiled members of christs body  thirdly it was ordained for the mutual society help and comfort that the one ought to have of the other both in prosperity and adversity see the matrimonial service   it is very justly observed by milton that the order of these causes is reversed by the divine institution the last was first and the first last and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him it was after this that god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply  as to the second of the above assigned causes i do not see that it entered at that time into gods holy ordinance at all and yet the minister expressly says in the service that the holy state of matrimony as he is going to celebrate it is an honorable estate instituted of god in the time of mans innocence though not a syllable is said in the scripture about the second cause  there can be no doubt that chastity is a most amiable virtue as well in man as woman and that the cause in question is a laudable incitement to marriage it is a prudential and virtuous ordinance of man but still it does not appear to be the ordinance of god at the institution of marriage if that institution took place as the ritual says in the time of mans innocence  on the contrary if we judge by the consequences it was quite otherwise so far was the practice of the patriarchs and their successors living under the mosaical dispensation from giving countenance to any such cause of ordination that they indulged themselves freely in concubinage and fornication abraham isaac and jacob had their wives and concubines david the man after gods own heart rioted in concubinage nay his adulteries were not even checked till he aggravated their guilt by accompanying them with murder it was not till uriah the husband of the fair adultress bathsheba was slain till by the most infamous contrivance of the royal adulterer that brave and loyal officer had fallen in the forefront of the hottest battle that nathan was sent by the lord to reprehend him with thou art the man  the number of wives and concubines of king solomon the wisest of men is proverbial and yet if marriage was originally instituted in the days of mans innocence as a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication the wisest man in the world must have been the wickedest man in it  but to give the fairest play to the argument i will just for the sake of it admit that gods holy ordinance confessedly instituted in the days of mans innocence might receive some additional confirmation under the christian dispensation i say might not that it did our savior himself came to fulfill the law but we do not find that he varied or changed it he did not even condemn the woman taken in adultery has no man condemned thee neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more  occasion indeed seems to have been taken from a very equivocal passage in st pauls first epistle to the corinthians to add this merelymoral motive to the religious causes of gods holy ordinance  the passage is this  nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband  let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband  i cor chap vii ver    the apostle however expressly says i speak this of permission not of commandment by which he plainly intimates that he speaks from doubtful and not divine authority as he does in like manmer in more places than one in the same chapter thus in verse xi but to the rest speak i not the lord and again verse xxv now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment etc   and indeed who that has any respect for the fair sex or the original institutions of god and nature can conceive the apostle to have been here divinely inspired when in the very introduction to these his remarks on the discipline of the marriage state he declares totally against it by saying it is good for a man not to touch a woman i might safely appeal against him to the gravest and chastest of our divines to the whole male and female world but i will examine first into the pretended authority  in the beginning of the creation says the evangelist mark god made male and female  for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife agglutinabitur uxori suae says theodore beza  on the contrary st paul in a confessed reverie says it is good for a man not to touch a woman is not this diametrically opposite to the first institution of the ordinance of matrimony is it not directly contrary to the express command of god given to the sexes at their creation is it not absolutely defeating the very end for which they were created male and female  shall we then set aside such positive and express commands of god for the mere suggestion of an apostle professedly uninspired at the time of his suggesting it  but even granting that st paul was inspired at the time of promulgating these injunctions it will not appear on a fair examination of the text that they militate against polygamy and concubinage much less enjoin monogamy  it is true that in our english translation the words  and  are rendered by the word wife but the original greek has by no means that precise and confined signification it means a female or woman in general those words being indiscriminately made use of to signify faemina mulier uxor and even virgo viz a female a woman a wife or concubine for so horace uses uxor uxor invicti jovis esse nescis ode l iii       nay uxor was sometimes used as the female of brute animals  olentis uxores mariti ode l i      and even a virgin indeed the very etymology of the word which is formed from  natus sum because we are born of a woman shows it had originally no reference to the conjugal but rather to the maternal relation it is thus used for matter in the greek translation of the old testament as  isaiah xlix    again it is used by the evangelist mark chap vii ver    for a woman in general without any relation to husband or wife  erat autem mulier graeca the woman was a greek it is used indeed as uxor quasi unica soror a sister or companion not sponsa a spouse or wife as cicero has it to atticus sua cuique sponsa mihi mea by st paul in his epistle to titus chap     this passage may be supposed to make against my argument because st paul recommends the husband of one wife or more properly of one woman but for what does he recommend him why to be a bishop it is very natural for a saint who thought it good not to touch a woman to prefer a monogamist to a polygamist in the affair of episcopacy but at the same time this recommendation tacitly permits that practice in the laiety he may indeed be supposed to censure the practice by saying a bishop should be blameless but should not every man be blameless if polygamy or concubinage therefore were in itself sinful it ought to have been as well prohibited in the laity as clergy but in his epistle to the galatians chap iv   it is made use of to signify the mother of our savior confessedly a virgin nay in the   th verse of the very chapter before us he uses  for every single or unmarried woman this cannot be imputed to the sterility of the greek tongue than which perhaps none is more copious as it affords not only  sponsa a bride or spouse but also  sponsa a spouse or kinswoman the ancient greeks however are not the only people who had no word in common use for the one wife of one husband it is remarkable that the modern french as if they held their wives in common use the word femme indiscriminately for wife or woman but how would it sound in english to say instead of my wife my woman our translators therefore have made use of the word wife agreeably to our manners instead of the word woman conformably to the original greek   it is also used in the same sense by homer who in the first book of his iliad calls briseis  who was then a virgin and is is called by him in another place  adolescentula  hom il i       ibid ver       again our english version does not observe the distinction between the pronoun possessive joined to the woman and the epithet or adjective annexed to the man which is made both in the original greek and in bezas translations it is in english in both cases the same his own wife and her own husband but in the original the terms are different beza also has it suam uxorem but proprium virum by suam denoting the mere possession of a thing to which the possessor is not singly and wholly attached but may have others of the same kind whereas by proprium is meant something singular and peculiar to which the possessor is particularly and wholly devoted thus in the greek it is  but it is  on the difference of which terms the learned pasor has the following remark  poni solet pro  vel  suus inter quae haec est differentia quod  dicatur de multis non enim quaecunque nostra sunt propria dici queunt when the duty of husbands and wives is again taken up by this apostle in the  th chap of his epistle to the ephesians the same distinction is preserved it is repeatedly  but it is  and  verse             beza indeed in one translation takes the liberty mentioned by pasor of substituting suis for propriis in the   th verse as he does also in the first epistle of peter chap ii v   where this subject is again treated of but the distinction is constantly preserved in the original greek it is both with peter and paul always    on the whole it appears that st paul is here advising the corinthians in a matter of moral discipline and not laying down religious precepts in the preceding chapter he gives his reasons for having nothing to do with common harlots on which subject he enters by previously saying it was rather inconvenient than unlawful omnia mihi licent at non omnia conducunt indeed there were both physical and religious reasons then as well as now against promiscuous copulation on this account says st paul in the passage before us let every man have a woman of his own and let every woman have her own proper or peculiar man  but though to enjoin a man not to go to common harlots but to have a woman of his own be enjoining him not to be without a wife or concubine it is not saying he shall have no more than one he might have two three or more every one of them would be still a woman of his own or which is the same thing one of his own women he would obey the apostles injunction in having  uxoram suam  on the other hand the woman cannot have more than one  maritum or virum proprium who might nevertheless be the maritus or vir proprius viz the particular man or husband to some other woman  thus jacob was the only husband of rachel as well as of leah both of whom being jacobs wives each of them might certainly be called jacobs wife as either might with equal propriety call jacob her husband indeed the altercation which passed between them on account of rubens mandrakes will show that they both thought themselves equally entitled to his benevolence as the apostle terms it and reuben went in the days of wheatharvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou have taken my husband and would thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy sons mandrakes and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night genesis chap xxx ver           milton like a shrewd casuist takes a very unfair advantage of st pauls particular notions of chastity but with all his casuistry he labors in vain to reconcile them either to divine inspiration or the general feelings of human nature see miltons tracts on the doctrine and discipline of divorce   how different the polemic and the poet  whatever hypocrites austerely talk of purity and place and innocence defaming as impure what god declares pure    our maker bids increase who bids abstain but our destroyer foe to god and man paradise lost book iv it is indeed pretended that the strictness of conjugal discipline supposed to be recommended by the apostle is confirmed by our savior himself who is conceived also to have prohibited a mans having more than one wife as well as a wifes having more than one husband  but this supposition is groundless for as i before observed from our saviors own words he came not to destroy the law or the prophets but to fulfill them now under the law polygamy was allowed as plainly appears not only from practice but precept it were taking up the readers time to little purpose to prove what is so generally known the learned seldom in his uxor ebraica shows fully that a plurality of wives was not only allowed of among the hebrews but amongst almost all other nations and in all ages in the east it was almost universal as it remains at this day the ancient romans indeed did not practice it though it was not prohibited mark antony i think was the first who led the fashion of having two wives this fashion lasted between three and four hundred years when it was prohibited by an express law under the reign of theodosius the emperor valentinian however permitted it in a fuller extent nor did the christian bishops of those times make any opposition to this reintroduction of polygamy justinian and the latter councils put a stop to it   in saying thou shall not commit adultery the law did not say thou shall not have more than one wife as it does when respecting idolatry it says thou shall have no other god but me it said thou shall not lie with another mans wife it did not say thou shall not lie with as many wives as thou will of thy own on the contrary it appears to have been commonly permitted to have two or more if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated etc deuteronomy xxi    and again ii sam xii   the prophet nathan reproaching david says thus says the lord god i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom  it is true that after the world became to be somewhat populous and perhaps some communities apparently too numerous for the land they possessed there are writers indeed who have labored to prove that polygamy does not tend to population but however ingeniously they have argued they have contradicted all the experience both of ancient and modern times if there are some countries in which at this day polygamy is allowed and yet they are not more populous than others where it is prohibited the fact may be accounted for by various other reasons the desolation occasioned by the plagues wars famine and licentiousness of those countries would probably have long since depopulated them entirely had not polygamy been allowed the practice of polygamy was prohibited by the civil magistrate for the political ends of society  according to the laws of justinian it was not lawful to have two wives at a time nor even a concubine with a wife the canons of the church also confirm this prohibition under the pretense of its being founded on the words of our savior in his reply to the pharisees but if we turn to the text we shall see that no such prohibition is there either expressed or implied  i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery matt xix    very true but if without putting away his wife he marry another as was the case with jacob when after marrying leah he married also her sister rachel it does not appear that he would commit adultery  it is the putting away the first wife that made the marrying a second adulterous nor was this a direct commission of that sin but an indirect and eventual one as such dismission of the first would naturally tend to make her form a connection with some other man which would be direct adultery this is plain from the words in which the same prohibition is expressed in another place by the same evangelist  i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery matt v    it is true that some of our most learned divines have been of opinion that the adultery ay in marrying the second wife and did not depend on the putting away of the first but in this they have shown themselves to be better canonists than casuists even bishop cosens says it is not the dismission of the first wife that is adulterous but the marriage of the second but this is clearly a mistake not only because polygamy was allowed at the time when our saviors injunction respecting a mans putting away his wife was promulgated but because the contrary appears on the very face of the text  the pharisees did not ask jesus about the lawfulness of a purality of wives but merely about putting away their wives and though he answered them in a fuller manner than they seemed to require he cannot be supposed to mistake the full drift and sense of their query  the question was is it lawful for a a man to put away his wife for every cause the reply is whosoever shall put away his wife except for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery that is indirectly by depriving her of the protection of a husband and reducing her to the necessity of accepting that of some other man agreeably to the words of the text before quoted causes her to commit adultery  our savior indeed goes farther and explains his meaning distinctly in adding and whosoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery but how so unless the criminality depended on the legal incapacity of the first husband to put her away this indeed made it adultery in the man marrying a woman thus unjustly divorced because she was still the first mans wife and not lawfully separated the legality of the divorce appears evidently to depend on the criminality on the part of the woman which ipso facto dissolved the marriage or what amounted to the same thing gave the husband a right to do it at pleasure by giving his bill of divorce and this seems to be particularly expressed in reply to the question whether a man might put away his wife for every cause and also to the additional question why then did moses command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away i e for every or any cause  it is this circumstance viz the facility of mens divorcing their wives at pleasure that accounts for the disuse of polygamy in countries where it was allowed by law it has been already observed that the ancient romans did not indulge themselves in polygamy though permitted but this was for a good reason they wisely chose not to have two wives in the house at the same time and therefore repudiated one before they took another and this they did as often as they pleased with no other formality than that of sending a message to the wife by a slave giving notice of their intentions after the manner of the hebrews    that this was certainly the meaning of our savior cannot be doubted moses says he because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives or rather as the translators have more properly expressed it in mark chap x ver v for the hardness of your heart  a mere english reader might from the former expression of matthew take occasion to say that the term wives in the plural is no more applicable to the individual than that of hearts and that the former word as well as the latter must be meant of their wives collectively and not of the wives of each severally but the original is in both places the same  beza has it pro duritia cordis vestri  for your hardness of heart in the singular number but he has it dimittere uxores vestras put away your wives in the plural conformably to the original   that this is the true sense of the text is farther confirmed by the remark which the disciples of jesus made on it in the succeding verse  it runs in the vulgar translation thus if the case of the man be so with his wife it is good not to marry  but the version is here also palpably defective by the man may be mistakenly understood a particular husband and by his wife may in like manner be understood his sole and only wife but the word his is foisted into the text it is indeed usually printed in italics to denote the interpolation this prohibition is expressed on the contrary in the most general terms si tale est negotium hominis cum uxore says beza conformably to the original  not the particular case between any one husband and his sole wife but the matrimonial commerce negotium between the sexes in general or as pasor explains it the condition or relative situation of a husband respecting his wives si ea est conditio viri etc pasori lexicon in loco   if any other argument were necessary to establish the sense of this reply which our savior gave to the designing pharisees perhaps some confirmation of it may be drawn from the question put to him by the saduces with a design equally sinister  a woman said they successively married seven husbands at the resurrection whose wife shall she be  had a plurality of wives not been permitted by the divine law it would have better answered their end if they had proposed the same question with a change of terms asking him if a man had successively seven wives to which of them at the resurrection would the husband belong  but i am not pleading either for the piety or morality of polygamy under the christian dispensation and in times like these i conceive one wife to be enough for any one man add to this that whether it be contrary to the law of god or not it is expressly contrary to that of man being forbidden in england by the written laws of the land it may not be amiss however to observe here that we are full as incorrect in the modern use of the word polygamy as i have before observed we are in that of the word adultery polygamy says burn is where a man has several wives at the same time he then proceeds to state the act of parliament in which the word person is used and a husband or wife is made equally culpable as if he had defined polygamy agreeably to its etymology and ancient signification  in like manner mr lock defines polygamy to be the having more wives than one at once but this definition respects the modern vulgar use of the word and is defective if we regard either the greek etymology  q d marriage with many as to the acceptance of the term in the greek it is affirmed by j pol onom l iii to have been a word applicable to either sex see harry stephenss appendix ad thesaur constantin or the statute which subjects the woman to the same penalty as the man absurdly indeed enough because it is a felony within the benefit of clergy so that by the letter of the law the woman must suffer death for what the man suffers only a burning in the hand unless the woman also be ludicrously allowed the benefit of clergy too     from the foregoing arguments however i take upon me to infer that matrimony as a divine ordinance instituted in the days of mans innocence was originally ordained as is expressly said for the sake of society and the procreation and education of children to hinder man from being alone for the peopling of the earth and for no other direct causes civil moral or religious  it will also hence follow that such married persons as so live together to answer these great ends of the divine institution may be said to fulfill their matrimonial contract according to gods holy ordinance  now not to dwell on the many physical and moral reasons which might be brought to prove that adultery in the female operates directly against the chief ends of this divine institution the universal principles and practice of the patriarchs and sages both under the law and the gospel sufficiently confirm it by their prohibitions and injunctions against this crime while mere concubinage or fornication in the man has been constantly connived at or expressly permitted  indeed the great and principal end of marriage procreation which may be justly styled the first commandment given by god to man in the words increase and multiply was so religiously observed by the ancient patriarchs that the raising up seed unto abraham was so strictly and solemnly enjoined to his posterity that it was not to be neglected by the man because his wife might happen to be indisposed or unmeet to cooperate with him for that great purpose  the conduct of abraham and sarah respecting her egyptian handmaid hagar proves the due sense they had of the nature of gods holy ordinance of marriage instituted as our matrimonial service says in the days of mans innocence  the behavior of jacob also and his two wives rachel and leah is a farther more forcible confirmation of the sense in which the duties of marriage were held under the patriarchal dispensation during their temporary barrenness both rachel and leah gave to their husband their respective handmaids bilhah and zilpah nay leah expressly imputes the cure of her sterility to this act of duty and complacence and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son  and leah said god has blessed and given me mine hire because i have given my maiden to my husband genesis chap xx ver      but though concubinage now called fornication was then deemed not only lawful in the husband but the contributing to it in case of barrenness meritorious in the wife we find the act of adultery or lying with another mans wife universally regarded with horror even among the egyptians and philistines thus when abraham denied sarah to be his wife and said she was his sister in consequence of which she was taken from him by abimelech the prevention of adultery was deemed so important and momentous a concern that god himself is said to have appeared in a dream by night to abimelech saying behold thou art a dead man for the woman thou have taken for she is a mans wife genesis chap xx ver   abimelechs reproaches verse  th of the same chapter are also very forcible and striking in the xiith chap of genesis we have also another instance of the like kind where god is said to have plagued king pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarah abrams wife verse    et seq   again when isaac went up on account of a famine in his own country to dwell in gerar and denied in the same manner his wife rebeka saying also that she was his sister he received a severe rebuke from abimelech for thus laying his people under the temptation of inadvertently committing even unintentional adultery and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how said thou she is my sister what is this thou have done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou should have brought guiltiness upon us genesis chap xxvi ver   et seq   now it will hardly be pretended by either our canonists or divines that abraham isaac and jacob though polygamists and fornicators to speak our modern language did not live in the state of matrimony according to gods holy ordinance if that ordinance was as is expressly said in the matrimonial service of the church of england instituted in the days of mans innocence  the prohibition of poligamy and concubinage is a mere civil prohibition of much later date than the days of mans innocence or those of the patriarchs  the pretense that marriage was instituted for the second cause assigned in the matrimonial service is therefore evidently false  not but that the liberty taken by a husband in concubinage may degenerate into licentiousness and be carried so far as to make him neglect the duties of the marriage bed the society of his wife and the education of his children if it should prevent his loving and cherishing her so far as is requisite to answer the real ends of the matrimonial institution such husband is guilty of a breach of his matrimonial vow and is in foro conscientiae highly reprehensible nay if his neglect of the nuptial duty be open gross and wilful the courtchristian may take cognizance of it and at the wifes requisition decree a restitution of conjugal rights see blackstone on private wrongs comment book iii chap   with which the husband cannot in law or in conscience refuse to comply  at the same time it must be admitted that with regard to men entering into the matrimonial state without discriminating the terms of the contract thinking they are equally bound with their wives to live a life of perfect chastity they are certainly reprehensible in foro conscientiae if they are guilty of incontinence although not so criminal according to the canons as incontinent wives who cannot mistake the meaning of the contract and are bound by all laws human and divine to observe the strictest fidelity to their husbands  finis
