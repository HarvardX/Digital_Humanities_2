liberal opinions in which is continued the history of benignus  his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from the heart his

to you to excel in them yourself and to cultivate them in others as it is the characteristic so should it be the motto of your family i cannot therefore resist the ambition i have of taking this method to acquaint the world that its reception of the former volumes of the liberal opinions has been justified by the imprimatur of my lord lyttelton  of a nobleman who promises to the nation on which the father so long reflected honor a person of equal ability equal eloquence and equal generosity in his immediate successor  i am your lordships most obliged and most obedient servant courtney melmoth  preface it was the opinion of horace rabelais and le sage of cervantes swift and fielding and many other names familiar to every man of reading that laughing satire was the likeliest to succeed as it always strikes the honied sting more deep into the heart benignus seemed to have entertained the same idea now and then yielding to the pathetic but never indulging the passionate yet juvenal himself had not more cause to be out of temper it is indeed most likely the author of this history apprehended with young that the world is too proud to be fond of a serious tutor and that if his narrative should ever get into print it would stand little chance to be well read that is to be read agreeably and advantageously had he gratified the mere dictates of despair had he left nothing behind him but a dull detail of his injuries with the complaints of a gloomy recluse and the despondencies of a dying hermit in one of his chapters he mentions this and accordingly he set down every scene without the formality and punctilio of authorship exactly as he felt it upon recalling it to mind and i make no doubt but that while he was thus faithfully engaged in describing his adventures it hushed for a while the sense of his misfortunes and he probably forgot such is the consequence and such the importance of exercising the mind that he was in fact a solitary selfbanished man in the recesses of a forest  for my own part i have nothing to tell the reader but that i wish with all my heart he may find as much entertainment in perusing these adventures as i have found in transcribing them from the manuscript the spirit of which is not even yet i trust exhausted  i cannot however take my leave of the reader as the editor of benignus without briefly obviating certain objections which were made by some to the moral tendency of the former part of the history let me declare therefore that the adventures of benignus are not so much recommended as objects of regular imitation as of general escape the goodness of that persons heart and the integrity of his intentions may safely be proposed as the purest standards but his passion for travel and the excess of his undistinguishing bounty with the various inconveniences and awkward perplexities arising from thence are examples rather to terrify than to follow his unlimited benevolence so far from promoting defeats the felicity which would arise from a better directed and a judicious generosity and nothing more was intended by the expression that nine times out of ten to be extremely good is not in this world the way to be happy than this that when liberality loses its name by rambling into profusion when the hand indiscreetly gives without the suffrage of the understanding though the designs of the heart may be ever so amiable it ceases to be in fact goodness and is therefore nine times out of ten rewarded by the contempt of economy the ridicule of imposture and the trick of necessity  to warn the unwary then to put simplicity upon guard to regulate the kindest noblest passion and to show the delicate partition which divides humanity from weakness and feeling from folly these memoirs are published in which for such purposes are exhibited scenes of hazard enterprises of moment and a diversity of characters not i hope ill adapted to the occasion i earnestly beg the history may be read with these views and i as ardently wish any imprudence may be avoided or any discretion acquired by the perusal  it is necessary to say something for having prefixed a table of contents to these volumes contrary to the design of benignus whose opinion upon upon this subject will be seen in the sixtysixth chapter  to works however of this nature it is not only customary to give short introductory summaries but it was even whispered to the editor by several gentle readers that such pithy hints at the head of a chapter were not only agreeable and convenient but even honest and conscientious in an author for said they if we like the promised matter in the general we enter readily into the particulars if we do not we turn over the leaves till we hit upon what is better suited to our taste  that i may make this history as pleasing as possible by yielding to the wish of various tempers i have taken the freedom of an editor to humor certain readers in this article but that i might not too flagrantly oppose the intentions of my author i must beg leave at the same time to observe that i have managed my information with some skill and economy and though a little is anticipated a great deal more will be found in every chapter than can or indeed ought to be told at the top and therefore it is my serious and earnest advice as a fair dealing editor between author and reader that lest any entertainment should be lost the whole should be read through with candor and resolution  advertisement these volumes begin with the rival of their hero benignus in the

attracted my attention as i advanced into the city it was late enough in the evening for a country gentleman to expect more appearance of tranquillity and indeed certain i am more than half the inhabitants of my village were asleep  as i passed therefore along streets which were illuminated and shops which exhibited with an air of ostentation every thing to view i gave way to the perfect simplicity of my soul and asked the coachman for mr greaves had now left me upon what public occasion these rejoicings were made  rejoicings your honor answered the fellow i see no rejoicings for my part the lamps indeed burn a little merrily but so they do every night of the year for the matter of that  very well said i  drive on briskly sir  so said so done and briskly he did drive with a vengeance mounting such precipices thundering down such vales turning such corners clattering over such stones and making such angles that unused to so pleasant an exercise i was utterly unable to keep my seat and was tossed about the coach from one side to the other fill a sudden jolt drove my head incontinently against the glass on the lest hand which gave me an opportunity to cut my cheek and hollow forth my disaster to the author of it i ordered him to go less furiously assuring him at the same time while i applied a handkerchief to my cheek that i was not an express nor upon any errand that required such hazardous expedition  oh very well replied this obedient driver i ax your honors pardon but i thought as how you might like to go the long trot he now set forward and crept so provokingly slow that i had full leisure to contemplate every thing i beheld around me  at the end of a street i saw a claster of shewy young women who seemed to have met by accident and were rejoicing at the interview while the coachman therefore was indulging his present fit of deliberation moving as if he had a mind to stand still  one of the ladies very politely walked by the side of the coach for some time enquired after my health with great assability and at last most hospitably invited me to drink a glass of wine with her struck with the agreeableness of her figure and genteel address and not doubting but that she was some young lady who had seen me either at school or at my village but whose features were worn out of my memory i made her a profound bow of acknowledgement expressed my concern at not being able to accept her flattering offer but would take the first opportunity to pay her my respects in delivering this sentence while the goodnatured creature expressed her satisfaction at seeing me even by a gentle pressure of the hand i had the confidence to look in her face in the hope of recollecting an old friend but such was the treachery of memory that although she actually called me twice or thrice her dear which methought denoted particular intimacy i could no way recognize her however i was in some measure rewarded for my pains by surveying a countenance where the roses and lilies were so nicely blended the brow so delicately arched and the bosom so exquisitely white that i congratulated myself highly at having found so amiable an acquaintance and signified my intention to wait upon her at all events the next day  all this time during which i was leaning half out of the window the coachman was stifling a laugh which when it was no longer to be repressed would very well have become the lungs of the animals he was driving at length he cries turning himself round upon his box why she is a tight going thing your honor i will get down and open the door  will you ride with the gentleman bess what say you hey imagining he meant to insult my friend whom i was bound in honor and indeed in conscience to protect i exerted myself warmly in her behalf insisted that the fellow should not affront my acquaintance but go directly where he was ordered then addressing the lady i was preparing a very proper apology for this unparalleled rudeness when the coachman with a saucy smack of his whip so increased the speed of the horses that i sound myself at a considerable distance before i thought of asking her direction  this however i now determined on and stopping the coach by dint of absolute vociferation i commanded the fellow to drive me back again to the lady as i had forgot to enquire in what street she resided and where i might find her house her house replied the coachman  somewhat surlily it will be a difficult jobb of work to find that i fancy she is a hereandthereian as a man may say  she has no house  no house said i and yet resumed the hero of the long lash she is pretty well known at most houses in town for all that what cried i is she then a woman of such distinction very great dictinction he replied bess bronsby beats round all the bawdy houses in a night sometimes  bawdy houses said i what is she then  is that lady  can it be possible that  that i stammered at a little  and selt the color in my face  i know what your honor would say interrupted the coachman and she is all that i can assure you and more too astonishment silenced me and it was some time before i was able to say go along coachman pray go along sir   reflections now thickened upon me and thus at last in the language of simplicity and inexperience i argued  fair unfortunate how i pity thee thou happily art another almeria detesting thy sad situation and shedding many a tear to the fraud which occasioned and to the disaster which continues it to thee happily some father with the seelings of mr greaves may at this very moment mourn thy loss and thy wanderings   oh that some gentle spirit inspired with benignity would interest itself in thy fate  would exert its friendly endeavors to sweeten it  thy heart may not acquiesce in the concessions of thy person and if it be so as surely the luster of thine eye is the luster of innocence do thou not sigh for the compassion of a friend do thou not weep for the bosom of a father oh that providence may bestow these blessings upon thee and may thou in a parents protection once more find shelter from mankind  i had finished this soliloquy just as the coach stopped in a spacious square at the house of my relation and after the man had opened the coachdoor i saw a woman moving along in no situation to be envied for she could by no means walk either direct or angular and though well dressed she was seriously cursing herself all the way and protested vengeance against the very next scoundrel she should meet  what is the matter with you poor woman said i stepping out of the coach are you subject to fits fits be d  d replied the lady  o yes cries the coachman look your honor how woundily strong they are upon her now alackaday poor soul she is got the staggers you lie you scoundrel said the lady the coachman knocked at the door and i was conducted by a footman to the family of my cousin drunk said i to myself as i passed through the hall and ascended the staircase  drunk a welldressed woman drunk in the public street at this time of the night and using such language too because a man civilly inquires what is the matter with her methinks the london ladies are a little queerish lord help me i see i know no more of the ways of this world yet than a sucking pig courage benignus  that world is all before you  chap l i was so extremely fatigued with my journey from never having traveled so far or so long together before that i was under the necessity of asking permission to withdraw to my apartments soon after i had paid and received the customary compliments awkward matters to be sure first salutations are at best but to a fellow who has not yet rubbed off the bashfulness of a boy by mixing with men they are horribly distressing i do not know that ever i felt a more displeasing sensation than at my entrance into the room in which mrs darlington and her niece were sitting in all the primness of expectation starch stiff laborious formality was visible in every thing around me and i really thought there was something punctilious in the very look of the furniture but alas i soon found the sormality was in myself  i was embarrassed and therefore imagined every thing near me partook the confusion how much was mistaken as soon as i expressed a wish to retire the wish was granted without any pageantry of ceremony mrs darlington desired i would do exactly at her house as i would do at my own  polite woman said i as i was following the servant to my chamber  this mrs darlington is certainly the best bred woman in the world there is a crisis at which fatigue is favorable to repose but a single moment beyond the crisis throws weariness upon the pillow i was however lucky in this respect and slept through the night without once waking to toss to turn or to contemplate the sun and i got up cheerfully together though he did not seem to rise with to splendid a countenance in this place as i had been used to observe him from the windows of my village to say the truth the morning after my arrival was the most lazyloolang morning i had ever beheld and yet it was scarce less than six oclock when i was dressed time however seldom hangs heavy on a man resolved to improve it and inclined to be satisfied the prospect from my apartment was a handsome square with a garden in the center through this square i presently saw a woman dressed in a ns blue surtout and sauntering along with a pair of pails mewing as she walked like a cat in distress then followed a sootboy shuffling over the pavement and highly delighted at the conceit of shaking the ends of a ick which hung over his shoulders into the good womans pail without her perceiving him and some little time after this came a solitary ass dreaming beneath panniers which appeared to contain vegetables for the market after him at due and drowzy distance crept the driver who looked if possible more sleepy than his beast but they both knew their business and habit will carry a packhorse we know to the end of his customary stage without any eyes at all it is to be presumed therefore in these cases they smell their way certain it is the ass with two legs and the ass with double that number crossed the square blindfold without any deviation from the track that led to the beginning of the next  how many alas of their brethren wander from the right road as the phrase is when broad awake this descendant of the sagacious baalam deserves therefore to be complimented  i amused myself in this idling way for half an hour and then went down stairs which by the bye were carpetted i presume to clean the sh  from top to bottom but sad was the survey of all below  all was still as midnight and pretty nearly as dark the door of the street was chained  the shutters were closed with bars of painted iron  the cricket was complaining that the sires were out and the pendulum clickt in its corner a neglected melancholy monitor it pointed to me however the intelligence of wanting only four minutes to seven it gave warning to strike  that may be said i but i suppose you may strike again before any one in this castle of indolence will make thee an answer the seven oclock of the country is indeed so very different from the seven oclock of london  at least the polite part of it  that i instantly ran into the contrast for the readers will find if readers i have that i was a desperate fellow to think before i began to act or in other words that while i was all sentiment and no fact  i hope the desiners of sentiment will forgive me all theory and no practice it was very unusual for me to let the minutest objects pass without producing a reflection  a short conversation with myself  an ejaculation  a note of interrogation or an exclamation and for the first ten years of my life this last matter was so very remarkable in me that it became at last characteristic and i was distinguished in several circles under the nickname of honest ehu  as i looked at the clock which methought spoke very sensibly i say i could not avoid rambling into a contrast all i have seen hitherto i cried is a mighty indolent collection of creatures truly dull dreary dreadful and solemn now in the country what a different face has the time of the day  a face not of business only but of joy the milkmaid is singing at her pail the ploughman is whistling over the furrow the birds are offering up their hymns from the hedges the very waves of the water seem to pursue each other in sport the leaves frolic to the gale and the lambs are tripping over the lawns  at the close of this soliloquy i conceived myself so prettily poetical that i heartily forgave the gloom which as first occasioned it and in high good humor with myself reascended the staircase  chap li i now laid down with perfect resignation on the bed till i might really hear somebody stirring but as i had no inclination to sleep because i had nothing to do which is however no uncommon excuse for indolence i resolved to employ the period in which i was thus shut up from society in sketching a scheme of life and laying a plan for my conduct in the capital  oh imagination imagination what a sorceress  what a witch art thou how do thou take reason by the hand and idea by the heart leading them through all thy lovely wilderness of mazes now into the recesses of the shade now into the avenues of sunshine  still intricate  still entertaining  till the youthful adventurer puzzled as pleased in the pursuit presses onward with too enterprizing a step till thou leavest him on a sudden  a misguided stranger in a fairy land surely fancy never promised or painted pleasanter scenes or more delightful figures than at this moment danced before me in all the luxury and decoration of romance  thou art now said i benignus in the capital of the british world thou have fortune to accommodate a heart to bestow  some little discernment to see and much health to enjoy but prythee now my good lad treasure up the hints which have been given thee learn wisdom from the wise and get understanding from experience already have thou seen something worth memorandum let me advise thee therefore to extract useful morals from the whole thus then runs the catalogue thou have seen in the coarse conduct of the grocer that selfishness is at best but a dirty sordid road to happiness and in the benevolence of blewitt that benevolence should condescend to be guided by discretion in the behavior of mr greaves is strongly maked to thee the golden characters of sensibility and economy  of tenderness disciplined by prudence of bounty regulated by reason the manners of thy villagers may serve well enough to show thee that thou will need meet with much discontent  much mistake much rudeness in thy migrations the man who travels must pay for his curiosity in thy curate thou may see that the system of philosophic patience is not proof against a foolish spark from a foolish tobaccopipe and from the ways of thy earlier playmates thou may observe that he who endeavors to do a great deal of good must have fortitude enough to bear calmly and even well temperdly a great deal of mortification forewarned therefore forearmed be that the maxim act with deliberation thou have already met even since thy arrival in london strange matters  an obstinate coachman a lady of distinction without any settled habitation and a woman strolling intoxicated through the street at ten oclock prepare thyself therefore for oddities of all sorts keep honest prudence ever before you and as thou journeyest along esteem her as the safest monitor of thy youth be very cautious and be very happy  this wellconnected and solid chain of argument put me in such high spirits and made me in my own conceit so very clever a fellow that i could lie no longer but springing from the bed with the agility of a man delighted with a slattering idea i danced about the room as light as a feather and seriously believing i was now a match for all the artifices of the world i cared not how soon i rallied forth to encounter them  by this time my watch positively declared it was eight oclock and i began again to listen whether the morning had yet commenced in london by the greatest good fortune i heard a foot moving sostly upon the stairs there was something social in the sound and in going toward it i saw the maids cautiously descending with their shoes in one hand and a candlestick in the other as i passed by them they stared at me as if to atisfy themselves whether it was really the strange gentleman or the strange gentlemans apparition a strange gentleman assuredly they thought me for upon my asking how long it would be before breakfast and that with the best natured accent in the world they replied with great astonishment  breakfast sir why it is but a little past eight oclock  oant it said i  willing to seem no greater a fool than necessary  ant it my dear i declare i supposed it might be almost nine  nine sir answered the other maid  would you please to breakfast so soon as nine them  no  no child i replied i will wait till your ladies get up that will be twixt twelve and one cried the girl she now quite did for me and i went sneaking up the stairs a third time feeling the ridicule of my own figure and repeating the words twelve and one with astonishing emphasis at every step insomuch that as i mounted in the climax i absolutely stamped again and thus disturbed the family by ringing the changes upon twelve and one  well said i shutting the door this is a pleasant existence truly  why for ought i see a mans life in this town should be estimated rather by the number of nights than days at this rate of calculation fifty years out of the threescore and ten are passed between the blankets  so that allowing upon an average ten more to dressing undressing eating and drinking  two to mere sauntering five to sickness and two to paying and receiving vis there remains but the solitary unite even supposing existence to be protracted to the utmost either to be d or to be happy heaven help me i am afraid i have got in a strange family for it can never be that this great feat of trade and pleasure should be such a dreadful dormitory as that comes to  no  no  i have hit upon the fact mrs darlingtons is a particular family and contains a very heavyheaded tribe be this as  may i will have at least the prudence to hold my tongue whatever use i make of my eyes indeed i will be caution in every thing saying this i applied once more to the window for entertainment and seeing a poor fellow at that time sitting down in the square to breakfast on a dirty piece of bread i involuntary opened the sash to ask what objection he had to butter none  said the poor creature  no objection in the world sir  but i am a child of sorrow  and had not lady pampers dog that lives at yon great house had an objection to this piece of bread which he carried last night in his mouth in order to bury it but on turning it over thought it i suppose too stale i should not have had any breakfast so that being the case bad is better than none you know sir i have resolved to be cautious friend said i but i see you are hard pinched and so  there is a shilling for you i closed the window and prided myself upon having displayed that true medium betwixt bounty and profusion in giving only one shilling at a time instead of two yes yes said i i ser there is nothing like it  a cautious man is an excellent character  chap lii in these reflections i indulged myself till about ten minutes past twelve when a footman with a bunch of twisted papers at his ears came to acquaint me that the ladies were waiting tea for me in the library i obeyed this summons with pretty much that sort of joy which a prisoner might be supposed to feel at the receipt of an unexpected reprieve  mrs darlington and her neice were seated at an elegant teatable at which a superb service of plate and china were exhibited the tea was measured from a silver cannister and poured from a golden urn  but unluckily the noon tide sun came rather too rudely into the room  that odious light puts cut ones eyes exclaimed the matron  lower the blinds alicia good day to you ladies said i if it is not too soon i unluckily aimed at humor in this salutation why it is rather too soon exclaimed the young lady to call it day already but you country squires always rise i think with the lark and go to bed with the crow  is not that the maxim pray draw a chair cousin said mrs darlington  never mind that noisy thing but sit down and get your breakfast lord cousin replied alicia what do you call this gemini crimini what have you got  here she listed up the skirt of my coat which had been the work of a rural tailor and was not it seems quite ridiculous enough for the london taste this really will not do benignus continued miss darlington i hope you rested agreeably cousin said mrs darlington  but i see my good reader there will be no end of your says is and says she is in this case  so i will even throw the breakfastconversation into dialogue  alicia it is a lovely fine morning benignus   mrs d what will you do with yourself after breakfast cousin   alicia do you drink sugar   mrs d i suppose you will smile at our cream   alicia shall i make your tea pretty sweet   mrs d i hope you will make a long stay with us   alicia i dare say you admire the country   mrs d you dont eat cousin   alicia do you find your tea agree able cousin   mrs d i am afraid you breakfast too late   these interesting questions all past and repast like the rebounds of battledoor and shuttlecock in about the space of one minute so that in attempting to reply to each i was kept in a continual stutter now directing myself to the aunt and now to the neice at last came on an interval which i did not fail to sill up by informing the ladies in a confused manner by way of general answer that i rested well  it was indeed a fine morning  i drank sugar  did not propose staying long  liked the country  perhaps upon trial might like london better  would take the cream just as i found it but did not choose to eat any thing at present  while i was thus speaking with a tremulous voice the old lady slanted her head till her right ear was exactly brought parallel to my mouth and alicia was biting her lips and catching her breath as if laboring to subdue the hickup what does my cousin say alicia cried mrs darlington  still remaining on the sp  what is he talking about alicia then with a very grave face and  audible voice recited the substa of my speech i now found that mrs darlington was defective in the faculty of hearing she was indeed so extremely deaf as scarce to understand the notes of her niece which i had afterward reason to believe were in no degree wanting in shrillness  when mrs darlington therefore dealt forth her interrogotaries they were intended only as a proper quantum of that inoffensive chitchat well adapted to the teatable and just as agreeably insipid as the tea itself and as she never heard one syllable of the pertinent questions with which miss alicia plied me she imagined her inquiries to run thus what will you do with yourself after breakfast my dear cousin as you are so great an admirer of the country i fear at first the time will hang heavy on your hands in town you will smile at our dignifying water and milk with the name of cream and as you dont eat i am afraid we breakfast too late for your usual time  now these sentences with little momentary pauses between would have been pleasing enough and to do mrs darlington justice it must be confessed she  make at least a comma at each but alicia who was both a wit and a wag ran her notes of interrogation so rapidly between that she not only destroyed her aunts stops and my endeavors to answer but played upon the imperfection of mrs darlington made me sit as if i was laboring under a violent impediment and confounded the whole conversation nor was this all alicia speakin  provokingly in a low voice could not be heard in any degree by the poor lady nor in her present oblique posture could this funloving alicia be even seen for mrs darlington was sitting on a contrary side of the cha very attentively waiting my replies it is more than possible that mrs darlington supposed i was actually making my responses very regularly and that upon principles of politeness she rather bore the mortification of losing every syllable than give a stranger to her infirmity the trouble of repeating his sentiments she was a woman of real fashion and the instant she understood from her rogueish interpreter that i designed to employ my morning in taking a transient survey of the town she said her coach was now and would always be at my service but when she found i chose walking she directed her footman to order benjamin to attend me adding that against my next excursion she would see out amongst her young friends for a more suitable companion this advance of friendship reinstated her in my esteem i pitied her misfortune and began again to think she was the best natured woman breathing of the young lady however i made a memorandum and set her down in the volume of extraordinaries  in something less than a quarter of an hour after the teathings were removed a young fellow of a florid complexion with his hair curling in his neck came to inform me mr abrahams would wait upon me in five seconds mr abrahams was it seems the steward of mrs darlingtons estates and had great share also in the management of her domestic affairs and my cousin willing to recommodate me in the best manner went out herself to order the said steward rather than a common menial adherent to attend me at the time this message was brought me alicia and i were looking over the books with the titles of every one of which numerous as they were she appeared to be acquainted she perused the bearer of this message as accurately as possible the moment he entered and indeed he was a very proper subject for female criticism  mr benjamin  for benjamin it was  was the nephew of this mr abrahams  the footman out of livery to mrs darlington  and the favorite of mrs darlingtons niece he was now habited in a light green coat and waistcoat neat buckskin breeches brown thread stockings a ruffled shirt shining shoes and silverbuckles nor were other necessary appendages wanting such as an hazle switch headed with a piece of ivory in his hand a cravat which with a narrow edging and tied carelessly adorned his neck  a garnet breastbuckle in the form of a heart and a bunch of baubles depending from his watch in a word he might very well have passed for a young nobleman whose passions gravitating toward the kennel and the stable had just come to london for the day on purpose to have the pleasure of riding home tomorrow chiefly indeed for the supreme exploit of telling his acquaintances how many score of miles he can ride betwixt sunrise and sunset  as alicia seemed to pay some sort of respect to him i inclined my head at his entrance rather nearer the earth than was necessary or indeed to speak more properly i was rather more polite than the established laws of subordination prescribe for having nothing about his dress that marked his real station except a broad fringe of silver that surrounded the button of his hat which i did not directly take notice of the hat being then under his arm he might as easily be mistaken for my lord himself as my lords favorite jockey mr benjamin was however i find my ladys gentleman and a smart tight taking lad he was as ever came a volunteer into the honorable service which way do you intend to ramble said alica speaking to me and looking at benjamin through the park miss i answered  for no other reason but because it was the only place i could venture to talk about without danger of feeling her wit tell your uncle then ben  i believe indeed she might say mr ben  tell your uncle he must go with my coz through st jamess so then up by westminsterabbey and so then by the house of lords and so then home by pall mall you will return by dinner benignus if possible said i  looking seriously at my watch  if possible but pray dont let me wait you see it is now one oclock  so that i am afraid i cannot promise  why not cried alicia why not you have four hours good and the deuce is in it if you will not have had enough for one day long enough before then i had totally forgot again the new regulation of times and seasons albeit i made the best of my mistake then you dine at five cousin soon after it said she very well i rejoined then you may depend on me and if mr benjamin will go see for his uncle i will set off di   chap lviii di  rectly would have been pronounced had not the two last syllables of that word been cut off by the appearance of mr abrahams himself this serious personage was altogether different both in look and dress from his nephew mr benjamin being rather swarthy than fair and formal than spruce  now then young sir if you please said he not much in the tone of a domestic  now let us make hay while she sun shines  with all my heart mr abrahams i replied for we are something late better late than never said the steward  miss alicia your humble servant benjamin i understand from my lady thee art to follow us ben bowed alicia curtified abrahams bent his neck as if he hated compliment that is to pay it and i went scraping like a schoolboy out of the room  and now it was that the expression of mr greaves became forcibly exemplisied for curiosity indeed paid the debt to surrounding splendor my eyes and heart were immediately taken captive and led not unwillingly in the pleasing chains of inexhausted novelty i walked amid the ambition of buildings and the clatter of carriages as if under enchantment and at the entrance of the mall which was on that day crowded with company i did not think that the paradise of mahomet could be more elegantly displayed for here beauty wealth and elegance were on all sides exhibited and what chiefly pleased me was the appearance of satisfaction that crowned the whole the dress and discourse of every party might be various but happiness seemed to be uniform an ill tempered man would here have lost his errand and gone home disappointed the ladies were springhtly and smiling the gentlemen were assable and gastant youth and age appeared equally to be delighted and my heart so tympathized and expanded at the view of so many hundreds of my fellowcreatures social and agreeable that i could not help catching mr abrahams by the hand and in the genuine fusions of transport exclaiming heaven and earth my dear sir wh a joyful prospect is this a joyful prospect quoth the steward  alack  alack sir  much cry and little   all is not gold that glitters   nulla ides  benjamin ant that  fellow who laughs so loud along with the woman there in a blue ck the poor devil who came with a diamond ring for me to buy the other day  verily i think it is he  yes sir said benjamin  it is he sure enough  why he looks the merriest of the whole groupe said i  that very scoundrel replied abrahams is the most notorious blackleggs in town he has ruined his whole family and is twenty thousand pounds in debt mercy upon us said benjamin lifting up his hands  mercy upon us heigho sighed i  who would think it ah ha cried benjamin softly yet with some emotion there she is by gingo  here he plucked me gently by the sleeve asking me in a whisper if i took notice of a young woman on one of the benches and if i did not think she was the most landsomest creature i had ever seen since i had eyes in my head  latter part of this question was uttered rather warmly so that before i had time to answer it abraham turned about and benjamin who all along kept aweful distance  behind we now past by a person whom mr abrahams faluted very obsequiously calling him his  inquiring after his family and professing himself at parting his  obedient and eternally devoted  that must be a most respectable character thought i to myself and i long to know him pray mr abraham what worthy gentleman was that you shook by the hand  a worthy gentleman sir replied abrahams as errant a rascal as any in the three kingdoms  burning the candle at both ends  has got six sons  must come all to the parish  and is at this very time in treaty with an honest man who has saved up a trisle by industry to supply him with a cool thousand upon the last mortgage and so then thought i wellbred persons it seems are the most obedient and eternally devoted servants of the errantest rascal in the three kingdoms and to show their politeness the more eminently will even shake this identical rascal by the hand with the same cordiality that they would embrace a very honest fellow  by this time we had got to the top of the park and having now had a view of the gayer parts of the town i expressed a desire to walk rather into some of the streets of business than into the gloom of westminsterabbey a wish which the steward gladly obeyed observing that trade was the thing and that every other point upon earth was trash and flash and flummery and nonsense and nothing at all benjamin seemed much to wish we would take another turn down the mall but perceiving his uncle against it dared not hesitate though i could plainly perceive the poor lads heart was upon one of the benches  accordingly we plunged into the great scenes of business and had no sooner got within temple bar than the contrast became so visible that the building appeared to be the boundary of a different world inhabited by a different race of mortals a step of dispatch an eye of attention and a face of care distinguished almost all we met from almost all we had left if one neighbor met another he took him hastily by the hand nodded his head and pressed eagerly forward whereas on the contrary i observed parties in the park saunter indolently along or form themselves into little societies and sometimes hold a long conversation here also the beast seemed to share the impatience of the man the very horses as if animated by the general hurry were either vigorously toiling in the car or bounding along with the coach even death was disregarded and the hearses rolled beside us with all the sprightliness of bridal chariots nay i beheld a fellow running across the way with a cossin over his shoulder and heard him at the same time curse a scavenger who obstructed his way  abrahams jogged on with the utmost indifference except that now and then he said he wished mrs darlington lived in the city and that he thought thames street infinitely preferable to all the jumble of st jamess at last he dispatched benjamin with an errand first asking my permission the errand luckily happened to lie at charing cross and benjamin either out of affection he bore his uncle or some other person ran forward as fast as his legs could carry him i now took a peep into the shops in every window of which was displayed a moderate fortune every thing that could give taste to attracting trifles or decorations to that which was actually necessary all that could accommodate the person with convenience with luster and with magnificence lay open to the eye the agreeable and glittering temptations were indeed so artfully disposed and so skilfully had invention varied her trinkets that the passenger was irresistibly invited to lay out his money and yet abrahams seldom turned his head even to look at them i was much captivated by the glasscase of a jeweller when stopping to look over the splendid toys which it contained i asked the steward if he was not amazed to see so many pretty shewy contrivances not at all amazed answered he sir to see them but very much amazed to think there are any people weak and ignoramus enough to buy them but as i always said a fool and his money is soon parted there was a little box however which particularly pleased me and which i was resolved to purchase in defiance of all the proverbs of solomon or abrahams i went into the shop while abrahams stood grinning at the door as much as to say he did not like the business  the trader was one of the neatest best spoken obliging beings that ever hopped round a counter his face was exceeding pale and made still paler by the powder on his pate which was rather flat than oval but there was a gaiety in his eyes even though they were gray which compensated for something of deadness in the rest of his countenance he drew out the glass adroitly and gave me with flippant assability the history and intent of every bauble i was really quite taken with the mans politesse and though i had no sort of intention to buy more than the little box yet he so clearly proved to me the indispensible necessity and use of several articles of which i never before had an idea or indeed knew that the world contained in it any such artiticles that in less than twenty minutes this courteous jeweller absolutely talked me out of seven guineas and a half i made purchase of a shining chain for my watch which the trader protested was the most delicate workmanship in the three kingdoms  i bought two crystal seals because he very properly observed that a good chain ought to have handsome appendages in the same manner as a good house ought to have handsome furniture i bought a silver toothpick case because he said no gentleman was without one and besides they looked mighty pretty in the hand after dinner these with my box completed my marketings with which i departed and as i went out of the door informed mr abrahams with somewhat of triumph in the tone of my voice of my bargain asking him at the same time if he did not think i had them a pennyworth  a pennyworth sir  cried the steward sneering up his upperlip till it touched the tip of his nose and twitching up the waistband of his breeches with infinite disdain though not so as to tear them a pennyworth  every man knows his own business best  some save and some do not save  many reservoirs  many fountains  dont you think them cheap then said i  the lord knows sir answered abrahams  what is cheap to one may be dear to another you know  many men many minds  but what do you think  rejoined i  think  replied the steward raising his voice about four notes  think  why i think  but i dont nevertheless presume to judge for you  yet i say i think i would look at the trumpery once and my seven golden guineas seven and twenty thousand thousand times before i would part with a brass happeny for all the things in the shop for not a thing there can i see that a reasonable man has any fort of occasion for why i have lived in this same london now sir eight and forty years and better than fortyeight  have seen all the catchpenny conundrums that ever were invented to take people in and yet i never laid out a crooked sixpence upon any of them and what is better still i hope with gods grace i never shall for between you and i sir those shewaway fellows are mere pickpockets mere pickpockets  rascals that live by snatch and catch and will have one hand in your fob as i may say while the other is squeezing you out a welcome  no sir  solid business  merchandise brokerage and such fair and square dealings are the things for me  the structure of st pauls now commanded my notice and i looked at it as worthy the deity to whom it was devoted and the apostle said i to abrahams whose name it bears might not blush to preach in it it is a vast piece of work to be sure answered the steward cautiously pulling out his watch and regulating it by the dial but i never was nearer it than i am now i am pretty right i believe  if you choose to see the inside i will attend you to the warder and wait at the door till you return and is it possible said i that you could be so many years in town and let such an edifice as this escape you very possible he replied that i should escape as you call it this edifice and every other of the like kind for i never set my foot within a church since i was born no  cried i in astonishment no replied the steward never indeed doctors and doctrines differ you know sir  in this town there are many religions  many religions mr abrahams  i mean said abrahams many ways of being religious  but surely the established protestant said i  established fiddlestick quoth abrahams prudently depositing his watch into his fob as he heated in his argument  what matters it whether i choose to perform my journey on horse back or on foot by this road or by that so as i get to the inn at last that is enough what is that to you under favor sir  what is that to you  i will tell you what young gentleman churches and chapels are all a joke a man may be as much in the way of working out his salvation as he walks along the streets as if he was to wear out the knees of his breeches by prayer faith and good works  hope and charity good works above all things that is the point  that is the creed  that is little he  that is salvation sir  the drops of disputation began to start in his forehead and he collected as much wind into his mouth as he possibly could that he might cool his ferment with a whew  i looked at him without speaking  because i really did not know what to say he had not indeed yet done for though the press of people began suddenly to be severe this good man in spite of sweat or squeezing muttered forth several heavy sarcasms against pulpits parsons churches and chapels still insisting that good works alone would save the soul though i did not extremely relish mr abrahams system yet i honored him for his principle as to good works and began to believe that however he might be mistaken in some of his maxims his grand tenet was right and might possibly make him a benevolent member of society  chap live we had just disentangled ourselves from the crowd when the steward perceived he had lost one of his shoebuckles a discovery which produced much agitation and a resolution with my leave to hunt after it when the people were dispersed by which means says he at least i shall perhaps obtain some part of it i represented to him the little likelihood of this sir replied he with a rueful tone and gesture pointing to his foot  sir dont you see that it is silver  silver sir solid silver as i hope to be saved and thirteen years ago the pair cost me nine shillings and six pence i shall not be able to answer it to my conscience if i dont see after it besides i had rather spend a pound than lose a penny scripture for that whoever loses one thing having ninetynine other things does he not seek diligently till he find it yea even at the charge of a candle very true said i mr abrahams i see you have so many strong arguments in your favor that we will wait till the coast is a little clear and then for conscience sake i will assist you in the search mean time sir said abrahams highly pleased with my condescension suppose you were to amuse yourself in that booksellers shop where you may look over all the books such is the convenience of a lounging place without laying out any thing while i will keep my ground and see that nobody stoops to take up my buckle and so march off with my property  there are sharpers sir at every corner of this town and unluckily there is more gape about this cursed spot with pictures on the one side and a damned great lumbering building god forgive me on the other than at any quarter of the whole city he now stood fixed as a rock and vigilant as a lynx while i pursuing his advice sauntered into the shop of a bookseller  there are several places in this metropolis and indeed all over this kingdom particularly adapted to cherish idleness a booksellers a barbers a chandlers and a milliners and these both in london and in the country are immemorially famous for sheltering those people who have little to do and an infinite deal to say hence we constantly find them silled and frequented by indolents of all denominations included in the catalogue are halfpay officers gentlemen who live as they term it on their means gentlemen who live upon ways without any means at all ladies who set the fashions ladies who follow the fashions and ladies who only love to see and talk about fashions without any power to do more than hobble in the train at an humble imitative distance these are peculiar to the connections of the milliner the barber and the chandler for the vulgar and the bookseller for the lazy the learned and the laborious  there were several of this kind of customers in the shop when i went in and two or three people really making purchases seeing business on foot and a chair empty i sat down and ran my eye over a pamphlet that laid upon the counter pray mr luton said one of the customers holding a book in his hand does this do any thing why not much sir it moves but slowly aye aye festina lent said the other  the fellow has a pretty knack at novels i think i dont much admire his poetry oh execrable replied luton he is a mere blockhead at verse though i ventured to give something for his miscellanies did they do  very well for the pastrycook i believe rejoined luton  i sold them by the lump to the man yonder he had the whole impression for seven and six pence  yet as they were upon the luscious order and therefore likely to run through the libraries i struck off a thousand horridly taken in to be sure but it is all a lottery all a lottery sir  well replied the customer i will take these popes and when you get any thing tolerable do let me know  oh  pray mr luton how did your four volumes of moral philosophy by dabbleall go off he is a doer of all works methinks and the fellow has certainly a turn aye cried luton that may be but i have turned him off for all that he is dull sir devilish dull dull as orthodoxy i declare to you his philosophy has not yet paid advertisements  i told him it was too much in the old style  god god god nothing but god and goodness and go to church and go  bed early through the whole  says i to him now pray my dear mr dabbleall be a little heterodox a little out of the way now do dont go off in the old report with a moral at your head and a proverb at your a  e i beseech you dont you know people sleep over these migh y good sort of writings a touch of the tabernacle for heavens sake my dear dab  well and what said he cried the buyer preparing to go out said he rejoined mr luton sternly why he said nothing i might as well have endeavored to drive an hackney beyond his house of call as that mule of a fellow out of his track no sir no he wrote obstinately on stringing together his damned collection of morals into four volumes  vo and preachifying till he piously picked my pocket of above a hundred and fifty guineas besides the twenty here he caught the gentleman by the wrist i generally gave him for the copy before the first volume was worked off but heaven be praised i have washed my hands of him and so he and his devotion may go to the devil together  this is a strange town cried the gentleman that can neither be pleased with religion or bawdry  not at all replied luton not at all sir it is the happy mixture of both together  a little of both delicately dashed that does the business here here is a little fellow now taking a book from a shelf behind him here is a lad knows how to tickle up the town to a tittle knows how to sed the pulse of the public to a nicety lookec sir pointing to the title page fifth edition with addition and came out only the beginning  the winter  every thing he writes runs like wildfire he has such a way of wrapping the thing up  such a a  a  a sir method of mixing the honey with the sting  such a  a knack at playing off the passions  oh lord sir he is a special journeyman indeed aye and works reasonably  but i beg pardon my customers i see are waiting  mr querist your very humble servant sir good morrow to you said the gentleman and went out he now served other people and they going away likewise i was just rising from my chair to converse with mr luton when a tall spare figure came stalking into the shop taking out of his bosom a large packet and presenting it to the bookfeller there is volume the first cried the spectre in gods name mr lemuel said luton casting his eye at a chasm in his breeches which i believe might originally have been whiteish why do you come out in the daytime you know the credit of me and my shop and every body knows your trade in a twinkle this was delivered in a sort of halfwhisper articulating as it were grinningly through the teeth sir said the author for such he was i was driven into this step by a precipitate and particular necessity for my landlord begins to mention the subject of arrears and rent to me and therefore you will advance me the price of this  laying his fable palm upon the parcel  directly because the remarks of mine host are not only pathetic but have therewith a tincture of the terrible what before the proofs are corrected cried luton that is out of the regular channel you know mr lemuel but as a matter of indulgence and in consideration of that aperture in your breeches i will come down half a guinea and trust to your honor to go on with the same care as if you had not received a farthing men of letters ought to be sometimes encouraged and as i really believe you have a little outrun the constable in the purchase of that last pair of shoes i cannot refuse you there sir he told out ten shillings and six pence from a purse which appeared to contain about sixty pounds and the petitioner after having given a written acknowledgment for the sum took it up made his bow and walked away without any disagreeable sentiment whatever he was scarce gone then another person in a full trimmed suit of black velvet came stintting into the shop with a look tread and tone of great authority luton said he you must let me have three hundred tomorrow the history will make eight quarto volumes and i will not take six pence less than   0i each really sir said luton you put me to a nonplush i am quite out of cash  have a large sum to make up for my printer against the beginning of the weck  i wish therefore  a fig for your wishes sir replied the demandant elevating his head and expanding his chest shall i have the money  what time will you call in the city sir answered luton sneakingly  i call in the city mr lucon  what do you mean by that a conslagration consume the city  who is to run after you hey i have a house i suppose yes and in a square and i presume you know too that there is a certain brazen intelligencer upon the door and i expect you by eleven oclock i say no more  but i expect d  m  e i expect you so saying he turned upon his heel threw his body of literature into a carriage which was waiting for him at the door and left luton to meditate upon the three hundred pounds  i now rose a second time and defired to see the magazines for the month while i was turning over these abrahams came in begging me ten thousand pardons and most bitterly complaining that he had been groping almost upon his hands and knees this hour to no manner of purpose for he could see no signs of his property and that hard as it was he must even put up with the loss and was ready to attend me to dinner i proposed going back in a coach to which mr abrahams confessing himself heartily tired and knowing possibly that there would be no great matter for him to pay readily consented i purchased a pamphlet a coach was called and we set off for mrs darlingtons  chap lv about the middle of fleet street abrahams happened to cast his eye upon the shop of a silversmith and this bringing strongly to mind the misfortune of his buckle he cried out with some emotion what a pretty mornings work have i made of it indeed yes yes fine misfortunes indeed  a buckle too that i have had so long and a buckle of silver into the bargain and a buckle that might have been in the shoe of my benjamin when i am laid low in my grave  stop coachman stop said i set us down here a minute i took the unhappy steward by the hand and walked with him into the shop if i thought i could match it now said abrahams as he passed toward the door i would certainly be extravagant for once though i believe i have a pair of respectable metal buckles in the house too he could however find no fellow to that which was on his foot and truly its fellow would not very easily have been found in any shop within the liberties of london for besides that it was in fashion thirteen years ago it was so excessively small and thin with the wear and tear of so many hard winters that i apprehend a silver groat would have turned the scale and fairly outvalued it  not being able therefore to provide a companion for the old one he thought of bartering with it for a second hand pair and to this purpose he unbuckled laid the solitary servant upon the counter and desired to know what it was worth or rather what he could allow him in the exchange should he choose to become a purchaser as much as any body in the business sir said the silversmith and while i determine its value perhaps if you look over the drawer on the other side you may fuit yourself and depend upon it you are come to the cheapest shop in own we examined a variety of shewy goods to all of which mr abrahams the steward had but one objection viz that he was morally sure the fellow would ask three times more than as an honest man he ought for sir says he drawing up his jaws significantly there is no guessing at the value of a buckle while these heavy tongs and anchors are in them meantime the silversmith was employed at the opposite counter in weighing the old buckle which he presently informed us came to seventeen pence halfpenny seventeen pence halfpenny cried the steward turning short about and twitching the foretop of his wig why man the pair cost me nine shillings and six pence and they are as good as new there is a great difference betwixt buying and selling you know sir observed the trader and there is nobody now will put such a thing as this turning the anchor backwards and forwards upon the foot will not they why not pray said abrahams while the color came flushing over his cheekbone  why not hey it dont signify dispu sir about such a trisle of which i have offered you the full value  joined the trader and if you have a mind to take the money there it is if not you are welcome to the trouble you have given me and your buckle into the bargain i am am i what after you have bruised the anchors all to pieces hey replied abrahams i thank you for your love but i am a man that knows the world an odd old bird that knows wheat from chaff i will have my buckle exactly as i gave it you sir what a devil business had you to mangle my property in this manner  in this way he ran on for several minutes and at last asked in a growling voice what would be the lowest price of the pair hanging over the window why said the silversmith they are only plated were made many ages ago and being old style will come cheap plated sneerd abrahams with ineffable contempt then i suppose instead of seventeen you would not give me seven pence if i should choose to dispose of them a twelvemonth hence no nor seven farthings neither said the tradesman returning his sneer thou art a very saucy fellow rejoined the steward and i would go with my shoestraps about my heels to eternity before i would buy a pair of thee as you please sir said the smith and to tell you the truth i dont care how few of such customers i have to my back abrahams was huddling up his broken silver not forgetting the iron thereunto belonging and was bustling away in high dudgeon when i begged him to stop a moment no sir answered he no sir i will wait for you in the coach but i will not stay another second in this shop for all the surlishd up stuff it contains so saying he went out grumbling and grinning in a most violent manner  i now rewarded the pains of the silversmith by purchasing a pair of near and new silver buckles received his thanks with my goods nicely wrapped up in a piece of paper and went forthwith to the coach i had not got my foot upon the step before i heard abrahams severely chiding a woman who had been sweeping the crostway with a besom for having the impudence to desire alms when the had so good a trade in her hands and when i do not doubt said he but you have extorted more money from passengers this very morning than would make good the loss of the silver buckle which i lost in st pauls churchyard indeed sir cried the woman i have not taken but one halfpenny to day though half a thousand folks have gone over my cressing without dusting their shoes and that one was flirted at me by a young man who wanted to see if he could not hit the old woman on the head by sending a halfpenny as he would play at taw and so wantonly  god bless him  jerkt it at me from his finger and thumb in this manner and after all sir lookee it is but a brum do therefore dear good sir for charitys sake  charity my b  k  de said abrahams prythee woman dont be troublesome go civilly away for i will not give thee a sous coachman drive on saying this he drew up disdainfully one of the glasses the poor woman really looks faint and i think mr abrahams said i we should so far oblige her as to throw her a little copper and then letting down the glass i gave her twopence  as you like exclaimed old good works as you like i have lost enough sir for one morning already the coach now proceeded and abrahams sat sullenly swelling in one corner leaning his arm against the left panel chagrind much at the buckle but more at what he called the sauciness of the seller of buckles when i had seen mr abrahams exhibit his temper thus far i was resolved if possible to bring him about a little before i resigned him over to melancholy reflections in his counting house and in this manner i began to administer a salve for all his sores mr abrahams i think myself much obliged to you for your company in my rambles of the morning but i cannot without concern reflect that in procuring me this pleasure it has been productive of your inconvenience and as it has so fallen out i must in some degree insist upon repairing it the werd repairing like sudden sunshine in stormy weather worked wonders upon the features of abrahams which from the gloom of wrathful wrinkles became softened into the most smiling symptoms of complacence and when i put the paper which contained the buckles into his hand reinsisting upon his acceptance as a debt due to him for his civility he only affected to refuse that i might press them the more eagerly upon him and so give him a better opportunity to receive them without exciting in my breast any sentiment to his disadvantage for mr abrahams was a great observer of forms and although he was at the bottom as selfish a mortal as could possibly exist yet he took great care in general to save appearances and without in reality ever doing a single praiseworthy action was generally talked of as a very religious knowing wellmeaning good kind of a man he took the buckles and so well contrived it as to six the obligation on my side for as he put them into his pocket he very gravely assured me that rather than affront me by a denial such was his regard he would wear the buckles even though they came from the shop of the most scoundreally silversmith in the city of london  thus was good humor restored to the steward who chuckled and chatted all the rest of the way and when we arrived at mrs darlingtons he jumpt out of the coach with the briskness of a boy and handed me obsequiously into the hall  we had forgot to pay the coachman and i saw the steward in a dilemma  he fumbled in his pockets some time then producing a guinea asked with a trembling voice for change though i could plainly see how much his avarice was alarmed lest the driver should happen to have so much silver about him i relieved his distress by satisfying the fare while the good man was making many excuses for giving me so much trouble and lamenting his want of loose silver which he protosted for the future he would always carry in his pocket  chap lvi the dinner was serving up as i entered the diningparlour where i was no sooner seated than i related the adventures of the morning concealing only the present of the buckles the ladies were highly entertained by the narrative and miss alicia was particularly smart in her remarks till i came to animadvert on the behavior of benjamin this intelligence i confess was reserved as a coup de grace because shrewdly suspecting the state of the young ladys mind and willing to gratify a piece of pleasant revenge i was resolved to see what effect the relation of this incident would have upon the constitution of this lively lass who had taken much delight in playing upon my inexperience ever since i came into the house i had no sooner therefore mentioned benjamins warm chcomium of the young woman on the bench adding likewise in a jocular manner that i presumed mr benjamin had his favorites than the face and neck of alicia were covered with an unusual suffusion of crimson which in the next moment disappearing left her as pale and languid as a lily she cut the slices upon her plate over and over again till in the end they were small enough for the mouth of a sparrow and yet after all she had neither inclination or intention to eat mrs darlington who though a wellbred woman was not a very accurate observer took no notice of these changes in her niece whose distress soon became so evident that she was obliged to rise from table and counterfeit a terrible headache for a disquietude which in fact sat much nearer to the heart  i now pitied her most sincerely and execrated myself for the unnecessary mischief i had occasioned vise propensity said i  pitiful passion this that leads us to repay every petty offense in kind how could i ever persuade myself to stoop so low as to recriminate and because i smarted beneath a momentary sally of wit i must needs take advantage of a bare conjecture and pursue my purpose till i wrung the tender confession from the heart and that the heart of a woman and that woman a relation oh fie upon it fie upon it i feel myself blush  when poor alicia arose mrs darlington arose with her appearing sensibly to feel her anxiety and so they went sighing up stairs together i was now therefore left alone to the enjoyment of my reflections and these soon brought on soliloquy the second why friend benignus this is a brave setting out a noble exploit truly  thou have spoilt a very excellent dinner and sent the founders of the feast weeping away the banquet is thy own prythee then fall too enjoy it and complete thy triumphs by rioting in the hospitality which thou have thus gratefully rewarded the whole matter too may possibly be a weak surmise how then have i had the assurance to make the story out my own way  mrs darlington now returned observing that her niece had desired to be left alone a little and politely made her apologies for leaving me so abruptly all this was poison to my wound i was fully conscious of the little trick i had played the pang of reproach struck my heart and the tear of contrition was swimming round my eye i declined cating on pretense of fatigue and mrs darlington swallowed a spoonful of soup and withdrew again to her alicia i spent the interval betwixt this meal and tea in a sense of real agony arising from the conviction of real meanness and error my feelings were as yet unblunted by habitual trespasses and as my greatest joy arose from the contemplation of having contributed something to the happiness of others so my greatest anxiety arose from an idea of having promoted their misery yet in the present case no way was left open for me to rectify my mistake or to soften the uncasiness which my blunder had brought about for all explanations would have betrayed that i guessed at alicias disorder and i could not so much as hope admittance to her apartment had explanation been advisable at tea however the young lady made her appearance led tenderly into the room by her aunt and i was glad to see her attempting to resume her former spirits of which in the general she had as the reader may possibly recollect an abundant share but rightwell sung the bard who first observed that misfortunes love to cluster and seldom or never come singly indeed one is commonly the illfavored messenger of another and that of a third and so on to the end of the last dreadful chapter of human accidents this was a day of disasters to poor alicia mrs darlington had just poured out the first cup of tea and was affectionately pressing her niece to drink it when a violent noise was heard in the hall and a consusd cry of several voices as if deploring a misfortune presently afterward a servant came into the parlour and with him mr abrahams acquainting the ladies that benjamin who had been missing at dinner was now co in all over blood and bruises and that the servants were carrying him up to bed speechless  blood was no sooner pronounced than the teacup fell from the hand of alicia to the ground on which in the same moment she sunk down herself this mrs darlington imputed to the effects of a sudden surprise seizing her so soon after her late agitation while i was perhaps the only one present who attributed it to the true cause every method was used to recover her but the violence of the sits into which she now fell resisted our utmost endeavors and she was a second time conveyed to her chamber in a much more alarming connition than before mr abrahams and i now went up to benjamin to see if he was yet able to unfold the occasion of this mystery when abrahams ere he had well opened the door and consequently before he knew whether his nephew was dead or alive began to harangue as follows  what is bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh you cannot make a silk purse of a sows ear pray sir in gods holy name what a devil have you been about where is the money i sent you for what made you stay so long what right had you to stay at all how the p  x came all that blood upon your clothes how came you to dizen yourself out in your green today what is the reason you  i am to be thus plagued upon your account and why dont you get  home to your father and mother who are starving you know upon five and six pence a week  these questions were all thundered upon the poor lad at once and in the uttering them such was the rage of the steward that he not only committed the extravagance of striking a pen which he had then in his hand against the table but smote that table likewise with so furious a fist in contradiction of his usual prudence that the lid split in twain and a small splinter from the ruins of the mahogany lodged itself deep within the palm of his hand till he roared again with misery this so increased his resentment both against the table and benjamin that the former he belabored stoutly with his legs and though he could not make it el he at least made it sorely complain which was no doubt a satisfaction and the latter he violently threatened to horsewhip if ever he should have the missortune to rise again from his bed so saying he ran ent protesting all the way down stairs that he would not leave him a great die when he would  chap lvii all this time lay the agonized benjamin resigned as a lamb under the knife of the butcher and when the fervants had washed him and at my desire departed i sat by his bedside and gently solicited to learn the cause of this strange disaster  sir said the poor lad  almost breaking his heart as he spoke  my friend has been insulted and so i have been fighting that is all i begged him to take time and tell me the whole promising to be his friend with his uncle and mistress when i know how to make his apology his tears thanked me and he proceeded thus  you remember sir how i bid you take notice of a young girl sitting alone on one of the park benches she is not a bad girl i can assure you though she was sitting by herself as soon as my uncle sent me to charing cross to receive fifteen shillings i went and received it as fast as i could and ran away to the park where i left nancy i found her with a handkerchief up to her eyes  the sweetest eyes in the world sir  so i pulled away the handkerchief gently and taking her under my arm walked away with her into the birdcage walk that i might talk to her without being disturbed nancy said i i charge you speak your mind to me what brought you into the park alone nothing said she mr benjamin pray leave me where i your father nancy said i and why dont you go home  home replied nancy sobbing as if her dear heart was beating itself through her stays  home benjamin i have no home nor no father  nor any thing else i thought sir i should have dropped down dead on the spot but i fell on poor nancys neck and there i lay she almost ready to kiss me without knowing it though i am sure as soon as i got a little better sir i   here mrs darlington herself came to the door requesting to know whether benjamin was better said that his young mistress also wished to hear a favorable account and desired him not to fret so as to increase his disorder but as he was a very quiet peaceable lad in general to expect no reproaches from her  mrs darlington  but total forgiveness mrs darlington understood from me that he was better and withdrew the poor fellows heart was so softened by this indulgence and so affected by the other circumstances which were lying heavily upon it that he could not return his acknowledgments soon after mrs darlington was gone however he thus resamed the story of his adventure with nancy whose misfortunes seemed to engross infinitely more of his attention than even the threats of his  the kindness of his mistresses or indeed any thing else  in truth this benjamin was a most excellent disposed young man his understanding was not much above his rank but his heart would have been distinguished had providence thought proper to have placed it in the breast of a prince for it led him to do a thousand noble actions with small opportunities and with an income of about a shilling per week to render more real service to society than mr abrahams his uncle with an income of about eight hundred a year for such was the annual fortune attributed to the steward who had amassed together all that possession merely by a strict adherence to one single maxim which i have been told he never once violated or infringed in the course of forty years namely to consider a farthing as some part of a guinea and a guinea as the nine hundred and ninetyninth division of a thousand and so on ad infinitum benjamin on the contrary thought a farthing too trifling to save and too insignificant to bestow but if by adding thereto the odd eleven pence three farthings he could divest himself of his seven days allowance and in so doing dry up one tear or remove one sigh procure one cordial to the sick or one meal to the hungry away it went as fast as he could get it from his pocket without even turning it over a second time without considering indeed that it would produce twentyfour pieces of copper and that twenty four pieces of copper would gratify several moderate passions but it seems the  had a pleasure in this sort of distribution and perhaps had in this respect the advantage of his uncte  chap lviii as soon as i got a little better i say sir  resumed benjamin i looked nancy in the face and entreated her to explain what she meant by having neither house nor father and then the poor thing spoke to me thus  oh benjamin i am turned out of doors and lay in the street all last night and have not broke my ft since yesterday morning and all for i misfortune which as i hope to be saved i could not help  what have not you eat nancy and did you want a bed i charge you dont talk new but come along with me and lean all your weight upon my arm so i led her sir in this manner to a publichouse and got her some refreshment and would not hear a word she had to say till she had forced down a morsel of bread and a glass of wine  though i could not get her to take it without water for she is to drinker i will assure you this over she informed me that her distress was as thus  she was sent out yesterday morning to the bakers over the way to get change for half a guinea but not being able to get it there seeing as how they had not so much silver in the house she went to several other neighbors shops and at last to the chandlers and there she met with a man who offered to go to his brothers as he called him at the blacklion and change it  as she supposed the man was as honest as herself and i am sure she is as honest as heaven  she gave him the half guinea and sat down in the shop to wait his return after he was gone the chandler said nancy do you know that man child no replied the poor thing trembling but you do i hope not i truly said the chandler he only came into the shop for a farthings worth of cotton to put in an inkhorn and i never saw him in my life before here poor nancys mind misgave her and not without reason for she waited and waited for above two hours and no man came so that she was afraid to go back to her fathers because she had stayed so long and met such a sad misfortune and accordingly she continued in the chandlers shop expecting and expecting till quite dark night  but why did not the chandler assist her in this emergence said i  he very well knew her honesty and surely where the poor creature had so much at stake and the sum so mere a trifle  he lend her he assist her sir replied benjamin not he truly though as to her honesty he had often seen instances of that and moreover her father had been a customer and bought all his chandlery there for many many years no sir about eleven oclock he said to nancy well child there is no chance of the mans coming now it is getting late and i have a dipping in the morning so i would advise you to go home to your fathers nay dont cry mayhap things may not be so bad as you think for mr dennis is a good tempered man and i dare for he will not hurt you but let me as a friend advise you never to trust people you dont know with money for the future to tell you the truth i did not much like the look of that chap when he came into the shop why did not you tell me so fall nancy mr suet why it is hard judging you know said the chandler but i thought i saw tyburn in his face and now i am convinced are long i shall see his face at tyburn  here nancy says mr suet set up a laugh which so provoked her that she left his shop without saying a word but i should tell you before she got far suet hallowed at the door after r and said that if her father ill treated her tonight she might depend on his coming to make her peace to morrow and that if the man brought the money he would take care of it poor nancy now sir  but i am afraid i am tiring you  i beg pardon for troubling you with my concerns and  i desire answered i i desire benjamin you will not stop a moment to make apologies for i long to know the fate of nancy dennis well then sir rejoined the stewards nephew wiping his eyes which had been all the time streaming  since you are so good i will go on he proceeded raising himself on him arm  chap lix poor nanny sir now wandered weeping about the streets till she came to her fathers but though she saw a light in the window and yet as you know it rained pretty smartly all night she had not heart to go in she put her hand on the knocker and then took it away  first walked forwards then backwards till at last she heard somebody behind her and soon found it was mr dennis himself who had been it seems out to look for her and having the key of the door in his hand he struck her in his passion swore she should never come into the house again and was going into it himself just as he had unlocked the streetdoor he asked her for the money saying he supposed she had spent it  with a great oath and when she told him the truth he damned her in a terrible manner banged to the door and left her to go where she might she sat all night crying upon the threshold till at last a watchman who knew her took pity on her put her to bed to his wife and then went again to his business in the morning she went home a second time but when her father opened the shutters and the poor thing asked him if she should have the pleasure of making the fire and getting his breakfast as usual he ordered her to get away from the door or else he would send a constable to her  the next thing she did was to find me out for you must know sir we have  a  a  a friendship for one another  but as she knew what a jealous creature my uncle is she was too good to come near my mistretss house because i once invited her there to drink tea with mrs goodly the housekeeper and i thought i never should hear the last of it but lord sir what a heap of contrivance distress puts into our heads especially when a young man and a young woman has a  a  a  friendship for one another said i mr benjamin looking at him slyly very true sir answered ben very true  friendship if it is of the right honest sort  friendship  heigho friendship i say sir will do any thing  nancy now recollected that the likeliest way to see me would be to go to the park where she knew i generally walked every morning with one of my mistresses  i mean behind them sir well sir to the park she went and there sat herself down after having wearied herself with walking upon the little white seat where we saw her perhaps you might think it odd she did not speak to me as soon as i came near her but seeing who was with me she would have died first for she is a prudent girl and has had the best of educations besides she knew i was flurried enough at meeting her there and would contrive to see her as soon as possible indeed nothing run in my head after i had passed her but how i should get away from my uncle who is as cunning as cunning and though i had great pleasure in attending you sir yet as  as  my  friend looked to be in some distress  i thought it  my  my duty to see if any thing could be done for her i almost made my head ach in hunting about for excuses for indeed so many came to mind at once that they quite flabergastined me but at length my uncle you know sir sent me away himself to receive some money which was only a months interest of a few pounds and was fifteen shillings as i told you as soon as nancy had finished her story and i made her drink half a glass more of the wine and water she threw her hand upon my shoulder and asked me what she was to do and there was such a  a something in her manner of look and in her manner of speaking that i was all over in a tremble from head to foot aye  aye said i benjamin  friendship  friendship  she said that she never dare to go home again without the money and she had only two new six pences and a silver penny and a little copper keepsake in the world and even they were locked up in her trunk at the bottom of all her things with this sir i put my hand in my pocket and took out the fifteen shillings and told out ten and six pence on the table and was just going to put it into nancys hand when something struck me to the heart as much as to tell me i was going to do a bad thing upon which i drew away my hand and took up the silver again then feeling sir in my other pocket i took out a spank span new halfcrown piece which young mistress gave me and was only sorry that i had no more at last i took out my uncles money and told it over again that is eight and six pence but sure something bewitched me for i quite trembled as i laid it down and so as last told nancy the whole affair  you must know sir she did not much like the money at all  the between friends what is it  but when she understood it belonged to my uncle abrahams she turned as pale as her apron and cried out lord of heaven mr benjamin what are you about i would not touch it for all the world put it up  put it up if you have not a mind to frighten me out of my wits and make me hate you for ever i was glad sir in the main to find my dear love  i mean sir  a  a  my  my  to find  my dear friend so honorable and just and as if providence designed she should be rewarded for it a thought came into my head which was a thousand times better because it was not to make us ashamed of ourselves and it is a shocking thing you know sir to be ashamed of oneself well sir  i be thought me of raising the money by going to the pawnbroker man where slash our coachman who is a terrible sot many a time used to go with first one thing and then another so i said nothing to nancy but desired her to sit still till i came back which should be in a few minutes she seemed uneasy to let me go but at last consented and as i was going into a little bye alley to take off my waistcoat and something else who should come that way but mr mendman my uncles tailor who always loved me from a boy and always said i one day should be rich  as sure as you live this generous soul lent me a whole guinea without my telling him a word about nancy and away i ran scarce touching the ground and not giving myself time to put on the things i had taken off and hardly buttoning my coat at first nancy was quite frighted  then blushed  for to tell you the truth here he whispered my shirt was one of the things  as i dare not pledge any thing in sight for fear my uncle should see me before i could get up stairs into my room  but i went out again and put my things on and soon cleared up the whole matter  we then went home together and there i found old mr dennis crying and taking on like a child as soon as he saw us instead of rising to scold nancy he ran to her fastened on her neck kissed her and shed tears for his passion was now all over and his love for his poor dear nancy returned at once  but not to trouble you with any more of this part of the story i shall only say that i left the old man hugging his daughter and i dont know why but me thought i could have hugged them both however nancy sighing  because she was quite weary and her spirits gone thanked me with a tear in her eye and i went out of the house hardly knowing what i had done or where i was going  chap xl i had got almost home sometime whistling sometimes singing and sometimes jumping for joy before i recollected that i had still the money in my pocket and that perhaps old dennis though he might pass over the loss while he was warm might talk about it when he was cool would be cruel again as he loved money so i even ran back to the house and found the old man quite busied in laying the cloth warming a little can of beer and pressing nancy to eat with a great deal of kindness i soon found he had never once mentioned the half guinea and so laid down the ten shillings and six pence telling nancy that it was a great chance we met the fellow and that it was well she knew him again god for give me sir for i made a fine story of it  mr denniss heart however was open and he insisted on my sitting down and drink a draught of his own brewing for indeed he belonged to a brew house so as i was to drink my nancys health i sat down and some how or other got into singing songs till at last mr denniss ale got into my head and made me forget  as you know ones time slips away in agreeable company  that i had stayed already so long from my uncle i therefore caught up my has and stick when i heard the cluck strike six and in a great hurry set forward for mrs darlingtons  unluckily however sir i happened to pass by the door of mr suet the chandler and as i was angry with him for his slight to nancy i called upon him to tell him a little piece of my mind mr suet said i you are a good natured man and i come to thank you for your kindness to poor nancy dennis last night nancy dennis be d  d said suet who was a passionate fellow and one of your great sighters into the bargain  what is nancy dennis to me  she kept me and my family up all night but you are her favorite i forgot that  it is a pity you did not see her when she was turned out by her father who has been making a sine piece of work here truly because forsooth i let her give the fellow that came into the shop a half guinea to change what had i to do with her half guinea a little silly puss i wish i had never seen her face for i shall lofe a good customer by her  a foolish minx i cannot think how dennis could trust her with any money my blood boiled at him sir all the time he spoke and when he called the poor girl those names i lost all patience and so without more ado i laid my switch over his shoulders upon which we both of us went to it and fought till some neighbors took suet away and locked him up and so parted us but i would fight for a friend to the last drop of my blood sir  nay for that matter i have lost a good deal o that already but i have had my revenge on that hardhearted rascal suet and so i dont mind my black eyes or bloody clothes of a farthing and now sir you know the whole story and i hope you cannot blame me seeing as how i did it to serve a woman  blame you said i benjamin  no say good lad i admire thy spirit and honor thee for thy sentiments and indeed i approve your conduct so much through every part of your adventure that i will go this instant and make peace betwixt you and mr abrahams you are very kind in says benjamin but if you please you may as well not say any thing about nancy for you know old people think such strange things and have such odd notions about friendship that perhaps he might take it into his head to  i understand you ben said i and i will bring you off without once mentioning your friend nancy depend on it  i now went down stairs to see after my sick cousin whom indeed i had too long left without making a small breach in good manners but as it happened she continued in her room and her aunt with her till supper was almost ready and the ladies were but just got into the parlour before me  i had scarce opened the door when both ladies began their inquiries after benjamin and i believe miss alicia obliged me with ten questions  so little art and so much nature had she  before it was possible i should return her one answer resolved however to make no more disturbances i now took a contrary method and said every thing that i thought might please the young one without betraying what i thought was apparent enough to the old one and if i mistake not this was the first time i convinced myself how necessary it is for a person who would live upon any peaceable terms with society to give into many petty deceptions where the plain truth would infallibly create confusion and disquietude and this sort of duplicity is i presume what the latins call a pious fraud yet something there was in my nature utterly repugnant to this nor could the best of motives ever reconcile it to my heart  nevertheless this embellishment of the truth had a great effect in soothing the something that sat heavy on the bosom of alicia for after i had told her that mr benjamin had accidentally met an old friend with whom he was tempted to drink a little freely and afterward got into a boyish dispute of which the worst consequence was likely to be only a bloody suit of clothes she gave his misfortunes a mixture of smiles and tears the latter of which however she kept from falling and at last she grew so pleasant without seeming to lodge too much on the subject that she actually told mrs darlington she found herself so much recovered that she should be able  eat a whole wing of a chicken this declaration on the other hand set mrs darlingtons heart at rest who most affectionately loved her niece and supper was now ordered without delay willing to do notwithstanding as much as i could in this affair i slipped out of the parlour to seek mr abrahams whom i found in the stewards office with his spectacles on his nose very industriously employed in examining a large book like a tradesmans ledger in which he was perhaps  this being saturday  casting up and adjusting the accounts of the week something  probably a reslection upon the buckles  had put him in high good humor and he considered the interest i took in his nephews conciliation in such good part that he left his business on purpose to mount the stairs and assure me that he forgave ben and then shook him heartily by the hand in my presence i should not however forget that mr abrahams just hinted at the prospect of sending the bloody clothes with success to the scowrers thus happiness being restored to the whole family the rest of the evening was passed in general satisfaction and i withdrew to my chamber not a little instructed nor a little pleased at having been in some degree an instrument in bringing about the agreeable catastrophe of the evening  chap xli the next morning dawned upon the unanimity of mrs darlingtons family alicia retained her usual flow of spirits benjamin was getting the better of his bruises the old lady rejoiced in the recovery of her niece and the steward chuckled over the gift of the silver buckles and the success he expected from sending the coat and waistcoat to the scowerers  a whole week passed in which this general felicity rather improved than diminished but felicity is at best but a coy visitant fickle in her friendship and unsteady in her attachments and perhaps if she condescends to stay seven days in a family it is as much as can well be expected change of air immoderate walking for my curiosity laid a heavy tax upon my legs or some other cause brought on a cold so that on the sunday evening succeeding these matters i was quite hoarse and did little more than cough and suck sugar candy a specific for this disorder which i adopted in the nursery and which if not infallible is at least as essicacious as many a nostrum of prouder name and dearer purchase there was always however a sort of stimulus in my temper which would never suffer me to be supine whether i was in sickness or in health in solitude or in society to this natural activity perchance i owe many strokes of fortune which men of dormant and indolent propensities never experience but i was inclined to brisk volition from my cradle and as we all naturally dislike whatever is naturally unlike ourselves  i mean in points of sentiment  i will now give the reader an early instance of my antipathy to every thing that wanted vivacity  in my childhood i was one day walking in a meadow when i happened to strike my foot against a stone  wretch said i  a little vexed by the pain  wretch how i pity thee fixed down by fate to one circumscribed spot  even to the narrow cavity of an inch diameter there ingloriously reposing  insensible to the joys of motion an increasing encumbrance to the earth your cover and supinely slumbering even as you grow  when i had thus triumphed over the innocent stone which bore all upbraidings peaceably i indulged the pride of superiority by running hastily away when my precipitance occasioned my foot to slip and threw me to use an old but emphatic phrase head over heels the proverb was verified pride had a fall i felt it and as i rose from the ground said thus to myself how unworthy is arrogance  what right had i to taunt and break my pitiful jests upon an innocent pebble sleeping quietly in it is bed performing it is allotted task in dutiful silence and gradually spreading into bulk peradventure to mend the very cartrut over which the foot of my horse or the wheel of my carriage is to pass more safely if i were not afraid of being called superstitious i should think this sprain of my ancle a judgment be it what it will if it teaches me humility i shall consider it as a very seasonable tumble and so here i was obliged to bind a handkerchief hard round the part assected as for the matter of a little smart i believe it may be wholesome enough  saying this i found the tears in my eyes for my ancle was swelling apace and went limping away  i mention this as a trait of my character and a judicious reader will indeed find something more truly and essentially characteristic in these minute developements than in the most elaborate detail of what historians very falsely call marking circumstances i have often wished since this trifling accident that i could have changed situations with the poor stone if motion cannot produce rest methinks there was nothing so extravagant in the idea yet was there much ill nature in it for i have seen and felt enough to destroy the constitution even of the stone itself and by a change of conditions it would i am pretty certain have had the worst of the bargain but i shall digress into gloominess which even for the chance of being read should my adventures ever be printed i am resolved not to do since i am confident no man either looks into a book or hears a story without some notion of being entertained and those people who think to raise pity or attention by expatiating on the subject of sorrow and formally entering into prolix accounts of calamity will certainly miss their aim the whining beggar who runs after us with a dismal ditty we avoid and despise the writer who dresses up the tale of woe in all the sable pomps of description and ceremonies of sepulchral sentiment is no less troublesome and vapourish and perhaps this is the reason why so many sizeable volumes nay i might add so many books of sacred instruction are neglected the utile dulce being constantly essential in every composition not excepting those which are designed to persuade us to virtue exhort us to repentance and prepare us for immortality and for the truth of this i appeal to all the libraries in the kingdom nay i appeal to every man who may hereafter take up these memoirs a few questions fairly ananswered decides the point  notwithstanding the real unhappy circumstances under which this history is written  notwithstanding the sad solitary deserted and even dying state of the author would any of these matters be attended to  would not the most patient turn from his book disgusted with the calamitous narrative were it only to consist of melancholy scenes ruefully related and morals deduced from thence in the soporific solemnity of lethargic language i declare to you my worthy friend the very recital of the questions already operate on my nerves and the answer is displayed in painting my retreat in more dreadful colors a browner horror breathes along the wood for my sake therefore and for thine o reader i will lull thee to sleep as seldom as possible and yet take especial care that i may neither hurt thy principles or fatigue thy spirits by keeping thee awake to the end of  at least of  a chapter  where as at an inn  if thou art disposed to take a little refreshing nap fold down the page good temperedly and in the hope that thou will wake in the same humor so that we may meet after the enjoyment of thy panacea upon terms of mutual obligation much good may it do thee    chap xlii though my cold confined me to the house it did not confine me to the chamber i had therefore sufficient scope for observation and that too on a part of life with which i was hitherto unacquainted the incidents which are constantly happening in every family are ample enough to excite infinite reflection in the minds of the speculative no wonder therefore that i found ample subjects for two or three days perhaps i was rather fortunate in this respect or the said two or three days might teem with domestic adventures for two very great events happened at mrs darlingtons while i continued an invalid and i shall relate them as i am resolved to do every thing else exactly as they fell out at the time  mr jonathan abrahams began to take a great fancy to me which the ladies told me i might consider as no trifling favor assuring me that he was by no means apt to take likings and particularly to young people whom he in general treated as a pack of striplings who know nothing of business and whom he always spoke of with the most supercilious contempt but it seems i was down  the credit side of his books where no doubt the silver buckles figured respectably be that as it may i was not displeased with his attention  for besides that it gratified my vanity it gratified an higher passion in giving me an opportunity now and then to throw in a word or two by the bye for my friend benjamin  it happened that during my recess at home mrs darlington and her niece were under an indispensible necessity to pay a debt of visitings  this debt had been long due and the discharging it postponed from day to day in mere compliment to me as i declined attending them through the ceremonies of introduction but as the debt was due to persons with whom the ladies stood on some little punctilio the payment could now no longer be evaded without a slur on that politeness of principle which genteel people consider as a sanctimonious appendage of public character  mrs darlington indeed was turally a little punctilious and miss had no objection to keep upon the square with the acquaintances she did not care a farthing for so that to have delayed the thing any longer would have been downright illbreeding a reproach no woman of fashion can possibly put up with as it implies something vastly more shocking than the imputation of intrigue or even of the mistake itself to prevent therefore so iniquitous a violation of the laws of high life i exerted my atmost rhetoric to request they would take the opportunity of my wishing to write letters and tumble over books and rub off the long score which their acquaintances had marked against them as could be testified by a variety of bills drawn upon the cards which were laid in the windows tucked in the carvings of the glasses and displayed round every mantlepiece my argument at length prevailed and pretending on my part a wonderful deal of private business that must at all events be done the ladies paid a visit first to themselves in their lookingglasses in their dressingrooms  then to the reslection of the same persons when they got down stairs into the parlour  because it may possibly happen that glasses differ as well as watches and lastly to the ladies the living ladies who retired within their drawingrooms were actually waiting for them  and here i cannot omit a word or two on the curious commerce betwixt those who are distinguished under the general title of the polite at least such among them as are resident in and about the courtly circle of the capital the point of ceremony is critically adjusted and the gradations from the cold salute of the perfect wellbred stranger to the most familiar ardours of the animated friend are discriminated with a minuteness which employed on subjects of equal or even more importance might produce to society something highly edifying possibly it may not be unamusing to throw together a few instances from the multitude i collected in the course of my observations on the customs of the polite  mr jonathan abrahams himself never struck the balance of debtor and creditor or understood the secrets of the per conpra more precisely than many wellbred people who nevertheless hate mathematics and could as easily solve the knottiest problem in euclid as repeat their table of multiplication the truth is mr abrahams book of accounts resembles the accountbooks of the modish only in two great particulars viz in paying and receiving and in these respects many of them are as exact as the good steward though he should bring down the fraction to the twentyninethousandth part of a farthing these are what may properly be called your annual visitors or people who settle accounts once in the year and therein the business differs widely from the business of mr abrahams for should that faithful gentleman happen to call on any tenant at quarterday and instead of receiving his money receive an apology or a denial the matter would most likely have a serious face and produce serious consequences but in the adjustment of these politer transactions where the parties know what they are about the point is soon reconciled the coachman drives lady a to lady bs house the footman thunders out a polite alarm at the door lady b happens unfortunately to be from home lady a putting her head out of the sash of the carriage to receive the messages sees perhaps the identical lady b at one of the windows but as she is not at home there is no such thing as nods or courtesies but the visit is paid and lady a orders the servant to go as fast as the horses can gallop to mrs cs while lady b is either sitting cool in her own parlour or else preparing to pay her compliments to some other ladies of the alphabet in the same manner or as we are told in the play if she chooses to be politer still she will entertain her acquaintances at home and send round her empty chair to entertain her acquaintances abroad  upon visitings of a nature somewhat less ceremonious were mrs darlington and her niece now gone they set out at half an hour past seven and as alicia was stepping into the carriage while her eyes were immediately after directed to the window of a certain chamber which contained at that time a certain person she gave this account of her intended excursions we shall pay half a dozen how do yous in pall mall half a score is your ladys at home in cavendish square two or three five minute stops at james pass half an hour with lady bustle half an hour with mrs slimlisp drink a friendly cup of tea and coffee with my dear marin and so be home again by supper i thought at least she would have had the conscience to say dinner tomorrow however away they went and mrs darlington herself  good woman as she was  seemed to be no way displeased at the rattle and rotation of absurdity she was at sixty years of age about to perform while alicia either out of complaisance to me or for some other reason kept still leaning out of the window and kissing her hand a ceremony which i aukwardly enough returned till she was fairly out of sight  chap xliii it was a preconcerted thing betwixt abrahams and me to enjoy a social hour together the very first time i could steal as he expressed it from the gaiety of magnificent madness to plain sober meaning commonsense by which was literally meant no more than preferring his company to that of his mistress  soon after the ladies were gone then jonathan conducted me into a commodious little apartment which led into his office where placing me in his own armchair he shook me respectfully by the hand and welcomed me to his hut and presently sir cries jonathan well crack an innocent bottle on this he rang the bell and two or three servants immediately obeyed the summons tell mrs goodby said the steward to send me the sugar basin and lemon squeezers perhaps sir you may prefer a tiff of punch some love one thing some another every man in his humor if we were all to like the same thing what would become of us what is one mans meat is another mans poison in short mr abrahams exemplified and corroborated almost every sentiment by proverbial evidence and he went on to prove how natural it was for some men to love punch and some wine till a bottle of the one and a bowl of the other might very fairly have been consumed  whether abrahams had really any saving policy in this method of interluding his conversation with old saws i cannot tell the sugar at last became useful and unlocking a closet that stood in the corner of the room and a bin that was made in the window seat he produced from the one a case of bottles such as are frequent amongst mariners and from the other another bottle which he said was almost as old as himself he now begged permission to sill his pipe which being readily granted a candle which he took from his beaufet being lighted and afterward extinguished and every other act of deliberation over he shook me once more by the hand as he was seating himself and repeated his gladness to see me  you would hardly think it sir cries johnathan fixing the pipe in his mouth  you would hardly suppose that i prefer this piece of a mousehole as i may call it to any room in mrs darlingtons house tant the bigness of a thing constitutes the goodness you perhaps call it a nut shell it may be so yet what is sweeter than the kernel very true mr abrahams answered i  pardon me sir quoth the steward there is something about you that i like you may see my respect indeed by wearing your favor  here he pointed to his shoes on which were the silver buckles  a keepsake mr benignus is a keepsake and should be held sacred memoria amie if a man was to part from any thing i gave him for this purpose though it were but a cheeseparing  though it were but the bowl of this tobaccopipe  i should never have any opinion of him again sir i will wear these buckles till they are ten times thinner than a sixpence and so sir here is my hearty service to you i was so charmed with jonathans gratitude and expressions of kindness that my heart opened and i was sorry that i had so shabbily purchased his esteem a pair of silver buckles said i to myself as he was taking off the punch pitiful  i have often thought resumed he setting his glass down of buying me a couple of labels to hang round the necks of my bottles but i dont know how it is one thing or another takes away ones money and leaves nothing for trifles yet some day i will certainly do it for you must know i am a strange fellow every thing in this room and in that office is my  and i am such a sort of a chap that i cannot even sit down on another persons property unless i pay for it that is being very conscientious indeed said i it is so answered abrahams but you shall hear i have been an old standard in this family and am besides a piece of a relation to mrs darlington but i made a rule many years ago upon having a legacy of fifty pounds left me per annum that however poor my apparel food or furniture it should be my own property having a method of making fifty pounds go a good way i came to a resolution and put it into practice madam says i to mrs darlington i am an odd fellow a very odd fellow and having now a little windfall come to me i am resolved to employ it in providing myself with all necessaries content is as good as a feast what do you mean mr abrahams says she why sure you will not leave me in this manner you know every thing is under your eye and i shall be ruined without you madam says i you misunderstand me i do not intend to kick the stool from under me some honest gleanings of my industry i have certainly picked up under sir robert darlington and fifty pounds a year more comes to me by gift put that and that together and i have a morsel of bread and a morsel of butter of my own the year round i have nevertheless a kind love for the darlingtons  use is second nature what is your drift johnathan said she why madam answered i to tell you in few the needful at once i will continue your steward as usual but i must purchase the furniture of my office and my parlour and pay you so much per annum for the houserent and after that you shall give me such a yearly salary as in your own judgment appears sufficient and i must also allow so much for my board otherwise be permitted to find my own diet only consent to stay abrahams cries mrs darlington and you shall do as you please well sir the point was at last settled in this manner i bought the things you see at second hand mrs darlington would take no refusal as to the compliment of my board and she was pleased to increase my my stipend so as to make my income comfortable one good turn deserves another i have now made myself as necessary to her as her estate indeed i have raised the value of her estate some hundreds a year since sir robert darlingtons death sir robert you must know was an easy man and let his lands always at the same rent so that his tenants got a great deal too fat nay one of them had the impudence to keep a couple of better hunters than any in his landlords stable and the daughters tossed up their noses in such a saucy manner that they fainted at the sight of a dairy and set their caps forsooth at a fortune but i soon brought their fine hunters to a plain honest carthorse made them earn their bread like father adam and turned the furbelows and flounces of the forward young misses into their decent housewisely apparel  aye and put a round sum into mrs darlingtons pocket into the bargain  this was acting the man of spirit said i mr abrahams it was answered abrahams i believe acting at one and the same time the politician the landlord and the steward and between you and i if sir robert had held it out much longer there is never a mothers son nor daughter upon the grounds belonging to darlington lodge would have been worth this  meaning the ashes of his pipe which he was then gently knocked against the bars of the grate but pray sir drink i believe you will find that pointing to the bowl pretty tolerable stuff i now drank for the first time for this worthy steward had so puzzled me by his enigmatic conversation and spoke in so extraordinary a manner that he saved his liquor by his singularity he had now talked almost half an hour for he was very deliberate in his articulation and i could not well make either one thing or another of him  he was altogether the oddest character which had ever yet come within my knowledge i was sometimes apt to suppose by his air of austerity that he was a much greater man in point of distinction than he pretended to be but there was something of superciliousness in his manners which was strangely disgusting i put together such parts of his conduct as amazed me the confession he made of having lent a man money upon a diamond ring his saluting a man with the greatest cordiality whom in the very next moment he called as arrant a rascal as any in the three kingdoms his never having set his foot within a church  his siddlestick of faith his anxiousness about the lost buckle  his squabble with the silversmith  his treatment of the poor female seavenger  his anger at the misfortune of his nephew  his meanness about the fare of the coachman with several other circumstances caught up in the course of his last conversation rendered his conduct so truly mystical that i could much sooner have solved any mathematical difficulty than have unfolded the riddle that disguised the character of mr jonathan abrahams  the conundrum was made still more intricate when to the strange matters above were added his more favorable parts of behavior such for instance as his gratitude for the tristing present of the buckles  his modest simile of the nutshell  his love of independence  his veneration for keepsakes  his integrity to the widow darlington whose estate he had improved his changing runninghorses to carthorses and his reducing the flyaway farmers daughters to a proper sense of their condition the only probable way for a person who is in doubt whether to pronounce a thing good or bad an equal mixture of both or neither absolutely one or the other is to follow the example of every honest trader and holding the scales with an even hand fairly weigh one property against another and this custom however simple would if practiced in the world save i conceive much scurrility and mistake for many characters at first sight seeming to want weight are upon trial found no way deficient and it may possibly happen that the scale of indiscretions heavy as they may look will kick the beam while the scale of virtues supposed wanting shall very honorably preponderate  as mr abrahams was summoned out upon some occasion or another just as he had brought his discourse and pipe to a conclusion i had leisure to weigh him as i thought proper and therefore fairly placing what made for him on the one hand with what made against him on the other the equipoise was very decently maintained the wrong scale trembled indeed somewhat at first toward the center but in the end by making all possible grains of allowance he appeared at least to be a mighty good meaning sort of a prudent painstaking man his errors chiefly those of affectation and habit and his virtues highly suitable to the steward of a rich widow who was too much a woman of fashion to look into her own affairs as soon therefore as i took mr jonathan out of the scales i made a memorandum of the labels to hang round the necks of his bottles  chap lxiv jonathan now reentered in more bustle than usual followed by a person to whom he quickly turned about and spoke as follows aye aye nabal too many eggs in one basket the more haste the worse speed  too much of one thing is good for nothing lent festina he stumbles that goes fast and so there is two hundred and fifty gone at a slap again well well nabal never mind that we can but be ruined we can but be ruined here he shook his perriwig by the foretop while the powder flew about the room and bespread the face of nabal who still maintained his station behind notwithstanding jonathans attempt to face him  a damned sprash indeed cries nabal wiping his face but the man is gone the world over run away too the rascal hey answered jonathan to the devil said nabal what is the matter gentlemen said i i hope no misfortune sir replied abrahams i have lost two hundred and fifty pounds for doing a generous action that is hard indeed said i and what is worse cries the steward it was done with another mans proney poor benjamins whole fortune i can assure you well nabal we must make the best of it run your eye over the daily and the gazetteer and call again in the morning nabal nodded his head and disappeared while abrahams sat down in his chair begged my pardon for the disorder into which this unlucky stroke had thrown him and muttered between his teeth the words villain caitiff and scoundrel with great fervor  i pressed to know the cause of this calamity  sir said the steward shaking me by the hand i wish with all my soul that my heart was made of adamant i wish i had no more commiseration than this poker a rascal came to me sometime ago with a pitiful face whom i knew from a baby and thought god help me as honest as myself he would have shut up shop  a sugarbaker sir  in four hours if i had not kept him going  well sir he wanted two hundred and fifty pieces  i had no money at home having just then made a purchase mrs darlington was pretty deep in the repairway and i could not command a shilling without breach of trust what was to be done  oliver said i to the man you must even make a break of it but he threw his tears upon me knowing what a fool of a heart i had and indeed melted me down to such an ignoramus that i touched upon poor bens property which was left him last year by his godfather and put the boys whole fortune into the hands of this oliver who gave me as i hoped to be saved nothing but a couple of crazy buildings in the worst part of the city and his bond for security the cottages may tumble down or be burnt up tonight and he may die tomorrow then what is his bond good for but now behold you the villain has shipped himself off for the devils arse a peak the lord of heaven knows where and i may go whistle for my money but the longer a man lives the more he knows if i was to live to the age of methusalem i would never do another friendly thing to man woman or child he has cured me of that you may deceive a man once and it is not his fault deceive him again and he ought to be crucified a burnt child dreads the fire for olivers sake i will forswear friendship i will i will i will  in uttering this harangue jonathan heated as he went and like a wheel in violent motion became at last so intensely hot that at the close of the speech he actually fired and while he emphatically repeated the words i will there was as much horror in his look fury in his eyes blood in his face and froth at his mouth as ever exhibited themselves in the countenance of a dog in the arid month of july expiring under the agonies of canine distraction i exhorted him to be pacified and bade him exert his fortitude a fig for fortitude sir i will burn his buildings and throw his bond into the middle of the blaze and if the hand which signed it was there into the bargain i would not pull it out with a pair of tongs i can bear any thing but ingratitude it is not the money but the man sir i would have pawned my salvation on this fellows honesty i dont think he ever behaved like a scoundrel before  then surely mr abrahams said i he deserves a  a  he deserves a halter replied the steward tut tut never tell me once a scoundrel and always a scoundrel by the same rule then mr abrahams said i once an honest man and always an honest man no such thing exclaimed jonathan almost delirious and quite hoarse  no such thing i have known a fellow pay away money one day and steal it another sir youre a young gentleman and i am only an old fool of sixtyeight who has given away my poor dear bens property to a rascal  my poor ben whom i love better than my eyes upon this the tears came actually into the old mans eyes while sympathy brought drops of the same sort into mine by way i suppose of keeping him company and i was at loss whether most to pity or despise him  i was just going to say something inspired by my too tender heart when a gentle tap at the door prevented me jonathan sternly bid the person come in and benjamin himself as pale as his shirt made his appearance the poor lad knowing the infirmity of his uncle and hearing his voice violently exerted as his chamber was immediately over the office came limping down stairs as the kick he received in the knee from the chandler was still retarding his recovery and was in hopes of administering some assistance to the steward as soon therefore as he entered he forgot his lameness and ran to beg his uncle for gods sake not to bring the gout into his stomach which he knew must be the case if he continued to give way to passion bidding him remember how bad he was last winter was twelvemonth and said he had rather die himself than bury his dear dear uncle that brought him up gave him schooling paid for the very shirt he had upon his back and had moreover put out his little fortune which was to set him up by and by to the best advantage  the former part of this affectionate speech softened the rugged nature and settled the rigid muscles of this strange compound and operated like a charm such and so rapid are the transitions and so instantly do different passions take possession of us but at the conclusion when benjamin mentioned the circumstance of his uncles great goodness in placing out his legacy to the best advantage he was so smote by the secret and bitter satire of such undeserved praise that he positively seized his own throat in mere detestation of himself and gave his forehead two or three hearty slaps as much as to signify that he was striking a numskull then softening again he threw his arms over benjamins neck and thus they remained for several minutes clinging together a stroke of nature and the pathetic has more charms far me than the gold of ophir  the scene before me could be painted only by the power that can silence the roaring of the sea and subdue the ferocity of the panther  i beheld the lover of money and the slave of passion melting into the tender charities of the relation i yielded to the occasion and however indiscreet indulged my temper the instruments of writing were in the room and while the uncle and nephew were locked in embraces i wrote a few words upon a slip of paper laid it upon the table and hurried out of the apartment  i had just got into the sitting room when a knocking at the streetdoor announced the return of my cousins  chap lxv readers there are i know of so critical and inquisitive a temper that every point must be cleared up as they go on or else the poor author is directly accused of inconsistency as it is my hearty wish should i come into print to satisfy all perusers and purchasers of whatsoever denomination i shall now settle some matter which might otherwise sit a little hard upon a critical stomach and first as to circumstances of time and place  it may seem a little odd that mr benjamin should have so rustic an air about him seeing that he was resident in a very fashionable family attended his ladies in st jamess park and had the pattern of so londonlooking a character as mr abrahams before him be it known therefore that till within these few months benjamin lived as a sort of upper servant at the country seat which bore the name of darlington lodge where this young lad was instructed in the office of surveying by a country schoolmaster who with the exciseman two or three farmers the landlord of the three blue bells and the rest of mrs darlingtons domestics with a few cottagers made the inhabitants of the whole village and he was now in town at the earnest desire of mrs darlington herself  whether this desire proceeded originally and entirely from her is a point no way incumbent upon me to meddle with at present certain however it is that the youth limself had no sort of objection to it for mr christopher dennis the father of his friend nancy formerly lived and manufactured the mild ale at the three blue balls aforesaid but on a recommendation from the squire of the next village he was now promoted to manufacture malt and hops at a capital brewery in the borough of london and there as the reader has seen resided with him nancy dennis the friend of mr benjamin  now some may think that the pride of the steward would have prevented him from suffering his nephew to remain as a servant though a favorite servant some may be surprised that mrs darlington did not discover the affection of her niece for this young fellow through all the affectation of disguises while others may express their wonder that after having made so many wise resolutions i should do so rash an action as that mentioned in the close of the last chapter for i will not attribute to any of my readers so little sagacity as not to suppose they all understand that upon the slip of paper left upon the stewards table was written a draught upon my agent with whom the reader will be presently acquainted for the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds  now to defend either this point or any others so as to labor at ex plaining away their blame or error i never shall pretend this history is not designed to be the stage for those imaginary gods and goddesses to act on who never said or did an ill thing but the matters herein related are neither more or less than some scenes representing and delineating mere human lise where characters and actions are displayed with all their beauties and blemishes as blended in the constitution by nature and brought out by occasion as far therefore as it is necessary for me to clear up circumstances which have reference to the rules of composition so far will i study to ease the mind of the reader but no farther should he therefore say to himself this is strange that is odd this is foolish and that is absurd i can only answer once for all that i am nevertheless an impartial biographer and it would be very hard if it were expected i should not only describe strangeness and oddity folly and absurdity but answer for it too no my dear reader this burden i totally shift from my shoulders i tell you faithfully what has happened and discover to you not only incidents but the persons of the drama be it thy business to account for and to analize to censure and to condemn  indeed i shall not i fear be able to clear up my own conduct to all readers and notwithstanding all which has been done many will call me a fool many a madman and more will wonder i am not now dying rather in a ditch than in a forest possibly however some may pity and some may weep there are it is presumed certain passages in these adventures levelled particularly at people of feeling such characters will happily bestow some tears to my misfortunes and if they do  let them not hastily wipe them from the cheek because they can never look ungraceful  thus much then has been said that the reader may not expect more than is intended and now having entered a caveat against all misapprehensions and written a chapter for this explanatory purpose i cordially invite the readers company and attention again to what i shall without any farther ceremony set before him   chap lxvi alicia took hold of my hand like a goodnatured lively cozen at her return and after she had asked how the poor fellows knee above stairs did told me that she had found out a companion for me and that he would breakfast with me in the morning she then was about to withdraw to her dressing room to pull off her finery and enjoy the comforts of an undress comforts which are none of the least for surely nothing can be more disagreeable than to sit in ones own house after the fatigues of visiting under a load of nonsensical ornaments and superfluous decoration with hoops spreading out their formidable immensity silks endangering of a soil pendents dangling at the ear and ruffles bandaging up the elbow to lay aside these therefore till fancy summoned them again from ehe drawer alicia had now opened the parlourdoor from which she beheld something that changed her whole behavior in a moment and though she was humming an italian air the moment before uttely altered her tune this something was mr benjamin who was then hopping across the room into which the parlourdoor opened under his crutch in his way from his uncles office to his chamber for the poor lads knee was still very painful and the apothecary strongly enjoined rest to prevent as he said an imposthumation and all vicious propensity to humors  the handle of the door was still in alicias hand and being rather loose it rattled as she trembled i was close to her on the other side but yet no artifice could possibly conceal her agitation benjamin bowed as well as his lameness permitted him and passed on luckily however for the lady mrs darlington went immediately from her carriage to her dressing room where she still remained when she had somewhat collected herself she looked me full in the face without speaking a word then lifting up her hands and eyes she cried out oh god oh god what a fool i am and how ridiculous do i make myself then hurrying away she hid her face and tottered up into her chamber  the passion of alicia had now fairly conspired with opportunity to betray her and the exact situation of her mind became too palpable to be mistaken nor was it possible to know the temper without pitying the passion for she was a girl of a very ambitious disposition had the loftiest notions of rank and heartily hated herself for entertaining any tender sentiments toward an object so much beneath her  such indeed was her pride or prudence that though vulgarly speaking she doated on benjamin to distraction that very benjamin never once suspected it and contrary to the general custom of young ladies in love she had no confidante or secretkeeper of her own sex  in the house i mean  to whom she imparted her slame  she never told her love but let concealment like a worm of the bud feed on her damask cheek to this guarded conduct perhaps it was that mrs darlington herself did not suspect the attachment or if she did suspect it she possibly trusted to her nieces superior ideas and love of splendor which she imagined would save her from any indiscretion there is however no opposing this strange passion against another the war is unequal and if intrieacy and entanglement takes place among the troops of love the enemy is generally worsted ambition itself is put to flight and the tender tyrant takes the field it plainly appeared from this and many other instances that micia was resolved either to die or conquer but alas with all her vivacity pride disdain and haughty determinations some decisive cirsances took place soon after this which humbled her spirit and reduc the sultaness to the slave but for a recapitulation of these matters intereseing as they are the reader must have philosophy enough to wait or the skip over some pages which it is hoped are not unworthy his perusal  i must not omit here to mention a piece of literary policy in not prefixing to each of my chapters an abridgment of the matter therein contained in imitation of several great writers for besides that i take this sort of anticipation to be the way to forestal the market it leaves little for the reader on which to exercise his imagination the charm of surprise is totally taken off he knows in five lines what is to be talked over again in as many leaves and it would be his cheapest way to buy only the table of contents which is at least the cream of the jest and the mere milk may go to the cat if it will  alicia was one day reading a new romance to a circle of ladies who were working round the fire at their needle the author informed them only that he begun with chapter the first and courteously desired they would courteously read on to chapter the last lord said one of the ladies what a provoking man this is we must go quite through the book without kuowing what it is upon in the middle of the first volume the heroine as is usual was desperately and as is usual unhappily in love read away my dear alicia cries a sprightly lass i wonder to my soul what is next a few chapters more threw the heroine into such a critical situation that the fair reader and her audience quite raved with impatience one of them caught the book and began to read at the last chapter of the first volume another wanted much to see how it ended this however would not do they found the author talking of quite a different subject and were vexed with themselves to think that while they were wasting time in turning over the pages to no purpose they might have come to the crisis of the story they were upon and got half way into another this reflection gave them fresh spirits alicia began where she left off the history improved in its progress sometimes they left working to laugh and sometimes to cry and when they arrived at the last chapter like a man who had taken a delightful but too short a ride through a pleasant and various country they lamented that it was done and could wish to go over the ground again  for these reasons have i avoided the bill of fare which specifies not only every dish but what every dish contains i will make the banquet as pleasant as possible but the reader must not spoil his dinner by a taste before it is ready but eat a hearty meal and take a slice of every thing at table which i hope he may be able to do without palling his appetite let alicia and her passion therefore amuse themselves together till it is proper to bring them again upon the scene at present they make their exit to introduce what is generally welcome a new acquaintance  chap xlvii we were scarce seated at breakfast when the footman brought in the name of mr draper and in five seconds afterward mr draper made his appearance and as mirthinspiring a person he had as ever was exhibited he looked about thirty his features were constantly on the smile he was inclined to no more than an agreeable corpulency his eyes were brisk and blue his complexion fair almost to freckles and effeminacy and his forehead without a wrinkle indeed there was no symptom either of care or caution sorrow or suffering about his character the easiness of his manner however the vivacity of his remark and the complacence of his whole carriage were so extremely adapted to the moments which are devoted to china and chatter that he was surely born to be a necessary appendage to the teatable  a cup of him once a day might be pleasing enough but i supposed that if he was to be taken for a constancy he would have a tendency like the tea itself to create the spleen demolish the nerves and promote the vapors he was in short all laugh loll and liberty and i set him down before he laid his spoon across the cup as a mere petitmaitre in which conclusion i was full as near the truth as people generally are who led away by the glance are too giddy or too proud to imagine they may be mistaken  perhaps there are a great many cases where it is quite wrong to believes ones own eyes at least he whosupposes he can develope the human character at a single view will have many a mortifying instance to question his sagacity and often commit blunders beneath the penetration of a puppy mr draper was more agreeable than the sugar and there was really so much cream in his conversation that our mornings repast was unusually social even alicia seemed for a while to forget her benjamin mrs darlington smiled at as much as she could hear and i perfectly charmed into silence considered mr draper as the most entertaining young man in the whole world yes said i to myself softly this is the very acquaintance i wanted what a fortunate introduction  how easy he sits in his chair what breeding in his step what polite pliability in his bow  what a flow of words and what pleasantry in his ideas i suppose now he is the most polished character of his age but i am afraid i make but a so so sort of figure beside him some how or another my hands are in my way i scarce know what to do with my legs i cannot conceive how i got this nasty trick of playing with my buttons and what the deuce can make me feel easier alone or with benjamin than with such a genteel circle as this before me  yet why do i indulge these thoughts rome was not built in a day and i dare say it takes some time to make a man a gentleman the hour may yet come when i may be as easy and affable as mr draper  mr draper was entering into a spirited burlesque on the insipidity of visiting parties and playing with his watchchain with as much carelessness as if he had got the whole conversation by rote while i entered into this soliloquy during which i fixed my eyes directly on the teaboard in the room this fit of cogitation was soon invaded by a smart tap on the shoulder from mr draper who putting up my reflections to auction became himself the first bidder and offered a penny for my thoughts then came on the subject of my dress which by the bye i had not altered but draper said he would walk with me to his tailor in the course of the excursion he had in store for me not cries he that i would have you suppose i am bigoted to frippery even though you now see me so apefied but the ridicule of fools is ten times keener than the cut of a razor if custom bids a man be a monkey he must even adopt the character sir and i would either dress or strip rather than be the topic of a moments titter to any man breathing to laugh is exquisite but to be the subject of laughter is to me the agony of the damned for these reasons therefore my dear lad adopt the absurdity of the times though it should command you to wear a doublet of gauze in the winter and a jerkin of flannel in the dog days what say you benignus shall we move it is too early for the ladies and we may enjoy many a delicious joke as we go on  as my cold was much mended and i admired mr draper even more than sugar candy and as i had besides an eager curiosity to see and know more of his character i readily embraced his offer and making our adieus to the ladies we walked out of the room like old acquaintances arm in arm together  end of volume the third
