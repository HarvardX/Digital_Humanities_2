poems upon various occasions  written for the entertainment of the author and printed for the amusement of a few friends prejudiced in his favor  by william shenstone gent   spes and fortuna valete oxford printed by leon lichfield near eastgate       prefatory dedication to mrs  dedications madam ought in policy to be addressed to the most powerful and in justice to the most deserving these i think i have united by applying to you in this manner who have gained the former of these advantages by means of the latter accomplishments like yours give the most absolute authority of any i mean that over the judgments as well as hearts of mankind  i intended here madam after the manner of other wellmeaning dedicators to have given some sketches of your character not so much from the ostentation of my art in describing as of the peculiar diligence i have used in observing it an indifferent painter may trace some features of his sovreigns face whose loyalty has rendered him accurate in studying the original  besides twere hard a lady of your perfections should be the only one exempted from the pleasure of being acquainted with em it is true you have a quick eye and penetrating judgment in distinguishing both natural and moral beauties but you must inevitably remain a stranger to the greatest were it not for the assistance of those important utensils a poet and a lookingglass  twere dangerous indeed you might suffer by any representation i am capable of but twas not incapacity alone discouraged me there is something in your character vastly disadvantageous to any that attempts it to proclaim you possessed of every imaginable good quality would be saying it was day when the sun shines in its meridian as for your faults if you have any they indeed are far enough from being liable to the former exception but the extreme difficulty i should have found in selecting a few minute ones and some i must have selected if possible as the shades of my piece together with the small share of credit i should have gained in the world disheartend me such indeed were my only objections unless i may adjoin this that to strangers your real and genuine character must have passed for flattery i say to strangers for where you are known you must be acknowledged incapable of it as the suns brightness can be set off by no allusion hence in short i laid aside all thoughts of a portraiture those that would love you as you deserve must know you as necessarily as those who know you must consequently love you  as to the poetry i beg leave to declare that it is the product of a young genius little exercised in versification and the muses you know madam are not like a great many of their sex that have the most esteem for those who neglect them though they have had sometimes in appearance horace and swift whom to you i would choose to mention have attended them whole mornings at their toilette that they might conduct them into the world in a more agreeable undress but my negligences madam are of such a nature that i must beg you would impute them to disuse and inexperience however by this confession i may probably put you in mind of a lady who having thrumd over a spinnet for a considerable space without the least show of harmony took much pains to prove she had never played before it is with an author much the same as with a sportsman hippolitus may excuse his illsuccess to himself and perhaps justly allege several alleviating circumstances but in vain may he attempt his vindication to the world that has been so frequently deluded by these apologies that it has made it a rule to fix the fault upon the marksman  i indeed ever despaired of affording much entertainment this way to a lady of your refined taste and i am positive that indolence has with me proved and always will do more than a balance to any other ambition this is my only encouragement that as one almost insensibly conforms to a taste one very much admires i cannot but think these trifles will not prove absolutely disagreeable to yours  you will perhaps find other names in these pages than that which includes all that is agreeable and is indeed the most comprehensive word that is i mean your own but as there is some thing mean in an aversion to the praises of another or a continual apprehension of being rivaled which i take to be it is original i am secure of giving you no uneasiness especially since a lady of your merit may give all others infinitely more than their due without the least shadow of danger  i ask pardon for the pedantry of latin mottoes and quotations but you may easily dispense with the loss of them whether you consider them merely as a compliance with custom or as certain scraps of antiquity to indemnify the poet with those critics who approve only what is ancient as there are some who fix a tutelary piece of iron on their thresholds to elude the fury of illdesigning spirits  next to the happiness of being possessed of merit is to show ones approbation of those who are and this is really no small addition to a mans character so that should these papers appear ever so ridiculous i shall value them on one account and should their fame prove equal to mr popes i should value them on none so much as that which is that they enable me to declare openly how much i am  madam your most obedient humble servant pembroke college oxford april   th      poems upon various occasions the speeches of sloth and virtue upon the plan of xenophons judgment of hercules sloth hither dear boy direct thy wandering eyes it is here the lovely vale of pleasure lies debate no more  to me thy self resign her mossy caves her groves and all are mine for me the goddess opes her various power springs in a tree or blossoms in a flower to please my ear she breaths celestial strains to please my eye with lillies strews the plains to form my couch in mossy beds she grows to gratify my smell she blooms a rose often in some nymph the deity i find where in one form the various sweets are joined yield but to me  a choir of nymphs shall rise and with the blooming sight regale thy eyes their beauteous cheeks a fairer rose shall wear a brighter lilly in their necks appear thou on their breasts thy wearied head recline nor at the swans less pleasing nest repine whilst philomel in each soft voice complains and gently lulls thee with her dying strains whilst spicy gums round each fair bosom glow and in each accent myrrhy odours flow for thee with softest art the dome shall rise and spiring turrets glitter through the skies for thee the robe shall glow with purple rays the sideboard sparkle and gilt chariot blaze in brilliant mines be other hands employed so the gay product be by thine enjoyed for thee the poplar shall her amber drain for thee in clouded beauty spring the cane to please thy taste shall gallia prune the vine to swell thy treasures india sink the mine for thee each nations nicer stores shall grow and every wind some lovely tribute blow learning shall never molest thy tranquil reign nor science puzzle thy inactive brain sometimes perhaps thy fancy take her wing to grace a fan or celebrate a ring fix various dies to suit each varying mien prescribe where patches should in crowds be seen or sigh soft strains along the vocal grove and tell the charms the sweet effects of love or if more specious ease thy care should claim and thy breast glow with faint desire of fame some trivial science shall thy thoughts amuse and learnings name a solemn sound diffuse to thee all natures shelly store i will bring to thee the sparklings on the insects wing pleasure in infant forms shall thou descry view in an ant or hear her in a fly when near thy path as often as spring appears the sportive goddess buzzes round thy ears now in some pebbles curious vein is seen or on some leaf bestows unusual green then sleep shall wrap thee in her downy arms and round thy wearied head diffuse her charms lest growing pride thy peaceful schemes oerthrow and thought succeed  my most destructive foe the watery nymphs shall tune the tinkling vales and gentle zephyrs harmonize their gales for thy repose instruct with rival joy their streams to murmur and their winds to sigh thus shall thou spend the sweetly flowing day till lost in bliss thou breath thy soul away how easy a transition should thou find were to thy fate annihilation joined  virtue fly fly fond youth the too indulgent maid nor err by such fantastic scenes betrayed though in my path the prickly thorn be seen and the waste turf produce a fainter green though no gay rose or purple product shine the rugged surface still conceals the mine and each unsightly object can supply more lasting pleasure more substantial joy but should those airy glittring toys allure yet whence could sloth the mighty boon procure or whence receive or how those gifts bestow which i alone possess  her greatest foe i from old ocean rob the treasured store and hidden gems through every realm explore twas i the rugged brilliant first revealed by tenfold strata in the earth concealed it is i the shapeless surface still refine and teach the rugged brilliant how to shine where blooms the rose where spires the shapely tree where smiles the grape without fair industry but grant we sloth the scene herself has drawn the mossy grotto and the flowery lawn let frankincense with every wind exhale and philomela breath in every gale let brilliants sparkle dear machines of pride and from the poplar flow the amber tide let gay pomona quitting all around for choicest fruits select the hallowed ground to tread the favored soil should virtue cease nor mossy grotts nor flowery lawns could please nor ought pomonas luscious gifts avail the sound harmonious or the spicy gale see thou those rocks in dreadful pomp arise and barren cliffs that sweep the vaulted skies those fields whence phoebus all their moisture drains and too profusely kind disrobes the plains when i vouchsafe to tread the lonely soil those rocks seem lovely and those deserts smile often on those pathless wilds as i appear with converse sweet his lonely steps to cheer those cliffs the exile has with pleasure viewed and called that desert blissful solitude known by its airy height and towering spires behind that scene fames lofty dome retires steep the ascent by which to fame we rise yet equal to the labor is the prize from thence you gain an earthly crown from thence  you reach the skies far far below the downy throne is seen that lulls to rest ignavias softer queen thence to fames turrets often she lifts her eyes desirous still still impotent to rise often when resolved to gain those shining towers the pensive queen the dire ascent explores comes onward wafted by the gummy trees some sylvan music or some scented breeze she turns her head her own gay realm she spies and all the airy resolution dies thus still in vain these gilded visions please the wretch of glory whilst the slave of ease doomed ever in ignoble state to pine boast her own scenes and languish after mine  love and music shall love alone for ever claim an universal right to fame an undisputed sway or has not music equal charms to fill the breast with strange alarms and make the world obey the thracian bard as poets tell could mitigate the powers of hell even plutos nicer ear his arts no more than loves we find to deities or men confined drew brutes in crowds to hear whatever favorite passion reigned the poet still his right maintained over all that ranged the plain the siercer tyrants could assuage or fire the timorous into rage whenever he changed the strain in milder lays the bard began soft notes through every finger ran and echoing charmed the place see fawning lions gaze around and taught to quit their savage sound assume a gentler grace when cymon viewed the fair ones charms her ruby lips and snowy arms and told her beauties over when love reformed his awkard tone and made each clownish gesture known it showed but equal power the bard now tries a sprightlier sound when all the feathered race around perceive the varied strains the soaring lark the note pursues the timorous dove around him cooes and philomel complains an equal power of love i have seen incite the deer to scour the green and chase his barking foe sometimes has love with greater might to challenge  nay  sometimes  to fight provoked the enamored beau when silvia treads the smiling plain how glows the heart of every swain by pleasing tumults tossed when handels solemn accents roll each breast is fired each raptured soul in sweet confusion lost if she her melting glances dart or he his dying airs impart our spirits sink away enough enough dear nymph give over and thou great artist urge no more thy unresisted sway thus love or sound affects the mind but when their various powers are joined fly daring mortal fly for when selindas charms appear and i her tuneful accents hear  i burn i faint i die colemira a culinary eclogue nec tantum veners quantum studiosa culinae nights sable clouds had half the globe overspread and silence reigned and folks were gone to bed when love which gentle sleep can never inspire had seated damon by the kitchen fire pensive he lay extended on the ground the little lares kept their vigils round the fawning cats compassionate his case and purr around and gently lick his face to all his plaints the sleeping curs reply and with hoarse snorings imitate a sigh such gloomy scenes with lovers minds agree and solitude to them is best society could i he cried express how bright a grace adorns thy morning hands and wellwashd face thou would colemira grant what i implore and yield me love or wash thy face no more ah who can see and seeing not admire whenever she sets the pot upon the fire her hands outshine the fire and redder things her eyes are blacker than the pot she brings but sure no chamberdamsel can compare when in meridian luster shines my fair when warmed with dinners toil in pearly rills adown her goodly cheek the sweat distills oh how i long how ardently desire to view those rosy fingers strike the lyre for late when bees to change their climes began how did i see em thrum the drying pan with her i should not envy g his queen though she in royal grandeur decked be seen whilst rags just severed from my fairones gown in russet pomp and greasy pride hang down ah how it does my drooping heart rejoice when in the hall i hear thy mellow voice how would that voice exceed the villagebell would thou but sing  i like thee passing well when from the hearth she bade the pointers go how soft how easy did her accents slow  get out she cried when strangers come to sup  one never can raise those snoring devils up then full of wrath she kicked each lazy brute alas i envied even that salute twas sure misplaced  shock said or seemed to say he had as lief i had the kick as they if she the mystic bellows take in hand who like the fair can that machine command o may thou never by eolus be seen for he would sure demand thee for his queen but should the flame this rougher aid refuse and only gentler medicines be of use with fullblown cheeks she ends the doubtful strife foments the infant flame and puffs it into life such arts as these exalt the drooping fire but in my breast a fiercer flame inspire i burn i burn o give thy pussing over and swell thy cheeks and pout thy lips no more with all her haughty looks the time i have seen when this proud damsel has more humble been when with nice airs she hoist the pancake round and dropped it hapless fair upon the ground look with what charming grace what winning tricks the artful charmer rubs the candlesticks so bright she makes the candlesticks she handles often have i said  there were no need of candles but thou my fair who never would approve or hear the tender story of my love or mind how burns my raging breast  a button  perhaps are dreaming of  a breast of mutton thus said and wept the sad desponding swain revealing to the sable walls his pain but nymphs are free with those they should deny to those they love more exquisitely coy now chirping crickets raise their tinkling voice the lambent flames in languid streams arise and smoke in azure folds evaporates and dies comparison it is by comparison we know on every object to bestow its proper share of praise did each a like perfection bear what beauty though divinely fair could admiration raise amidst the lucid bands of night see hesperus serenely bright adorns the distant skies but languishes amidst the blaze of sprightly sols meridian rays  or silvias brighter eyes whenever the nightingale complains i like the melancholy strains and praise the tuneful bird but vainly might she strain her throat vainly exalt each swelling note should silvias voice be heard when on the vilets purple bed supine i rest my weary head the fragrant pillow charms yet soon such languid bliss i would fly would silvia but the loss supply and take me to her arms the alabasters wondrous white the marbles polish strikes my sight when silvia is not seen but ah how faint that white is grown how rough

blood and hills of slain that flames should ravage where the sword should spare nor age nor sex redeem the young or fair the babe should stain with harmless blood the sands torn from the mothers breastand trembling hands not the soft maid his hardened breast should move too sierce for pity as too rude for love yet could our god his boasted power disarm give manly fury to a female arm not sanguine youth nor tall gigantick might felled the dire tyrant in a dubious fight throughout his camp no hostile fires there flew no poison raged nor missive javelin flew twas loves soft flame and who could love control twas beautys darts oercame his yielding soul twas judiths face  she left her gloomy veil while envious custom would her charms conceal her sparkling eyes with tears familiar grown she gayly taught an office long unknown cheerful she laid her sable weeds aside and though she shone she shone for israels pride she bade her robe wave wanton with the wind within the purple tire her locks confined enslaved the tyrant with the circling toy and taught the silken texture to destroy her wellplacd gems his faultring soul oerthrew her charms disarmed him and her faulchion slew the desperate scene of death her hands displayed lost in amaze the persian chiefs surveyed chilled with cold fear the softer mede beheld yet owned her courage as her charms excelled from either camp shrill clamours pierced the sky the shrieks of sorrow and the shouts of joy here the gay sounds of mirthfulbands were known there the wild horrors of an host over thrown stretched on the plain the slaughtered victims lie who impious dared jehovahs aid defy twas he alone their haughty rage could quell by him the victors fought the vanquished fell they fought by him with every power endud force when they struck and speed when they pursued his praises let me sing whose might divine no power can limit and no tongue define be he by age adored adored by youth whose works are wonders and whose words are truth he spoke  the dust an human form received he breathed  that human form respird and lived who shall great god thy sovereign will restrain man dust or nothing as thy words ordain though earths foundations at thy sight give place though deepfixd mountains skip before thy face quick at thy breath though slinty rocks decay and flow like wax in liquid folds away yet gentle mercy to thy people shown endears thy sway and gilds thy awful throne and on the pious suppliant pleased to shine protects him fearless midst a power like thine what though with gums our altars smoke in vain the fumes of incense and the fat of slain though worships pomp thou can regardless see and earths rich fragrance breaths nosweets to thee bliss still succeeds when righteous hands revere the mind untainted and the heart sincere peace to all such but who with impious arms against thy israel raise unjust alarms shall feel thy angel with unpitying hand scatter disease and tortures through the land nor ever returning peace their spirits cheer raise the sad heart or stay the falling tear the teatable when last i saw the lovely maid twas near the noon of day when rising nymphs their fancy aid with scandal  and bohea the pictured urn an equal share diffused to all around o that in every court there were but half the justice found sudden the melting sweet subsides like zemblas hills of snow when from the heavens descending tides their glittering tops oerslow the curling steams around the place exhale a nice perfume and from selindas beauteous face call forth celestial bloom and could alas destructive prove a nymph so formed to please so like some newborn queen of love amidst her infant seas from bacchus sprightly cups our thoughts a careless pleasure share ah why should cythereas draughts refine the soul to care yet thence i felt my pangs renew my bloom my life decay and like the gentle herbs i drew my spirits sink away whoever from bright selindas hand the fatal gift obtained have since exposed to her command ten thousand woes sustained sure if enchantresses there are whom tortured hearts obey such only are the blooming fair the only philtre tea inscription to the memory of a l esquire justice of the peace for this county who in the whole course of his pilgrimage through a trifling ridiculous world maintaining his proper dignity notwithstanding the scoffs of
