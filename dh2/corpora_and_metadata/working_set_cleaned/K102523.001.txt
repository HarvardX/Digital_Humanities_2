a compendious history of the british churches in england scotland ireland and america by john brown volume i  a compendious history of the church of england and of the protestant churches in ireland and america giving an account of the most material transactions since the introduction of christianity to the present time with an introductory sketch of the history of the waldenses  by john brown minister of the gospel in haddington  psalm lxviii       walk about zion  tell the towers thereof mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generations following glasgow printed by john bryce mdcclxxxiv  preface the remarkable usefulness of church history has been formerly hinted an acquaintance with that of our own and of our neighboring churches must certainly be peculiarly necessary to instruct us concerning the many divine favors received and the many sins ungratefully committed in our land in this abridgement i have attempted to exhibit the principal substance of many large volumes in the english history my materials have been extracted from fox fuller burnet strype and sometimes from collier but chiefly from warner neal calamy bennet and pierce  in the scotch knox calderwood bailie brown shields burnet wodrow crookshanks de foe stevenson kirktons mss acts of parliaments and assemblies and even spotswood and guthrie etc have been my conductors i have aimed at impartiality in my narrations but dare not pretend that i have every where attained this rare historical excellency that i might not be tempted to impose my own inventions instead of facts i have seldom dipped into the secret springs of mens actions or made reflections on them freedoms of this kind too often render histories little better than well written romances  to complete my historical plan i once intended compiling other two volumes of the histories of the protestant churches of france switzerland holland germany hungary poland sweden and denmark to which that of the waldenses herewith published was to have been the introduction but want of access to many necessary vouchers together with the increasing infirmities of old age oblige me to drop this design  may some other more adequate to the work speedily take it up it is not perhaps to the clerical honor that so many of them labor in civil histories while that of the church of christ is so

west indies seceders in america p        0 a brief sketch of the history of the waldenses from whom all the protestant churches originated whether the inhabitants of the north parts of italy or italy proper of which milan was the capital received the gospel in the end of the first or the beginning of the second century of the christian era is uncertain during the first four centuries their doctrine worship discipline and government appear to have been much on the same footing with their neighbor churches into which a desire of conformity with the heathens and with the civil government had gradually introduced a number of lesser corruptions but from the writings of their bishops ambrose of milan philastrius and gaudentius of brescia in the  th and of ruffinus chromatius and niceas of aquileia in the  th and of laurentius of milan ennodius of pavia and others in the  th century it appears that they still held all the fundamental doctrines of the gospel which were afterward opposed by the papists they were so far from depending on the roman pontiff that in the last half of the  th and first half of the  th century they were in a state of formal separation from him and sometimes held him as an heretic nor in the writings of maurus of ravenna manfuetus of milan or the liturgy ascribed to ambrose in the  th and of paulinus of aquileia or of the less judicious paulus dioconus and his collection of the homilies of the fathers do we find the popish doctrines relative to the scriptures the merit of good works mediation of saints or worship of creatures or their images or transubstantiation of the sacramental elements established  but the contrary nay the council of frankfort in a d     made a noble stand in opposition to the worship of images and other increasing errors idolatries and superstitions of the romish church  while the christian church as angilbertus of milan mournfully laments retained almost no remains of holiness sincerity or purity god in the beginning of the  th century raised up claude bishop of turin with great learning and faithfulness to defend and illustrate the truth in opposition to the prevailing errors and corruptions of the times in his commentaries on the books of moses ruth goipel according to matthew and the epistles of paul to the galatians and ephesians and his letters to theodomir and others he boldly maintained the equality of the other apostles to peter and that mens works can in no respect merit the favor of god that no traditions ought to be admitted as grounds or parts of religion that men are saved by faith in christ alone that all churches on earth are liable to error that prayer for the dead is unprofitable that god alone and no creature whether original or image ought to be worshipped that the bread and wine in the lords supper are not turned into the real body and blood of christ but are appointed representations of them the council of paris in     as well as agobardus archbishop of lions justified claude in the most of what he said especially in his opposition to the worship of images and superstition in the tenth century the doctrines of claude were maintained by ratherius of verona not without a mixture of mistakes perhaps they were more faithfully maintained by gundulfus and his numerous followers in the eleventh century but their tenets have been miserably misrepresented by their popish adversaries as well as themselves were cruelly persecuted  notwithstanding all that the popes could do by force or flattery the archbishop of milan and the whole of his large diocese in italy properly so called continued independent of rome till about a d  0 0 about which time nicolas ii by means of his agent damian having got a party to submit labored to expel all the married clergy these and others highly offended with the persecution of berenger who maintained much the same doctrine as claude of turin had done separated themselves from all church fellowship with the roman see and its adherents notwithstanding the persecutions and calumnies they suffered these opponents of the romish corruptions exceedingly increased and spread themselves into almost all italy and france switzerland and part of germany from their living in the valleys of the alps these in piedmont savoy and places about were called vallenses or waldenses  these in the south of france were called albigenses or poor men of lions from their residence in or about albi and lions from some of their principal preachers they were called berengarians petrobrusians henricians arnoldists esperonists and josephists as in england they were called lollards  either from mere malice or by confounding them with some that were really such their adversaries called them manichees cathari etc and charged them with the grossest errors and the most abominable practices but from the concurrent testimonies of the two reyners that executed the office of inquisitors against them and of freher baronius ralphcogshall lienstein thuanus claudeseissel archbishop of turin ribera paradin the emperor frederic ii and many other papists it appears that their lives were remarkably pure and holy so that nothing but their opposition to the abominations of rome could be justly charged upon them and from their ancient manuscripts placed by moreland in the library of cambridge and others in the library of geneva particularly from their noble lesson explication of the lords prayer creed and ten commandments catechism confession of sins spiritual almanac and sermons and tracts concerning antichrist purgatory and invocation of saints all dated about a d    0 and from their confession of faith of that date compared with those of                          and      published for their own vindication in italy france or bohemia  and from the accounts of reyner pope pius ii claudeseissel thuanus and other papists as well as of the centuriators of magdeburgh it appears that their doctrine worship discipline and government were all along very like to those of the reformed churches of geneva france holland scotland etc  no doubt some of them had particular opinions but they generally maintained that the word of god is the only rule and standard of religion  that the decrees of councils and dictates of fathers are to be admitted only in so far as they agree with it that the reading and knowledge of the scripture are equally free to the laity and clergy that the scripture itself is to be read rather than the dictates of men that baptism and the lords supper are the only sacraments of the new testament church that the eucharist is to be received in both elements by the people as well as by the priests that the bread and wine used in it are but signs and symbols of christs body and blood that masses are impious to say them for the dead is downright madness that purgatory or any other middle state of departed souls is but an invention of men that the invocation of saints is idolatrous that the church of rome is the apocalyptical whore of babylon that it is a true church which hears the sincere word of christ and uses the sacraments instituted by him be where it will that the romish pope has no lawful primacy over the church or any title to both civil and ecclesiastical power that he and his bishops are the devouring plagues of the church that priests marriage is lawful and vows of celibacy an invention of men and occasion of sodomy that monkery is but a stinking carcass of devotion and its orders so many marks of the antichristian beast that dedications of churches commemorations of the dead priestly benedictions of bells mitres palls palms or other irrational creatures together with forced fastings superstitious festivals perpetual chanting of hymns and the like were invented by the devil that none but god can forgive sin and that auricular confession of it to the priests is unnecessary and ought not to be admitted instead of public satisfaction for scandals  while their regard to the scripture and learning it by heart and their uncommon holiness and in some things extreme strictness of practice sufficiently distinguished them from the papalins and recommended their principles to all around them they were spread with mavelous success by bruis and henry through most of the south of france notwithstanding all that bernard and others could do to oppose them about a d    0 a rich merchant of lions commonly called peter waldo joined himself to them procured a translation of the bible into their vulgar language and having distributed his stock among the poor he in    0 commenced a public teacher and had an amazing success in publishing the gospel of christ pope lucius iii by a sentence of excommunication consigned him and all his obstinate brethren to the devil and his angels and required all archbishops bishops princes nobles and others having authority to hunt them out and either force them back to the bosom of the church or else utterly destroy them  under pain of excommunication and confiscation of goods to themselves if they were not duly diligent not very long after ildesonsus king of arragon and frederic of germany emitted edicts bearing that if any of their subjects should attend the sermons of these heretics or afford them meat drink or lodging their goods should be confiscated and themselves punished as guilty of high treason and charging these heretics to depart out of their dominions within three days after hearing of these edicts  and encouraging all their subjects to plague and distress and despitefully use them if they did not  the waldenses still increased and imperceptibly spread through the most of europe  hungary bulgaria britain and had numerous congregations in italy france germany and spain it is said they amounted to about eight or ten hundred thousand finding their throne in danger of being shaken by their means the pontiffs had recourse to new and extraordinary methods of subduing these opposers in the south of france where the earl of toulouse and other great men protected them and where it seems the clergy had been more humane or indolent they almost filled both cities and country pope innocent ii therefore delegated reyner a cistertian monk and peter of castlenau to root out these heretics in a d   0  dominic and his companions heartily joined them by declamations and sophistical arguments or by capital punishments where words were not effectual they labored with no small assiduity and zeal and ho inconsiderable success in their converting work like missions and courts of inquisition were therefore established by his holiness in every city of europe the inhabitants of which were suspected of heresy at first these courts proceeded in much the same forms as ordinary courts of justice but encouraged by the inhuman edicts of frederic ii of germany and lewis ix of france the dominicans gradually formed their inquisitorial judicatories into such engines of injustice treachery cruelty and filthiness as might have made devils to abhor them and blush the years         0   00    0                  0          0         0      etc etc are represented as most distinguished by their infernal work but sometimes these bloody reformers were driven out and murdered by the enraged populace  some of the rules formed for these inquisitors were   that they should never dispute any point of religion before the people   that none who in any respect favored any heretic should be allowed sacramental absolution   that such as did not discover an heretic should be cut off from the church as a corrupt member   that an heretic delivered over to the secular power should never be allowed to vindicate himself before the people   that they should beware of favoring any condemned person before the people upon his retracting his heresy and promising to turn from it   the inquisitors should always suppose the facts charged as fully evident and only examine the panel on circumstances relating to them   they ought always to have a book open before them in which they may pretend the pannels whole life and a great many depositions against him are recorded   they ought constantly to threaten him with inevitable death and damnation if he do not ingenuously confess every thing and renounce his heresy   they ought never to attempt to convince him by the scriptures lest themselves should be confounded by his answers  0 they ought never to answer directly to him and ought to heap a variety of questions upon him at once in order to confound him    if he seem ready to protest that he never embraced the heresy he is charged with they ought to pretend that they have sufficient proofs of the contrary and that if he confess freely he may expect favor  while the courts of inquisition thus labored to hunt out and destroy these witnesses of christ the popes excited the civil powers to persecute them in every place  in terra nova in calabria in provence in dauphine at paris in bohemia and austria in germany in england in flanders and holland in poland in italy in dalmatia in croalia in sclavonia at constantinople in greece in livonia in sarmatia in bulgaria and in spain as perrin has particularly recorded but in france bohemia and piedmont we find them most cruelly murdered in order to extirpate them from the south of france where remund earl of toulouse remund earl of foix the viscount of beziers and others protected them pope innocent iii taking occasion from friar peters death in that country excommunicated remund of toulouse charging all archbishops and bishops to pronounce him accursed with sound of bell and extinction of candles every sabbath and festival for murdering a good servant of god he absolved all his subjects from their oaths of allegiance to him and commanded all good catholics to pursue his person and seize on his property he sent preachers through all europe to promise paradise and all other privileges granted to those that went to the holy war in the east to all such as should bear arms against the albigenses for the space of forty days some hundred thousands quickly marched to destroy them and seize on their spoil terrified by their approaches remund not only cleared himself from the murder of friar peter but delivered up all his property to the pope and submitted to a most public whipping naked and to swear to be obedient to the pope all his life and to make irreconcilable war against the albigenses etc to avoid commanding the crossed army against them he went off to rome to reconcile himself with his holiness beziers was quickly besieged and taken and about sixty thousand of its inhabitants murdered in cold blood nor could the supplications of the popish clergy and people prevent their sharing in the common ruin the military pilgrims immediately laid siege to the town of carcasson and having taken it put all the inhabitants to the sword they soon after with no inconsiderable loss took the city of carcasson but the inhabitants had slipped off through a subterraneous vault and fled to arragon catalonia and toulouse the earl of beziers being perfidiously taken died in prison and his lands were given to simon earl of montfort who was made general of the popes army assisted by the king of arragon and by the english who hated montfort the albigenses still stood their ground notwithstanding all the perfidious stratagems of the papists to destroy them the popes forces at length gave them a dreadful defeat in which and its issue they boasted that they killed about two millions of them  the council of lateran in a d      having formed some new resolutions for the utter extirpation of the albigenses another mighty army of perhaps  00000 crossed soldiers was raised under simon of montfort by which and the assistance of lewis viii and ix kings of france the albigenses after a war of about  0 years were almost utterly destroyed or driven from their country and the earl of toulouse and their other helpers were reduced to the most humiliating terms nor is it probable that less than  00000 of the pontifical butchers perished in their murdering work  multitudes of the albigenses and their brethren having fled into bohemia and austria were soon afterward reckoned about eighty thousand in these parts it does not appear that any general persecution was raised against them till about a d      when john huss and jerome of pue partly enlightened by books from england  a bold and open stand against the romish abomintions the bohemian nobles loudly complaining of he perfidious murder of these eminent ministers by the council of constance and they and their people requiring the use of the cup in the lords supper the pope excommunicated the whole nation and obtested the emperor kings princes etc by the wounds of christ and by their own salvation to take arms against and extirpate that accursed generation from the face of the earth  promising full remission of sin to every one who should kill any of them but the lord for a time made the bohemians under zisca and procopius the terror of all the armies that could be raised against them the papists nevertheless by throwing about  000 of them into deep mines and others of them into rivers and otherwise destroying them did them all the mischief they could and at length by craftily dividing them got multitudes of the poorer sort cut off  notwithstanding these murders  notwithstanding imperial edicts prohibiting these bohemian brethren that continued adhering to the truth to remain in bohemia or moravia  and notwithstanding manifold persecutions especially of their ministers they maintained their ground and had their societies exceedingly well regulated  as at the reformation they entered into a fraternal correspondence with the lutherans they shared with them in their afflictions the bohemian nation having refused to assist charles v in obliging the germans to receive the decrees of the council of trent ferdinand his brother imprisoned fined scourged banished or murdered their principal men and confiscated their estates and disarmed and disenfranchised the city of prague the capital of their country he by an edict banished all the brethren and ordered their churches to be shut up this did but stir them up to resolve to be still more faithful for god  and part of them to retire to poland in      ferdinand by another edict banished about two hundred of their ministers that were married or had received their ordination in germany  thereafter till a d      the bohemians enjoyed not a little peace and liberty under their popish sovereigns but ferdinand having forced himself into the throne contrary to the fundamental constitutions of their kingdom resolved rather to render his dominions desolate than to allow an heretic to dwell in them set himself by every possible artifice as well as bloody violence to complete the destruction of their church  in which he succeeded to his wish contrary to his coronation oath he encouraged the popish clergy and nobility to vex his other subjects on account of their religion protestants were prohibited to print any thing but what was licensed by the popish chancellor while papists had full liberty to misrepresent reproach and abuse them the burgrave who kept the crown and privileges of the kingdom was imprisoned because he had insisted for a free election of the king the protestant churches began to be gradually destroyed in      the states were prohibited to hold their usual meetings for consultation their election of frederic elector palatine for their king did but enrage ferdinand who was now chosen to be emperor and raising an army by a bloody war soon reduced them to their wonted or rather worse subjection by plundering noblemens houses  by extorting free quarters and money from the subjects  by decoying nobles corporations ministers and others to lend their money  by causing the cities which belonged to protestants to maintain his standing army  by raising gold and silver to a tensold price in order to pay the protestants and then suddenly diminishing its value as much  by ordering creditors to lose all that they had lent during the rebellion as he called it  he first in order reduced his protestant subjects to extreme poverty  next commissioners of reformation were appointed in every town and illage who labored to disgrace the protestant religion and extol the popish  the most eminent men were invited to apostasy and others decoyed by their example or compelled to it  an high court of reformers was erected from which there was no appeal  such ministers as apostatized were highly favored and promoted while such as steadfastly adhered to their principles were barbarously abused by the soldiers or banished or murdered and their places filled with illiterate persons apostates or jesuits their congregations were charged to assist in persecuting them and threatened with death if they harbored or concealed them about fifty of the principal protestant noblemen were condemned and executed and underwent their martyrdom in a most christian manner whatever belonged to them or other protestants was confiscated or given to the soldiers and other papists  ferdinand called for all the ancient charters of the kingdom and destroyed them  protestant tutors for children were absolutely prohibited all protestants were declared outlaws and commanded to leave the kingdom unless they resolved to become catholics within six months protestants children were ordered to be taken from them and committed to monks or other papists for instruction and protestant wives were banished from their husbands many of the ancient laws securing the liberties of the subjects were repealed and the free cities were impoverished by taxes and contributions cruelly extorted and had soldiers and other mean and base men especially apostates imposed upon them for their magistrates  it was enacted that none but papists should be allowed any traffic or commerce  or to learn any trade  or to make a latter will  or to continue in hospitals and that whosoever should harbor a protestant preacher should suffer death with confiscation of goods bibles and other evangelical books were sought out and destroyed such as were weak and simple were cajoled and flattered to embrace popery such as attempted to leave the country were hindered fair promises of pity or favor were perfidiously made or broken marriage baptism and burial of protestants were prohibited under severe penalties such as remained in the country were either forced to conform or were barbarously murdered so that since      there have scarce been any public appearances of a protestant church in bohemia  but no where were the waldenses more frequently or more cruelly persecuted or showed more stedfastness in the faith than in their native valleys of piedmont and places about such multitudes of them were apprehended in the   th century that the popish archbishops of arles and narbonne represented to their inquisitorial persecutors that the country could not afford materials for building prisons to contain them in    0 their enemies suddenly fell upon those of the valley of pragela and cruelly massacred multitudes of them in the depth of winter such as escaped the hands of these butchers generally perished by cold and hunger in the mountains no less than fifty infants were found frozen to death  some of them in the arms of their mothers who had shared a like fete finding that no cruelties exercised upon particular persons or places availed to their extirpation pope innocent viii in      published a most furious edict against them requiring the duke of savoy king of france and all other princes nobles magistrates and others to take arms against them and destroy them wherever they could be found and requiring all preachers to stir up and encourage their hearers to the utmost by promises of indulgence pardon of sin and an immediate entrance to distinguished blessedness in heaven to root them out from the face of the earth and threatening deposition to all civil and ecclesiastical rulers or officers who should not with due diligence promote this bloody work  albert de capitaneis his legate enforced this bull with an extensive accusation of the waldenses and with proper directions how to extirpate them animated by these things the princes and magistrates attacked them in every place and in every form and murdered above eight hundred thousand of them  insomuch that for a time the remains of them were scarcely visible the duke of savoy at last fearing that his dominions would be depopulated by such a pernicious war put an end to it in them  it was not however long when margaret de foix cruelly persecuted part of them that inhabited the marquisate of salluces but animated by god they drove out those that had seized their property and enjoyed it peaceably for many years importuned by the archbishop and the inquisitor of turin charles duke of savoy in      ordered part of his troops to surprise and massacre the waldenses but finding that after they had recovered from their consternation they in their own defense killed multitudes of their murderers he was obliged to put an end to his open war and take more slow methods to destroy them who had multiplied so exceedingly of late as to be reckoned more than eight hundred thousand encouraged by francis i king of france and by pope paul iii the parliament of turin in      renewed the persecution and required the waldenses to drive out all their barbs or ministers and that all the rest should under pain of death resolve within three days to go to mass  and in order to promote this the most eloquent popish preachers were sent to officiate among them but they got almost none to attend their harangues  sundry of their barbs were condemned and burnt  by order of the french court or instigated by his own bloody disposition de oppeda in      fell upon these about merindol and cabrieres and in the most cruel and barbarous manner murdered about  000 of them and burnt    boroughs and villages philibert duke of savoy being reestablished in his dominions by the peace of      the monks excited him to raise a new persecution against the waldenses but by means of their representation to him and to his duchess the sister of henry of france who really befriended them a temporary stop was put to it nevertheless it was not long when philibert pushed and assisted by the pope and by the kings of spain and france sent a powerful army under the lord of trinity to exterminate them from the face of the earth he in    0 and      by every method cruel or perfidious did what he could to destroy them especially their ministers but the repeated rebuffs his troops met with from handfuls of these people together with the intercessions of margaret his duchess made him grant them liberty of worshipping god in their own way by a formal treaty june  th       nevertheless within about four years after philibert perhaps instigated by castrocaro the bloody governor of these valleys and especially by the pope published an edict requiring all his subjects either to give their solemn promise before a magistrate within ten days that they would go to mass or remove out of his dominions within two months and commanding magistrates to transmit to him exact lists of all such as did not obey that he might take proper measures to punish them but the missives of the protestant princes of germany one of which from the elector palatine was exceedingly nervous and faithful together with the intercession of the duchess restrained the full execution of it  though castrocaro exercised all the cruelty he could upon them some of them being cruely prosecuted because they or their friends had assisted the french protestants charles ix of france wrote a letter to their duke in their favor in the end of that same year      they entered into a solemn covenant to maintain their religion and assist one another in their steadfast adherence to it which mightily encouraged themselves and not a little dispirited their enemies no sooner had the duchess died in      than the bigoted papists stirred up the duke to renew the persecution again his waldenses but by the intercession of some great men the execution of it was in a great measure prevented his son charles who succeeded him in    0 had allowed them some rest had not their inveterate enemies the monks and their supporters by an infinity of villainies imposed on him and thus been permitted to exercise their cruelties meanwhile the waldenses in the marquisate of salluces which from      to      had fallen under the power of france were persecuted in much the same manner as their brethren under the dukes of savoy that country returning to the duke their popish adversaries never rested till by their perfidies and persecutions they had entirely ruined the followers of christ in it about       notwithstanding the waldenses of piedmont had in   0  and    0 obtained a new confirmation of their liberties every artifice was used to hasten and complete their destruction the monks and priests loaded them with calumnies artificially dressed up to render them detestable apostates and others were encouraged or hired to commence processes against them or to excite them to mutual law suits their youth were tempted to lucrative marriages with papists such as fell under discipline were tempted to refuse submission and to commence catholics this together with the general death of their pastors by the plague in    0 and their receiving of french ministers in their stead occasioned a relaxation of their discipline all sorts of criminals were favored if they renounced their heresy apostates were enriched by false contracts and such as adhered to their religion were obliged to pay taxes for them popish missionaries were appointed to labor among them as spies and seducers the most wicked and infamous persons were encouraged and largely bribed to bear witness against them and if any even papists witnessed for them and against their monkish or jesuitical abusers he was in danger of being excommunicated and punished as a favourer of heresy to advise any from hearing the missionaries exposed one to death and confiscation of goods to give these missionaries full opportunity of seducing souls or prying into secrets they were appointed to collect the taxes persons in poverty or in sickness were promised large assistance if they but engaged to go to mass all but papists were prohibited to have either public or private schools or to hold any kind of public office infants were forced from their parents to be trained up by papists a council for extirpation of heresy was formed at turin for a trial all the waldenses of campillon were commanded under pain of death and confiscation of goods for ever to abandon their houses and whatever they possessed within the space of    hours new forms of persecution and torture were contrived the waldenses were continually cited to turin where they were ruined by the expenses of the plea or of their imprisonment while jews heathens and mahometans were exempted by law and no wise required to conform the inquisition was authorized and encouraged to compel them to conform to the romish religion or to destroy them and they were joined with sorcerers in the laws made against them troops were lodged in their valleys that they might be ready in a moment to cut their throats to gratify their own resentment popish rulers sometimes murdered priests and then laid the blame on the waldenses  having by these means prepared matters charles duke of savoy notwithstanding his solemn treaty with them in      and      and notwithstanding their most humble and earnest supplications to him and his mother and their pretended attention thereto by which their deputies were detained at turin did by the instigation of the council for extirpating heresy order his troops to march unexpectedly into these valleys and murder his evangelical subjects the marquis of piarresse and other commanders of the troops by flattery and by perfidious promises amused the poor people to prevent their standing on their own defense or escaping to the mountains  that they might have the barbarous pleasure of cutting all their throats or dispatching them in still crueller forms so dreadful was the cruelty and carnage made upon ministers men women and children as had scarce ever been exemplified on earth provoked herewith jahier gianvel and other brave waldenses took arms and heading small handfuls of their brethren defended themselves and often defeated their enemies even when they were twentieth or sometimes an hundred times their number this together with the remonstrances of oliver cromwell the states of holland and protestant cantons of switzerland obliged the duke and his council to put a stop to their infernal massacre which they labored to excuse and color over with the most abominable falsehoods and to confirm their liberties by a new treaty  cromwell not only effectually remonstrated for their relief but procured them large collections in england   000 pounds sterling of which he deposited as a fund for the support of their ministers and schools but by charles restoration they were robbed of this privilege  notwithstanding the above mentioned treaty of pignerol the envoys from england holland switzerland and france who had come to interceed for these persecuted people had scarcely gone home when the court of savoy and their agents had renewed their persecution and continued it notwithstanding the humble remonstrances of the persecuted and the intercessory missives from the elector of brandenburgh and the states of holland and switzerland the poor people were obliged to attend at turin if they had dependent processes they were deprived of liberty to trade their deputies who applied to their prince were remitted to the inquisitors the territory of st john was deprived of all public exercise of their religion  and under the most false and frivolous pretenses almost every article of the late treaty was violated their managers of the public collections sent them by their protestant friends were falsely charged with embezzling the money stratagems were formed for securing the ignominious death or assassination of mr john ledger their faithful and active moderator  or superintendent of their churches the duke and his court refused to read any petition that respected their religion or trade bagnol who had greatly recommended himself by his burnings and unheard of cruelties in the late massacre was rewarded with the government of the valleys and quickly began to imprison or assassinate their inhabitants after he had decoyed such of them as had fled to return to their houses he and the marquis of flory fell upon them with their troops but necessity obliging the poor people to stand in their own defense they had mavelous success against their murderers though sometimes a hundred to one this as well as the intercession of the cantons of switzerland induced the court of savoy to think of renewing their treaty with them but while their deputies were at turin and contrary to the most solemn declarations of the court their valleys were at once suddenly invaded by bagnol and damian and about sixteen or eighteen thousand butchering troops but the poor people assisted by god and with the loss of no more than six drove them out with the loss of  00 if not  000 of the soldiers they obtained a new treaty in      but which was clogged with several injurious restrictions and with the payment of about an hundred thousand pounds sterling to the duke and his partisans for pretended damages as the fulfillment of this treaty in some measure depended on lewis xiv of france the cantons of switzerland states of holland and court of britain wrote to him in favor of these poor persecuted people as well as they did and had done to the duke of savoy notwithstanding all these treaties and assurances they were still persecuted in manifold forms till at last the court of turin encouraged by lewis xivs revocation of the edict of nantz and instigated by the popish clergy commenced another furious persecution of them in      which entirely ruined their churches and obliged them to disperse themselves along with the french protestants into other countries thus the waldenses who had under god given birth to all the protestant churches were at last obliged to flee for refuge amongst them  amidst these manifold persecutions it is hard to say whether the christian patience and stedfastness of the waldenses or the infernal perfidies and cruelties of their enemies were most amazing multitudes of them were condemned and publicly burnt as if they had been the most infamous criminals multitudes of them after suffering all the cruelties terrors and tortures of the inquisition shared the same fate after manifold oppressions and impoverishing exactions multitudes were driven from their dwellings and all their neighbors being prohibited to relieve them perished by cold and hunger they were loaded with the vilest reproaches in order to make every body abhor them and their very infants were represented as absolute monsters in the form of their bodies sometimes they were obliged to put on boots full of boiling tallow and required to walk in them they had soldiers quartered upon them who like devils raged blasphemed and tormented them every way they could devise sometimes they were crammed into narrow rooms where they had neither room to stand sit or lie that they might be suffocated by their own breath or stench multitudes were thrown from the tops of rocks or into deep mines sometimes the men were assembled and sportfully hewed in pieces by the soldiers while the women were driven into houses and barbarously burnt multitudes were murdered in the streets and their naked carcases for several days left unburied others were stripped naked while alive and turned out amidst frost and snow some were cast into dungeons full of snakes or like venomous tormentors some were thrust into holes full of iron spikes in which they could neither fit nor stand upright some were cast into prisons on the water in which they could not stretch themselves and if they turned themselves they must fall into the water others were kept in prisons till they were suffocated perished with cold and hunger or their bodies gradually rotted alive some had their mouths slit up to their ears others had the flesh cut off from their faces others were slashed in different parts of their bodies or had their members cut off one after another others were often put to the strappado and then hewn in pieces some had their brains dashed out against the rocks others were nailed by the feet to trees with their heads hanging downward others had their brains breasts or privy parts taken out or cut off and broiled or roasted and eaten or otherwise shamefully or cruelly used others had their nails torn off by pincers or had their other torments prolonged as much as possible others were dragged furiously through streets or stony places at the tails of mules or horses others were in the most barbarous manner hung up on tenter hooks or the like by their secret parts others had their bodies stabbed all over with forks some had burning matches put between their lips or fingers etc or were roasted before or upon slow fires such as had fled into caves were shut up smoked to death or otherwise destroyed after being brutally ravished women had stakes run up through their belly and were thus carried naked on the soldiers shoulders or set up by way sides or had their bellies ripped up or were cruelly burnt if unborn infants dropped out they were thrown into the fire given to dogs or trodden under foot other babes were dashed against stones or precipitated from high rocks or torn asunder or cut in pieces quick by the soldiers in a way of diversion  such were the tender mercies of the papists toward the most harmless witnesses of jesus christ  a compendious history of the church of england the gospel of christ was preached in britain not very long after his ascension to heaven but whether by paul joseph of arimathea or whom else we know not the story of lucius the british kings request of preaching missionaries from eleutherus bishop of rome is not in the least probable while diocletian the roman emperor and his colleague furiously persecuted the christians on the continent about a d  0  constantius their caesar in britain against his will commanded to pull down the christian churches but as soon as he had it in his power he restrained his persecution it is said that to try his courtiers who professed themselves christians he required them all to offer sacrifice to the heathen idols under pain of being deprived of their preferments  and that such of them as steadfastly adhered to their religion he commended and enrolled among his particular friends uch of them as complied with his sinful mandate he sharply rebuked as treacherous to their god and dismissed from his service as unworthy of trust in a d     the bishops of york london and britannia secunda attended the council of arles in france which formed several canons and transmitted them to the bishop of rome for his consent to and observation of them whether any british bishops attended at the council of nice in a d     i cannot determine in     three british bishops along with many others at the council of arimini in italy were by the emperor constantius influence forced to sign an arian creed perhaps after they came home they like their gallic brethren returned to their orthodoxy but it is manifest that not long after the british church was infected with the arian heresy  about a d  00 pelagius or morgan a famed british clergyman taught that adam was created naturally mortal that the hurtful consequences of his first sin affected only himself that the law qualified men for heaven and was founded on promises equally good with those of the gospel that none can be the children of god unless they be free from sin that rich men cannot be qualified for the kingdom of god unless they part with all their wealth to the lord and to the poor that mans free will attended with proper information is sufficient for every moral action without any supernatural assistance of gods grace that gods grace is given to men in proportion to their desert of it  and that victory over temptation is obtained merely by the freedom of mens own will his errors being readily received and propagated by multitudes the orthodox clergy brought over lupus and gsrmanicus french bishops to assist them in opposing their progress and in founding seminaries of learning  which perhaps occasioned the long continued use of the gallican liturgy in britain the most noted schools founded about this time were those of dubricius and illutus and of the monastery of bangor  the british christians having gradually abandoned themselves to wickedness god gave them up into the hands of their northern and savage neighbors the scuts and picts who terribly ravaged their country their roman superiors being no longer able to assist them they called in the saxons who ruled the north parts of germany these barbarous heathens had no sooner repressed the scots and picts than they turned their arms against the britons themselves and murdered the most of them in consequence of which they with the christian religion were almost wholly confined to the principalities of wales and cornwall where st david and some other clergymen made a respectable figure  between a d   0 and   0 augustine the romish missionary paulin and aidan two scotch preachers wilfrid bishop of york and others by their labors converted the seven kingdoms which the saxons had erected in england to what they called the christian faith augustins principal aim was to render them subject to the numerous ceremonies newly imposed by pope gregory the great the britons and their scottish neighbors were exceedingly averse to part with their gallican or grecian rites in exchange for those of rome dinoth and his british brethren as well as aidan and finan scotch presbyters boldly withstood the introduction of the papal power or manner of worship into britain wilfrid was no less zealous for the romish interest and labored to have the festival of easter observed on the day appointed at rome it was said by peter and paul and to introduce the form of clergymens shaving their heads in form of a cross after most furious contentions the romish party assisted by oswy saxon king of northumberland gained their point the same oswy and egbert king of kent appointed wighard the elected archbishop of canterbury to repair to rome for a pontifical consecration he dying at rome pope vitalian furnished the sea with the famed and truly sensible theodore of tarsus and sent along with him adrian a neapolitan monk to prevent his introduction of any of his grecian rites theodore having called a council of his saxon clergy got them persuaded to unite in a subjection to the roman pope and to receive a settled form of church government assisted by the princes he drove wilfrid of york and several other bishops from their sees because they refused to submit to his authority wilfrid appealed to the pontiff but the romish decrees in his favor were disregarded in england the contest for preeminence between these two haughty diocesans continued till the end of the  th century wilfrid led the way of the afterward frequent appealing from the decisions of canterbury to those of rome but many of the saxon bishops little regarded his holiness decisions others reckoning rome the fountain of their christianity treated them with more respect  meanwhile in a king of the west saxons in a mixed assembly of laics and clergymen formed his code of    laws requiring that clergymen should live in a canonical manner that every child should be baptized within thirty days after its birth that none should transact worldly business on the lords day that the tithes appointed for the clergy should be duly paid that churches should be sanctuaries for malefactors as the cities of refuge had been under the old testament that murderers might make compensation for their crime to the friends of the persons they had murdered  after the haughty wilfrid had for about fortysix years plagued the church with his zealous introduction of the romish day of celebrating easter and of their clerical tonsure of the head and with his mad promotion of monkish societies and causing of multitudes rush into them contrary to every tie or call of affection or duty  and of pilgrimages to the tombs of the apostles at rome and had suffered not a little in the cause he died a d  0  about the same time the english church began to be divided into parishes many places of worship had formerly been but chapels of ease and were supplied with preachers by turns from the neighboring monasteries in which bands of clergymen not in the best manner lived together many of the scots picts and irish were prevailed on to receive the romish season of easter and their form of clergymens shaving of their crowns by the labors and example of venerable bede by the erection of schools and by the contests between theodore and the scots and no doubt by other causes which we know not learning prevailed more remarkably in britain than in any other age before the norman conquest adhelm ceolfred egbert bid eddius clemens and alcuin were their most noted doctors as yet the english knew nothing of purgatory they had little reverence for sacred relics and opposed the worship of images the pope began to send his legates for rectifying disorders among them and to demand peter pence for the erection and support of colleges at rome but they did not reckon themselves his subjects nor think his palls necessary or effectual to consecrate an archbishop their kings divided bishoprics at their pleasure without regard to his will  the danish invasions together with the almost perpetual contentions between the saxon kings having long rendered the state of the english church and nation exceedingly deplorable egbert king of the west saxons whose conquests laid the foundations of the subsequent monarchy called a council at calcuith a d     which enacted that the catholic faith and ancient canons should be duly observed that all churches should be consecrated with sprinkling of holy water as a kind of baptism and with the administration of the eucharist by the bishop of the diocese that an uniformity of principles and practice together with the impartial exercise of church government and discipline be carefully maintained that none but persons of an unblemished character nominated by the bishop of the place with the consent of the convent should be admitted as abbots or abbesses that it being uncertain from whom scotchmen receive their orders none of them should officiate as priests in england that all acts of preceding councils marked with the sign of the cross instead of the names of members should be carefully observed that no religious house should be alienated to common uses without extreme necessity and the consent of the conventuals and some of them in no case whatsoever that all bishops should have copies of the acts of council that neither priests nor bishops should exercise any power but in their own stations and districts that the funerals of bishops should be celebrated answerable to the prescribed form that the tenth part of their estate should after their death be given to the poor and their english slaves be set at liberty and in fine so many psalms be sung some masses said so many prayers and oblations made for the benefit of their departed souls  after the danes had almost ruined his kingdom alfred the grandson of egbert obtaining the superiority forced them either to profess themselves christians or depart the country he with great zeal promoted religion and learning he bestowed the half of his incomes upon the poor and on monasteries students at the university of oxford which it is said he founded and indigent foreign churches by this means he recovered his subjects from their deep ignorance john scot of dunse was his principal teacher it is said that he himself translated the new testament and psalms into saxon for the use of his subjects  in the tenth century the repeated ravage of the danes again reduced england to the utmost confusion and misery religion learning and almost every thing amiable were neglected in a d     we find a synod at graetly under king athelstan the principal acts of which related to regular payment of tithes provisions for the poor and for parochial clergy prohibition and punishment of breaking into churches sorcery witchcraft theft robbery merchandise on sabbath perjury manslaughter  together with directions for bishops to attend the courts of justice and oversee and direct their procedure and that of the subordinate clergy with respect to their religious ministrations about a d     odo archbishop of canterbury established other ten canons asserting the sacred privileges of churches the freedom of ecclesiastical revenues from all civil taxation  admonishing the king and his nobles to show themselves exemplary in honoring clergymen ministering justice and providing for the poor  directing bishops clergy and monks to promote religion in their respective stations  prohibiting incestuous marriages or violation of nuns  exhorting christians in general to cultivate an unity becoming such as had one lord and held the same faith  and to observe sacred festivals pay tithes and avoid superstition dunstan having commenced primate of the english church abandoned himself to covetousness pride and sedition and was twice banished for his crimes he violently exerted himself to drive the secular canons from their monasteries and place his own monkish brethren in their room instigated by his influence edgar an absolute monster of lewdness rebelled against king edwy his brother and obtained part of his kingdom and afterward fell heir to the rest he with all his might assisted dunstan of canterbury oswald of worcester and ethelwald of winchester in extruding the canons and in forcing the clergy to live unmarried he and dunstan made two new systems of constitutions one of sixtyfive and another of six relating to the payment of tithes the behavior of clergymen etc dunstan oswald and adulf by their holding a plurality of sees occasioned no small contention  after dunstan had directed king edgar and edward his son as he pleased king ethelred quite disregarded him as did almost all his subjects perhaps this general contempt together with grief that almost all his schemes in favor of the monks were overturned hastened his death and he was some time after canonized and worshipped as a saint  in the eleventh century alfric archbishop of canterbury in the homilies which he translated and in the letters which he wrote to his clergy plainly affirmed that the bread and wine in the lords supper are but signs and seals of his body and blood that communicating at easter is no more profitable than at any other season and that there ought to be no solitary communicating of the priests he urged his clergy to live unmarried but did not pretend that marriage was unlawful nor did he persecute such as were guilty of it elfeg his successor is chiefly famous for his heroic and christian manner of enduring horrid abuse imprisonment and death from the danish invaders whom he had exhorted to use the conquered english with humanity  to satisfy the justice of god for his own and his fathers injustice and murder of the saxon royal family canute now danish monarch of england squandered away his revenues in rebuilding and endowing monasteries to quicken the languishing zeal of his subjects he traveled in pilgrimage to rome and it is said procured some useless bulls in their favor his so harold and hardy canute being quickly cut off the crown which they had acquired by so much fraud and murder reverted to edward the confessor the son of edmond and brother to the saxon lineal heir he advanced robert the norman to the fee of canterbury by his going to rome for his pall and by his haughty and imprudent behavior toward the english and filling every importan station with normans he quickly became an objec of general abhorrence stigand his successor ha no such remarkable attachment to rome harold the brother of the infamous confessor having seized the throne from his nephew was soon after killed in battle and with him ended the royalty of the saxons a d  0   after it had continued about  hundred years  william duke of normandy the conqueror took possession of the english throne and to fix his family on it he labored to fill the principal posts of both church and state with his norman countrymen and to introduce their language into the nation the famed pope gregory vii being bent to wrest all investitures in bishoprics by the collation of ring and crosier from the impure hands of magistrates he deposed one english bishop for receiving them from king william and another for his illegitimate birth but lanfrank of canterbury got them restored palls from rome now began to be thought necessary for the consecration of bishops by the most peremptory restraint of clerical marriages and laical investitures gregory intended to render clergymen perfectly independent on civil rulers and absolute laves of the roman see william and lanfrank pretended to relish his project but expressed themselves with great caution after the danish wars and norman oppressions had long interrupted the meeting of english councils lanfrank assembled one t london about a d  0 0 it consisted of an rchdeacon a church officer then little known in england    bishops and    abbots it in part confirmed the order of benedictine monks appointd the bishops seats to be fixed in the most conspicuus place of their diocese changed some sees proibited marriage to the  th degree of consanguinity ondemned simony divination and magic revived he ancient canons of the english church and proibited clergymen to judge in causes of blood another council was held the next year which prohiited clerical marriage established archdeacons reored the blessing of the marriages of the laity to he priests and denounced punishments against all ch as should behave rudely toward religion or ergymen  gregory by hubert his legate required k wilam to pay up the arrears of peter pence due by his ingdom and to take an oath of fidelity to the roman see william consented to the first but commanded hubert to inform his holiness that he held his crown of none but god and his sword and he would never render it dependent on any other suspecting that lanfrank had encouraged william in his disobedience gregory cited him to rome but being fortified by the royal prohibition he declined the journey being threatened by gregorys legate william commanded his subjects to acknowledge no pope but whom he allowed and to receive no mandate from rome without his leave finding william no less haughty and determined than himself gregory labored by a mixture of flattery and threatening to render him more pliable  he assembled a council a rome and required the western bishops to attend it but not one from england durst go up nor did they send their excuse william having formerly reduced the lands of abbots and bishops in normandy to much the same taxes as those of his other subjects and obliged themselves to personal services in attending his councils etc he to the no small offense of the english clergy reduced their lands and persons to the same condition enraged with the news of this gregory commanded lanfrank his minister of state to repair to rome under pain of suspension from his office of archbishop lanfrank sent off a justification of his conduct but was too wise to go thither himself so much did william disregard gregory one of the most enterprising popes that ever silled the romish see that all his supplication and flattery could not for six years procure the release from prison of odo bishop of bayeaux in normandy  the ejection of the secular canons and clergy from the monasteries had formerly occasioned terrible commotions now the exemption of monasteries from the bishops jurisdiction in which both william and gregory had their own influence and ends occasioned no small noise having enacted that spiritual causes should only be judged in clerical courts william abandoned by all his principal officers that they might make their court to his sons died a d  0    by the interest and activity of lanfrank william rufus his second son succeeded him he regarded the archbishop or other clergymen no longer than he needed their assistance he seized the vacant benefices for himself and for that end kept the sea of canterbury and others several years vacant falling dangerously sick about four years after the death of lanfrank he professed himself a penitent promised to reform his practice and to atone for his former sins bestowed some lands upon the church he filled the sea of canterbury with the famous anselm a norman abbot and that of lincoln with one bloet his chancellor happening to recover he heartily repented of his conduct and resolved to make the new bishops pay for their advancement anselm had too much of the haughty dignified clergyman to comply with any thing contrary to his own inclination  highly offended with him for refusing to assist him with money in his war with his brother and for acknowledging urban as pope before he had declared his mind on that point william offered to urban to acknowledge his disputed authority providing he would send him a pall for a new archbishop of canterbury urbans legate having first got william to acknowledge his masters pontifical right gave the pall to anselm who stubbornly refused to receive it from the hand of the king not long after the papal council of clermont in france prohibited all laical investiture of bishops or abbots having on several occasions insultingly desired his majestys allowance to repair to rome for the welfare of his soul and the good of the church anselm contrary to his own solemn oath and to williams express prohibition set off william laid him under a sentence of banishment and seized on his revenues at rome anselm had his feet kissed and was revered almost on a level with urban himself while william was declared worthy of excommunication as anselm had assisted in this william disregarded his missives and with reluctance received those of the pope  william dying a d   00 and robert his elder brother being employed in the sacred but truly papal and detestable war with the mahometans in palestine henry the younger seized on the english throne to secure the favor of the pope he recalled anselm to his former station returning more full of pride and bigotry than he had gone off he directed by the romish council refused to pay any homage to henry and told him that he would not stay in england if he should confer any clerical investitures as he could hold no communion with either the giver or the receivers meanwhile pascal the pope taking advantage of anselms embroilment with henry sent over his legate to render the canterburian primacy more dependent on rome henry and his council wisely assisted anselm in this matter and forced the legate to return before he had avowed his commission prince robert being on the point of invading the kingdom henry to prevent anselms joining him after no small shifting promised to part with the right of investing bishops or abbots but having made peace with robert he resolved to retain it to put anselm who had in his councils strenuously contended for a ratification of the decrees of gregory and urban out of the way he sent him to rome to beg from his holiness that right of investitures either simply or as a particular favor but sent warewalst elected bishop of exeter along with him with secret instructions  pascal declared the right of investitures sacred and unalienable from the church anselm heartily acquiesced but warewalst boldly pled for his master and at last told his holiness that henry would rather part with his crown than with his right and finding pascal no less determined in his measures he in henrys name prohibited anselm to return to england henry justified warewalsts conduct and seized on the temporalities of anselms archbishopric while the canons relative to investitures and clerical celibate which anselm had got enacted in his synod of westminster lay disregarded in england warewalst persuaded pascal to mark an indifference toward him at rome provoked herewith anselm left rome and retired to blois in france where he told henrys sister that he behoved to excommunicate him henry having marched to normandy to wrest it from robert his elder brother patched up a peace with anselm and the pope completed it by appointing that bishops and abbots upon their election should do homage to henry that anselm should consecrate these bishops which henry had already invested and henry should renounce all right to invest any more both henry and anselm explained this agreement in their own favor as much as they could anselm then applied himself to erect the new bishopric of ely and to persecute the married clergy whom he owned to be the best and most numerous but death cut him short learning pride and mad zeal for clerical celibate and papal power were the distinguishing lines of his character  henry immediately resumed his wonted powers and invested the new archbishop of canterbury and only sent to rome for his pall he afterward assisted him in hindering the popes legate to exercise his power in england to revenge this insult of his authority his holiness supported thurstan archbishop of york in refusing subjection to the primate of canterbury observing that his subjects marked a regard for william his nephew in normandy henry became more tractable pope honorius sent john of crema his legate who persuaded the archbishop of canterbury to summon a council at westminster henry having in his perplexity surrendered his right of investitures the whole english clergy became the slaves and dependents of the pope at the council the legate sat on a kind of throne above the bishops and nobility he declaimed with great warmth against the abominable nature of clerical marriage or ministers intimacy with their own wives and that very night he was taken in bed with an harlot the canterburian primate repaired to rome and complained of the legantine mission as an encroachment upon his authority romish flattery persuaded him to return invested with legantine power over all britain and so laid the foundation of complete slavery to rome in that island to manifest his new powers he called a synod and in his holiness name ratified several of the canons made by anselm and john of crema  as henry had robbed his elder brother of the crown he was no sooner dead than stephen his sisters son contrary to his thrice repeated oath of allegiance to maud his daughter now empress of germany seized on it to confirm himself in his usurpation he spared no promises to either clergy or laity cringing to the pope he admitted his legate who not only held councils in his name but caused the monks of canterbury elect their archbishop without regarding stephens consent  the bishop of winchester being made legate not only called the primate to his bar but required stephen himself to answer for his imprisonment of some bishops and seizing on their revenues  while a most bloody and barbarous war between the partisans of maud the empress and those of stephen threw the nation into the utmost confusion pope innocent constituted theobald archbishop of canterbury and his successors perpetual legates of the roman see that nothing might be transacted but under pretense of legantine power stephens own brother bishop of winchester was invested with similar authority his versatile changing of parties was extremely remarkable at first he took part with stephen his brother next he got the empress elected and enthroned and consigned all the friends of stephen to the devil and his angels and after all assisted in restoring stephen to his throne after much contention with his fellow legate theobald of canterbury repaired to the papal synod of rheims stephen prohibited him to return as he had gone off without his permission to revenge this affront theobald as well as the pope took part with the empress and returning to england he laid that part of it which acknowledged stephens authority under an interdict of public worship the contending parties wearied of the war came to an accommodation but theobald directed by his holiness refused to crown the son of stephen who had contrary to his oath seized on the crown  amidst these calamities and to the infinite vexation of the bishops the monks by their charters and by exemptions purchased at rome had gotten themselves freed from their jurisdiction and quickly after obtained mitres and other badges of episcopal dignity for their abbots they soon felt that the popes immediate jurisdiction was harder than that of their diocesan bishops by journies to rome upon the election of every new abbot one of which cost about  000 pounds sterling  and to obtain pontifical decisions of their frequent contests they were put to insupportable expenses they were rendered slaves to the pope and his legates they were exposed to the hatred of their sovereigns and involved in perpetual quarrels with the bishops and even the prosecution for justice at such a distant court was a severe punishment  henry ii the empress son having obtained the throne a d      he applied himself to rectify the disorders of his kingdom the monks had not finished their struggle for an independence n the bishops but pope adrian who was an englishman diverted henry from attending to it by complimenting him with the savage kingdom of ireland providing he could conquer it the irish primates had all been married the son had succeeded the father for fifteen generations none of their four metropolitans had ever purchased a pall from rome these things made adrian reckon them most brutish barbarians invited to the assistance of dermod king of leinster who had drawn a war upon himself by his adulterous carrying off of the wife of his fellow king of breffney henry soon made a kind of conquest of ireland about the same time he made thomas becket his chancellor on the recommendation of theobald of canterbury for whom beckets address at rome had procured the legantine power in opposition to his rival of winchester about a d    0 thirty persons of both sexes esteemed heretics landed in england from germany henry called a council at oxford to examine their opinions it is said they were all extremely simple except gerard their chief we know not what their real opinions were but the council delivering them up to the secular power henry commanded them to be branded with a hot iron in their forehead and whipped out of oxford and prohibited all his subjects to give them any meat drink or lodging being the depth of winter they perished with hunger and cold and it is said underwent their sufferings with great patience and cheerfulness  contrary to theobalds advice henry resolved to restrict the clerical power expecting that becket whom he had loaded with favors and who seemed to be far removed from monkish devotion would assist him in it he got him made archbishop of canterbury after theobalds death becket soon after attended pope alexander in the council of tours a d      and secretly resigned his archbishopric into his hands and received it back from him  what remorse he pretended for receiving it by henrys influence and the investiture from his hand i know not but it is probable that he and the pope planned their scheme of rendering the english clergy perfectly independent on the state not long after his return he delivered to satan a nobleman who had dared to oppose the entrance of one whom he had presented to the rectpry of aynesford henry was highly offended that one of his crown officers should have been thus excommunicated without his knowledge about twenty years before it had been decreed that such as laid violent hands on any clergyman should never be absolved by any but the pope and in his presence the clergy were now strongly but cunningly instigated to render themselves subjects to none but the vicar of christ to honor anselm for his zealous invasion of the royal power becket got him solemnly canonized for a saint this inflamed his clerical brethren to follow his steps in hopes of a like glorious reward  the clergy having obtained the sole jurisdiction over their own body abandoned themselves more and more to murders and other horrid enormities of an hundred clerical murderers not so much as one was punished with degradation from his office highly offended herewith henry commanded that all such clergymen as should be apprehended in acts of felony murder burning of houses or the like should be carried before the civil judges and punished as others but becket withstood his orders with the utmost firmness and violence the clerical boldness in wickedness still more abounding henry having assembled a council of his lords spiritual and temporal at westminster proposed to them five constitutions extracted from the customs of henry his grandfather viz that none should appeal to the roman see without the kings consent that no bishop or archbishop should leave the kingdom without his majestys consent that no crown officer or immediate vassal of the king should be excommunicated without his knowledge that clergymen charged with capital crimes should be judged in the kings courts that repairing of churches taking of tithes and other ecclesiastical affairs of general concern shall be judged in the civil courts these articles were heartily approved by the nobles but the bishops and abbots obstinately refused their consent unless this all enervating clause saving the rights of the clergy should be added henry threatening effectually to humble their pride all of them except becket yielded and at last the popes legate persuaded him to feign his consent  having got these articles unanimously established henry called another council of his lords spiritual and temporal at clarendon for extracting and confirming the laws of his grandfather sixteen articles were formed bearing that all differences relative to the right of patronage should be tried in the civil courts that no churches which are fees of the crown can be disposed of in perpetual donation without the kings consent that all clergymen charged with crimes against the laws shall appear before the lord chief justice as well as before the ecclesiastical courts and none of them after conviction be protected by the church that no clergymen shall go out of the kingdom without his majestys consent and their giving proper security of their doing nothing to the prejudice of him or his subjects that accusations of laymen in ecclesiastical courts shall be proved by reputable witnesses and whom the sheriffs shall oblige to attend if necessary that excommunicated persons shall not be obliged to continue on the spot where they lived formerly but only to abide the judgment of the church that none who immediately hold of the king or any of his barons shall be excommunicated or their estate laid under an interdict without first acquainting him or his chief justice if himself be out of the kingdom that none shall appeal from the archbishops court without his majestys consent that bishops and abbots must perform the services annexed to their tenures when required by his justices or ministers  and must be present at all trials except when sentences of blood or of losing life or limb are to be pronounced that the revenues of all vacant bishoprics abbeys or priories of a royal foundation shall be paid into the kings exchequer that the king shall have the power of conveening the electors of bishops abbots and priors and the elected must do homage to him before their consecration that he shall punish every wrong done to the superior clergy and they shall prosecute such as injure him that no goods of forfeited persons shall be protected from his seizure in churches or churchyards that all pleas of debt shall be tried in civil courts that the sons of copyholders are not to be ordained clergymen without consent of the lord of the manor in which they were born etc the council unanimously agreed to these constitutions but becket refused to sign them with his episcopal seal and not long after suspended himself from the exercise of his office and imposed a penance on himself for sinfully consenting to them  henry dealt with alexander iii who had been advanced to the popedom by his influence to ratify the above constitutions and to constitute the archbishop of york his legate alexander instead of this labored to reconcile him to becket and constituted henry himself his legate providing he should not use his power against becket henry rejected the office of pontifical dignity with great indignation and resolved to humble becket he caused him to be prosecuted for holding a royal manor for converting to his own use the revenues of the archbishopric of york and of some other bishoprics and for embezzling  0000 pounds of the public money when he was chancellor becket appealed o the pope as his sole judge and refused so much s to converse with henry on their points of difference henry got him accused as a fugitive from justice and disobedient to his sovereign  and afterward of perjury and high treason no persuasions f his fellow bishops could make becket yield an hair readth he insulted both them and his sovereign they pronounced him guilty of perjury in breaking is oath of allegiance and cited him to appear before his holiness to answer for his conduct when the temporal lords told him that by refusing to submit to their authority he involved himself in treason he boasted that were it not for his character he would in a duel vindicate himself against any one of them who durst charge him with a crime he fled to france where king lewis instead of banishing him as henry desired protected him and recommended his cause to the roman court henry hoped that alexander would have gratefully befriended him and at least persuaded becket to resign his see but neither his former favors nor his pompous embassy had any such effect on the pope he and becket declared ten of the constitutions of clarendon null and void and threatened to excommunicate all such as should maintain them becket then resigned his authority into the hands of the pontiff but alexander unwilling to have his faithful servant run down by the civil power and fearing that his submission might issue in the reduction of the papal power restored him to his office and promised to assist him in it to his uttermost  the contest between henry and becket became more and more serious henry published a proclamation banishing all the relations of becket and commanding to seize all the revenues of his see for public use and prohibiting all correspondence with either him or pope alexander and declaring it high treason to bring any bull of excommunication or any interdict from any of them etc becket excommunicated all such as adhered to the constitutions of clarendon and some of henrys more active lords or ministers were mentioned by name in a number of missives to henry himself he mingled threatenings with argument he did all that he could to seduce clergymen and others from their allegiance but those of the province of canterbury remained deaf to all his solicitations suspecting that lewis of france fomented their differences henry levied an army to prevent an attack from france or a revolt of his own subjects the clergy of the province of canterbury dealt very plainly with his holiness and represented to him the ingratitude and irregularity of his conduct convinced by the influence of henrys presents and by his own fears that he might join the german emperor another disobedient son alexander appointed his legates to repair to england and there judge between him and becket becket raved like a madman as if christianity would have been ruined along with his loss of his cause nor could his friends persuade him to resign his primacy on condition of henrys giving up the constitutions of clarendon thus matters proceeded till about      that becket insisted for a pontifical ratification of the excommunication which he had passed against the observers of the constitutions of clarendon and for his holiness allowance to consign henry into the hands of the devil alexander informed henry that his allowance for his excommunication could not be long delayed unless he should repent hitherto neither becket nor alexander had profited much by their quarrel the former had languished in exile and the latter had been deprived of his revenues in england but now while lewis of france invaded henrys dominions in normandy alexander manifested an uncommon regard to becket and confirmed to him all the privileges he had formerly enjoyed to revenge this henry entered into a league with the german emperor who hated alexander and if the nation could have borne it he would have renounced alexanders spiritual headship and acknowledged pascal his rival being informed that the english were firmly attached to his interests alexander caused the bishop of london to admonish henry and in his name require him to restore becket and annul the constitutions of clarendon the bishop having mildly executed his commission represented to his holiness in henrys name that e inclined to continue his obedient son providing he behaved as a spiritual father and that nothing hindered beckets return providing he desisted from opposing the royal prerogative and laws of the land to which he had sworn subjection reckoning this missive injurious to his character becket consigned the writer into the hands of the devil and notified the same to his clerical brethren finding that this contest retarded his conquest of ireland henry became more and more anxious to have it made up in an interview which he had with lewis for establishing peace between them he persuaded him that it was only beckets pride and obstinacy that prevented a reconciliation with him both french and english nobility exclaimed against him as intolerably perverse and unfit to be protected in either kingdom regardless of this becket delivered up the english bishops and other clergymen to satan in such multitudes that henry had scarcely enough to officiate in his chapels enraged by this henry assured his holiness that unless he immediately sent his legates to absolve his clergy and decide the debate between him and becket he would secure the peace and honor of his kingdom in a manner less agreeable to his wishes alarmed with this plain dealing alexander immediately dispatched his legates to england with flattering letters to henry bearing that they had full power to terminate the differences and absolve the excommunicated but he privately assured becket that he would take care of his interests and advised him to dissemble for a little time he gave the legates secret instructions to give no decision without first acquainting the archbishop of sens in france who was a trusty friend of becket the legates therefore cavilled at every thing which henry proposed observing their conduct henry threatened to do himself justice by another method the replied that they feared none of his threatenings as they belonged to a court which had been accustomed to command kings and emperors  not long after lewis procured another meeting between henry and becket in order to have them reconciled henry offered to becket a full restoration of all his dignities and privileges and a thousand marks to defray the expense of his voyage becket pretended that he had suffered  0000 marks of damage all which he must have refunded to him  finding no hope of his submission henry sent a messenger to pope alexander offering him as much money as would clear his extensive debts and  0000 marks more providing that he would translate becket to some other see and remove him from france to rome alexander would do no more than send other legates to mediate a peace between them but as becket refused to promise any obedience to the kings laws but what consisted with the privileges of the pope and the liberty of the church this attempt also proved fruitless  finding henry extremely tenacious of his rights the roman court resolved to humble him by force as they had just done frederic the german emperor to prepare their way they every where represented him and his laws as extremely detestable and extolled becket as an almost unparalleled saint and confessor three legates were then appointed to excommunicate henry and lay his kingdom under an interdict informed of their intentions henry renounced the authority of both pope and archbishop and prohibited all his english subjects to receive any of their mandates he ordained that no peterpence should be paid without his warrant that all the clergy that were out of the kingdom should immediately return under pain of forfeiting all their revenues that none should submit to any letter of interdict under pain of being hanged on the spot as traitors to their king and country to establish his family on the throne he in a crowded assembly of his principal subjects caused henry his eldest son to be crowned by the archbishop of york and to swear that he would inviolably observe the ancient customs becket loudly complained of injury done him  pretending that the coronation indispensibly belonged to the archbishop of canterbury alexander quickly consigned over the archbishop of york and all other bishops who had assisted at the coronation to the devil and his angels and threatened to do the same with henry himself if he did not without delay make peace with becket who at the same time notified that he would lay the kingdom under an interdict of all public worship if he was not reconciled within fifteen days afraid of a fate like to that of the german emperor or of trouble to his young son or perhaps of papal damnation to his soul in the future state henry newly recovered from a violent fever had two meetings with becket in the presence of king lewis in the last of which he yielded all that becket demanded however heartily henry had forgiven the injuries done him becket now rendered more proud than ever prosecuted his resentments he always went attended by an armed guard and in this manner attempted to enter the palace of the young king he prosecuted the popes excommunication of his fellow bishops they fled from england to henry in normandy and represented becket as a public incendiary a persecutor of clergymen and a determined enemy of his king and a destroyer of all good men that came in his way henry in his outrageous passion said that it was strange that not one of his numerous dependents had courage to avenge him of a single priest who braved and sought to depose and disinherit him  four gentlemen of his household moved by this surious expression hasted to england and murdered becket while he was officiating in his cathedral  the romish court no sooner heard of it than they resolved to revenge his death in the most terrible manner the french king the bishop of sens and others charged henry with it and care was taken to proclaim it in the most horrid forms through all christendom henry was threatened with excommunication and his kingdom with an interdict unless he should speedily give sufficient evidence of hi repentance he dispatched his ambassadors to the several foreign courts to disown the fact and to declare his detestation of it these sent to rome were at first rudely maltreated and had audience denied them but a present of five hundred marks sterling opened their way to his holiness ear their promise that henry would submit to the judgment of the church prevented his consignation to satan and the interdiction of public worship in his kingdom legates were dispatched to england to absolve him they collected all the depositions they could to prove him guilty but finding none to their purpose they allowed him at last to clear himself hy oath that he had neither commanded nor assented to the assassination they then accommodated matters with him on condition that he should never withdraw his subjection from pope alexander and his successors while they acknowledged him a catholic soveeign that in all ecclesiastical causes he should allow appeals to rome that he should serve three years n the sacred war against the infidels in palestine uness dispensed with by the pope and should maintain two hundred men for that service that he should ully pardon all the adherents of becket and restore he see of canterbury every thing that had been taken from it during his exile and that he should nnul all laws and customs which he had introduced to the hurt of the church  to which was added this secret article that he should go barefooted to beckets tomb and ask pardon and endure a sound whipping from all the canterburian monks upon hese conditions henry obtained pardon of a crime of which they had first caused him swear himself innoent when they could find no proof of it to magnify becket they gave out that the dead body wrought more miracles than christ and all his apotles had wrought for the confirmation of christianity tself and many thousands of mad devotees yearly isited his tomb  the monks of canterbury appeared to inherit his ambitious and obstinate temper they claimed the sole power of electing his successor and carried their point against both their kings richard whom they elected was scarcely consecrated when in his council at westminster he got eighteen canons enacted importing that no clergymen should marry that no sons should succeed their fathers in spiritual functions that no clergymen should frequent public houses unless when on journeys that none of them should assist in the judgment of capital crimes and that no money should be taken for the holy chrism or baptism or any other sacrament richards next work was a furious dispute concerning jurisdiction with roger of york which issued in mutual blows meanwhile the popes legate persuaded henry to exempt clergymen from all civil judgment except with respect to some services and the abuse of forests in consequence of this they became the absolute slaves of the pope and almost perpetually contested with the laity in order to inslave the whole kingdom  alexander called a council at rome a d      and required the western bishops to attend it four english bishops repaired to it but richard mindful of some offense which his holiness had given him in taking part with his opponent prior of the monks went not they prohibited the secular powers to judge any clergyman under pain of excommunication  or to impose any tax upon them unless they generously offered their assistance and the laity were incapable to bear the necessary burdens they required all christian princes to eztirpate heretics  to prevent their living under their jurisdiction  and to confiscate their goods and render their persons slaves they decreed the same privileges as to the sacred warriors in palestine to all such as should take arms against them  these laws were reckoned the more necessary as the waldenses had exceedingly increased and spread themselves in several places of eurupe the monks of malmsbury withdrawment of themselves from under their bishop of salisbury and their forging of a charter for defending their disobedience drew from archbishop richard a sensible remonstrance to the pope much about the same time in a letter to one of his suffragans he laments that the english clergy had wickedly subjected themselves to the pope instead of their lawful sovereign in consequence of which one might murder as many clergymen as he pleased and then by prostitution of an amiable wife or by a little money purchase his absolution from a priest  while lucius the papal successor of alexander was busy demanding assistance from england to depress the senate and people at rome the monks of canterbury by king richards entreaties and other like methods elected baldwin their archbishop he attempted to erect a college for the secular canons at his see but his holiness instigated by the monks caused him to demolish it and hallow the ground at last the mob instigated by the monks pulled down the buildings and the archbishop with the materials laid the foundation of the palace of lambeth which the pope also ordered to be demolished meanwhile great preparations were made for a mad warlike expedition to palestine  k richard i dying his brother john succeeded him a d      contrary to his inclination the monks of st david elected one girald for their bishop he posted to rome for confirmation and by his large offers thought to have been created an archbishop of wales but king john and the archbishop defeated his project and another was made bishop much about the same time pope innocent iii finding the western churches sufficiently entangled in his yoke appointed a general valuation of their revenues and the fortieth part of them to be granted for carrying on the sacred war the archbishop of york prohibited the lifting of this tax in his diocese excommunicated the officers that levied it and laid the country under an interdict because they would not oppose them but he was obliged to yield the monks having seized upon the rectorship of feversham before the kings presentee had got possession of it innocent took their part several who had inlisted themselves for the sacred war drawing back innocent appointed the bishops to excommunicate them by name every sabbath and obliged king john notwithstanding his deep poverty to give the  0th part of his revenues for carrying on that mad war  hubert the excellent archbishop of canterbury dying the monks of that place chose reginald their subprior to succced him he immediately posted to rome for confirmation and notwithstanding that he had given his solemn oath to his electors that he would not reveal his election till they should allow him he no sooner got over the channel than he every where assumed the dignity of archbishop in his way to rome provoked with his impiety and imprudence or fearing the kings displeasure the prevalent party of monks in the convent begged his majestys leave to choose a new archbishop appeased by their submission john recommended gray bishop of norwich to their choice and at his own expense posted off a number of the monks to obtain his confirmation at rome while the bishops dispatched their proxies to complain that they had been deprived of their right in the election the romish court welcomed all parties but innocent quickly determined against the bishops and adjudged the whole right of election to the chapter of monks belonging to the sea k john having taken an oath of the monks whom he had sent to rome that they would choose none but gray of norwich though himself safe to assure the pope that he would acknowledge any whom the convent should elect promising to absolve them from their oath innocent obliged the monks under pain of excommunication to choose one stephen langton a native of england but a member of the roman court and pretending that there was no need of princes consent in his holiness presence he immediately consecrated him  john was altogether enraged to find one wholly attached to the french interest placed in this important station he drove out the canterburian monks for electing their subprior without his knowledge he threatened the pope that if he got not his will in this matter he would prohibit every future appeal from england to the roman see innocent boldly replied that he would but involve himself in inextricable difficulties if he dared to oppose the vicar of christ to whom every knee must bow by his command the bishops of london and worcester laid the english nation under an interdict of divine worship except baptism of children taking of confessions and giving the sacrament to dying persons in consequence of this their dead were buried in ditches and highways like brutes their churches were shut up and their altars forsaken had john turned his resentment wholly against the roman court he might perhaps have carried his point but his seizing of bishoprics abbeys and ecclesiastical revenues and requiring his subjects to renew their oath of allegiance and many of his nobles to give hostages for their fidelity gave great offense informed of these ferments innocent delivered him up to the devil and by flattering missives labored to secure the favor of his offended nobles and clergy john granted the bishopric of lincoln to wells his chancellor and commanded him to receive consecration not from langton but from the bishop of rhoan in normandy wells considering himself as now subject to another head repaired directly to langton for consecration john in his rage immediately seized the temporalities of his bishopric nevertheless wells duplicitymade him suspicious of every body about him and ready to hearken to every term of accommodation he offered to admit langton archbishop to recall the banished bishops restore the monks of canterbury and obey the directions of his holiness saving to himself and heirs the rights of the crown nothing less than a total surrender of himself and all his prerogatives to their mercy could content innocent and langton a conversation between john and pandulf innocents legate in order to reconcilement proved quite unsuccessful innocent and his party did every thing in their power to render john odious they represented him as an enemy to the rights of the church and nation peter an hermit was employed to foretell that his royal dignity should cease before next ascension day and none of his posterity ever wear the crown this exceedingly hurt him among his credulous subjects meanwhile it was decreed at rome that he should be deposed and another substituted in his stead having published this sentence innocent labored to engage philip of france to dethrone him promising him a throne in the heavenly paradise and the crown of england in fee simple to him and his heirs if he did he dispersed his missives and agents all over europe to persuade his infatuated votaries that it would be an eminent service done to god and religion to cut off this contumacious prince and enslave the kingdom of england to the holy see and he promised full pardon of sin and all other immunities granted to the sacred warriors in palestine to all such as should assist in this work  philip with great zeal prepared for attacking his english neighbor and john raised an army to defend his own rights but terrified by innocents menacing letter and by pandulfs exaggerated accounts of the french army john consented to deliver up his kingdom to the pope as the only means of protecting it and to receive it back as a fief of the holy see to do homage for it to innocent and give him his oath of subjection and resign into his hand all the patronages belonging to the crown  and after all to declare solemnly that he did all this of his own free will and with the advice and consent of his barons this was all performed on the monday before ascension day in the presence of multitudes having got his ends accomplished pandulf contrary to his promise privately slipped off leaving john in the hands of the devil and the whole nation under an interdict king philip was highly provoked by the popes mandate to stop his warlike expedition but being unwilling to draw the curse of rome upon himself and his kingdom he submitted after receiving johns oath to govern according to law and equity langton absolved him from the sentence of excommunication john assembled his barons to consult how the damages of the church might be repaired  highly offended with his mean submission to the pope they resolved to take arms against him and refused to assist him in recovering that part of normandy which philip had seized langton threatened to excommunicate such as would take arms before the interdict were removed  to render his claim to the english kingdom most firm and manifest innocent sent his legate to cause john make a second resignation in presence of his nobles and clergy and attested by the primate after the papal charter was presented on the altar and attributed to the directive inspiration of the holy ghost john swore fealty and did homage to the roman see and to innocent and his lawful successors upon this he received back the rights of his crown from the legate the nobles considered this second resignation of his crown as a condition of his obtaining the popes protection against them langton attested the charter but protested against it and thereby drew upon himself the detestation of the roman court innocent and his agents now represented john as a prince of extraordinary humility and piety and the lately extolled langton as a most wicked apostate and the other clergy who had formerly assisted the roman usurpations but now assisted the barons in demanding a restoration of the liberties of their kingdom as most detestable miscreants a civil war taking place john fought to retain himself and subjects slaves to the pope the barons who had lately helped to enslave the kingdom fought for its liberties and obtained the magna charta and charter of forests which still continue the foundations of english liberty john persuaded his holiness to declare these charters null and void and while his barons expected nothing but peace he attacked them with an army of foreigners to many of whom he distributed the property of his native subjects they called lewis heir to the french crown to be their sovereign neither he nor they regarded the pontifical thunders launched in favor of john  in      innocent and john retired to their grave and not long after langton of canterbury who contrary to the fears of some and the hopes of others had proved a most valiant defender of the liberties of the english church and nation the monks chose walter one of their own number an ignorant and scandalous wretch whose father had been hanged for theft to be archbishop king henry iii and his bishops warmly opposing it pope gregory ix declared their election null and void and took the choice into his own hand by promising the pope the tenth part of all the movables in england for the support of his sacred war against the german emperor henry got richard chancellor of lincoln promoted to the primacy terrible distress and rage accompanied the levying of this tenth part for the pope but fears of his papal damnations made the people at last to comply bishops and abbots were obliged to advance the money for their inferiors they were forced to sell or pawn the church plate or to borrow money upon it at high interest from the italian usurers whom the popes nuncio had brought along with him for that purpose  richard dying soon after his advancement pope gregory intending to have all the vacant benefices of note conferred upon italians or other foreigners opposed the monks election of nevil bishop of chichester fearing that like langton he might turn out a friend to his country enraged by this about eighty persons of high rank entered into a solemn confederacy to drive the italian clergy out of all their preferments in england and carried their point gregory was sufficiently provoked but henry finding that so many great men were concerned in the affair durst punish but few of them having got henry made his blind dupe gregory annulled other two elections of an archbishop and at last himself appointed edmund treasurer of salisbury  contrary to the expostulations of the new archbishop henry admitted otho the pontifical legate he brought with him a set of canons to be established in a council which he called at london they imported that churches should be consecrated within two years after their erection that no abbot or rector shall pull down old churches without leave from the bishop of the diocese that no person of infamous birth or who is ignorant or scandalous be admitted to the priesthood that bishops live at their cathedrals a considerable part of the year and officiate on the great festival and on the sundays of lent that bishops visit their dioceses consecrate churches exercise discipline and frequently preach to the people that every one that brings a cause into a spiritual court give his oath that he does not act from any litigious humor that every advocate at his admission give oath that he will plead according to truth and equity that all judges keep records of their procedure and give parties concerned copies on demand etc the canon which he proposed against plurality of clerical charges was warmly opposed the principal stations of the church were quickly filled with italians and other foreigners licentious enough in their lives but trusty slaves to the roman see regardless of his subjects henry permitted gregory to oppress them as he pleased  the english clergy and many of the people were stripped of almost all that they had for the assistance of the pope against the emperor but the emperors troops seized it in its passage to rome finding that he could do nothing effectually for the relief of his country archbishop edmund retired into a monastery gregory transmitted to the other bishops a list of  00 italians to be preferred to vacant benefices before any other should be served no matter though for want of their language they could be of no use to their flocks  celestine iv had scarcely succeeded gregory in      when he appointed an insolent legate to strip the english clergy of the poor remains of their wealth the nobles finding henry utterly averse to assist them resolved by themselves to restrain such exactions they commanded the wardens of the several seaports to stop every person who brought bulls or mandates from rome a messenger was apprehended with several bulls empowering the nuncio to raise money from the clergy the nuncio complained to henry but the barons boldly justified their conduct and represented to him the injustice he did to his subjects in permitting such exactions and showed him a list of revenues enjoyed by italian clergy in england which exceeded those of the crown the barons empowered a knight to order the nuncio to leave the kingdom who upon his shifting told him that if he did not depart within three days he would be cut to pieces finding that henry could not protect him he hasted off to the no small joy of the nation  when the council of lions met in      the english barons insisted for a redress of their grievances especially the yearly payment of a  000 marks of tribute for the kingdoms of england and ireland as fiefs of the pope and of the clause non obstante in all his bulls after waiting for a time to no purpose and finding that his holiness intended only to amuse them they protested against the payment of that annual tribute and swore that they would not suffer the revenues or their church to be carried off by foreigners and then returned home  innocent iv having obtained the popedom pretended great favor to the english allowed their patrons to present whom they pleased and to nominate an english successor whenever any place was vacated by an italian but he required their bishops under pain of excommunication to sign the charter by which king john had rendered the nation tributary to the pope they meanly complied next year the parliament by a solemn deputation complained to his holiness of their grievances particularly papal exactions from clergymen and pensions from churches the robbing of patrons of their power to present proper persons to ecclesiastical charges and benefices the bestowing of benefices on italians who understand not the english language and do not preach at their churches nor maintain any charity or hospitality there that while italians had free and easy admission to privileges englishmen were obliged to prosecute their rights at rome and that the clause non obstante in bulls was destructive of all the laws customs and privileges of the nation innocent being utterly averse to diminish his revenues or powers told them that he would prosecute his own measures let henry do what he would he loaded the english clergy with new taxes and claimed right to be administrator to all bishops who died without latter wills he appointed one bishop to levy from his resident clergy one third and from nonresidents one half of their movables under pain of excommunication or suspension after some contrary proclamations of henry innocent carried his point except with respect to the effects of the bishops that died intestate provoked with these exorbitant exactions grosthead bishop of lincoln a man of uncommon learning and resolution set himself to oppose both innocent and henry his pitiful dupe in a manner becoming his character he tore the papal bulls which presented unqualified candidates to benefices he refused to consecrate such italians as could not speak english he formed a list by which it appeared that italians possessed ecclesiastical revenues in england to the value of  0000 arks which were perhaps equal to a million sterling at present at last for refusing to consecrate an italian boy to the first vacant benefice in his diocese and for his faithful remonstrance against the papal wickedness he was contrary to the advice of the wiser cardinals excommunicated by the pope he appealed to the judgment of god and continued his work in the church and died in a christian manner bearing a solemn testimony against the romish corruptions  henry had scarcely forborne oppressing the clergy by exactions for a pretended expedition against the infidels in palestine when pope alexander iv about    0 demanded another for the conquest of sicily to prince edmund and because they had not money bills were brought them from italy indorsed to some merchant there and every bishop and abbot was required to sign them under pain of excommunication the pope and king obliged them to comply the bills being a little altered after the nation had been for seven years grievously oppressed in this manner ottobon the popes legate assembled a council of the english clergy at london which enacted that in case of necessity lay persons might baptize infants that no money should be taken for the administration of sacraments that no clergymen should be installed before the preceding incumbents be certainly dead that parishes should be no further divided that executors of testaments should present an inventory of their trust to their ordinary before they begin their administration that no bishops shall sequestrate the profits of vacant livings that penance shall never be exchanged for money that no tithes be alienated that clergymen abstain from pluralities especially such as are possessed without dispensation or institution that no benefices be held in commendam that no patrons be allowed annual sums for their grant of presentations  edward i having ascended the throne in a d      his parliament about two years after enacted a number of salutary laws for both church and state meanwhile the general council of lions imposed a new tax on the whole western church  none but peckham deacon of lincoln opposed it having dared to hint that the english clergy had been already so impoverished by taxations that they had scarcely whereon to live pope gregory x deprived him of his preferments not long after he rejected burnell whom the canterburian monks had unanimously elected their archbishop and himself chose and consecrated another peckham a learned franciscan peckham quickly held a council at lambeth which confirmed the constitutions of otho and ottobon and further enacted that priests should carefully instruct their ignorant people that the bread in the lords supper was both his body and blood that unconsecrated wine merely rendered the swallowing of the bread the easier and that which was consecrated belonged only to the priests who celebrate divine service in the less important churches that baptism by lay persons is valid that the most necessary points of religion should be plainly explained to the people once every quarter of an year  as notwithstanding former prohibitions many continued devoting their estates to the church to the hurt of the nation and the impoverishment of the kings exchequer  the parliament by the statute of mortmain enacted that if any person should dispone of any heritable property to the church without the will of his immediate superiors of whom he held that property these or higher superiors might immediately seize on said disponed houses or lands for themselves as their undoubted property in all time coming  edward being bent on limiting the power of the clergy he and archbishop peckham had several warm contests the citizens and burgesses now beginning to be called as members of parliament along with the lower clergy as a national council in this edward demanded from the clergy an half years revenue finding them reluctant he charged the opposers of his motion to stand forth and take their trial as disturbers of the peace of the kingdom this obliged them to comply with his harsh demands accounting it an unsupportable burden to attend parliaments the inferior clergy by degrees accustomed themselves to make their grants in convocations next year edward demanded a new supply from the clergy after procuring a bull from pope boniface viii prohibiting their payment of it they pretended their terror of this bull as a reason of declining it edward sealed up their stores and gave them till next parliament to deliberate on the affair peckham caused publish the popes bull prohibiting collectors to levy it in all the cathedral churches next year edward called a parliament without the spiritual members which enacted that all the goods of such clergymen as refused the royal tax formerly imposed should be confiscated and themselves outlawed and prohibited judges to do them justice in any suit the clergy threatened to excommunicate all such as should seize their goods without their consent but finding that edward would not be trifled with they after some conference yielded the point consented to pay a fine for their contumacy and to deposit a fifth part of their revenues to be employed in defense of the kingdom when needful winchelsea archbishop of canterbury alone remained obstinate but edwards order to seize his whole property made him willing to part with a fourth part of it in consequence of this submission edward and his parliament confirmed to the clergy all their wonted privileges  not long after boniface prohibited edwards further attempts upon the betrayed and disjointed kingdom of scotland but he and his barons little regarded his holiness mandates boniface also presumed to put the new bishop of worcester in possession of his temporalities as well as his spiritual jurisdiction but edward obliged him to renounce that clause and pay a  000 marks sterling for ever accepting it about the same time by a large present of gold plate he persuaded pope clement to absolve him from his coronation oath to preserve his subjects liberties secured to them by magna charta and charter of forests and to give him a bull declaring all excommunication for the breaches of it null and void after humbling some of the seditious nobles he attacked the archbishop of canterbury and by the popes assistance got him suspended and his see sequestered in the hands of the nuncio just before his death he held a parliament of laics and clergymen at carlisle which enacted that none of the principal preferments should be granted to any foreigners that the rents of religious houses should not be given to the pope for his college of cardinals nor should he have any title to the first fruits of vacant benefices that peter pence ought never to be demanded to a triple extent that no legacies disponed to pious uses should ever be converted from their original design  during the   th and   th centuries the wealth of the templar knights had exceedingly increased  it is said they had   000 lordships in europe  envy of their greatness and covetousness of their wealth varnished over with pretended discoveries of their horrid enormities brought them to ruin in england and every where else in the beginning of he   th not without opposition archbishop winhelsea submitted to the calling of the clergy for memers of parliament and himself summoned the inerior sort reynolds his successor probably by his resents obtaining the uncommon favor of clement was empowered to visit his provincial charge for three years successively and to suspend the jurisdiction of all his suffragans during that time  to visi places ordinarily exempted  to restore  00 clergymen who had been deposed for scandal  to dispen with  00 that by reason of nonage were unfit for holding benefices  to absolve  00 laymen wh had laid violent hands upon clergymen  to allow  0 clergymen to hold plurality of benefices annexe to charge of souls notwithstanding all laws to the contrary  and in fine to pardon on profession o repentance all crimes committed within  00 day before  during the weak and disorderly reign o edward ii we find little relative to the church but some clerical subsidies to the king the elections o the bishops of durham winchester london and hereford by the pope without regarding their respective chapters of monks and at last many clergymen assisting the barons to depose him and insta his son edward iii  mepham succeeded reynolds in the archbishopric of canterbury in his provincial council he fixed the number of holy days and the manner of observing each he had not proceeded far in his provincial visitation when the bishop of exeter stopped him with an armed force edward prevented a bloody contention between them by recalling mepham who soon after died notwithstanding edwards spirited remonstrances and other efforts his holiness still supplied the ecclesiastical vacancies without regarding either king or wonted manner of election archbishop stratford having on account of their poverty refused edward a clerical subsidy for carrying on his war with the french occasioned a terrible contest between him and his no less haughty sovereign who scorned to yield to prevent the popes filling up the vacant livings with foreigners edwards parliament in their statute of provisors enacted that all such as should be convicted of bringing papal provisions or foregrants of ecclesiastical livings into he kingdom should ly in prison till they paid a fine or his majestys use and made satisfaction to the arty injured next year the clergy having pleased edward with their large subsidy they had their priileges further explained and confirmed against all ncroachment of the secular courts in his next arliament held at westminster the famous statute f praemunire enacted that whoever should apeal any cause of property to the pope should be utlawed from the kings protection their estates and movables confiscated for his use and their persons imprisoned till ransomed to his content these tatutes with that of mortmain above mentioned were calculated to restrain the growing power of the roman court but unwilling to break with his hoiness edward never put them into execution  urban v having commenced pontiff in      he n the haughtiest manner required the english to ay their annual tribute promised by king john  edwards parliament declared that john had no ower to bring any such servitude upon his kingdom without their own consent and that the whole nation was determined to oppose all pretensions of he pope to it this spirited resolution for ever deivered england from this infamous tribute complaints being presented to this parliament that clergymen had almost the whole management of the state in their hands they supplicated edward that no clergyman should be held admittable to the offices of chancellor privy seal treasurer baron of exchequer and other places of the civil list edward had scarce removed them from the first three oices when he died in      and was succeeded by richard ii his grandson under whose weak government both church and state were almost ruined  in the parliament    0 the statute of praemunire was ratified and it was further enacted that whoever went beyond sea to procure himself any clerical benefice without the kings leave should be excluded from the protection of the laws and that it should be held treasonable to bring into the kingdom any sentence o excommunication on account of the making of these statutes the bishops protested and the pope raged against these restrictions of their power the nuncio was required to do nothing contrary to the laws of the kingdom and prerogatives of the king and to export no money without special warrant from him and his council  meanwhile the nation was not a little enlightened with the knowledge of the truths of christ about    0 john wickliff principal professor o divinity at oxford boldly defended the statutes o that university against the mendicant friars and even threw out hints against their pontifical protector for this langham archbishop of canterbury deprived him of his wardship and substituted a mon in his place about the same time langham condemned thirty opinions and king edward commanded the heads of the university to search out an expel all such as were tainted with them wicklif appealed from the archbishops sentence to the judgment of pope urban but provoked with his confirmation of it he began more openly to attack the scandalous behavior of the monks and popes  to expose the absurd superstitions which prevailed  and to urge people to acquaint themselves with the word of god as the rule of their religious conduct and for their assistance he translated the bible into english the clergy furiously opposed him and the monks commenced a violent prosecution of him before pope gregory xi but the papal schism and the influence of the duke of lancaster and other noblemen that favored him retarded the execution of it about eight years about      william courtney archbishop of canterbury revived the process in the councils of lambeth and london wickliff was accused of ten heresies and thirteen other errors the principal of which were that the encharistical bread is not by the priests consecration of it turned into the real body of christ that no more power was given to peter than to the other apostles that the church of rome is no more the head of the universal church than any other that the pope has no more power of jurisdiction than any other priest that if churchmen scandalously misbelieve they may be deprived of their temporalities that the gospel of christ is a sufficient rule of a christian life that monastical and other additional rules add no real excellence to christianity that clergymen ought not to have prisons for punishing mens bodies not long after he died peaceably in his rectorship of lutterworth without any appearance of either recanting or explaining away his tenets but about thirty years after his bones were dug up solemnly judged condemned and burnt  notwithstanding courtney excommunicated multitudes of wickliffs followers who were nicknamed lollards they mightily increased taking the opportunity of richards absence in ireland they attempted to have their doctrines approven by the parliament a d      they presented a spirited remonstrance in which they averred that the church of englands imitation of the romists in the use of her temporalities had banished faith hope and charity that the english priesthood derived from rome and pretending power over angels is not that which christ settled on his apostles that the restraint of clergymen from marriage occasioned many scandalous immoralities that the pretended miracle of transubstantiation renders the greatest part of christians idolaters that exorcisms or clerical benedictions of wine bread water oil wax incense stones for the altar church walls holy vestments mitres crosses etc have more of necromancy than of religion in them that the junction of the office of prince and bishop prelate and secular judge in the same person is improper and hurtful that prayer for the dead is a wrong foundation of charity and religious endowments that pilgrimages prayers and offerings to images and crosses are near of kin to idolatry that auricular confession makes priests proud admits them into the secrets of penitents and gives them opportunities for intrigues and other great offenses that womens vows to live unmarried betrays them into infamous correspondences tempts them to procure abortions and murder their children unbaptized that unnecessary trades occasion pride and luxury this remonstrance so alarmed the clergy that some of the bishops posted to ireland to bring home the king to their assistance while arundel who had just obtained the archbishopric assembled a council for condemning such heretical doctrines  in      the barons deposed the weak and in some things tyrannical richard  and henry iv duke of lancaster ascended the throne as nearest heir  his parliament of   00 revived the statutes of provisors and praemunire but as he for his own security on the throne courted the favor of the clergy they continued asking and the pope in collating of benefices the parliament also enacted that the purchasers or executors of bulls prohibiting payment of tithes or exempting from the jurisdiction of bishops should incur the penalties mentioned in the statute of provisors the bishops by royal warrants had formerly imprisoned multitudes of the followers of wickliff henry to please them and their pope now procured a statute for burning of heretics in consequence of which these bishops who under richard would not assist in condemning traitors and notorious oppressors greedily claimed the sole power of judging and committing to the flames such as they called relapsed heretics sawtra a pious priest of london was almost immediately condemned and burnt because he could not believe transubstantiation  when the parliament met a d   0  arundel instigated by henry assembled his clerical council at oxford to extirpate heresy from the university and nation they enacted that none should preach without license from a bishop that sermons should only touch upon moral subjects and such things as had been formerly taught by the church that no books of wickliff or his followers should be read in schools or colleges that no person without authority should translate any part of the bible into english that no propositions or conclusions tending to the corruption of mens faith or practice should be mentioned that none should dispute concerning the worship of images holy relics or pilgrimages or any other point fixed by the church and that the heads of the university should once every month enquire into the principles of the students admonish them if found in an error and expel them if obstinate nevertheless the doctrines of wickliff still prevailed  when henry demanded a pecuniary aid from his parliament the commons insisted for favor to the lollards and represented that the clergy squandered away their enormous wealth in vain grandeur and unnecessary pomp that if he would take away their temporal estates the nation would be more able and ready to defend itself the poor better supplied and themselves more attentive to the duties of their station in a second remonstrance they insisted that the statute for burning of heretics should be either repealed or amended the clergy loudly reproached the commons as heretics themselves and henry haughtily rejected their requests and wished the rigor of that statute heightened not long after he refused his assent to an act of parliament for the trial of clergymen in civil courts but cheerfully signed a warrant for the burning of one bad by a blacksmith who could not believe transubstantiation  wickliffs tenets still spreading were again condemned at oxford and every one was prohibited under pain of degradation to teach them the convocation of london having urged the archbishop to visit the university of oxford the heads appointed twelve of their principal doctors along with the delegates of the archbishop to examine the books of wickliff and transmit an extract of the condemnable propositions to him and his suffragan bishops he and henry had resolved not to leave one lollard in the kingdom but death cut them both off in      lamented by almost none but the abandoned clergy just before his death arundel had labored to persuade young henry v to prosecute sir john cobham or oldcastle and other heretical lords  finding him averse to such cruelty arundel and his agents pretended that sir john had assembled  0000 of his party to massacre his whole royal family persuaded hereof henry assembled an army and was at midnight conducted to a place where he found about an hundred of the poor persecuted lollards assembled for worshipping god with arms about them for their own defense from murderers some were killed others instigated by promises and threatenings falsely confessed a plot and that sir john was at the head of it a price being set upon his head he was soon apprehended hanged by the middle and then burnt he endured his sufferings as a courageous martyr for christ while arundel answered to god for his treacheries and murders henry seemed to have been convinced that he had been imposed on and granted the lollards an act of indemnity  after the council of constance a d      pope martin began to display his absolute power over the english church he often disposed of vacant bishoprics in the form of provisions and annulled the elections of the chapters of monks within the province of canterbury he in two years appointed thirteen bishops he was extremely lavish of his grants for consolidating and appropriating parish churches or of dispensations with clergymens nonresidence or laymens enjoyment of ecclesiastical benefices king henrys bold remonstrance checked his presumption a little  the parliament enacted that none should be admitted to benefices upon papal provisions contrary to the right of the patron and the clause non obstante in papal bulls should have no effect henry further demanded that his holiness should dispose of no preferments in england and that himself should enjoy the pontifical revenues of that country whenever he should be employed in defending the holy see when martin labored to evade these demands henrys ambassadors protested that their master would therein use his own prerogative martin at his own hand translated the bishop of lincoln to the archbishopric of york but henry commanded the dean and chapter not to admit him and so he was forced to return to lincoln and the pope to acquiesce perceiving that the french monks had marked their disaffection to him and his conquests in their country henry turned them out of some monasteries and put englishmen in their room  henry vi an infant was scarce enthroned in      when chichely archbishop of canterbury renewed the furious persecution of the lollards two priests were accused before the first convocation but got off with their life in the following parliament the commons grievously complained that want of due clerical instruction tempted the subjects to lollardism the sacraments not being duly administered  many dying without the privilege of religious ceremonies  and hospitality being neglected through clergymens nonresidence at their charges and they insisted that if any priest should absent himself from his flock six weeks in a year he should forfeit his claim to his benefice russel a franciscan having taught that the payment of personal tithes to the clergy was not commanded by the word of god and that they might be better laid out upon some pious uses as the givers found meet was warmly persecuted for his detestable doctrine he escaped out of the kingdom but all those of his order were commanded to preach up the contrary and the university of oxford required all their students before receiving any degrees to swear that they would never maintain russels opinion or any wise assist in defending it  archbishop chichely having in his first convocation moved for an annulment of papal exemptions and having advised henry v to refuse the bishope o winchester for pontifical legate had rendered himself obnoxious at rome martin being now freed from the entanglements of his immediate predecessors charged him under pain of excommunication to labor to his uttermost to have the statutes of provisors and praemunire repealed and to inform the council and parliament that every one that obeyed them lay under excommunication at rome and to require all his clergy to teach the same  and finally to report his diligence herein attested by two credible witnesses chichelys excuse not being sustained at rome he was suspended from the exercise of his legantine powers he appealed to the next general council and to the tribunal of god if that should not meet martin repeated his demands in other two missives in the last of which he put the archbishop of york first in order pretended to annul the statutes by his own power prohibited the bishops to act upon them and declared all the obeyers of them excommunicated not to be absolved by any but the pope except at the point of death at last chichely promised to do his utmost for the repeal of these acts martin represented to the king and to bedford the regent that they were obliged it conscience to repeal them and to the parliament that they could not be saved unless they voted their repeal the english rulers had learned to dissemble with his holiness when the parliament met chichely with great appearance of zeal insisted with the commons for a repeal of the criminal statutes pretending to argue from scripture reason and the common consent of christians and then with the rest of his episcopal brethren withdrew the commons with great solemnity entered on the debate but after all refused either to repeal or amend these obnoxious acts and formed an address to his majesty to procure from the pope a purgation of the archbishop who they thought had been hardly used by the roman court the privy council would not allow the cardinal bishop of winchester to exercise his legantine powers nor would the duke of gloucester who was regent allow him to officiate as prelate of the order of the garter nor was it without manifold limitations that the council would permit him to publish the papal croisade against the bohemian heretics for a levy of    0 men or to collect voluntary donations for supporting them  in the convocation of london several clergymen and others were accused of heretical hints against the worship of images and that the pope was antichrist and for holding some of wickliffs opinions such as would not recant were thrown into prisons and dungeons to teach them repentance this clerical meeting cheerfully granted a tenth part of their incomes to his majesty but neither the popes own demands nor all the solicitations of his nuncio could persuade them to grant as much to him nor even a twentieth part without the kings consent not long after the nuncio himself was imprisoned for collecting money from the subjects contrary to law the convocation which had been originally accustomed to do nothing but give aids had perhaps in archbishop courtneys time begun to transact ecclesiastical affairs as the bishops permitted they now appointed delegates to attend the general council of basil which met in      and instructed them to insist for a check to his holiness dispensations with clergymens pluralities of charges and nonresidence at them and his collation of dignities and benefices upon persons ignorant or under age  king henry espoused the cause of pope eugenius against the council of basil and acknowledged the schismatical conventicle of ferrara afterward translated to florence but the lower house of convocation refused to contribute toward the expense of sending any delegates to it when eugenius granted the bishopric of ely in cominendam to the archbishop of rhoan henry at first rejected the bull and when the candidates good services made him consent chichely opposed his claim to the temporalities  the convocation enacted that none but graduates in universities should be capable of any benefice and thus empowered the seminaries of learning to prevent the admssion of ignorant wretches  after chichely and his clergy had made several ineffectual attempts for repealing the above mentioned statutes he worn out with age that he could not perform his episcopal work begged of his holiness to instal stratford the bishop of bath in his place stratford and his clergy still insisted for a repeal of these acts which so much bridled their power notwithstanding their masters silly complaisance henrys ministers refused to yield meanwhile henry beaufort his grand uncle cardinal bishop of winchester died famed for nothing but sordid avarice and pride peacock of chichester was a kind of deist who extolled the light of nature above revelation and which was reckoned more unpardonable he espoused some of wickliffs tenets after he had twice recanted he was deprived of his see and all students who embraced his tenets were excommunicated and expelled the university  after he had reigned thirty eight years henry was dethroned for his weakness and edward iv earl of march eldest branch of the line of york which had been set aside by henry iv was made king to establish his dignity he granted the clergy every thing they asked he screened them from the statutes of provisors and praemunire freed them from the jurisdictions of the civil courts and under pain of excommunication prohibited all his judges or officers to arrest or imprison any of them he pretended to grant them these favors from a terror of the excommunication denounced by the holy canons and that he was persuaded that the miseries under which the nation had long groaned were the judgments of god for avenging the disrespect which had been showed to his servants in      nevil archbishop of canterbury held a council at york which appointed every priest four times a year to explain to his hearers the fourteen articles of faith ten commandments two gospel precepts of love to god and our neighbor seven works of mercy  feeding the hungry giving drink to the thirsty entertaining strangers visiting the sick clothing the naked comforting prisoners and burying friendless dead  seven deadly sins of pride envy anger hatred aversion to religion and virtue covetousness and epicurism  the seven principal virtues of faith hope charity prudence temperance justice and fortitude and the seven sacraments of baptism lords supper confirmation penance extreme unction marriage and ordination this was materially the same with the tenth canon of lambeth in       after edwards dethronement restoration and death and about two or three months reign of his son edwatd v richard crookback duke of gloucester his uncle took the throne but after two years he was driven out by henry vii duke of richmond heir of the line of lancaster who had married elizabeth daughter of edward iv and heiress of the house of york  he had several contests with the ambitious clergy but his principal care was to hoard up money and so died hated or feared by all his subjects under his reign bourchier archbishop of canterbury brought over the first printing press from harleim in holland to oxford in england in       henry viii succeeded his father in   0  divinity as then taught in the universities was his favorite study while many of his subjects were plotting the destruction of his fathers two most rapacious ministers empson and dudley he and his council were occupied in settling his marriage with catherine aunt to charles v emperor of germany and king of spain she had been married to arthur his elder brother when he was about fifteen years of age he slept with her for a time but was said to leave her a virgin upon his death henry vii unwilling to lose her portion or to allow her a proper dowry on receipt of it procuring a dispensation from the pope got her betrothed to henry his second son in the   th year of his age but perhaps repenting he made young henry enter a solemn secret protestation against it as catherine affirmed herself a virgin and had an agreeable and virtuous temper henry viii moved by some reasons of state and reckoning his conscience sufficiently protected by his holiness dispensation took her to his bed about two months after his fathers death and they were conjunctly crowned  henry and his courtiers having abandoned themselves to pleasure wolsey from the rank of a chaplain pushed himself into almost the whole management of the kingdom a law had been made in the late reign that clergymen convicted should be burnt in the hand another was now made that murderers and robbers not being priests or deacons should be denied the benefit of clergy highly offended the clergy insisted that all their orders being sacred none of them could lawfully be judged by any civil court standish risked both his dignity and life in honestly opposing his brethren and henry supporting the statutes wolsey thought fit to yield  but animated by his cardinals hat and his archbishopric of york he with great zeal promoted a clerical contribution for his holiness to defray the expense of the turkish war but the clergy had both wit and zeal to retain their own money wolsey was made the popes legate a latere and appointed to visit all the monasteries in the kingdom and empowered to visit all the monasteries in the kingdom and empowered to dispense with all ecclesiastical laws for a whole year the clergy were highly offended especially as the popes bulls granting him these powers had represented them as very ignorant and profligate they thought it very improper that wolsey should pass such a censure upon when when his own vices were so remarkable but observing that their ignorance and profligacy would inevitably render them contemptible he was willing to endeavor the reformation of the inferior clergy by every tenable method except the drudgery of giving them a good example he also expected that the abominable practices found in monasteries would justify his suppression of them and converting of them into cathedrals colleges or collegiate churches but his friends advised him to suppress them by the less invidious method of papal authority  the enormous wealth and power of the clergy had made many of them think that they might do what they pleased without reproach or control under pretense of a turkish war to be carried on by all the christian princes of europe pope leo x published an indulgence which extended to both the quick and he dead and promised forgiveness of all their sins and a complete redemption from both hell and purgatory at fixed prices for carrying on the war the subordinate disposers of these indulgences acted in the most profligate manner it is said the power of releasing souls was sometimes played for in taverns zuinglius of switzerland and luther of germany boldly decried this abominable merchandise luthers books spread into england and were the more eagerly read that his doctrines appeared like to those of wickliff the lollards were therefore the more furiously persecuted the least word however inadvertently dropped against any ecclesiastical law was enough to found a prosecution and parents teaching their children the lords prayer and the ten commandments according to wickliffs english translation was thought a sufficient ground of burning them as heretics puffed up with his own theological learning and highly offended that luther had so freely handled t aquinas his favorite doctor henry published a pretended refutation of his books this procured him high flattery from rome with a new title of defender of the faith which his successors or the throne still retain but luther in his reply treated him with very unceremonious freedom to promote the salvation of his countrymen william tindal published an english translation of the new testament with short notes sir thomas more so famed for his mildness learning and popish piety published a virulent confutation of it the bishops poured forth their proclamations against it as a book infinitely dishonorable to god and ruinous to the souls of men and from all the pulpits in the nation charged all that had any copies of it to bring them to the vicar general within thirty days under pain of excommunication and of being suspected of heresy some were prosecuted as heretics but recanted  while wolseys oppression of the nation particularly his clerical brethren with taxes diverted mens minds to other objects  after henry had lived almost twenty year with his queen and had several children born by her her frequent miscarriages and the improbability of her having any sons provoked his dislike of her perhaps the french and spaniards questioning the legitimacy of his daughter mary when proposed for marriage with their princes awakened his suspicion of the unlawfulness of his own while anne of boleyn his queens maid of honor had begun to captivate his capricious affections he first intimated his scruple to cardinal wolsey and required him to declare his mind concerning his divorcing of catherine wolsey having had his attempt on the popedom defeated by charles her nephew was bent enough to do her a disservice but was wise enough to be leave to consult the learned men of the kingdom the bishops and others being assembled advised henry to consult all the universities in europe and procure their determinations under their respective seals messengers were immediately dispatched with proper instructions to consult the foreign universities in more than a year not one but that of orleans had returned their opinion  when dr cranmer then tutor to the children of a gentleman in whose house henry happened to lodge a night suggested the propriety of obtaining and publishing the decision of the universities which if done his holiness would scarce dare to pronounce a contrary sentence highly pleased with the hint henry pushed for the foreigners resolution of his two questions whether the law of god allowed of a mans marrying his brothers wife and whether the pope could dispense with the laws of god all the universities except those of rome and most of the learned in europe papists lutherans and zuinglians declared themselves in the negative of both questions with much difficulty and little unanimity the universities of oxford and cambridge declared the marriage unlawful having obtained the opinions of so many learned men henry assembled the bishops who all except fisher of rochester declared it unlawful and put their name and seal to their decision warham archbishop of canterbury put fishers name and seal to it but fisher steadfastly maintained that he never empowered him to do so  having removed catherine from his bed henry applied to pope clement vii for a divorce however willing clement would have been that henry had sued out his divorce in england and married another and got a legantine confirmation of his marriage he was very unwilling to displease charles the emperor whose favor he needed against the protestants and shifted off the affair the best way he could campegius was at last dispatched for england with legantine powers and a bull of divorce to be shown to henry and wolsey but with secret instructions to spin out the affair as long as possible the matter was begun in the legantine court by campegius and wolsey catherine who had absolutely refused to retire into a monastery or to consent to her own divorce and had employed the interest of the emperor and other friends abroad to prevent it appeared once and again before the legates but appealed the cause to the pope himself campegius adjourned the court till the ensuing october meanwhile the pope called the cause before himself and cited henry to his bar henry commanded the earl of wiltshire to protest against the citation as contrary to his royal prerogative and in a letter signed by cardinal wolsey four bishops two dukes two marquisses thirteen earls two viscounts twentythree barons twenty two abbots and eleven commoners the pope was entreated to confirm the judgment of so many learned men henry disdained to send any to represent him as a panel but he sent some to excuse his noncompearance and if possible to draw the cardinals to his side while henry was fretted with delays wolseys enemies and even anne of boleyn his former friend represented him to his majesty as a treacherous conniver with campegius and a betrayer of his masters interests they prosecuted him for accepting his legantine powers and in other different forms as henry had given him warrants for many things charged upon him as criminal he sometimes pretended to protect him but when he thought his danger over he was arrested for high treason and poisoned himself in his way to the tower confessing that if he had served his god as faithfully as he had done his king he would not have abandoned him in his old age  in september    0 henry published a proclamation prohibiting all purchasing of any thing from rome under the severest penalties and declaring his intention to annex the ecclesiastical supremacy to his crown foreseeing that the clergy would startle at the last he indicted them all as guilty of acknowledging and submitting to wolseys legantine powers and by the statute of praemunire declared them to be out of his protection and to have forfeited all their estates and goods to his use finding themselves at his mercy they gladly submitted to a fine of      0 pounds sterling for his exchequer and to acknowledge him their spiritual head they readily advanced the money and promised never more to meet n convocation or to make any canons without his majestys allowance but they thought a laymans headship over the church so absurd in itself and so inconsistent with their allegiance to the pope that they insisted to add this clause as far as agreeable to the laws of christ in their acknowledgment of it henry for the present admitted their clause  the parliament meeting in      the commons thought it a proper season for securing themselves and their people against ecclesiastical oppressions and even the clergy finding that their prosecutions of men without any accuser causing them accuse themselves on oath or obliging them to abjure what opinions they pleased or be burnt were very disagreeable  resolved to amend their customs the parliament restricted the protection of clerical criminals explained and enforced the statute of mortmain which prohibited the alienation of lands to the church without consent of his majesty and other immediate superiors they prohibited the payment of nnats and first fruits to rome they declared that no excommunication on account of adherence to these laws should be regarded henry at first consented to these laws only for a year but when the convocation besought him to preserve the liberties of the church he replied that no ecclesiastical constitutions should hereafter be made or executed without his consent that as some of the provincial ones already enacted were inconsistent with his prerogative he intended to have them all examined by a committee of    persons half of them clergymen and the rest members of parliament that such  were found improper might be abrogated and those that agreed with the law of god and his prerogative might be confirmed with his royal assent the clergy were obliged to submit sir thomas more seeing whither matters were tending resigned the great seal and warham archbishop of canterbury died  cranmers book against henrys marriage with his brothers widow and his manful disputing against i in the foreign universities procured him henrys peculiar favor and therewith the archbishopric o canterbury apprehensive of the critical nature of the times and having his affections fixed upon a young lady he accepted the charge with the utmost reluctance at an interview francis the french king pretending great friendship for henry advised him neither to go himself to rome nor send any agents to prosecute his divorce but secretly to marry anne of boleyn now duchess of pembroke and he would stand by the marriage henry did so about the   th of november      but it is scarcely possible that cranmer could be present notwithstanding the contest relative to the divorce clemen readily granted to cranmer the bulls and pall for hi archbishopric fearing that his oath of obedien to the pope might interfere with his majestys authority or bind him up from necessary reformation cranmer took it with a protestation against tha which he thought wrong in it meanwhile clemen instigated by the emperor would neither grant henry his divorce nor allow it to be judged in england the english convocation at cranmers instalment by a great majority determined as the foreign universities had done but committed the question o catherine consummation of her marriage with arthur to the canonists who determined that the presumptions she had done it were very strong all the upper house of convocation except the bishop of bath and wells confirmed this the convocation of york determined in the same manner hereupon henry avowed his marriage with anne of boleyn and appointed cranmer to call a court o judge of the nullity of his marriage with catherine  the tidings of these transactions had provoked clement to consign henry into the hands of the devil had not his moderate cardinals urged him to deay it while henry was on the point of a rupture with the pope the french king persuaded him to submit his cause to him and his cardinals exclusive of the imperialists upon the condition of obtaining ull satisfaction henry would not trust clements romise unless he had it under his hand in writ or would clement trust henry on any lower terms belley bishop of paris was dispatched from rome with clements engagement to henry and a day was fixed for the return of henrys submission of his ause four frenchisied cardinals were added to verbalance the friends of the emperor meanwhile he emperors agents so assiduously labored with the pope that he promised to revoke his engagement if henrys return should not come on the very day appointed as perhaps through the bearers mistake f his way the return had not come up within that me clement brought the affair before his consisory of cardinals and notwithstanding belleys earest pleadings for a delay and contrary to common rder concluded it in their first sederunt declaring henrys marriage with catherine valid and requirng him to take her back to his bed under pain of he highest ecclesiastical censure within a day or wo the english courier came up with henrys subission but clement could not with honor to his fallibility immediately revoke his decision thus rovidence shut up henry to a breach with the roish court altogether enraged with his disappointent and that he had debased his supremacy in aking his unfruitful submission henry resolved to ake the romish see feel the weight of his resentment he had already restricted the clerical prerogatives and for some years his learned subjects had been examining the foundations of the popes authority and all except fisher of rochester were persuaded that it had nothing to support it from scripture reason fathers or decrees of ancient councils  when the parliament met in january      a bishop preached every lords day at pauls cross preparing the minds of the subjects for the intended change and teaching that the pope had no right to authority in england the parliament confirmed their former act prohibiting the payment of annats prohibited the presentation of candidates for bishoprics to the pope or asking his instalment appointed bishops to be elected by the chapter of the sea upon a license from the king nominating the candidate  who after swearing faithful allegiance to his majesty should have a commission granted for his consecration and be invested with a right to the temporalities of the bishopric they rendered the laws against heretics more agreeable to those of the kingdom they appointed that thirtytwo persons should examine all the ecclesiastical canons of england and abrogate such as they found contrary to his majestys prerogative and the laws of the land or good of the subjects  till the finishing of which the present canons were to be held binding unless they were plainly derogatory to the royal pterogative and established laws and customs of the nation as this uncertain state of the canons left henry full power to explain them or allow them to be executed or not these commissioners never met elizabeth barton the holy maid of kent instigated by the popes agents pretended inspiration and to animate his subjects against henry for opposing the pontifical power predicted his shameful death within a month if he divorced his queen and married another she was attainted and five of her accomplices lost their lives  when the parliament received the news of clements decision against henry their sovereign they especially such as favored the reformation resolved to tear up his authority in england by the roots they declared the whole kingdom freed from all dependence on rome they ordered all payments to the apostolic chamber of provisions bulls and dispensations for ever to cease that all dispensations not contrary to the law of god should be hereafter granted by the two archbishops and that no license in any matter not formerly dispensed with should be granted till it should be examined by his majesty and his council they empowered the king to visit and correct the abuses of the monasteries they suggested that the old and new testaments were considered as the rule of faith they declared henrys marriage with anne valid settled the crown on the issue of it and prohibited all under pain of misprision of treason to slander said marraige or its issue or this solemn approbation of it they took an oath of allegiance to henry as head of the church instead of the pope and to maintain the succession of the crown to the issue of his presenc marriage and to renounce all allegiance to the pope not long after this oath was imposed on the clergy and many other subjects they required clergymen to preach nothing but what was agreeable to scripture and catholic tradition sir thomas more and bishop fisher who had before so zealously promoted the burning of all such as could not believe transubstantiation now lost their lives because they scrupled at henrys marriage with anne and at the oath relative to his ecclesiastical supremacy in november this year the parliament confirmed henrys supreme headship over the church particularly in correcting errors and heresies and to the no small grief of the clergy granted him the annats and tithes of all ecclesiastical preferments which had been formerly given to the pope they framed an oath concerning the succession of the crown and required persons of all ranks to take it they declared it high treason to speak against his majesty or his present queen or to call him an heretic schismatic tyrant or usurper and they made provision for the suffragan bishops  when paul iii was made pope henry by his minister cassils applied to him for his reconsidering his cause paul was exceedingly desirous of a reconciliation with england but the news of some friars and of sir thomas more and bishop fisher being executed for refusing to renounce their allegiance to the roman see made him lose all hopes of it he therefore delivered henry into the hand of the devil and his angels absolved all his subjects from their allegiance to him commanded all ecclesiastics to leave the kingdom and all the nobles to take up arms against him prohibited all other christians to have any dealings with the english laid the kingdom under an interdict of divine service annulled all treaties made with henry by foreign princes since his marriage with anne of boleyn and declared the issue of it spurious and incapable of succeeding to the crown  the oath approving of his majestys marriage and the succession of the issue of it to the crown and renouncing the papal authority had been administered by commissioners all over the nation the spread of tindals new testament and of the beggars supplication which was chiefly directed against the lazy monks as devourers of that which belonged to the poor had contributed to the conviction of severals but the bulk of the nation still continued zealous for popery such as dared to oppose it were in danger of being burnt or otherwise persecuted but the queen lord cromwell afterward earl of essex archbishop cranmer shaxton of salisbury and latimer of worcester who studied to promote the reformation had influence with henry while bishop gardener the duke of norfolk and others did their utmost to oppose it none were more averse to it than the cloistered monks who openly declared against the kings procedure begged the people to take up arms against him and labored to embroil him with foreign princes to humble their pride henry appointed lord cromwell who had once been wolseys servant but was now made his majestys vicegerent in spiritual affairs instead of the popes legate and others to visit their monasteries in the manner which he prescribed to prevent a rial of their behavior some voluntarily surrendered their monasteries into his hand others upon examination were found guilty of the most abominable frauds multitudes of pretended relics were exposed and destroyed images of pretended saints were taken down and burnt and the rich oblations made to their shrines converted to the kings use  faction and lewdness of the most unnatural kind were every where found having considered the reports of the commissioners for the visitation the parliament agreed to suppress     of the smaller monasteries and to give their plate and other furniture to the value of about  00000 pounds sterling and their rents amounting to   000 pounds per annum to the king about ten thousand monks were turned out each of them with fortyfive shillings equal to about the value of    pounds at present to carry them beyond sea or to live on till he could work and their governors had yearly pensions granted them to ease the nation these pensionaries were thrust into vacancies as fast as possible and hence most of the inferior clergy became inveterate enemies to the reformation in      and      the greater monasteries were surrendered into his majestys hand to prevent an examination of their manners the clear rents of all the suppressed house amounted to      0  pounds six shillings and four pence but their true value was at least ten times more with   000 pounds of this revenue henry intended to erect    small bishoprics but no more than those of westminster chester peterborough oxford gloucester and bristol were actually founded to prevent the ecclesiastics resumption of their property mo of the abbey lands were given to courtiers or fol to the gentry at an easy rate in      the parliament complimented henry with the chanteries coleges free chapels hospitals fraternities and guilds with their manors and estates together with  0 manors and parks which had belonged to the archbishop of york and    pertaining to his lordship o canterbury  tindals new testament had been prohibited i    0 by the money with which the copies of i were bought up for destruction he was enabled t translate the old and publish it along with the new corrected this corrected by cranmer was contrary to all the solicitations of gardner and his party published by authority but to avoid the odiou name of tindal who had been burnt for an hereti in flanders it was called matthews or cranmer bible meanwhile notwithstanding her piety an virtue queen anne by her airy and imprudent behavior and by the accusations of her popish enemies fell under a suspicion of infidelity about three years after her marriage inwardly burning with lust after another henry was highly offended with her for bearing him a dead son as catherine ha done she was quickly attainted and to please henry condemned without any shadow of proof and beheaded may         as guilty of a precontract of marriage with some other man and o plotting henrys death she died solemnly protesting her innocence next day henry married jean seymour the object of his outrageous lust soon after annes daughter elizabeth was declared a bastard as mary e daughter of catherine had been a little before both parliament and convocation declared annes marriage null and void  complaints of different doctrines delivered from pulpits being transmitted to court henry whose spiritual headship rendered bishops and all their underlings and offices mere creatures of his crown by circular letter to the former prohibited all preaching or about three months till proper articles of faith were published by his direction and authority and gned by cranmer and    other bishops  0 abbo o archdeacons besides proctors in these the old and new testaments the creeds attributed to he apostles  council of nice and athanasius were ade the standard of faith without any regard to he decrees of the popes justification through the ighteousness of christ alone is asserted but the reovation of our nature is represented as a part of it the sacraments of confirmation marriage ordination and extreme unction are omitted baptism is repreented as necessary to salvation and the washing aay of original sin transubstantiation auricular onfession and penance along with the worship of ints and images are retained prayer for the dead  commended and purgatory left doubtful craner consented in hopes of obtaining better articles fterward but few either papists or protestants ere pleased  provoked with these articles but especially with he suppression of the monasteries in which many eceived alms many got places for their idle friends and prayers and masses were carried on night and day or their deceased relations deliverance from purgaory  and animated by the popes bull above menoned and the incendiary declamations of the monks multitudes of papists took arms against the government in lincolnshire a monk headed  0000 of them but a proclamation of pardon dispersed them the duke of norfolk headed a more formidable pary in the north the heads of this conspiracy aong which were sundry abbots and priests were pprehended and executed these insurrections proked henry against the remaining monasteries as urseries of rebellion he resumed    which be ad before given back to the monks the shrine f st becket to which the english devotees had arked infinitely more regard than to jesus christ in their annual devotions having given to it in one year about a  000 pounds sterling when they had not given one farthing to its rival altar of jesus christ  was demolished  meanwhile henry by virtue of his spiritual supremacy published certain injunctions for regulating the behavior of the clergy bearing that they should every quarter of a year preach twice against the popes supremacy and in defense of the kings that they should publish his late articles of says and proclamation for the abolishment of some holy days in harvest that they should instruct their people to make no pilgrimages to saints or their relics but stay at home and mind their family keep gods commandments and teach them and the creed and lords prayer in english to their children that they should carefully dispense the sacraments in their parishes that they should not frequent taverns not sit long at gaming but apply themselves to the study of the scriptures and of a good life that every one who had  0 pounds a year and did not reside at his charge should pay five pounds to the poor and every one that had a  00 pounds should maintain a student at the university or as many students as they had hundreds a year that a  th part of the livings should be applied for repairing the vicars houses if decayed thus henry commanded the very things for which wickliffites and lutherans had been burnt  much about the same time cranmer latimer and other eight bishops and some divines published the instruction of a christian man it maintains that our savior descended into the local hell that all articles of faith are to be interpreted according to the scriptures and the decrees of the first four general councils it maintains the doctrine of seven sacraments and of transubstantiation it restricts the clergy to two orders bishops and deacons and affirms that according to the word of god no bishop has authority over others it restricts the invocation of saints to a desire of their intercession with god for us it maintains that churches ought to be dedicated to none but god it allows handy labor on saints days especially during the harvest it maintains the doctrine of justification by the imputed righteousness of christ and of passive obedience to the king not long after lord cromwell procured henrys allowance for all his subjects to read the bible published by cranmer and an order to have a copy of it set up in every church that it might be red between sermons or at other times by the people  queen jeans death in childbed of prince edward henrys breach with the german protestants who refused to receive him as the head of their league unless he abandoned transubstantiation and allowed the people the cup in the eucharist the umbrage which he conceived against cranmer and other reforming bishops for not consenting in parliament to his appropriation of the suppressed monasteries or cheap sale of them to his favorite courtiers the hand which lord cromwell and other reformers had in his disliked and almost immediately annulled marriage of anne of cleves the artifices of bishop gardner bonner and other papists  together with his own peevish humor  proved a remarkable check to every attempt toward further reformation from henceforth to his death henry prohibited all importing of foreign books or printing any part of scripture before they were examined by him and his council or the bishop of the diocese he commanded that all decriers of the old popish ceremonies should be punished and that such as argued against ransubstantiation should be put to death on this oot pious lambert whose last words were none ut christ none but christ was condemned and burnt  in      the parliament made the state of religion till worse by their act of the six artieles which estalished transubstantiation the withholding of the acramental cup from the people the celibate of the clergy vows of single life in others private mass and auricular confession and enacted that whosoever should speak preach or write against transubstantiation should be burnt as heretics and their estates be forfeited to the king and such as should dispute against the other points mentioned should suffer death as felons without the benefit of clergy that such as merely spoke or wrote against them should for the first fault forfeit all they had to the king and ly in prison during his pleasure and for the second suffer death  all the clergy were appointed to read this act from their pulpits once every quarter of a year cranmer opposed the making of it for three days bishop shaxton and latimer were cast into prison for speaking against it latimer continued there till henrys death but shaxton recanted and under mary became a most furious persecutor henry having granted commissions to the bishops and their commissaries to hold quarterly meetings for prosecuting of offenders against said act five hundred were immediately imprisoned but his pardoning of cranmer and lord cromwell discouraged the popish zealots till they had got the latte destroyed this parliament also enacted that proclamations of the king or under his eal should b held of equal authority with an act of parliament  they were consistent with the standing laws and customs of the realm and did not extend to loss of estate liberty or life they also appointed the remainin monasteries and religious houses to be suppressed which was quickly done thus in a few years    monasteries  0 colleges   0 hospitals and    chantries and free chapels were empried of their inhabitants and furniture and many of them demolished their valuable libraries were through ignorance often sold to bookbinders for a trifle  lord cromwells hand in henrys marriage wit the immediately disliked princess of cleves lost hi his wonted favor the duke of norfolk feared hi opposing of henrys marriage with miss howard queen annes cousin who was executed about a year after for lewdness the papists hated him for his activity in promoting reformation he was therefore attainted of high treason in much the same manner he had done some relations of cardinal pole sometime before as it is probable he had henrys order for doing what was laid to his charge he was condemned without being allowed to speak in his own vindication almost immediately after his execution two lutheran ministers who had been condemned unheard were burnt for hints against popery in their sermons while four papists who had denied henrys supremacy were hanged about this time henry having corrected a tract called the erudition of a christian man drawn up by some divines and approved by the parliament published it as the standard of the says of his subjects its matter and plan were much like to those of the institutions above mentioned an order for reading the english bible seems to have been issued about this time  about this time bishop bonner of london published some injunctions for his clergy which from their nature seem to have been imposed on him by henry probably at the request of cranmer they required clergymen to read every day a chapter of the bible with some gloss upon it and to study the book compiled by the bishops that no curate should be employed without being first examined by the bishop or his officers that they should instruct their people in english how to believe pray and live according to the will of god that they should endeavor to reconcile such as were at variance and be good examples of love and forgiveness to their flock that they should permit none to go to taverns or alehouses or to use unlawful games on sabbaths or holy days in time of divine worship that they should perform the duties of their office decently and diligently use no unlawful games and never go to alehouses or taverns without urgent necessity that no plays or interludes should be acted in their churches that in preaching they should explain the whole gospel and epistle for the day according to the opinion of some learned doctor and insist chiefly on such places as may best stir up their hearers to prayer and good works that none below a bishop should preach without a license from his majesty or the bishop of the diocese  when popery prevailed few sermons were preached but in lent and in these scarce any care was taken to acquaint hearers with the mind of god but to extol the ceremonies of the church and stir up men to an enthusiastic devotion  cranmer did what he could to provide proper preachers and to leave the most eminent to labor in an itinerant manner but so few could be had that the most of the nation continued in gross ignorance to help the weak and restrain the wicked and erroneous from misleading the people a book of homilie on the epistles and gospels for the year containing plain paraphrases on and practical exhortations from them was published which were to be read to congregations by persons not licensed to preach  meanwhile the licensed preachers having frequent complaints brought to his majesty against them began for their own security to read their sermons and so introduced that lifeless and absurd custom now so common in the british dominions  in      the parliament indirectly established the contents of the erudition of a christian man henry was submitted to as an infallible pope having the faith and consciences of his subjects at his disposal even cranmer and his reforming brethren believed the whole government of the church to depend on the magistrates will and hence took out their commissions to hold their bishoprics only during his majestys pleasure and to exercise authority by his direction and allowance in      a faint attempt was made to reform the ecclesiastical worship henry published an exhortation to prayer and a litany in which the virgin mary angels archangels and all the orders of blessed saints were invoked the rest of it was much the same with that which is still used in the english church no doubt cranmer had a hand in the composition but as his power with henry was now much sunk it was little regarded by the subjects he also obtained some mitigation of the bloody statute of the six articles that none should be convicted upon it but by the oaths of twelve persons and that all information against preaching should be within forty days and the prosecution within a year nevertheless belenian adams liscals anne askew and others were burnt because they were not able to believe transubstantiation all the books published by tindal frith joy barnes and other protestants were ordered to be burnt the parliament appeared in earnest to reduce the nation to their wonted darkness of popery they declared the catholic church judge of all controversies in religion they appointed tindals bibles and all books contrary to the six articles set forth or to what may be set forth by his majesty to be destroyed they condemned all writings against transubstantiation they prohibited all annotations upon or preambles to english bibles or new testaments they prohibited all reading of the bible in churches  or of the english new testament by husbandmen artificers apprentices servants women or any other of weak capacities or low stations they enacted that whoever should be convicted of preaching or maintaining any thing contrary to his majestys instructions made or to be made should for the first offense recant for the second bear a faggot and for the third be burnt thus stood matters respecting religion when the proud peevish and corpuent henry viii died of an ulcer in his leg january    a d       his son edward an hopeful youth of nine years of age succeeded him his father in his last will had named sixteen persons to govern the kingdom till he should be eighteen years of age to whom other twelve were added as privy counselors the earl of hartford uncle of edward and afterward duke of sommerset was chosen protector king edward himself the archbishops cranmer and holgate the bishops holbeach goodric latimer and ridley with secretary paget and admiral lisle were the most noted on the protestant side the princess mary the earl of southampton and bishops tonstal gardner and bonner supported the popish  power being chiefly in the hands of the protestants all prosecution upon the statute of the six artieles was stopped and such as had been imprisoned for religion were liberated miles coverdale afterward bishop of exeter hooper of gloucester john rogers and many other exiles for truth came home and served in the church immediately after edwards coronation protestants began to preach against the use of images in churches and of masses for souls departed  having begun their administration the regents and counselors as in the former reign required the bishops to take out new commissions bearing their subjection to his majesty and that they held their offices and privileges only during his pleasure this cranmer and his fellow reformers hoped would bridle such as inclinced to popery as the inferior clergy and even most of the bishops were intolerably ignorant cranmer assisted by some others composed a second book of homilies or plain discourses o the fundamental articles of the christian religion to be read where none was able to preach these is the number of twelve related to the use of scripture the misery of mankind by sin salvation by christ true faith good works christian love oaths apostasy fear of death obedience to superiors  whoredom and religious contention to procur the consent of gardner cranmer showed them first to him but he would hear of no alteration in doctrine till edward should be major nevertheless the greater part of the regents approved them  as henry by one of his last acts of parliament had empowered his sons council to issue forth proclamations of equal authority with those of the king the regents resolved to begin with a general visitation of the church a letter was dispatched in edwards name to all the bishops suspending their jurisdiction during the time of visitation and prohibiting the other clergy to preach without his license any where but in their own churches this was intended to restrain the popish priests from spreading mischief while protestant preachers could obtain license to preach wherever they had opportunity in this visitation the kingdom was divided into six circuits and two gentlemen a civilian a divine and a register were appointed for each as the divines were intended for the instruction of the people as well as for examination of ecclesiastical affairs six of the most grave and popular ridley madew briggs cottisford joseph and farrar were appointed for this work along with the late homilies these visitors carried with them    instructions from edward to be distributed among the bishops and parochial clergy many of them the same with these formerly prescribed by lord cromwell when he visited the churches as vicar general under henry viii they principally required that all ecclesiastical persons should observe the laws relative to the kings prerogatives should preach once every quarter of a year against pilgrimages and prayers to images and exhort to works of faith and charity that such images as had been abused to superstition should be taken down by the clergy only that where no sermon is the lords prayer the creed and ten commandments be repeated from the pulpit to the people that within three months every church be provided with a bible and within twelve with erasmus paraphrase upon the new testament that none who cannot repeat the lords prayer the creed and the ten commandments or who are at enmity with their neighbors be admitted to the lords supper that the gospel and epistle at high mass and the first and second lesson for every sabbath and holy day be read in english that one chapter of the new testament be read at mattins and another of the old at evensong that clergymen often visit the sick and instruct them with passages of scripture in english that for avoiding disputes about precedence there be no more processions around churches or church yards that all shrines tables candlesticks trindills or rolls of wax pictures paintings and other monuments of idolatry or feigned miracles be removed from churches etc that the people be instructed not to despise the ceremonies still retained but to beware of sprinkling their beds with holy water ringing o bells or using of consecrated candles for driving away devils that patrons who dispose of livings by simoniacal pactions shall for that time forfeit their righ of presentation to the king that the book of homilie be read that dignified clergymen below bishops shall at least preach twice a year that priests shall be reverently and charitably used for their works sake these and some others respecting instruction and order were enjoined under pain of excommunication sequestration or deprivation as their ordinary should answer to the king the injunctions for bishops required that they should see to their clerg and peoples exact observation of the preceding injunctions should preach four times a year within their own diocese unless they had a reasonable excuse that their chaplains should be able and diligen preachers of gods word that they should ordai none but such as would preach the doctrine set fort in the homilies gardener and bonner refused t comply with these injunctions and on that accoun were imprisoned but soon after liberated  the parliament having met repealed all the law which made any thing treasonable but what ha been specified in the act of the   th of edward iii they repealed the act of the six articles and what depended on it together with the acts that made the royal proclamations of equal authority with acts of parliament or declared any thing felony which was not held such before they enacted that whoever should own the popes supremacy or write against that of the king or should burlesque the administration of the lords supper now to be in both bread and wine should be punished that all private masses should be disused that all bishops shall be appointed by his majestys letters patent and continue in office only during his pleasure that all processes in spiritual courts be carried on in his name and sealed with his seal excepting some courts belonging to the archbishop of canterbury contrary to the solicitations of cranmer and his fellow bishops they bestowed on edward all the lands of chantries which had not been granted to his father with all the oblations pertaining to them for obits anniversaries and lamps together with the guild lands enjoyed by any fraternities on like accounts they also commanded monks to remain in their places and apply themselves to handy labor but this act was soon after repealed the convocation which chiefly consisted of papists did little more than allow the lawfulness of priests marriage and of giving the sacramental cup to the people the lower house petitioned the upper that the commission of    for reforming the ecclesiastical laws might be revived that what the bishops and divines had done for correcting the offices for divine service might be laid before them and that the inferior clergy might be readmitted into the house of commons or at least no act relative to religion or the clergy be made without their consent  the protestants abroad laboring under terrible distress several of them fled into england  of these peter martyr was made professor of divinity at oxford and bucer at cambridge ochinus who afterward prepared the way for socinianism and fagius had pensions granted them and were of excellent use in the universities meanwhile the common people of england continued mad upon their old heathenish rites processions wakes carrying of candles etc the pulpitary contentions between popish and protestant preachers was exceeding great all preaching without licenses from his majesty or the primate was therefore prohibited till an uniformity in worship should be got established two archbishops and sixteen or seventeen bishops and six divines were appointed to examine and reform the offices of the church they began which the eucharist and left it much the same as in the mass book and only added what was necessary to correspond with the communion in both kinds they left auricular confession as a matter indifferent after receiving the lords supper the priest was directed to turn himself to the people and read the exhortation and then require the impenitent to withdraw left the devil should enter into them with the elements after a little pause followed the confession of sins and absolution at the end of this office was hinted his majestys intent to proceed to further reformation in correcting the other offices of worship they overlooked the word of god and composed the evening and morning service as it now stands from the popish missals of sarum york hereford bangor and lincoln only there was no confession or absolution from the same materials they formed the litany as at present only elizabeth caused strike out the prayer for deliverance from the detestable enormities of popery before that time it was common for preachers after reading of their text to bid prayers directing the people for whom and what they should pray that every one might then pray silently by himself in the office of baptism the childs forehead and breast was to be marked with the sign of the cross the devil to be expelled by exorcism and the child thrice dipped in the font on its sides and breast unless it was very weak it was then to be wrapped in white vestments and to be anointed with oil on the head with a short prayer for the descent of the holy ghost in confirmation the children being catechized the bishop signed them with the sign of the cross and laid his hands upon them in the name of the father son and holy ghost in the office for burial the soul of the deceased was recommended to the mercy of god and forgivenness of sin ready admission to heaven and a happy resurrection at the last day prayed for to the grief of hooper rogers and other foreign divines who reckoned them appendages of the idolatrous mass and badges of antichrist the romish habits of clergymen were too earnestly retained by cranmer and ridley for fear of too much displeasing the papists  this book of common prayer was never laid before the convocation the popish bishops of norwich hereford chichester and westminster protested against it but the parliament in january      appointed it to be used through the whole kingdom under pain of six months imprisonment and loss of a years salary for the first fault  forfeiture of all their preferments and a years imprisonment for the econd  forfeiture of all their goods and imprisonment for life for the third this parliament permitted the marriage of priests and for the encouagement of fishing prohibited eating of flesh in lent the princess mary absolutely refused comiance with this new liturgy the most of the people were highly displeased with it being exceeingly sorry to lose their wakes processions many hoidays censing of images church ales etc peter martyr was molested for his theological instructions t oxford he offered to defend his doctrine  not long after a public disputation was held ridey had another at cambridge the popish dispuants deeply entrenched themselves in the unintelligible jargon of the schoolmen while martyr and ridley placed their principal dependence on the oracles of god both parties claimed the victory  not content with words the popish clergy roused their votaries to arms the rebels in devonshire amounted to  0000 strong they demanded of edward a restoration of the six articles the performance of mass in latin the elevation and adoration of the sacred wafer in the eucharist the withholding of the sacramental cup from the people the reerection of images in churches the renewal of supplications for souls in purgatory the calling in and prohibiting of all english bibles the rejection of the new service book and restoration of the old forms of worship the court returned them a soft answer but only the edge of the sword could bring them to reason in norfolk the rebels headed by one ket a tanner amounted to  0000 but the ear of warwick with scarce  000 dispersed them  meanwhile bonner of london being suspected of disloyalty was appointed to preach a sermon in which he should declare his persuasion of the kings supremacy but having hated or forgotten to do so he was deposed and imprisoned and ridley of westminster was also made bishop of london  some anabaptists having fled hither from germany were hunted out and prosecuted for their enthusiastical nonsense and blasphemy joan bocker a woman plainly delirious was burnt for some whimsical expressions concerning our saviors not being conceived of the substance of mary cranmer to his lasting reproach instigated the reluctant prince to sign the warrant for her execution george vann a poor harmless devotee of the same sect was also committed to the flames for perhaps very ignorantly affirming that only the father is the tru god  in a d    0 the parliament revived henrys ac for appointing    commissioners to reform the eccelesiastical canons and named the persons for this work they finished their work in fiftyone sections edward dying before it received his confirmation it never had the royal sanction annexed to it but archbishop parker published a copy of it under the title of reformatio legum anglicanarum etc in which no punishment is mentioned for heretics the parliament also authorized a book of ordination compiled by six bishops and six divines which is much the same with that now in use in consequence of all these reformations in worship the council ordered all clergymen to deliver up their massbooks and other formulas to proper persons appointed by the king  ridley now bishop of london began to visit his diocese besides the abovementioned injunctions the council now appointed him and his episcopal brethren to remove all altars out of churches and provide communion tables in their stead  that so people might no more imagine the lords supper a sacrifice day bishop of chichester and heath of worcester insisted that christians have an altar  and refused to obey the council and on that account were deprived of their office popular preachers were sent through the country to remove mens prejudices against the removal of the altars which had no contemptible effect as the people imagined that the priestly apparel added superior virtue and sanctity to their ministrations it would have been proper to correct their mistake hooper who had resided at zurich in switzerland during the debates concerning the unlawfulness of compliance with things indifferent in themselves when abused to superstition occasioned by the emperors interim form of religion having returned home and preached with great applause was appointed bishop of gloucester by edwards letters patent he declined accepting it as he abhorred the swearing by saints even before the holy ghost in the oath or supremacy convinced of the justness of his objection edward struck out that phrase hooper also looked on the use of the popish vestments as sinful edward and his council were inclined to dispense with the habits but cranmer and especially ridley and goodric insisted that as the things were indifferent in themselves they ought to be retained in obedience to the law hooper consulted peter martyr bucer and the genevan and swiss divines on this point they were all of opinion that these relics of popery ought to be removed from the church but thought that hooper might comply rather than be rendered useless and breed a schism in a reforming church his case was truly pitiable his brethren would neither suffer him to live without being a bishop nor admit him in the manner his conscience approved after suffering confinement imprisonment and other hardships he at last consented to permit others to put on the vestments at his consecration and once at court being admitted he labored beyond his strength preaching sometimes twice or thrice a day to the poor people that hungered after the word of god most of the reforming clergy particularly latimer coverdale tailor philpot bradford samson etc were of the same mind with hooper concerning the habits nay even cranmer and ridley seem to have relaxed their bigotry and to increase the friends of reformation admitted samson and others without them if they did not also intend to procure an act for their abolishment it is certain that when they died martyrs they contemned them and indeed it was strange for men of such piety and sense to mark such immoderate zeal for trifles in a country where john a lasco and other foreigners were allowed to worship god in their own manner  gardener and his other popish clergy did not reckon the deeds of the governing council valid nor themselves bound to obey them after he had been imprisoned for his disobedience gardener still behaved contemptibly and was therefore deprived of his bishopric and sent to the tower in which he continued prisoner till q mary relieved him as he and his brethren had taken out commissions for their office only during his majestys pleasure they could scarcely complain of such severities his deprivation and vesays resignation on account of his old age making way for scory and coverdale to fill their sees the balance of the episcopal power was in the hand of the reformers they therefore proceeded to correct the doctrines of the church cranmer and ridley drew up fortytwo articles the same in substance with the thirtynine now used after these had been corrected by some bishops and again by cranmer they were ratified by the privy council without being presented to either convocation or parliament along with them was printed a short catechism composed it is said by poinet bishop of winchester translated by cranmer and authorized by the kinds letters patent  the reformers proceeded to a second amendment of their book of common prayer a short confession of sins and absolution of the penitent introduced the daily service and a rehearsal of the ten commandments with a short pause between each while the people kneel along with a declaration that this posture did not import any adoration of the elements ntroduced that of the communion to please the papists elizabeth caused the last to be erazed but it was restored at the restoration of charles ii the use of oil in confirmation extreme unction prayer or the dead in the office for burial auricular confession crossing in confirmation and the lords supper were laid aside the parliament appointed this liturgy alone to be used through the whole kingdom after allhallow      they declared marriages of priests valid and their children capable of heirship they reunited the bishoprics of london and westminster alas that we should find them permitting fishers reapers and the like to labor on the lords day  day bishop of chichester heath of worcester and tonstal of durham being deprived of their office on account of disobedience to the laws edward appointed a visitation of all the churches and to bring in all superfluous plate etc into the exchequer or dispose of it for the benefit of the poor notwithstanding all this reforming care many of the courtiers were grasping at the churchs property while not a few clergymen were almost starved and obliged to become kitchen clerks surveyors receivers etc for a livelihood while many protestants adorned their profession others were a disgrace to it some principal reformers were too much inclined to stretch the laws in their own favor and to persecute such as were not of their opinion their progress in reformation notwithstanding their many powerful and crafty opponents and so deep rooted customs is an admirable display of the interposing power of the lord  both edward and they intended to have proceeded further in removing the remains of popery and in settling the government and discipline of the church in his diary he laments that the ignorance scandalous lives and popish inclinations of some of his bishops hindered his restoring of the primitive discipline in the manner he wished bucer presented to him a platform of discipline bearing that scandalous persons should be excluded from the sacraments that the old popish vestments should be laid aside that there should be no half communion service that godfathers should not answer in name of children to be baptized that the lords day should be strictly sanctified and frequent fasts but not lent observed that bishops should apply themselves only to their spiritual employment that coadjutors should be added to some of them and each of them have a council of presbyters that country bishops should be set over twenty or thirty parishes who should often conveen their clergy and strictly inspect them that provincial synods be held twice a year and have commissioners from the king to observe their conduct cranmer was much of the same mind he disliked the government of the church by convocations in which deans archdeacons and cathedral clergy have more influence than the representatives of the real pastors of the church he appears to have drawn up a more perfect book of common prayer but could not get it introduced on account of the popish inclinations of his subordinate bishops and clergy  the reformation of the english church being now at its height it may be proper to observe that in their doctrine of original sin predestination justification effectual grace and good works they corresponded with augustine and calvin that they were not satisfied with the discipline they had obtained though they thought they might submit to it till it could be rectified by authority that they believed but two orders of clergy viz bishops and deacons and that bishops and priests were but different ranks of the same order and that they acknowledged fellowship with other protestant churches which had no bishops and hence till the end of elizabeths reign they never urged any reordination of their presbyters  as his sister mary as well as the queen of scots were papists and elizabeth had been declared  bastard by the parliament the regents or rather he duke of northumberland advised edward still  minor as he lay dying in      to bequeath his rown to jean gray eldest daughter to lady franes his cousin and the duke of suffolk a lady of exraordinary qualities piety and zeal and next in blood after the three princesses above mentioned the council and cranmer himself after much oposition to it signed this disposal of the crown to er great grief jean was proclaimed queen immeditely after edwards death and an army raised to maintain her claim but mary having by her perdious promises to the suffolkers and others to make o change relative to religion deceived the people aised an army and without any bloodshed made her entrance into london four weeks after the death of her brother bonner gardener and other papists were immediately liberated from prison in council she solemnly declared that notwithstanding her fixedness in her own religion she would compel none to it but by the preaching of gods word next day by his inveighing at st pauls against the late reformation dr bourne so provoked his audience that his life was in danger but rogers and bradford at the hazard of their own carried him off safe he and his popish friends quickly rewarded their kindness with imprisonment and burning  to prevent like tumults for the future mary prohibited all preaching without special license declaring that she would not compel her subjects to receive her religion till further order should be taken for it alarmed by this universal prohibition of protestant preaching while papists got licenses the suffolkers depending on their merit in her enthronement and her solemn promise to them deputed some to represent their grievances to mary she rebuked them as insolent one of them having put her in mind of her promise had for his reward three days on the pillory and his ears cut off as a defamer bonner of london gardener of winchester tonstal of durham heath of worcester and day of chichester were restored to their sees hooper who had with great zeal supported the rights of mary against jean gray along with coverdale tailor and rogers were imprisoned for preaching after she had prohibited it cranmer who had saved her life from her fathers intended destruction of it and had contended for her claim to the crown and holgate archbishop of york soon after shared the same fate the foreign protestants were commanded to leave the kingdom bishops poynet barlow scory coverdale and bale deans cox haddon horn turner and samson together with grindal javel sandys rainolds pilkington whitehead fox rough knox and about forty other preachers and eight hundred principal professors of the protestant religion sled into foreign countries to prevent their escape the council sent orders to all sea ports to permit none to leave the kingdom without passports  on the first of october      mary was crowned by bishop gardener assisted by ten of his diocesan brethren dressed in their romish mitres copes and rosiers in a parliament procured to her mind by bribery and every other shameful method the laws of edward concerning religion after a tedious deate of six days were wholly repealed severe punishments were enacted against those that should are to disturb the restored popish worship or break down altars or images upon the  d of november rchbishop cranmer lord guildford jean gray and he two sons of northumberland were indicted of high treason in attempting to set up another for queen they all confessed the charge but cranmer appealed to his judges with what reluctance he had signed edwards exclusion of mary by means of   0 new presentations to ecclesiastical livings and other methods the convocation of which bonner was president was entirely to her majestys taste  they all agreed to subscribe the doctrine of transubstantiation except philpot philips haddon cheey aylmer and young who disputed against it hree days being answered with little more than hreatenings and reproach weston the prolocutor old them that though they had the scripture on their side he and his friends had the sword on theirs most of the common people were zealous even to madness for the restoration of their old idolatry and uperstition  provoked by marys apparent intention to marry philip heir to the spanish crown wyat a trusty papist in      raised an army of four thousand forces against her and attempted an entrance into london his army being quickly dispersed himself was taken and executed pretending that his rebellion was raised by protestant influence lady jean gray and lord guildford her husband were executed the princess elizabeth narrowly escaped wyat to save his own life once accused her but when he saw that he must die he declared her innocent gardener procured a warrant from some privy counselors for her execution but the lieutenant of the tower would not make use of it till he had consulted queen mary her sister she disowned it but continued her favors to gardener  having got the nation somewhat settled mary appointed her bishops to visit it and rectify disorders her instructions for their procedure were drawn up by gardener after an angry recital of the innovations of edward they were charged to execute the laws which were in force under king henry viii but not to proceed in her majestys name nor exact the oath of supremacy these encroaching on the papal authority  to separate clergymen from their wives  to reordain such as had entered by the form prescribed under edward or supply the defects of their ordination by the unction priestly vestments etc  to compel all persons to attend the church the archbishop of york and bishops of st davids chester and bristol were deprived of their sees on account of their marriage and those of lincoln gloucester and hereford by her majestys pleasure soon after the sixteen vacant bishoprics were filled up with candidates to her taste multitudes of protestant preachers were turned ou for being married even though they were willing to leave their wives and for nonappearance  and without being heard  philips spanish gold having reconciled almost at the papists to marys marriage with him she has the more opportunity to persecute the protestants as they had complained of their usage in the disputes of the late convocation the court resolved to mortify them with a repetition of it at a second dispute before the university of oxford cranmer and ridley and latimer were taken from their prison to manage it on the protestant side in the debate which turned upon transubstantiation and the propitiatory sacrifice of the mass they behaved with great modesty and presence of mind but their enemies bore them down with continual shouting noise and derision sometimes four or five of them speaking all at once after all they were required to subscribe the articles of debate as if they had been vanquished they refused and on this account to their great satisfaction were declared heretics the papists intended to have exposed them in like manner before the university of cambridge but the three bishops above mentioned with seven others published from their prison a declaration that since they had met with so much abuse and misrepresentation at oxford they would dispute no more unless in writing and before her majesty or council or her parliament at the same time they emitted a summary confession of their faith that the holy scriptures are the sole supreme judge of all religious debates that justification is by faith alone through the imputed righteousness of christ that holiness of nature is necessary in order to produce good works that there is no purgatorial state after this life that baptism and the lords supper ought to be administered according to christs institution that the denial of the sacramental cup to the people  transubstantiation and adoration of the elements and the sacrifice of the mass ought to be condemned that marriage is lawful to all men and in the conclusion they charge the subjects not to rebel against the queen but to obey her cheerfully in all points not forbidden by the law of god  gardiners intrigues with charles the german emperor had long kept cardinal pole from returning to his native country but his attainder being repealed he now came home papally invested with legantine powers and in his speech to the parliament nov    he warmly invited them and the nation to reconcile themselves with their spiritual father and return to the catholic church they readily acquiesced and had prescribed for their penance their annulment of all laws made against his holiness authority since the  0th year of henry viii they received the popes pardon of all their sins during that period on their knees and then went to the chapel royal in solemn procession and sung te deum and spent the rest of the day in revelling and mirth because the lost children were now recovered to the pope the parliament supplicated his holiness to confirm some marriages judicial processes settlements of lands and erections of bishoprics cathedrals and colleges the cardinal legate admitted their requests but denounced the heavy judgment of god against all such as did not restore all the ecclesiastical goods which they had in their hands the pope refused to confirm poles restrictions and published a bull excommunicating all those who did not restore whatever they had pertaining to the church terribly afraid of papal damnation mary delivered up all that was in her power some of her subjects were not so timorous but threatened to defend their claims by the edge of their sword mary repaired the old monasteries and erected new ones as fast as she could  made inquiry who had pillaged them under her father and brother and commanded bonner to craze from the public registers whatever had been done against the pope or monks as a terrible scandal to the nation to the great joy of the popish clergy the statute of richard confirmed by henry iv for burning of heretics was restored to its wonted vigor  it seems cardinal pole lost the favor of the pope for proposing to bring back the english heretics by instructions and arguments gardener enraged by the reprinting of his book which inculcated subjection to henrys ecclesiastical supremacy and mary were furiously bent upon severities and thought that a few examples would terrify the rest into their will hooper rogers sanders and tailor were burnt in the beginning of february      and eleven more in march and april their triumphant courage and constancy confirmed their protestant brethren and made some papists think better of their cause the english bishops attempted to throw the odium of these executions upon king philip  who to return it on themselves caused his spanish confessor preach against such severities gardener craftily turned over the management of them upon bonner who brutish as he was pretended to be sick of them about this time the exiles abroad by a printed paper called her majesty to remember that during her brothers reign no papists had been put to death and even jews were tolerated and they urged the nobles and commons to interceed with her to forbear shedding the blood of her protestant subjects or at least allow them to leave the country this had no good effect as if bonner had been too mild philip and mary by a letter quickened him to his pastoral work of extirpating heretics  accordingly in the months of june july august and september no less than twentyfour were burnt of whom holy bradford was one not long after ridley latimer and philpot shared the same fate after being decoyed and terrified into a recantation cranmer publicly professed his repentance of it and suffered the slames in the most courageous manner marking his grief for his fall by first burning his unworthy hand which had signed his recantation cardinal pole now archbishop of canterbury on account of his mildness was deprived of his legantine powers gardener had died miserable in both body and mind but bonner continued his murderous fury the year      exhibited one continual series of cruel persecutions numbers were burnt at a time because they could not believe transubstantiation and such things as are equally absurd in imitation of the spanish inquisition mary erected a court of twentyone commissioners most of them clergymen for the trial of heretics and prohibited all her subjects to pray for the persecuted protestants or to wish that god would bless them in her reign according to warner     were burnt for religion of whom four were bishops and twentyone inferior clergymen fiftyfour others were prosecuted for heresy seven of whom were whipped and sixteen perished in prison lord burleigh says that four hundred suffered publicly besides those that were murdered in prison the bones of bucer and fagius were dug up called to give an account of their faith and not compearing at the bar were condemned to be burnt for heresy peter martyrs wife having once been a nun had her bones dug up and buried in a dunghill  meanwhile the contentions among the reformed added to their misery while some at the peril of their lives preached to such as would attend them in the night and one congregation in london had five preachers of whom rough the martyr and scambler and bentham afterward protestant bishops were a part  others troubled their fellow prisoners with their disputes some of them being arians in opinion were so troublesome in the kings bench that the marshal was obliged to shut them up by themselves harry heart true and abingdon declaimed against all learning and fathers and labored to infect their companions with pelagian errors ridley wrote them a letter and bradford another in order to convince them of their mistakes careless had much conference with them for the same end they even wrote against one another in the prison i do not find that any of these arians or freewillers dared to risk a martyrdom for truth but the contentions they raised drew reproach on the protestant religion and made the papists to triumph over it  those that fled to foreign parts were no less plagued with contentions the lutheran clergy except melancthon and a few others of his mild temper opposing their having shelter among them most of them fixed their residence at embden strasburgh zurich basil and some other places in flanders switzerland and germany especially at frankfort on the mein there whittingham williams sutton and wood with their families and friends took up their abode in      and were allowed by the magistrates to meet for public worship in the french church but at different hours they and the french exiles agreed to subscribe the confession of the french protestants and to make no quarrel one with another about rites of worship the english also agreed among themselves to forbear anwering aloud after the minister and to drop the litany and the surplice and that after a general confession of sins they should sing a psalm and then the minister pray preach and again pray subjoining the lords prayer sing another psalm and dismiss the congregation with a solemn blessing having agreed to choose a minister and deacon they invited their scattered brethren to share of their happiness as the principal preachers and students of divinity had settled at strasburgh zurich and bail for their instruction or employment by printers the frankforters begged them to send some of their number to be pastors and gave them an account of their platform of worship and discipline the strasburgh divines demurring on their request they invited john knox from geneva haddon from strasburgh and lever from zurich the students at zurich reused to come unless they would follow the service ook prescribed by k edward the frankforters eplied that they were ready to comply with it as far as the word of god required but they did not choose to practice indifferent ceremonies in a counry where they were disliked and especially as edward had altered many things to the better and ntended to have laid aside more of these rites soon after grindal and chambers brought a letter from ixteen learned exiles at strasburgh insisting for full conformity to the service book as neglect of it would infer a condemnation of the english martyrs knox bale and fox now at frankfort and fourteen others replied that they had omitted as few ceremonies as possible that the martyrs in england were not dying for the ceremonies but believed they might be altered to the better and that the divines of strasburgh had better not come than attempt to reduce the congregation to the use of the service book the frankforters having consulted calvin he replied that there were in the english liturgy many intolerable fooleries which godly men ought to reform as they had opportunity and that he knew not what they could mean who were so fond of the dregs of popery where they had full liberty to establish whatever was most for edification they therefore agreed to retain their own order  about the end of april      dr cox who had been tutor to king edward a man of great pride and of no small credit with his countrymen and some of his friends coming to frankfort disturbed the worship of god by answering aloud after the minister next lords day one of them without the consent of the congregation mounted the pulpit and read the liturgy knox in his sermon taxed them with breach of agreement and affirmed that some things in the service book were superstitious cox prevailed with the magistrates to forbid knox preaching any more in that place knoxs friends applying to the magistrates they appointed the congregation to unite with the french church in both discipline and ceremonies according to their first agreement provoked by this cox and his friends in a manner superlatively base accused knox of high treason against the emperor on account of some strong expressions in his english admonition published about four years before unwilling to risk the emperors resentment the senate of frankfort respectfully desired knox to leave the place cox and his party strengthened by the arrival of other divines procured the magistrates permission to use the service book knoxs friends offered to submit the dispute to the arbitration of foreign divines but they refused and solicited calvin to countenance their ceremonialism he absolutely refused and told them that he saw no reason for burdening the church with such offensive and hurtful things and that their conduct toward knox was neither brotherly nor pious  and besought them to study peace among themselves this missive having no effect upon these ceremonialists the old congregation were obliged to yield and leave the place some of them went with fox to basil others to geneva where they chose knox to be their pastor and formed their church after the model of that place  they published their plan in english directed to their brethren at home and hinted that finding some rites of the service book apt to do hurt they had laid them aside as hezekiah did the brazen serpent and the primitive church their love feasts in a few months after they had forced out their brethren horn pastor of the new frankforters fell into a contest with ashby one of the principal members the elders gave judgment against ashby he appealed to the people after the most furious and shameful contention the magistrates were obliged to interpose and order them to draw up a more perfect plan of discipline which might regulate their affairs the congregation did so and most of them subscribed it but horn and about twelve others dissented and appealed to the magistrates  after patient hearing of both parties the magistrates decided in favor of the congregation upon which horn and his friends left the place  in      mary died after a short reign unhappy to herself and her subjects the capture of calais by the french bloody persecution contagious distempers excessive storms and inundations had rendered most of the nation absolutely miserable mary was the object of her husbands contempt she was grossly ignorant melancholy cruel and revengeful her conscience being blindly directed by her confessor she never but once pardoned a person accused of heresy her parliament hated her cruelty and unwillingly granted her supplies none but the popish clergy lamented her death  under her sister elizabeth had run no small hazard of her life and had met with no small abuse and hardship in her imprisonment gardener had often moved for her death king philip had befriended her intending it is iike to make her his queen after marys death she had scarcely ascended the throne when she manifested too much of her father and that she affected pompous worship and as much of the popish religion as could consist with the maintenance of her own legitimacy and supreme headship over the church she was crowned in the popish manner and notified her accession to his holiness but he claimed england as a fief of the romish see and declared it high presumption in her a bastard to think of taking the crown without his consent this produced her immediate breach with rome as some protestant preachers began to make use of the service book without license the papists took the alarm to prevent disputes she prohibited all preaching till the parliament should meet and allowed the clergy only to read the gospels and epistles for the day and the ten commandments in english and to repeat the lord prayer and the creed  the exiles abroad prepared to return home and reconciliatory letters passed betwixt them these of geneva insisted for an entire and mutual burial of all offenses and that their brethren of basil strasburgh frankfort worms etc would unite with them in laboring to obtain a settled form o worship like to that of the best reformed churches which they had seen they promised to join in requesting her majesty that nothing burdensome to tender consciences might be imposed after such preparation the exiles returned home with nothing but their learning and experience their friends abroad wrote after them beseeching them to labor to have their reformation as complete as possible at first and to lay aside all relics of popery otherwise they might afterward find all struggling to remove them to no purpose jewel cox grindal pilkington and others in their answers professed their concern to do so and complained that the nation were so careless about the purity of worship and that elizabeth retained crucifixes crosses lighted consecrated candles and popish vestments in her family and chapel and was bent to have the scriptures received upon the authority of the church but they had not courage to act up to their views or to stand by one another such as supplely complied with her majestys will were promoted to bishoprics etc and such as did not after a temporary permission to preach were suspended and reduced to their former depth of poverty  the ordinary methods of procuring a parliament to the sovereigns will being taken they resumed for the crown all the first fruits and tithes which mary had restored to the church they repealed some of the penal laws they appointed public worship in a known tongue they empowered her majesty to nominate bishops to all the vacant sees  and restored to her the supremacy over the church which had been claimed by her father and brother and required all in public employments civil or sacred to swear an oath acknowledging the same by this supremacy the sovereigns did not claim a power of preaching or administering sacraments but the acts establishing and explaining it make them judges of what doctrine is to be preached they by their delegates in spiritual courts are supreme judges in points of discipline they have power to ratify canons relative to church discipline and government without consent of either convocation or parliament and to appoint whatever ceremonies they think proper for advancing the glory of god and the edification of his church they have the sole power of nominating bishops who must be chosen and no other  and who cannot act but by royal commission no convocation can meet or act without royal indiction and appointment of their business all appeals formerly made to rome fall into the kings chancery to be judged by his delegates thus excepting clerical ministrations the kings of england have the same power as the pope once had  it was next resolved to establish an uniformity of worship and ceremonies to prepare the way elizabeth appointed nine popish bishops to dispute in writing against as many protestants before herself her council and houses of parliament  whether the use of an unknown tongue in the public worship of god be not contrary to scripture and the custom of the primitive church whether every particular church has power to alter her own ceremonies as appears most conducive to the general edification of her members and whether the word of god represents the mass as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the quick and the dead but the popish doctors gave up the debate on the very first day pretending that the catholic cause ought never to be submitted to such a laical arbitration the reformers themselves were not of one mind relative to the ceremonies and the service book some were for introducing the form drawn up by the genevan exiles others among whom elizabeth was chief inclined to retain all the ceremonies which could possibly consist with the purity of doctrine and the independence of the church on the pope she even appointed parker grindal cox pilkington whitehead and some others to review edwards second book of common prayer and to strike out of it all passages that might offend the pope or his friends and to make every body easy with respect to the corporal presence of christ in his supper  but to alter nothing in favor of scrupulous protestants this book thus purged or rather made worse was established by law in edwards time kneeling or standing at the lords supper were held indifferent and only the surplice was at last retained now kneeling was commanded copes and other popish vestments as well as festivals and their eves were reappointed in these modes of worship the parliament required an exact uniformity and that whosoever unnecessarily absented from church should pay a fine of twelve pence for each fault nor had elizabeth been content with all this unless the parliament had empowered her to appoint what further ceremonies she found necessary upon this rock of uniformity the still remaining corruptions and the almost perpetual divisions and often repeated persecutions of the best in the nation were founded in the convocation the popish doctors made a considerable stand for their religion and for disburdening their consciences presented to the lord privy seal a remonstrance in support of transubstantiation the propitiatory sacrifice of the mass the popes supremacy and clergymens ole power to judge of matters of faith or discipline  no sooner was the parliament dissolved in      than all the bishops were required to swear the oath of supremacy acknowledging the queen supreme governor of the church in all causes death having of ate seasonably cut off many of them only fifteen emained all of whom except kitchen of lundaff obstinately refused to take it and were therefore deprived of their sees three of them retired to the continent and the rest were kindly treated in engand even booner white and watson whose hands had been most remarkably stained with protestant blood though imprisoned had a sufficient maintenance allowed them by the queen most of he monks returned to secular employments while he nuns and many others went beyond sea after he bishoprics had remained vacant about a year in opes of the popish bishops conforming whitehead gilpin coverdale knox and samson had offers of them but they refused to accept on account of the ceremonies and vestments grindal parkhurst sandys and some others accepted them with trembling in hopes of an after correction of the settlement as none of the marian bishops would concur in the consecration of parker to be archbishop of canterbury it was performed at lambeth by barlow bishop elect of chichester and scorey elect of hereford who officiated in their surplice and chimere and coverdale once bishop of exeter and hodgkins suffragan of bedford in their long gowns the ceremony was performed by prayer and laying on of hands without gloves sandals ring slippers mitre pall or any other of the aaronical vestments how parker such a zealous stickler for romish apparel could be content with suth plainness i know not as the papists terribly exclaimed against this ordination the parliament about seven years after confirmed it  at first elizabeths bishops were poor and somewhat moderate but as their wealth increased so did their pomp and their lording it over their clerical brethren  the english reformation was now fixed but neither clergy nor people were uniform in their views the court party believed that all power of reforming the church was lodged in the sovereign who might model the doctrine worship and discipline of the church in every thing not contrary to the express statutes of the realm that the church of rome was a true though much corrupted spouse of christ of which the pope was the lawful bishop in his own diocese that christ had appointed no particular form of government in his church but had left it to magistrates to model it as best comported with the laws of their state that the pattern of the first five centuries of the christian church was a more proper standard of church government than that of the apostles in whose time she was in a poor and infant condition and that the religious observation of things indifferent in themselves becomes a divinely commanded duty when required by magistrates  the strict party believed it unscriptural and unreasonable to have the religion of a nation subjected to the will of any mere man that the pope is antichrist the man of sin and son of perdition that the church of rome is not a true church but an idolatrous synagogue of satan that the validity of clerical ordinations cannot safely be suspended on an uninterrupted succession of bishops in the church all along from he apostles that the holy scriptures of the old and new testaments exclusive of the apocrypha are he standard of discipline and government as well s of doctrine and that no regard ought to be paid o the primitive church but what corresponds with he bible that nothing left indifferent by christ ought to be imposed in gods worship by human laws that such rites as have been abused to idolatry or re calculated to render men superstitious ought ot to be reckoned indifferent but unlawful in these ircumstances these however took the oath of supremacy in consequence of her majestys explaining t to mean no more than that she was head over all persons in the church to the exclusion of the pope and his agents  by virtue of the act establishing her supremacy eizabeth erected an high commission court and gave them    articles of injunctions for visiting the churhes much the same as those emitted in the begining of edwards reign which were to be read in every church once every quarter of a year a rule was added concerning bidding of silent prayers in the church and another for taking away the altars and placing communion tables in their stead the obervation of these injunctions was required under pain f suspension deprivation sequestration excommuication etc the most of the commissioners were aymen and any two of them were appointed to exmine the state of churches suspend or deprive nworthy clergymen and put others in their place  to proceed against the obstinate by imprisonment church censures and other legal methods  and to rectify all disorders relative to religion and benefices  as elizabeth retained in her chapel her altar crucifix and lighted candles by day  the service was sung not only with organs but with cornets and sackbuts on the solemn festivals and could not be easily distinguished from that of the popish cathedrals the commissioners displeased her by their destroying of images and other relics of popery in their visitation they found that though scarcely  00 or   0 of the popish clergy had quitted their livings their places could not be supplied many of the reformed exiles scrupling at the terms of uniformity required by the injunctions and elizabeth choosing rather to damn her subjects through ignorance than dispense with a relick of popery  as her majesty was not fond of the doctrinal articles of edward and it was yet unsafe to permit the convocation to judge of them eleven articles concerning the nature of god the sufficiency of the scriptures the nature of the church the power of civil magistrates the power of the pope the rectitude of the newly corrected service book the nullity of the propitiatory sacrifice of the mass the communion in both bread and wine the unprofitableness of images relics and feigned miracles the advantages of true holiness etc  an assent to this confession of faith full compliance with the service book and swearing the oath of allegiance were the terms of ministerial communion such was the obstinate bigotry of elizabeth archbishop parker and their agents that rather than admit a learned and godly preacher that scrupled at a romish habit or ceremony they admitted numbers of a naughty practice and who could scarcely read prayers or sometimes an homily a third book of homilies consisting of    plain discourses concerning the church peril of idolatry good works fasting gluttony and drunkenness excess in apparel prayer public worship in a known language reverence of gods word alms christs birth passion and resurrection worthy receiving of the lords supper gifts of the holy ghost marriage repentance idleness rebellion etc was published for their assistance some congregations had not a sermon in seven years and others scarcely one in twenty the translation of the bible by the exiles at geneva was published with a dedication to elizabeth but as in their notes they had allowed of disobeying tyrannical magistrates and had represented bishops and archbishops as the apocalyptical locusts so much offense was taken at it that for fifteen years it could not be got reprinted in some following years about thirty editions of it were dispersed tindals bible was for the present permitted till the bishops should publish a new translation the dutch and german protestants under john lasco returned to london but the queen disallowing their foreign superintendent they were obliged to choose grindal bishop of london for their head  the popish bishops behaved rudely enough to elizabeth but nothing could make her detest their religion she still loved images and ceremonies in the worship of god and had prohibited clergymens marriage if cecil afterward lord burleigh her renowned secretary had not interposed his nervous solicitations pope pius iv by his nuncio offered to confirm the english liturgy allow the people the sacrament in both bread and wine and annul the decree against her mothers marriage if she would return to the romish church but she could not think of parting with her ecclesiastical supremacy  ferdinand the german emperor and others interceeded with her to allow the papists the free exercise of their religion but she had too much policy to trust them especially as long as mary of scotland her rival and their favorite lived  when archbishop parker visited his diocese in      he found that most of the beneficed clergy were either ignorant mechanics or disguised papists  many churches shut up and in several counties not a sermon preached or even a homily read within twenty miles for several months but parker who before his advancement was humble and modest now like his mistress chose rather to have millions of souls perishing in ignorance than that a pious and learned scrupler at some relics of popery required by the act of uniformity should be allowed to instruct them having finished his visitation parker fixed the lessons of scripture for all the holy days in the year that preachers might no longer have liberty to read what they thought most edifying to their hearers or to read the oracles of god instead of apocryphal fables  to confirm the royal supremacy the parliament in      appointed the oath acknowledging it to be carefully imposed on all the clergy judges and advocates and that the first refusal of it should render them outlaws the second render them traitors but elizabeth and parker protected most of the papists from having occasion to refuse it they also appointed the bible and book of common prayer to be translated into the welsh tongue and a copy of it provided for every cathedral and parish church in their country in the convocation many clergymen were so ignorant that they could not write their own names they agreed upon and subscribed the thirtynine articles which were afterward in part confirmed by the parliament      bishop sandys brought in an address to her majesty beseeching her to remove out of the service or prayer book the warrant for private baptism and for baptism by women  disallow the crossing in baptism and to appoint commissioners for reforming the ecclesiastical laws another paper subscribed by about    members requested that the whole congregation should sing the psalms and organs be laid aside that none but ministers should baptize and they be allowed to forbear signing the baptized with the cross that kneeling at the lords supper be held indifferent that the use of copes surplices and other popish vestments be removed that that which relates to the punishment of nonconformists in the articles be mitigated that all holy days dedicated to the honor of creatures be abrogated or at least people have liberty to attend their ordinary work immediately after public worship this not pleasing another paper was presented requesting that all holy days except sabbath days and festivals relating to christ be abolished that in reading the prayers ministers turn their face to the people that they may hear and be edified that the cross in baptism be omitted as tending to superstition that many being unable to kneel at the sacrament and others kneel and knock superstitiously the order of kneeling may be left to the discretion of every ordinary that no more but the surplice be imposed in the apparel of ministers in executing their office that the use of organs be omitted after much warm disputation this paper was approved by    of the most learned against    of present members but    absents by proxy voting against it and only    for it it was lost by one vote of an absent who had heard nothing of the debate  almost all the noted english divines had testified their dislike of the popish vestments imposed on the clergy sundry foreigners and particularly the genevans had declared against them and advised to a more perfect reformation but so zealous were elizabeth parker and their agents that the great martyrologist fox and coverdale could have no preferment and scarcely liberty to preach on account of their scrupling at such relics of superstition or idolatry parker who directed his clergy not to tender the oath of supremacy to papists except in cases of necessity for fear of distressing them  by elizabeths order drew up some advertisements which obliged every preacher to take out a new license which could not be had without declaring their full consent to the habits and ceremonies many of the best still scrupling he cited them to hi court at lambeth admonished some and threatened others samson and humphreys remarkabl for piety and learning offered to subscribe with some limitations but could obtain none after their imprisonment samson was deprived of all clerical office and humphreys durst not return to oxford elizabeth craftily refused to annex her royal confirmation to parker and his brethrens advertisement concerning habits but ordered that all refusers o them should be punished with suspension and deprivation from their office to prepare the way for reducing the puritan clergy about london john for was prosecuted but it seems they were ashame to deprive him parker begged cecil and some other noblemen to attend him in his dealing with the london nonconformists but they refused being ashamed of such work of an hundred clergymen    were by threatenings and otherwise made to subscribe the terms of conformity thirtyseven among whom parker acknowledged were some of the best preachers absolutely refused and gave in their reasons but were immediately suspended and threatened with deprivation if they did not conform with in three months  the commissioners for visitation of the churche cruelly obliged every clergyman having charge o souls to swear obedience to all royal injunctions letters of the lords of privy council articles and in junctions of their metropolitans and mandates o their bishops and other superiors to gird these in junctions fast upon the puritans spies were appointed in every parish to watch their conduct  that rendered it impossible for them to escape the high commission by such means even london was rendered most miserable for want of preachers bisho grindal indeed prosecuted the puritans or scruple with the utmost reluctance and wished to indulg them but could not for elizabeth and especiall for parker several heads and others of the university of cambridge once and again besought cecil their chancellor that they might be dispensed with as to the habits which gave great offense at court nevertheless that university was long a nest and refuge of puritans they retained their right of sending forth twelve preachers yearly who might preach for life without any license from the bishop which contributed to the edification of many thousand souls meanwhile the other puritan preachers partly fled unto foreign countries partly betook themselves to ecular employments or to be chaplains to persons of rank and many who had large families were educed to beggary  when the refusers of the habits and ceremonies found themselves extremely traduced by their enemies they began to publish tracts for their own vindication the high commissioners procured a deed of the privy council prohibiting the printing or vendng of them provoked with this restraint and with the silencing sequestration and imprisonment of so many of their faithful pastors and preachers for mere scruples at the robes and ceremonies of antichrist many of the people began so separate from the conforming clergy and meet for worship by themselves in doing which they laid aside the liturgy and followed the plan of geneva it ought to be remembered that though the robes were most readily spoken of amidst these contentions yet the puritans complained of many things beside they did not allow of the office of bishops to be superior to that of presbyters or of bishops temporal dignities and secular trusts they disliked the titles and offices of archdeons deans chapters and other officials in cathedral churches they condemned the exorbitant power and oppressive conduct of the bishops and their chancellors and their spiritual courts the putting of excommunication and absolution into the hands of laymen promiscuous admission of people to the lords table however ignorant or licentious they lamented the total want of christian discipline they disliked restriction of ministers to set forms of prayer and the vain repetitions prescribed in the common prayers they disliked several expressions in the office of marriage burial etc and the reading of so much of the apocrypha to the exclusion of a large part of the word of god they complained that there were so many unpreaching pastors so many pluralities and nonresidents and that ministers were intruded by patronage without regard to the choice of the people they detested the observation of so many holy days of human appointment while buying and selling on the lords day were permitted they disapproved instrumental music singing of prayers and other relics of papal forms in cathedral churches they scrupled the use of the cross in baptism and the officiating of godfathers and godmothers in place of the true parents they disliked the manner of confirmation upon so easy terms as well as the pretense that imposition of the bishops hands certified persons of their real saintship they disliked the obliging of communicants to kneel at the lords supper  or to bow at the pronunciation of the name jesus they disliked the use of the ring in marriage as a sacramental symbol nor could they believe that the use of popish robes or ceremonies in divine service promoted the edification of mens souls  coverdale samson fox humphreys and others of the puritan clergy continued in the church and became itinerant preachers lecturers or chaplains as they had opportunity but coleman button halingham benson white rowland and hawkins ministers of london looking upon the established church as obstinate in her adherence to many dregs of popery and in persecuting the faithful followers of christ separated from her and privately preached in houses and woods informed of this elizabeth published a proclamation that whoever did not attend their own churches but attended conventicles should for the first offense be deprived of the freedom of london and afterward abide the punishment directed by law one of these private meetings being detected many were apprehended who before bishop grindal and other judges behaved in a most bold and christian manner after lying a year in prison twentyfour men and seven women were set free neither the remarkable piety nor the nervous arguments nor the sufferings of these puritans could move the high commissioners they had their spies in all suspected places to prevent their assembling for worship and prohibited all preaching in london without special license from the bishop or archbishop  in      the bishops published their bible which was merely that of tindal somewhat corrected and with some maps cuts and notes but they little regarded it in dealing with their scrupulous brethren protestants being terribly prosecuted in france and the netherlands many of them fled into england and settled in london and other trading places  regard to the erection of manufactures and care to weaken her neighboring princes moved elizabeth to permit them their own modes of worship she and parker had been extremely kind to her popish subjects and had issued directions to prevent bringing them under hardships by the imposition of the oath of supremacy to reward her kindness they now raised two rebellions against her and the pope delivered her and all her adherents to the devil and his angels and dissolved all oaths of allegiance to her or contracts with her these things occasioned a penal statute against papists and requiring them solemnly to protest their innocence to her but to keep them in countenance and render the puritans equally odious the same protestation of allegiance was without the smallest shadow of reason required of them and the prosecutions chiefly carried on against them which popish priests by counterfeiting them sometimes promoted by oaths and interrogations they made them their own accusers and such was their candor that they made it a point to deny nothing of the truth and to declare their principles before their judges if nothing could be found chargeable upon them they were ruined by the charges of a dilatory procedure and then dismissed under obligations to appear whenever their judges should call them  in    0 cartwright a most learned professor of divinity at cambridge extended the field of disputation between the puritans and their persecuting brethren in his theological lectures he with great modesty and caution insinuated that the names and functions or archbishops and archdeacons ought to be abolished as not warranted in scripture that the scripture only warrants preaching bishops and deacons who take care of the poor that every church ought to be governed by its own minister and elders not by chancellors and officials that every minister ought to have the charge of some flock that none should solicit admission to the ministry that bishops ought not to be created by the civil magistrate but chosen by the church that in reforming churches all things ought to be reduced to the apostolic pattern that none incapable of preaching ought to be admitted to the ministry that none but ministers can lawfully administer the sacraments that popish ordination is not valid that only canonical scripture ought to be read in the public worship of god that in public prayer all the people ought to join with the words of the minister and not pray or read each by himself that the care of interring the dead pertains not to the ministerial office that all the words and names of god being equally divine there is no reason for standing at the reading of the gospels or bowing at the mention of the name jesus that sitting at the lords table is as lawful as kneeling or standing that baptism by women or laymen is unlawful that parents ought to present their own children in baptism and not be obliged to answer in name of the child that women and persons under age ought not to be allowed to stand sponsors for children that the sign of the cross in baptism is superstitious that the lords supper ought not to be administered in private that the prohibition of marriage at certain seasons of the year is popish and then to give licenses to it for money is intolerable that clandestine marriages are inconvenient that the observation of lent and other holy days of human appointment is superstitious and unlawful that markets and merchandise on the lords day are unlawful that in ordination it is sinful and ridiculous for the bishop to say receive thou the holy ghost as if he could confer him and that kings and bishops ought not to be anointed to their office for occasional hints of this nature notwithstanding much intercession in his favor he was deprived of his office expelled the university and for two years retired to the netherlands  grindal being translated to the archbishopric of york sandys was made bishop of london perhaps contrary to his convictions he deprived his old fellow puritans of the poor remains of indulgence which grindal had left them and insisted for the most rigid uniformity when the parliament met in      in which strickland and wentworth were principal speakers some relief was intended for the puritans having had the thirtynine articles presented to them in order to their legal establishment they waved the three articles which related to ceremonies and government and ratified such only as belonged to doctrinal points requiring all that possessed ecclesiastical livings to declare their consent to these and such as should teach any thing contrary to them to be deprived it is probable that the choose of  0th article bearing that the church has power to decree concerning rites and ceremonies of worship and has authority in controversies of faith was not in the copy which they approved and it is certain their act admitted ordination by presbyters to be valid  though it be notoriously certain that but a small part of the episcopalian clergy did or do subscribe these articles with honesty and candor yet to distress the puritans the convocation which sat during this parliament requested the bishops to recall all former licenses to preach and to require not only a subscription of the articles but of the book of common prayer and of the ordinal for consecration of bishops priests and deacons as containing nothing contrary to the word of god  as the condition of every new license contrary to law this act though never confirmed by the queen was violently executed by most of the bishops meanwhile contrary to elizabeths inclination the commons presented a petition for supplying a multitude of parishes destitute of preaching and for checking abounding profaneness and atheism the elector palatine appointed zanchy to write to her in behalf of the puritans but it seems archbishop grindal durst not deliver his letter it is certain that uniformity was more and more urged scambler and some other bishops notwithstanding their consciences were much at her majestys will being sensible of the bad consequences of the great want of preaching and total want of church discipline permitted their clergy to enter into associations or presbyteries for promoting of both at northampton the clergy the mayor and the justices of peace agreed upon several rules for promoting christian knowledge regulating divine services and sanctifying the sabbath the clergy agreed upon private exercises of preaching at their meetings in order to their mutual improvement in gifts and grace  parker still labored at his persecuting work he sent for the principal men of the suspected clergy and told them that they must take out new licenses in which they must subscribe to all the articles imposed by the late convocation the bishops of ely and winchester assisted him but grindal refused alleging that it might bring them under a remunire goodman lever samson walker brown field johnson and others were called to he episcopal bar and told that they must either come up to the queens injunctions or be deprived beza of geneva by letters besought the bishops to bate their rigor and besought the lord treasurer o endeavor procuring some further reformation in he church discipline the parliament having met began to form a bill for regulating the procedure of he rigid bishops and for granting some relief to the istressed puritans elizabeth and her bishops preented them and wentworth the principal advoate for religion and liberty was thrown into prison or his parliamentary freedom and in      deeing brown brownrig millain clark and about   other puritan ministers were deprived for scruling the episcopal impositions  meanwhile field wilcox and others drew up n admonition to the parliament consisting of twenythree chapters relative to the superiority of bishops ver presbyters the authority of the church in things indifferent the election ordination resience preaching ability and apparel of clergymen the book of common prayer and subscription f it holy days of human appointment right preahing reading of the scriptures deans preaching and ministering the sacraments the pertinents of aptism and the lords supper ruling elders and church discipline deacons and widows magistray cathedral churches civil offices of clergymen  for presenting this book to the parliament the uthors of it were imprisoned more than a year they published a confession of their faith to refuse he calumnies of whitgift  about the same time cartwright published a seond admonition supplicating redress of the puritans rievances and representing the injustice of punishng men for warning the parliament without dropping one treasonable hint several pamphlets being published in defense of the admonition the bishop were obliged to answer it whitgift chancellor o the university of oxford was chosen for that purpose and was answered once and again by cartwright whitgift scarcely pretended to argue from scripture but from the dictates of fathers in the first five centuries of the christian church while cartwright insisted to have all things in religion regulated by scripture having the court and bishops on his side whitgift hunted down his antagonist with force an calumny and obliged him to conceal himself fle his country and live in distress and poverty eve when he was rewarded with his bishopric he could not forbear persecuting him a shrewd evidence that his evil conscience knew that he had not rational or scriptural arguments to support his cause  while france was socked with the blood of massacred protestants the state of the protestant religion in england was most wretched pleasing parker i their ready compliance with surplices copes squar caps etc the papists had easy access to ecclesiastica functions the clergy busied themselves in addin to the number of their livings but almost utterl neglected their duty and alienated the church property for their own private gain the court was a harbor of atheism profaneness and every kind o licentiousness many of the subjects were absolut atheists or heathens in their practice the lord day was generally little regarded and some live without any appearance of worship at all on it but  was not against these heavendaring crimes but against puritans disconformity to things which themselves allowed to be intrinsically indifferent that elizabet and her darling bishops burned with zeal on  burchet a madman who was but called a puritan having struck one and killed another whom his delirious brain fancied to be hatton a papist the odium of the deed was charged on the whole body of puritans provoked with their application to parliamen or redress of their terrible oppression and with their holding of secret presbyteries among themselves e commanded to prosecute them with unrelenting gour field wilcox and five others were derived for scrupling to subscribe promises of confority drawn by the commissioners outlandish men ho could scarce read the english tongue were aced in their stead and their poor people who ad enjoyed two sermons every sabbath had scarce one in a quarter of a year johnson was thrown unto prison where he died amidst poverty and huner notwithstanding the reluctance of parkhurst ishop of norwich parkers commissioners deprived about  00 puritan pastors in his diocese alone  nor were the clergy alone plagued with subscripons one was devised for such as deserted their hurches in which they engaged to full conformity pies were placed in every suspected parish to inform against such as did not punctually attend their churhes in order to have them punished nay spies ere placed upon the puritan prisoners in order to ring them into more trouble when the puritans ppeared before the high commissioners they were bused as if they had been dogs or devils which no oubt sometimes provoked them to some unadvised ords the candid warner justly observes that he cruelties exercised by the court bishops against their worthy brethren of the same faith fell little hort of these exercised by bloody bonner against the protestants some of the persecuted offered to disute the points which they held and for that crime were the more readily deposed and imprisoned as he presbyteries prophesyings or meetings of clerymen to exercise their preaching talents for mutual mprovement were thought to have a puritanical ppearance elizabeth and parker contrary to the will of the privy council resolved to stop them to he great grief of the pious parkhurst they were first uppressed in his diocese some of the puritans reconing it better to meet together on holy days and other occasions for joint prayer and reading of the scripture than to spend the time idly or in drinking and playing at cards  parker being informed of it applied himself to suppress that supercriminal conduct as he readily believed every reproach he could hear of the puritans his steward and one undertree forged letters in name of benham stonden and others importing a plot against lord burleigh the treasurer and that the earls of bedford leicester and other noblemen were in it parker began to prosecute the puritans with great fury but upon examination undertree confessed that the whole was a sham intended to disgrace the puritans this not a little sullied the honor of parker but hi impudence preserved him from blushing and neither of the villains who had been guilty of such enormous forgery were punished to the great hur of the isle of wight and hindering of foreign protestants to dwell or trade in it parker visited it turned out the nonconformists and shut up their churches jersey and guernsey lying out of hi reach and having no fixed form of church government the people caused cartwright and snape to draw up a plan which they observed till james i obliged them to receive the episcopal yoke and the ceremonies attending it it appears to have bee much like to that of the westminster assembly  while elizabeth and her favorites carried on their persecution of the pious and peaceable puritans she marked an astonishing kindness to papists who sough the ruin of herself and her kingdom they were frequently released from prison about  00 of their meetings for idolatrous worship were connived at  nine foreign colleges being erected for the popis education of english youth one at rome and eigh in the spanish dominions swarms of romish missionaries poured themselves into england in a few years that of rome and of douay in flanders furnished three hundred all of them deep sworn to labor to their uttermost in reducing their heretica countrymen to the religion of their ancestors about this time henry nicolas founded his family of love whose enthusiasm rendered them almost delirius their opinions were somewhat like to these of he popish quietists or the quakers they had their private meetings for worship on account of which they sometimes tasted of elizabeth and parkers wholesome severities some german anabaptists aving fled into england twentyseven of them were apprehended nine banished and two burnt about the time that parker himself was dragged by eath before the tribunal of god  in the beginning of a d      pious grindal as translated to canterbury sandys to york and ylmer once an half puritan but now a cruel perecutor to london in parliament an unsuccessul attempt to lay a tax on such as did not attend the hurches and receive the sacraments was made  he convocation framed articles of admission to the inistry thirteen of which were published with eliabeths leave though they had not her seal one f them declaring that all licenses to preach dated revious to feb        had become void but might e renewed without any expense thus for the ird or fourth time elizabeth had disqualified all e preachers of her kingdom chiefly in order to rge out protestant scruplers at popish vestments d ceremonies had all the bishops been equally rict in the renovation of licenses the church had d scarce any preaching that deserved the name  any of those who had the charge of souls being inpable even to read an homily aright and they were ly obliged to read the service and administer the craments in person once in the half year under the nalty of five pounds to the poor but it was a ercy that many of them employed puritans as eir curates and lecturers who with great earnestss labored in the work of the lord notwithnding all attempts to root them out the puritans ll continued if not increased under their hardships many of them held secret meetings for discipline informed hereof elizabeth commanded archbishop grindal to hunt them out some of their chiefs were apprehended others chiefly in the diocese of norwich of which freke was now bishop were suspended nor could the distinguished piety and peacefulness of greenham prevent hi going with the rest  in order to preserve the useful meetings for mutual improvement among his established clergy grindal drew up for them the following regulations  that they should only be held in churches appointed by the bishop of the diocese that the archdeacon or some other appointed by the bishop should moderate in them that the bishop should have a list o all clergymen fit for attending them and should appoint the passages of scripture to be handled in them  that the moderators should appoint such clergymen as could not yet preach some other useful task tha if any in his discourse touched the affairs of state the moderator should immediately stop him and delat him to his bishop that if any inveigh against the ceremonies he shall be suspended from preaching  till his bishop give him a new admission that n minister once suspended or deprived be suffere to speak in these meetings till by subscription an daily practice for a time he conform to the order o the church and that no laymen should be permited to speak in public by these regulations h thought they would be innocent enough but ezabeth sending for him exclaimed against all suc meetings as illegal in themselves and infinitely dangrous to both church and state for the advantage  both which she said it would be to have but thr or four preachers in a whole county and she peremptorily commanded him to suppress them wholl as with the most evident marks of high displesure she refused to hear his reply grindal wrote h a most sensible letter representing the usefulness  these meetings on account of which he had n reedom to suppress them and begging that her majesty would not interpose her prerogative in eccleastical affairs without the advice of her bishops or ronounce so peremptorily in religious as in secular matters quite infuriated by this meek remonrance she by a deed of her starchamber confind him to his house sequestrated him from his juisdiction for half a year before this elapsed grinal made a kind of submission but as he could not etract his opinion nor profess his sorrow for the dvice which he had given her majesty she contiued his sequestration and so the exercises for rophesying went down  elizabeth being terrified est knowledge should make her clergy less disposed o an absolute submission to her arbitrary will  cartwright being preacher to the english factory t antwerp got fenner travers ashton and others rdained to the ministry who could not obtain it at ome where in      whitingham and laurence were deprived for their want of episcopal ordination the woeful condition of england was almost inexressible in cornwall there were   0 incumbents ot one of which could preach a sermon and most of them pluralists nonresidents fornicators adulerers drunkards gamesters on the lords day and et people were prosecuted if they attended a purian sermon  when the parliament met in    0 the commons greed to observe a fast by themselves on a lords ay to supplicate his direction in their work and he preservation of her majesty and the realm now when the popish powers were forming leagues for the tter destruction of protestants but they referred he nomination of the preachers to the privy council elizabeth was terribly offended that they had dared o do this without her consent asked and obtained the commons submitted themselves and begged her pardon the parliament enacted that all romish priests who attempted to seduce protestants and these seduced by them into a change of their religion should be liable to the pains of high treason  and the saying of mass be punishable with a years imprisonment and a fine of  00 marks sterling and the hearing of it with a years imprisonment and a forfeiture of  00 marks and that every person who did not attend churches in which the common prayer is regularly used shall forfeit to her majesty  0 pound a month and ly in prison till it should be paid and schoolmasters forfeit  0 pounds and be imprisoned for a year and be perpetually incapable of teaching a school and as some puritans provoked with their terrible oppression had published some satirical pamphlets against unpreaching clergymen etc they enacted that all such as wrote or published any ballad or letter containing any thing scandalou against the queen should suffer death without benefi of clergy  by his questions and demands of subscription aylmer made terrible havoc among the clergy about london such as did not answer to his satisfaction were immediately suspended and silenced while the bishops drove the puritans from their pulpit many of the nobility and gentry took them into their families to teach their children which by the blesing of god prepared them to make such a stan for religion and liberty about the middle of the nex century violent methods but drove the dissente further from the establishment robert brown  schoolmaster having published a tract entitled t life and manners of true christians was prosecuted o account of it after a little rest he and harriso traveled through the country preaching against bishops and ceremonies for which he was imprisoed above thirty times he and his followers forme themselves into a particular sect but they we quickly obliged to retire to holland after officating for some years as their pastor brown himse returned to england and became an idle dissolu conforming rector at northampton his aposta dissolved his congregation at middleburg but the friends of his scheme gradually multiplied they held much the same doctrine as the church of england but they denied her to be a true church on account of her many corruptions and renounced all communion with her and every other church not of their own model they placed the whole power of church government equally in all the brotherhood they chose and ordained their own officers and deprived them of their office at pleasure their particular congregations lived as sister churches but none had any jurisdiction over another nor had their church officers any power of office without the bounds of the congregation in which they were last chosen and ordained they hated all prescribed forms of prayer every brother had liberty of prophesying or exhorting in their religious assemblies after a sermon the brethren ordinarily conferred upon the subject of it  tyler coppington and hacket leading brownists in england were imprisoned several years and the two last hanged  about      multitudes of jesuits pouring into england preached openly against elizabeths title and authority and dispersed their books campian and two others were apprehended and hanged but the zeal of the courtiers ran out chiefly against the puritans the remarkably pious wright was deprived and imprisoned because he had received presbyterial ordination at antwerp to extend their oppression elizabeth employed some hungry courtiers to examine the claims of lands and livings belonging to the church and granted every thing for which churchmen could not produce legal titles to them by examination of parsons wardens and others they bade fair to find means to sequestrate most of the church lands for her majestys use the bishops were therefore obliged to beg her superseding of their commission the suffolk justices of peace ventured again to supplicate her indulgence toward the puritans and complained that they were reckoned with the vilest malefactors some conform clergy also wrote in their favor but elizabeth aylmer and other court bishops who connived at or encouraged profane swearing and the most open drunkenness revelling and gaming on the lords day panted for their ruin  notwithstanding his further submission and removal of his sequestration grindal continued the object of elizabeths dislike and hence lived in a dejected manner till he died in      whitgift of worcester who had distinguished himself by his hatred of the puritans was placed in his stead he had scarcely received his archbishopric when elizabeth solemnly charged him to restore the discipline of the church and the established uniformity which had lost its credit under his predecessor prepared for obedience he the very first week dispatched his mandates to all the bishops of his province that no preaching catechizing or prayer be allowed in families in which more than the members are present that none preach and catechize unless he read the whole service and administer the sacrament four times a year that all preachers and others in eccleiastical orders wear the prescribed habits at all times that none be allowed to preach but such as have been regularly ordained that none preach unless he have taken the oath of supremacy subscribed the books of common prayer and of ordination of bishops priests and deacons and all the thirtynine articles and use said books in all their ministrations several lawyers thought that he exceeded his legal powers and might have been brought into a praemunire for tendering articles and requiring subscriptions not warranted by parliament but having her majesty on his side he insisted on them at pleasure and for refusing of them     preachers were suspended in the counties of norfolk suffolk sussex essex kent and lincolnshire besides great numbers in london the diocese of peterborough and other counties  some of whom were dignitaries in the church and most of them graduates in the university fortynine of them were immediately deposed from their office no doubt multitudes twisted their conscience to make it submit rather than render them and their families outwardly miserable the bulk of the inferior clergy who had any sense wished for amendments in the service book that the many valuable men thereby disqualified might be of use in the church but whitgift was deaf to all they could say being terrified lest amendments might make people think the church had once been in a mistake  the ejected clergymen and others that pitied them presented a supplication to the privy council for some relief in the affair of subscription but whitgift who by turning papist under queen mary had retained his place was firmly resolved to display his power and execute his fury against all such as had not consciences as flexible as his own not content with archiepiscopal jurisdiction he besought her majesty for the sixth time to erect an high commission whose power might extend to the whole kingdom and might apply wholesome severities not becoming bishops as such she readily granted his request  this court consisted of    members    of which were bishops and three a quorum they had power to call before them all ecclesiastical causes to examine persons upon oath concerning their own conduct and to suspend deprive imprison or excommunicate them as they found cause and to amend the statutes of colleges cathedrals grammar schools and other public foundations they borrowed the examination of men upon oath touching their own principles or conduct from the spanish inquisition and their powers were manifestly inconsistent with the laws of the land but who durst contradict her majesty and the archbishop who composed twentyfour articles directing this court how to examine the puritans upon oath shocked with a sight of them lord burleigh wrote to the archbishop that they favored strong of the romish inquisition if they were not more ensnaring whitgift returned him some pitiful pretenses in support of his oath ex offices the privy council represented to him and aylmer and by naming the persons that they connived at pluralists nonresidents and multitudes of ignorant and scandalous clergymen drunkards whoremongers gamesters at cards and the like and only exercised their inquisitorial diligence against such as were laborious and diligent preachers whitgift attempted to vindicate his conformists while he carried on his furious career against such as had scrupulous consciences beale the clerk of the privy council had his own share of harrassment for exposing the illegality and injustice of his inquisitorial procedure  with no small difficulty the puritans obtained a kind of conference on the disputed points between the archbishop and his brother of winchester on the one side and messrs spark and travers on the other before the earl of leicester and lords gray and walsingham they conferred concerning the reading of the apocrypha instead of the word of god and as equivalent to it  the administration of baptism in private and by women the usefulness of popish vestments the allowance of insufficient clergymen nonresidence and pluralities neither party were satisfied but the noblemen were so far convinced that they solicited favor for the nonconformist ministers meanwhile aylmer prosecuted them with unrelenting fury without the smallest shadow of a crime and after abusing them at his bar with the vilest reproaches he suspended thirtyeight of them in summer      and afterward prosecuted others being turned out of their livings and hindered to keep schools some of them were reduced to beggary while cartwright was correcting a plan of regular discipline among themselves which travers had drawn up about eight years before  they applied to the parliament  to the convocation to whitgift  and again to the parliament for redress of their grievances in their last supplication they show that the ten thousand parishes in england had no more than about two thousand preachers to supply them on both occasions the parliament showed willingness to relieve them but elizabeth and whitgift carried all before them and wentworth and other who boldly inveighed against the bishops arbitrary procedure were sent prisoners to the tower  in      the parliament appeared exceedingly desirous to grant them liberty  to restrain the high commission  to prohibit pluralities and nonresidence of clergymen and some bills were presented ur limiting the power of bishops  allowing of persons to marry at any time of the year  and for the better observation of the lords day which was now erribly profaned but the zeal of elizabeth and er bishops and whitgifts fears that alterations would make people think the church had been in an rror prevented all such endeavors from having any effect an act was made against jesuits and traficking priests and such as supported or concealed them  in      the parliament appeared still ore zealous to relieve the supplicating puritans and some members proposed a farther reformation f the church not only did elizabeth commit the armest speakers to the tower but in her plan of eneral pardon she excepted all such as offended against the act of uniformity or published seditious bels i e tracts which represented the arbitrary rocedure of the bishops  about this time the  d art of the preachers in england were suspended o eprived about five hundred of whom agreed to bserve the plan of government and discipline which artwright had corrected which is pretty similar to at agreed upon by the assembly of westminster and they agreed to meet in classical presbyteries once  six weeks  in synods once every half year and  a general synod or assembly once every year  after sandys archbishop of york had for several years cruelly persecuted the scruplers he died a d      declaring in his latter will that he was and had always been persuaded that the ceremonies were not expedient for the church but ought to be disused by little and little much about the same time died fox samson and humphreys noted puritans  while the spaniards were preparing to invade and conquer the kingdom the puritans who had always distinguished themselves for the protestant and national interests again supplicated the parliament for relief but elizabeth who was flattered as a goddess by the convocation reprimanded the commons for considering whether they should grant it and how they might correct the fearful profanation of the sabbath when the fears of the spanish invasion were over by means of a storm and sea fight some less serious puritans published some scurrilous tracts against the bishops and their procedure and ceremonies under the titles of martin mar prelate etc which were answered by churchmen in an equally ludicrous and abusive manner at last the nonconformists press was discovered and sir richard knightly and sir  wigston who had entertained it and the printer and newman the disperser were deeply fined in the starchamber others were put to death of whom udal a pious and learned minister was one who had no hand in the scurrilous pamphlets but in a demonstration of the discipline of the christian church in which the character of the bishops was thought to be touched at least he acknowledged a great part of that book to be true notwithstanding much intercession in his behalf he was terribly persecuted and condemned as a traitor without either shadow or proof of his disloyalty and died in prison meanwhile whitgift commenced a new visitation and framed twentytwo articles on which the wardens of every parish were to be examined upon oath and which were remarkably calculated to distress the puritans and set every one at odds with his neighbor in his letter to burleigh sir francis knolles calls them articles of inquisition highly prejudicial to the royal prerogative  the puritans associations for government and discipline among themselves exposed them to further persecution cartwright and fifteen others were apprehended and imprisoned in the fleet jail  their first answer not being to the taste of the managers they had    articles exhibited against them and were required upon oath to declare how far they were chargeable or not for having enough of common sense to refuse being self accusers they were punished with several years imprisonment  james king of scotland interceeded with elizabeth dr goad and whitaker noted clergymen with lord burleigh and nine of the imprisoned ministers with whitgift for relief as the archbishop refused to favor them unless they renounced their discipline and engaged themselves to complete conformity with the church they applied to her majesty and largely vindicated themselves from the reproaches cast upon them what effect this application had i know not but cartwright was liberated and restored to his hospital in warwick while fenner field travers and many others continued in prison and their families were starving  stone perkins johnson and too many other puritan clergy answered upon oath and informed their persecutors of their assemblies and discipline thus purchasing their own ease at the hazard of their brethren  to render the puritans odious hacket who imagined himself to be jesus christ and coppinger and arthington his prophets with every other enthusiast were represented as of their number but cartwright vindicated them from all connection with such  when the parliament met in      elizabeth notified to them that every thing relative to the church was to be left to her attorney morris who had just before published reasons against the oath ex officio and proved it contrary to scripture the practice of heathen persecutors the laws of the land and her majestys prerogative ventured to propose an enquiry into the bishops procedure in their spiritual courts in compelling men to their inquisitions and subscriptions and to take an oath for accusing themselves  or in degrading depriving and imprisoning people at their pleasure and he offered two bills one against the oath ex officio and another against illegal imprisonments sir francis knolle seconded him for this presumption both of them were banished from the court morris was deprived of his chancellorship in the duchy of lancaster and of all power to act as a lawyer and was for several years detained in prison elizabeth told the parliament that her power over them was absolute and she would allow no such bills to be exhibited terrified by the sat of morris and knolles the parliament submitted and to pacify her enacted tha all persons above sixteen years of age that refused to attend their established churches or who had any hand in promoting nonconformity should without allowance of bail be imprisoned till they made a proper confession of their fault and engaged to uniformity that if they did not so within three months they should be for ever banished the kingdom and that if they did not leave it within the time prescribed or did ever return they should suffer death without benefit of clergy meanwhile the papist were condemned to banishment or to confinemen within five miles of their residence  to evade the cruel force of this terrible act the moderate puritans came to church when the common prayers were over and received the lords supper in churches in which some latitude with respec to the table posture was allowed the brownist fell under the whole weight of it one of their congregations being discovered about sixty or sevent of them after manifold harrassments were throw into different prisons after a most cruel imprisonment barrow a gentleman greenwood and penry ministers all remarkable for piety were hanged as traitors but their dying professions of their loyalty and the total want of evidence to the contrary made their most effronted adversaries even elizabeth herself almost ashamed of their groundless calumny and murder about seventeen or eighteen other brownists died in their prisons  meanwhile though the papists had raised several insurrections against her  though they had supported mary of scotlands right to her crown and after her death that of the infanta of spain  and had concurred with the spanish invaders in      elizabeth either from love or from fear generally used them as her dear children during the first eleven years of her reign not one of them was capitally prosecuted during the next eleven notwithstanding the popes excommunication above mentioned and repeated rebellions no more than twelve priests were executed almost every one for crimes relating to the state for the next ten notwithstanding multitudes of jesuits labored to their uttermost in seducing the subjects to join the spaniards no more than fifty priests were executed and fiftyfive banished during the last twelve years of her reign they had almost as much freedom to profess practice and propagate their idolatries and superstitions as they could have wished  till about a d      the english protestants had all believed that the superiority of diocesan bishops above presbyters was merely founded on the laws and inclinations of men bancroft now chaplain to archbishop whitgift to the great offense of the puritans and others in a sermon pled for the divine right of it about      he bilson bridges cosins and saravia published their defenses of episcopal powers and notwithstanding the restraint of the press were answered by bradshaw fenner mortice the attorney and beza the learned but poor hooker published the first four books of his ecclesiastical polity in which he chiefly attempts to prove that the scriptures are not the rule of church discipline and government and that therefore she may appoint whatever forms or ceremonies she judges most conducive to edification  in      fletcher succeeded aylmer in the bishopric of london in his first visitation of his diocese he set out with twenty seven articles of enquiry for church wardens concerning their preachers by means of which he quickly replenished the prisons which for a little had been tolerably emptied with puritan preachers it happened well that his marriage drew upon him elizabeths displeasure suspension of him from his office and banishment from the court these breaking his proud heart he was succeeded by the still more unmerciful bancroft  the learned ainsworth johnson smith robinson and jacob principal leaders among the brownists having before fled to holland multitudes followed them and erected churches according to their own plan at amsterdam arnheim middleburg leyden and other places  about this time dr bound published a tract on the due sanctification of the lords day all the puritans relishing his sentiments distinguished themselves by their sabbath behavior  hereon the customary shooting fencing bowling interludes and maygames and morrisdances on it began to be disused and disliked this exceedingly galled the clerical managers and their agents who hated every appearance of strict piety archbishop whitgift and judge popham called in the copies of bounds book and prohibited the reprinting of it this made it more read than ever not without remarkable success  meanwhile barret a fellow of the university o cambridge in a discourse to the clergy declared himself against the calvinistical doctrines of predestination and perseverance in grace the heads of the university obliged him to retract and whitgift hutton of york and some others drew up the articles of lambeth which bear that god not moved by any foreseen faith or good works of men bu of his mere good pleasure has chosen some particular persons to everlasting life all of whom and no other certainly obtain it that saving grace is not bestowed upon all men that no man can by the power of his free will come to christ and be saved that justified persons have assurance of remission of sins and of eternal salvation that true saints never fall totally nor finally from their state or exercise of grace had not whitgift and his friends for their own sake implored elizabeths forbearance she had brought the formers of these articles which she disliked or who required the students to assent to them under the statute of praemunire she was nevertheless highly offended with dr baro a frenchman for continuing the debate in favor of barret and at last obliged him to resign his professorship the university of oxford harmonized in sentiment with that of cambridge and calvins institutions were publicly read by order of the convocation about the same time the learned broughton bilson and others had a warm dispute whether christ suffered the wrath of god in his soul and whether he descended to the local hell after the disputants had fatigued themselves the controversies were dropped in both the universities  toward the latter end of elizabeths reign hopes of approaching redress from the apparent heir to the crown somewhat quieted the puritans afraid of having their cruelties returned on their own heads by a puritan sovereign the ruling clergy delivered over the prosecuted into the hands of the civil judges some of whom handled them in a furious and brutal manner during her very last years the dispute seemed almost hushed and the puritans increased to about fifteen hundred preachers  the popish missionaries also notwithstanding their furious contentions between the seculars and the jesuits labored with great diligence and no inconsiderable success  the parliament which met in   0  renewed their attacks upon the power of the spiritual courts pluralities nonresidences procedure ex mero ossi exchange of penance for money and other clerical corruptions but elizabeth interposing prohibited them to debate the cause and referred it to the archbishop who was at some pains to render the clerical courts more circumspect  at last she died in   0  she was extremely haughty and took a pleasure in manifesting her power and authority especially over the consciences of her subjects she never appears to have struck at any dissimulation which served her own purposes regard for her own supremacy chiefly hindered her from being a papist she was not much more mercifully disposed to protestants of a tender conscience than mary her sister her improvement of the great abilities of some of her statesmen so as to make their suggestions seem her own was the principal ornament of her reign pomp and power not the glory of god or the welfare of souls appear to have been the governing motives of her darling clergy many of her ruling bishops were no less truly persecutors than the popish ones under mary had been it however grieved them much that elizabeth was no friend to the clerical wealth  james vi of scotland had no sooner succeeded as nearest heir to the crown of england than all the different parties courted his favor whitgift and his fellow bishops dispatched henry nevil dean of canterbury to assure him of their unfeigned loyalty  and to recommend their church to his care  and to beg his command relative to their spiritual courts he returned them answer that he intended to support their government as elizabeth had left it the papists welcomed him to england and put him in mind that he had been born and baptized a member of their catholic church which he had called his spiritual mother  and for whose religion his royal mother had died a martyr the foreign protestants had a kind reception and his promise of maintaining their religious liberty as in scotland ames had long professed himself a presbyterian and n some occasions had extolled the scotch form of worship and government to the highest the puritans oped for remarkable relief under his shadow about eight hundred of their ministers out of twentyfive counties presented to him that which was called the millenary petition in which they begged that the cross in baptism the interrogations put to infants and their confirmation by bishops might be said aside that the use of the cap and surplice might be no more urged that persons should be examined before admission to the lords supper that the use of the ring in marriage might be omitted that the common prayer might be abridged that the singng in churches might be modified to better edificaion that the profanation of the sabbath might be restrained and the observation of other holy days ess strictly urged that none but canonical scripture might be read in the public worship of god that ministers may not be charged to direct their people o bow at mentioning of the name jesus that none be admitted to any charge of souls but such as are able and obliged to preach on the lords day that such present incumbents as cannot preach be either removed or obliged to maintain preachers in their stead that pluralities and nonresidence be prohibited that clergymens marriage be declared lawful and that they be only required to subscribe the articles of religion and the oath of supremacy that bishops give up their commendams that impropriations annexed to bishoprics and colleges be only bestowed upon incumbent preachers that a sixth or seventh part of the impropriation be assigned for a maintenance to the preacher that no church censures be administered by mere laymen chancellors etc that none be excommunicated for twelve pencematters or without consent of their pastor that ecclesiastical processes be abridged and some popish canons abrogated that the oath en officio requiring men to be their own accusers be more sparingly used that licenses for clandestine marriages be more rarely granted etc  stung to the very heart by this reforming petition and terribly afraid of losing their impropriations the university of cambridge enacted that all such as in any matter or manner opposed the established doctrine or discipline should ipso facto be suspended from whatever degrees they had obtained and be for ever incapable to receive any the university of oxford published a vindication of the corruptions complained of in this petition and though exclusive of puritans and dignified clergy not any great number of the incumbents were much removed from gross ignorance or even capable of a regular admission to the lords table they boasted that all the other protestant churches could not afford so many learned men as england alone other petitions like to the above mentioned were presented to his majesty and several papers enforcing them published to which their opponents quickly returned answers the conformists much dreaded the ensuing parliament  whitgift wished rather to account to god for hi conduct than to it and actually died before it met  james heartily hated these puritans and their reformations but that he might more plausibly part with them he appointed a conference between them and their opponents at hampton court in the middle of january   0  archbishop whitgift eigh other bishops and eight or ten other learned dignitaries were appointed to defend the cause of the conformists  while no more than john reynolds whom his brother william had converted from i would pery while himself became a papist and spark  doctors of the university of oxford and chadderto and knewstubs of cambridge were allowed to maintain the cause of the puritans james himself wa moderator and his courtiers were witnesses o the first day the puritans were not admitted bu his majesty represented to the bishops what he apprehended wrong in their service book bancroft falling on his knees begged that nothing in it might be altered lest the papists and puritans should triumph over them as acknowledging that they had formerly been in an error nevertheless to satisfy james they added some words in the office of confirmation and absolution and they agreed to consider whether the administration of baptism should be restricted to lawful ministers and midwives who were ordinarily known to administer it in a due manner on the second day the puritan doctors being admitted reynolds was their principal speaker he insisted that some few words in the thirtynine articles might be added explained or omitted that the confirmation of children by the bishop be considered that plurality of benefices might be disallowed and preaching ministers every where settled that the reading of the apocrypha in the public worship of god instead of his own word  the baptismal interrogation relative to the infant  the sign of the cross in baptism  the superstitious vestments  the symbolical ring in marriage  and the purification of childbearing women ought to be abolished because relics of popery he also complained of excommunications by lay chancellors and entreated that clergymen be allowed to meet together every three weeks for their mutual improvement  during this conference bancroft again fell upon his knees and begged that schismatics might not be suffered to speak against their bishops and that his majesty would provide a ministry which could read prayers and homilies for they had too much preaching already in which many dared to vent their malice against their superiors the conformist disputants scarcely needed to open their mouths  proud of his theological abilities james chiefly with hectoring and bluster so confounded the puritan doctors that even reynolds that miracle of learning sunk far below his ordinary dignity reckoning i vain to oppose the torrent of royal though often pitiful abuse at the end james told them that since they had no other objections he would make them conform or drive them out of his kingdom to his inconceivable satisfaction he had his labor extolled by bancroft and others as if in wisdom he had almost exceeded solomon himself and had never had a royal equal since our saviors birth on the third day the conformists satisfied him concerning the high commission and the oath ex officio which was the more easy as they appeared to belong to his own prerogative when he extolled the wisdom of their institutions whitgift cried out that undoubtedly his majesty spoke by the direction o the spirit of god  in consequence of this conference a committee was appointed to devise regulations for lessening the charges of the high commission and for planting schools and for settling proper ministers in ireland in which the popish party had been lately reduced and on the borders of scotland and england where theft robbery and other disorders exceedingly prevailed  the puritans refused to be concluded by thi mock conference the disputants on their side had not been chosen by them nor thought many thing sinful which their brethren did  nay had refused to represent these to his majesty  nor had they been permitted to debate the points which they had mentioned in any proper manner they complained that barlow in his narrative published without the knowledge of his puritan opponents had given  most unfair account of the conference and modestl confuted whatever the bishops had said in a representation directed to his majesty but for their effectual conviction james without consulting either parliament or convocation by his royal proclamation commanded their complete uniformity in the use  the service book as now corrected whitgift die about six weeks after this conference and tw months after cartwright his more valuable antagonist  james being naturally fond of absolute power the flatteries of his conforming clergy tempted him to exercise it before the parliament met he by a proclamation charged all the jesuits and popish priests to leave the kingdom but carefully informed the world that it was not on account of their religion but for their maintaining the popes power over princes  and by another he commanded all the puritans to conform immediately or underly the extremities of law in his speech to his first english parliament he acknowledged the popish to be his mother church though defiled with some infirmities and blots and declared himself ready to indulge the popish clergy if they but renounced the popes supremacy and his pretended power to dispense with the murder of sovereigns and that he would be glad to meet papists half way in order to union but eagerly declared puritans unsupportable in any well governed state he moreover informed the parliament of his hereditary right to the crown and that he was answerable to none but god for his conduct the parliament quickly perceived that they had no longer to deal with the sagacious and determined elizabeth and so took their own course to the great vexation of the bishops they appointed all processes in ecclesiastical courts to be wholly issued in the name of the sovereign and under his seal of array  they also annulled all grants of church lands which had been made to the crown for twenty years immediately preceding they legitimated the marriage of clergymen by reviving the act of edward vi for that effect for under elizabeth their marriages had been merely tolerated and their children were bastards in lawreckoning  in the convocation egerton fleetwood wotton clark and other puritans petitioned for a correction of the service book but they and their brethren were commanded to conform before midsummer or underly the censures of the church in the upper house rudd bishop of st asaph insisted at considerable length for some indulgence to their scrupulous brethren but he was obliged to drop it  in this convocation the book of canons was approved by the clergy and was afterward ratified by his majestys letters patent it consisted of     articles collected from the injunctions and other episcopal o synodical acts under edward vi and elizabeth it enacted that whoever should affirm the church of england not a true apostolical church  or that her established form of worship was in any respect corrupt or superstitious  or that any of her thirtynine articles could not be subscribed with a safe conscience  or that any of her ceremonies were wicked and not to be used when commanded by authority  or her government by archbishops bishops deans etc was antichristian and contrary to the word of god  or that any thing in the ordinal for consecration of bishops priests and deacons was contrary to the word of god  or that persons consecrated according to it needed any other call or ordination to their office  and that whoever separated from the communion of the church of england or set up any other communion in opposition to it  or that affirmed that any such was a lawful church  or affirmed that ministers or laymen might without the kings authority make any rules for church government  or who submitted to such rules  should ipso facto be excommunicated not to be absolved but by the archbishop after proper evidence of their repentance and a public recantation of their wicked errors  it further enacted that no appeal from any ecclesiastical judge shall be sustained unless the appellant solemnly promise conformity to the church of england according to the service book and subscribe an approbation of it and of the thirtynine articles and the kings supremacy that none be allowed to preach lecture or catechize without such engagement  that people bow at the mention of the name jesus that all clergymen officiate in the surplice and other sacred robes that all communicants kneel in receiving the lords supper that not parents but godfathers and godmothers present children to baptism and that ministers baptize all children so presented unless their parents were excommunicated  bancroft being advanced to the archbishopric of canterbury and encouraged by the lawyers decision of the king to be absolute governor of the church persecuted the puritans with such unrelenting rigor that burning excepted they were much about as miserable as under mary the bigoted papist of above   00 such preachers  00 were quickly deprived for scrupling to subscribe the articles of uniformity  some excommunicated some imprisoned and others driven from their country the king and starchamber court assisted him in denying them the common privileges of subjects secured by law by a second demand of subscription bancroft renewed his persecution so many of the london clergy refused to subscribe again that a great part of the churches were in danger of being laid desolate for want of preachers  had not the prodigious numbers of scruplers which now appeared alarmed the court and made them for a time to relax their prosecutions such as insisted for a total separation from the establishment were especially distressed hence the moderate dr ames and parker the author of the ecclesiastical policy and several brownists retired to holland where these soon fell by the ears and excommunicated one another this together with the other puritans debates among themselves relative to the propriety of separation from the church occasioned no small joy to their conformist opposers  notwithstanding king james boasting that the papists might be good subjects while puritans could not be safely tolerated in any well regulated state they in   0  attempted to blow up him and his whole parliament by the force of gunpowder intending to lay the blame on the puritans their enterprise being seasonably discovered and prevented james in a few days after told his parliament that the puritans deserved to be burnt for denying the salvation of papists the parliament enacted that whosoever came not to church should pay twelve pence for every sabbath they were absent unless they could give a satisfying excuse to the justices of peace this fell especially on the puritans as means were used for protecting the papists the puritan clergy offered a public disputation concerning the lawfulness of the ceremonies particularly officiating in the surplice crossing in baptism and kneeling at the lords supper but it was refused them hereupon these in lincolnshire drew up an apology in which they offered to subscribe to his supremacy but could not subscribe their unlimited assent to the book of common prayer and the thirtynine articles as they thought some things in them contrary to the word of god they objected that the book of common prayer or service book leaves out a great part of scripture and often the most edifying never to be read in public and prescribes the reading of  0  out of     chapters of the apocrypha in their room thac a bad translation of the bible is appointed to be read in public service that surplices crossing in baptism and kneeling at the lords supper ought not to be used as they have been abused to idolatry by the papists and have a mystical signification annexed to them and because god alone has power to appoint ceremonies in his own worship etc  these objections received an answer from bishop moreton and dr bourges  downham sparks covel hutton rogers and ball wrote in favor of the ceremonies and were answered by bradshaw baynes ames and others  the scruplers being intolerably reproached as heretics schismatics fanatics precisians enemies to god and their king bradshaw published his english puritanism which is a kind of confession of faith concerning religion in general pastors elders church censures and civil magistracy  for the information of foreigners by means of dr ames now professor of divinity at francker in holland some others published a declaration of their principles concerning he power of magistrates about sacred matters somewhat of an independent taste the ministers of devonshire and cornwall published a vindication of themselves and friends on the head of loyalty to his majesty about three years before james had assurd the inhabitants of jersey that he would not make any change upon their forms of worship but banroft persuaded him to violate his promise and aboish their order of geneva and force them to an uiformity with the english church this occasiond no small trouble to both ministers and people and made not a few of them flee into other places  when the parliament met in    0 and a memer had very boldly inveighed against the ambition and tyranny of the ecclesiastical rulers and against he kings arbitrary imposition of taxes  james encouraged by bancroft and by a royally licensed pulication of his vicar general bearing that kings were not bound by laws or oaths or to regard the onsent of their subjects in raising of taxes  called oth houses to whitehall and told them that it was seditious for them to dispute what kings may do  and prohibited them to touch upon any principal oints of his government regardless of his high words they asserted their rights petitioned for a trict execution of the laws against papists  a prohiition of pluralities  and an indulgence of puritan reachers without obliging them to subscribe the erms of uniformity they also remonstrated against he high commission and their tyrannical proceure  about this time died bancroft and was ucceeded in the archbishopric by the pious and moderate and almost half puritan abbot  in     the new and still authorized translation of the bible was published in consequence of the puritans bjections to that of the bishops in the conference t hampton court it is a most valuable translation but a little marked with episcopalian zeal hence come vestry vestments bishops bowing at the name of jesus etc in      legate and wightman who i suppose had been seduced by the then dispersed socinian missionaries were burnt for denying the true godhead of jesus christ and the holy ghost and a third languished in prison till he died what proper pains were taken to convince them of their errors i know not  about this time died prince henry a virtuous youth from whose happy succession to his father deliverance from spiritual oppressions was expected it was even suspected that jame caused him to be poisoned on account of the great regard paid to him by his subjects but while he and his agents were laboring to subvert the true protestant religion and liberty in britain god laid the foundation of a far distant deliverance in the marriage of his daughter elizabeth to frederic electo palatine of the rhine in whose issue the british royalty has been long established it is remarkable how heartily the puritans were attached to and prayed for this alliance and its issue when there appeared no prospect of their being our sovereigns  about a d      henry jacob having adopted robinsons plan of mild brownism and returning from holland did with solemn fasting found the first congregational church in england the independents claim him for their parent rather than the scandalous brown  not long after james took  journey to scotland to introduce his darling ceremonies into the worship of god there as he returned through england particularly through lancashire in      he was exceedingly grieved to se the country so deeply infected with puritanical observation of the lords day in consequence of which the holy seasons of lent and other festivzls were let regarded to check this growing sanctification o the sabbath and thereby confute the popish arguments against the protestant religion he contrar to his own proclamation in the first year of his reign and contrary to the irish confession of faith which ad just passed under his great seal issued a proclamation bearing that after divine service on the lords day his subjects should be allowed their lawful diversions of dancing archery leaping vaulting laygames whitsuntideales morrisdances erecion of maypoles etc and women be allowed to dorn the churches with rushes etc before sermon  and pretending to prove the lawfulness of such ports  but forbidding bullbaiting interludes and such like as unlawful  and prohibiting common people to play at bowls which was reserved for persons of rank at anytime papists and puritans were deprived of these diversions because they came not o their parish churches had not archbishop abbot and others interceeded he had caused this proclamation to be read from all the pulpits in the kingdom but it was only done in lancashire where papists now so much abounded nothing better could be expected from a king in whose court scarce any thing could be heard but oaths and language ordering on blasphemy  the dutch synod of dort consisting of    divines  professors of divinity and    ruling elders from the united provinces  with    foreign divines met in      as james had been a furious opposer of the arminians and violently opposed the admission of vorstius to be professor of divinity at leyden he was glad to have an opportunity of sending carleton davenant hall ward and balcanquel to dort  dr goad succeeded hall whose health could not endure that climate they all assented to every article of the dutch confession except that which reates to parity of ministers and to church discipline they heartily agreed with the synod in their decisions against the arminian doctrines except that davenant and ward held some kind of universality of redemption and that some not elected might be saved but davenant as well as hall afterward declared that the arminian tenets could not be adopted in a consistence with the doctrine of the church of england  meanwhile to the great joy of foreign protestants english puritans and archbishop abbot the elector palatine was chosen king of bohemia but james who hated all elective royalty and was loath to displease the spanish court from which he expected a wife to charles his son disliked his soninlaws advancement and notwithstanding the eagerness of his subjects shifted his assistance till his daughter and her family were reduced to an almost permanent beggary  in    0 the congregation of robinson a pious and moderate brownist at leyden being on the decline through the death of old members and marriage of the young into dutch families they resolved to remove to some part of america under the protection of england where they might preserve their religion they sold their estates and bought two ships and after solemn fasting and prayer for gods blessing and protection set sail for that country one of their ships sailing they all embarked in the other and arrived safe at cape cod nov  th notwithstanding innumerable hardships especially during the first winter they laid the foundation of the new england colony which has since proved a remarkable refuge for many persecuted fearers of god and in which multitudes have been converted to christ  buckeridge harsnet neile and laud having embraced the arminian errors  by their flattering of james in his notions and practice of arbitrary government made him their hearty friend and were advanced to some of his principal bishoprics the calvinists zeal to preserve the liberties of the nation made him heartily hate them in consequence here of he reckoned all that opposed his arbitrary managements to be puritans who began to be distinguished into state puritans who contended for a limited monarchy and church puritans who maintained the doctrines of the reformation in oppositio to arminius when the parliament met in      the commons drew up a large remonstrance in which they complained of the danger of the protestant religion from the increase of papists their numerous conventicles the remission of the fines imposed on them by law the education of many children of rank in popish seminaries abroad and the spread of popish books and they besought his majesty to assist his soninlaw in recovering his electorate and to break off all attempts toward a marriage of his son charles with the spanish infanta and marry him to some protestant princess james hearing of this prohibited them to meddle with his government or his sons marriage and because they were not as pliable as he wished he dissolved them  having thus got rid of his troublesome houses of parliament he commanded the popish prisoners to be liberated about four thousand jesuits and others obtained their release informed of this multitudes of jesuits and other papists flocked into england  mass was openly celebrated in the country in london their private meetings were so crowded that in      the floor sunk under one of them and killed the preacher and about    others meanwhile the established pulpits were carefully filled with zealots for arbitrary power and such as dared to assert the rights of the subjects were punished mr knight having in a sermon before the university of oxford taught that subordinate magistrates may defend themselves against their sovereign if he become a tyrant and attempt to force their compliance with idolatry or blasphemy being prosecuted and interrogated what authority he had for such an assertion he quoted paroeus on romans xiii but chiefly his majesty in assisting the protestants of rochelle against their french sovereign himself was imprisoned paroeus commentaries were publicly burnt at london and oxford and his assertion condemned as seditious  the university of oxford declared that it was unlawful for subjects upon any account to take arms against their king and all graduates were obliged to subscribe it and to swear that they would always continue in that opinion  to distress the puritans still more effectually james commanded his bishops to prohibit clergymens touching in their sermons any thing not contained in the thirtynine articles  to put down all afternoon sermons and substitute an explication of the catechism creed and ten commandments in their place  and that such as only catechized the children be chiefly countenanced and preferred  that none below a bishop or dean should touch on the deep points of predestination or the universality efficacy or resistableness of gods grace that no preacher should dare to set bounds to the royal prerogative or touch any matter of state that no preacher should rail against papists or puritans who were added for a sham  that bishops and archbishops be more cautious in licensing of preachers  and that all disobeyers of these injunctions shall be punished with suspension from office and benefice till the archbishops with advice of their convocation prescribe some further punishment  formerly the puritans had only offended by scrupling popish ceremonies or forms of government now their faithful adherence to what they had been required to subscribe in the thirtynine articles contrary to arminianism rendered them offenders and excluded them from preferment nay in many places bishops and their officials restricted preachers to the express words of the catechism in their afternoon work  having to his inexpressible grief accidentally killed a man in hunting archbishop abbot withdrew himself from the privy council in which his advice had been little regarded on account of his tenderness to pious and conscientious scruplers  having lost their friend many of these puritans retired to america and popery came in like a flood to promote the marriage of charles with the spanish infanta it was agreed that she and all her servant children and descendents should have liberty to profess the popish religion that she should have a church oratory and chapel furnished with all necessary ornaments and utensils that she should have a bishop and    priests to officiate with full jurisdiction that she and her servants should have full liberty to procure dispensations indulgences jubilees etc from rome that no english laws against papists shall in the least affect the popish descendents of this marriage or stop their succession to the crown that the infanta shall educate her children in her own religion till they be ten years of age  to these articles james swore before two spanish ambassadors and twentyfour privy counselors who subscribed the treaty he and his son swore also to some private articles that there should be no future execution of the laws against papists nor any new ones made that there should be a perpetual toleration of the popish religion in private houses that the infanta should never be solicited to change her religion that they should deal with the parliament to rescind the laws against papists  charles further swore that he would deal with his father to allow the infanta to have the education of her children till they were twelve years of age and that he would diligently hearken to such priests as she would employ to confer with him on points of religion the papists began to triumph and the protestants to tremble archbishop abbot by a letter earnestly remonstrated against the match after all james solemnly called god to witness that he sincerely detested popery and that the increase of it was a heavy burden on his soul meanwhile his parliament presented him with a list of    popish lords and knights in office while scarcely any that was but suspected of puritanism could be admitted to be a justice of peace and after finishing the french match for his son he allowed ten thousand papists to be confirmed at the french ambassadors lodging  in      james died not without suspicion of poison he was possessed of some learning deeply tinctured with pedantry and selfconceit he appears to have been void of all religion or common honesty and remarkable for silly cowardice base dissimulation presumptuous perjury profane swearing lewd speech or behavior ambition of arbitrary power and rage against puritans during his reign papists but especially the puritans exceedingly increased while the high churchmen by their ignorance error and impiety became the detestation of all sober protestants their doctrine became at last high arminianism while himself if he had any profession was half or wholly a papist bent on reconciling the popish and protestant faith james new bishops were almost perfectly similar they maintained the romish to be a true church and the pope the principal bishop in christendom they contended for the lawfulness of images in churches and for the real presence of christ in the sacrament and that transubstantiation was but a scholastic nicety they pled for auricular confession and priestly absolution and the merit of good works they gave up with the morality of the christian sabbath they claimed an uninterrupted succession of the episcopal character from the apostles they were mad on the imitating of papists in rich furniture of chapels and gaudy pomp of worship while they flamed with zeal in compromising matters with rome they were notoriously negligent of instructing their people in the truths of god almost every practical writer of note as willat dyke preston sibbs byfield bolton hildersham dod ball whatley etc were puritans  charles i ascended his throne a hearty enemy to the puritans looking on them as a kind of seditious and treacherous persons who would take their first opportunity of revolting from the temporal jurisdiction as they had done from the spiritual his queen whom he almost adored was a bigoted french papist and had the education of her children secured to her till they should be thirteen years of age her conscience was directed by her confessor assisted by the popes nuncio and a secret cabal of jesuits and priests bishop laud was of a rough temper prone to severities especially against the paritans impatient of contradiction very arbitrary and superstitious and though not an absolute papist extremely fond of near approaches to popery and of being patriarch of britain and ireland the privy council and the starchamber in which the same persons were members and the high commission managed almost every thing in some respects the last was worse than the spanish inquisition as they punished people without any breach of law  arminianism daily gained ground with all such as coveted preferment laud had attempted to have it approved by the convocation had not bishop andrews persuaded him that it was too soon to put it to the trial  henrietta the popish queen had scarcely arrived in england when a plague followed her and cut off above forty thousand in london and places about a solemn fast was appointed to supplicate god for the removal of it when the parliament met the commons earnestly remonstrated against the increase of popery and the several causes of it and begged that the preaching of gods word might be increased and the labors of pious peaceable and learned scruplers at the ceremonies used  and that pluralities nonresidences and commendams might be moderated charles promised in the fairest manner but be had already begun to believe that no faith is to be kept with parliaments upon the very day after he had wrote to archbishop abbot to proceed against the papists and had by a proclamation required all english youth to be recalled from the popish seminaries abroad he appointed eleven popish priests to be liberated fiftynine popish nobility and gentry were in places of power and trust the titular bishop of chalcedon was appointed the popes vicar general and archdeacons all over england  charles sent eight of his war ships to attack rochelle the rough sailors and soldiers being more pious than the royal martyr refused to fight for papists against their protestant brethren but were betrayed into the hands of french officers  montague one of his majestys chaplains published his gag for an old goose which contained several principles calculated to disturb the church or state the house of commons condemned it and the archbishop prohibited him to write any more on such subjects but encouraged by the court he quickly published his appeal to caesar the tendency of which was to promote arminianism and reconciliation with rome and to advance the kings prerogative above the laws of the land after examination the commons condemned it as contrary to the doctrine of the church of england and bound montague in recognizance of two thousand pounds for his appearance at their bar when called apprehending o pretending this to be an invasion of his majesty prerogative and a dangerous precedent laud and other two bishops through buckingham persuaded charles to take the cause into his own hand an soon after to still the noise about the increase o popery and his assisting of his popish brotherin law against the protestants of rochelle he dissolved the parliament notwithstanding his extraordinary ca to prevent the return of any puritan members b marking them out for sheriffs the parliamentar commons next year fell directly upon montague errors he was accused of maintaining that the church of rome is and always was a true church which had stood firm on the foundation of the sacraments and doctrine instituted by christ that a doctrine of faith hope or charity is controverted between papists and protestants that images are useful for instructing the people and as an excitemen to devotion that some saints and angels have a pculiar patronage over certain persons and countries that justified persons may fall from grace  and of branding puritans and even exact conformists with odious names  of scoffing at preaching lecturing and all other appearances of serious religion  and that the scope of his book was to reconcile the english church to the roman see charles again took the cause into his own hand and dissolved the parliament  nevertheless montagues arminian errors were refuted from the press by bishop carleton doctors sutliff featly and goad and messrs ward burton yates wotton prynne rouse etc several conferences for debating the arminian errors having happened charles perhaps instigated by laud and neile prohibited all further deputing on these points laud and his friends having the management in their hands turned the edge of this proclamation wholly against the puritans they could not have their books printed if they contained any thing against arminianism or popery while their opponents were allowed full liberty and had no small encouragement archbishop abbot was suspended from his office for refusing to concur in betraying the liberties of church and state into his majestys hand and for his christian moderation toward such as scrupled at the ceremonies or even the government of the church and for much the same reason williams bishop of lincoln fell under the displeasure of the court but montague sibthorp and manwaring arminian stretchers of the royal prerogative were caressed and preferred when the parliament met in      they again remonstrated against the increase of popery in england and ireland in which last papists had boldly refused to concur in the defense of the kingdom unless they were allowed a legal toleration and to have houses for religious worship in dublin and other places but so impudent in uttering falsehood were charles and laud that they pretended all these clamours about arminianism and popery to be groundless   conformity to the rules of the church that the matter preached by lecturers be carefully observed  that none but noblemen and others qualified in law be allowed to keep chaplains that care be taken to have reading of prayers and catechizing as well attended as the sermons laud caused to transmit a copy of these instructions to every parson for the due observation of them and by his archdeacons made search for all lecturers and chaplains these lecturers so much suspected were chiefly of the puritan stamp who scrupling at full conformity only preached in the afternoon having no legal benefice but chosen and maintained by the people being men of a remarkably holy practice strict observers of the lords day warm preachers and staunch calvinists laud accounted them the great plagues of church and state when a fast was observed in london for the removal of the raging pestilence prayers were appointed to be read in all the churches

attendents went in procession round about the church repeating the hundredth and the nineteenth psalms he then read some short prayers beseeching god to accept of that beautiful building and that a

from a written book read a number of curses against a such as should profane that holy place by musters o soldiers or by holding of civil courts in it or b bearing of burdens through it at the end of

presumption  in      laud being made chancellor of the university of oxford expelled several of the fellows for preaching or teaching antiarminian doctrine and appointed others to be sharply admonished for his singular appearances of piety and for preaching twice every lords day mr crowder was deposed and imprisoned by the high commission  about four years before drs gouge sibbs and other clergymen had formed a scheme to buy up all the ecclesiastical impropriations that were in the hands of laymen and not in the service of the church in order to bestow the profits thereof as salaries

his ill usage of his parliaments an taking upon himself the faults of his ministers he ha much lost the affection of his subjects and had bu few friends of credit and interest at home bot french and spaniards were pleased with his distress foreign protestants abhorred the ruling bishops an wished well to their oppressed brethren the que was hated by every body who regarded either region or liberty the bishops could not but expe to have their late tyranny resented and their pow abridged the judges were contemned and hated for betraying the laws of their country and giving their sanction to almost all the illegal proceedings of the privy council and starchamber it is nevertheless certain that few members of weight in the parliament had any intention to subvert the episcopalian government of the church till the haughty behavior of the bishops and some other circumstances gradually led them to it  being met the commons immediately appointed a committee to receive grievances relative to religion they soon attacked the late canons and after warm reasonings found that the clergy have no power to make any binding canons without consent of parliament that the late canons made by the convocation of london and york are not obligatory on any of the subjects that they contain many things inconsistent with his majestys prerogative laws of the and rights of parliament and liberties of the subects that their grant of a tax or benevolence is ontrary to law and not binding upon any of the lergy it was pled that they had no power to sit after the parliament was dissolved and therefore all their canons were ipso facto null and void  that everal of them were bad in themselves and that he oath which they had framed was in some points mbiguous and in others directly false and illegal  the convocation met again along with this parliaent but having no commission from his majesty hey transacted no business of importance and after aud their great supporter was impeached they lost ll heart dwindled away and broke up without either prorogation or adjournment after he had or many years oppressed the conscientious part of he nation laud was now loaded with manifold imes the scotch commissioners accused him of aking diverse alterations in religion contrary to their anding laws and imposing upon them a book of mons and a service book contrary to the discipline ad goovernment of their church and that he had composed a public prayer for their destruction as traitors and rebels and had caused it to be read in all the churches in england the house of commons impeached him of attempting to subvert their constitution by an introduction of arbitrary power  of procuring sermons to be preached and pamphlets printed in which the authority of parliament is denied and the absolute power of the king asserted  of interrupting the course of justice by his messages threatenings and promises to the judges  o selling justice himself and advising his majesty to sel places of judicature of procuring the canons and oath imposed by the late convocation of robbing his majesty of his ecclesiastical supremacy and pretending that spiritual jurisdiction is not derived from the crown of introducing popish ceremonies and cruelly persecuting such as opposed them of promoting men of corrupt principles and practice to the principal stations in the church of retaining chaplains popishly disposed and committing to them the licensing of books to the scandal of the protestan religion of attempting to reconcile the english church to the romish of discountenancing sermons and silencing depriving imprisoning and banishing godly and orthodox ministers of dividing the church of england from her sister protestant churches abroad of being the author of all the late disturbances in scotland and england of endeavoring to deprive the kingdom of its legislative power by alienating hi majesty from his parliament upon this impeachment laud was imprisoned in the tower and soo after suspended from his archbishopric after h had lain in prison about four years ten other articles were exhibited against him not much differen in matter from some of these mentioned notwithstanding his own and his advocates remarkable quibbling so much of his indictment was proved as notwithstanding his majestys pardon brought him to lose his head on tower hill jan  0       much about the time that laud was sent to the tower bishop williams was discharged and charles to gain him to his side promised him satisfaction for all the loss he had sustained prynne burton and bastwick and leighton were liberated and indemnification of their losses out of the estates of laud and his fellow members of the high commission and starchamber voted them but i suppose the subsequent confusions prevented their obtaining much of it a complaint was preferred against bishops pierce montague owen and manwaring and against several of the inferior clergymen for their zealously promoting popish innovations and cruelly persecuting such as opposed them but the commons had not leisure to prosecute them while the parliament manifested their abhorrence of the late measures the people could scarcely be restrained from tumultuously pulling down and destroying whatever they were told had been illegally set up the bishops could scarcely officiate according to their late injunctions or even walk in the streets in their robes without being upbraided as popish priests etc  read prayers were decried as a lifeless quenching of the spirit of god and not suited to the times  the moderate brownists or independents had still held their meetings as secretly as possible lathorp having succeeded jacob as their pastor one of the members having had a child baptized in the episcopal church this occasioned a dispute in the congregation whether it ought to be rebaptized the greater part holding the negative such as insisted for a rebaptism separated themselves and chose one jasse for their pastor who laid the foundation of the first baptist congregation that i meet with in england the rest of the congregation renewed their covenant to walk together in the ways of the lord and notwithstanding manifoldhardships continued remarkably steadfast dispirited by the rent of their congregation lathorp and about thirty others retired to new england can the author of the marginal references on the bible succeeded him but after he had preached a year or two in private houses lauds persecution obliged him to flee to holland where he was pastor to the brownists at amsterdam samuel how supplied his room at london but lauds party having excommunicated and imprisoned him his church chose stephen more for their pastor finding how things went in this parliament they ventured to hold their meetings more publicly the marshal of the kings bench came upon about eighty of them assembled together and threw the most of them into prison  next morning five or six of them were carried before the house of lords to whom they honestly declared that they could own no other head of the church than christ that no laws contrary to these of god ought to be obeyed and they disowned the jurisdiction of the pope and every other foreigner such a declaration a few weeks or months before would have cost them their ears but now the lords dismissed them with a gentle reprimand and three or four of them went to their meeting next sabbath and were not a little satisfied with their order in preaching and administering the lords supper  though the commons could not yet rectify the old canon law which had long been an unfathomable source of oppression in the spiritual courts they voted down the late innovations and appointed commissioners in all counties to demolish and remove out of churches and chapels all images crucifixes superstitious pictures and other relics of idolatry according to the injunctions of edward and elizabeth they prohibited the imposing of the oath of uniformity upon the students of cambridge and oxford at their matriculation they made it their business to cut off illegal additions from the worship discipline and government of the church and to punish such as had promoted the introduction of them contrary to the laws of the land  the freedom which the commons used with the bishops and their canons awakened the attention of the whole nation the press being now open several pamphlets not in the most decent language were published against these diocesan lords and their office archbishop usher applied himself to defend the episcopal order as apostolical but by bishop be meant no more than a stated president over presbyters  which most of the puritans were willing to admit his half presbyterian scheme was far enough from pleasing his brethren about a year before bishop hall directed by laud had published a defense of hierarchical episcopacy in which he attempted to prove that it was an apostolical institution and of perpetual obligation that as the pious christian fathers would not change the form of church government which they had received from the apostles the universal practice of the primitive church is the best rule of judging concerning the apostolical practice and that presbyterian government having no foundation in the word of god or in the practice of the christian church for   00 years is altogether unjustifiable as laud in revising it had altered several passages hall could scarcely go the length of his own book nevertheless he now published a remonstrance to the parliament and soon after a defense of it in vindication of liturgies and diocesan episcopacy his performances were answered by messrs stephen marshal edmund calamy thomas young matthew newcomb and william spurstow in their smectymnus so called from the initial letters of their name in which they showed that the scripture no where restricts men to set forms of prayer that for  00 years after christ there were no set forms of prayer imposed by the church and defy the bishop to produce one genuine liturgy within that time they showed that the english liturgy is extracted from popish models and in many places offensive to tender christians that bishops and presbyters are represented as the same in office in scripture that both scripture and the ancient church allowed presbyters to ordain pastors without bishops as archbishop usher and all the english bishops for many years after the reformation thought they might and that for  00 years after christ bishops had no chancellories or commissaries they showed manifest differences between the bishops of the  d and  th century and the diocesans in england they concluded beseeching the parliament to reduce episcopacy to its primitive simplicity if they retained it and that the liturgy might be reformed if they continued it and not at all imposed but left to preachers discretion how much of it should be read where there was sermon had all the other bishops been as pious and moderate as hall with all his high flights matters had readily been compromised but the courtiers were too proud to stoop an hair breadth to their opponents and so to the great satisfaction of the papists the contentions increased till both church and state were in flames  the fate of the hierarchy being now in the hands of the parliament petitions subscribed by multitudes for or against it were presented to both houses some as that called the root and branch petition subscribed by   000 citizens and other inhabitants of london craved that the whole fabric of episcopacy might be demolished another subscribed by   00 beneficed clergymen only insisted for the reformation of it in which they were joined by great multitudes in othet representations nineteen petitions signed in whole by about an hundred thousand six thousand of whom were noblemen gentry and dignified clergy insisted for the continuance of the establishment as it had stood since the reformation these different petitions furnished the commons with a large field of elaborate debates  sir henry vane younger thomas bagshaw and white insisted for the total abolishment of the hierarchy lords falkland and digby the most noted of the royalists insisted for the continuance and reformation of it representing the present bishops and their agents as a set of infernal oppressors who had tried how much of the papist they could bring in without popery and how much of the gospel they could destroy without exposing themselves to punishment by the civil law as the papists who flocked about the court being protected by the queen sometimes insulted the courts of judicature the commons besought his majesty to issue forth a proclamation for executing the laws against papists in general and to remove them from his court and all such as refused the oath of supremacy from the army and garrison and to disarm their whole body as their number was become dangerous to the nation there being about  000 of them in one parish of westminster these addresses did but provoke the papists the king and queen being determined to protect them as long as they could charles even reprived goodman a seminary priest under sentence of death in newgate  which occasioned warm remonstrances from both houses of parliament  in      wentworth now earl of strafford who had once been a most zealous asserter of the rights of the subjects was attainted of high treason for endeavoring to subvert the government in england and ireland and to introduce arbitrary power of kings charles countenanced a plot to draw the army to london and rescue him by force this but enraged the parliament and made his condemnation the more harmonious even falkland and digby who opposed his attainder represented him as a most insupportable tyrant his conduct as lord lieutenant of ireland too strongly verified it with great reluctance charles signed his sentence of death and perhaps not till himself had hypocritically desired him to do it for the peace of the kingdom a design of charles dissolving the parliament taking air the citizens of london declared that they would lend no money upon the parliaments security if their sitting were so precarious money being immediately needed to pay off the scotch and english armies in the north charles was obliged to ratify an act bearing that the parliament should neither be dissolved nor adjourned without their own consent alarmed by the discovery of a popish plot against them and the flight of the conspirators both houses bishops not excepted entered into a solemn covenant in the presence of almighty god to maintain with life power and estate as far as they lawfully might the protestant religion against papists and popish innovations  and his majestys person honor and estate and the privileges of the parliament and rights and liberties of the nation and of every one concurring in this protestation in every thing they do in prosecution of it  and by all proper methods to endeavor to bring to condign punishment all that act contrary to the contents of it  and by all just and honorable methods labor to preserve the union and peace between the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland  and that neither fear hope or any other motive should make them relinquish this vow promise and protestation this was subscribed by eighty lords seventeen bishops nine judges and four hundred and thirtyeight members of the house of commons and it was immediately printed and sent to all the sheriffs and justices to be taken by the whole nation the minister reading and taking it himself and then those of his congregation the names of such as took or refused it being entered in different registers the commons soon after voted the refusers of it unfit to bear office either in church or state this protestation except what relates to the hierarchy is materially the same with the solemn league  the commons next attempted to exclude the bishops from their seat in parliament and to abolish deans chapters archdeacons prebendaries chantors canons and their officers and to bestow their salaries in supporting preachers for the instruction of the people but both bills were lost in the house o lords meanwhile these peers had appointed ten earls ten bishops and ten barons to examine what innovations needed to be removed these appointed a subcommittee of bishops and divines on both sides several rectifications were proposed in the doctrine worship and discipline williams of lincoln who was chairman or moderator presented a plan for regulating the power and conduct of bishops but which almost nothing diminished their power archbishop usher who was then occasionally in england offered another bearing that vicars and church wardens should have much the same power as presbyterial sessions suffragans and their clergy should meet every month in the manner of presbyteries bishops and their clergy once or twice a year in the manner of synods archbishops bishops and suffragans together with duly chosen representatives of the inferior clergy once in three years in provincial synod  and both meet in one national synod when the parliament should sit this scheme was much the same with the presbyterian except that the bishops or their suffragans were constant moderators but when it appeared that the bishops stuck together in the parliament against all alterations the committee broke up without agreeing on any plan this stiffness of the bishops provoked their opposers to rise in their demands meanwhile the high commission and starchamber courts being abolished and an act passed against their future erection the puritans declared their zeal for a manifesto which charles s he intended for the meeting of the german princes at ratisbon in favor of his sister elizabeth queen of bohemia and her children bearing that he intended to do his utmost to have them restored to their electorate  baffled in their former attempts to reduce the power of the bishops the commons impeached laud and other twelve of them of high crimes and misdemeanors  for making and publishing the late canons contrary to his majestys prerogative and the fundamental laws of the land the rights of parliament and liberties of the subjects they did not resign their seats as was expected but craved time to prepare answers as charles intended to set off for scotland to complete the pacification with that kingdom the treaty between the two nations and act of oblivion excepting the scotch bishops and four others were ratified and confirmed in this treaty an endeavoring after an union and uniformity in religion and church government with the scots was approved by his majesty and his houses of parliament and on the national thanksgiving for the peace the scots who had a little before been declared rebels were by order of parliament declared good subjects from all the pulpits in england  scarcely had he returned from scotland when the english bishops severely reproached him for consenting to the abolishment of prelacy and ratification of presbytery in that kingdom this together with his consenting to the condemnation of strafford lay heavy on his heart  complaints of want of sermon in churches being presented to the commons they appointed afternoon sermons in every church either by the vicar or some other chosen by the parish in his room and that people may at their own charge set up lecturers to preach on sabbaths or other days where sermon is wanting forty members were appointed as a committee to provide preachers and salaries for vacant congregations and another committee to examine complaints against scandalous clergymen many of which had been presented they also appointed that the lords day should be more carefully sanctified and no sports be allowed on it that all images of divine persons or virgin mary should be abolished and bowing at the name of jesus or toward the east or the communion table laid aside as archbishop laud in his prison still presumed to ordain clergymen the lords suspended him from his office and sequestrated his jurisdiction in the hand of inferior officers till he should clear himself from his charge notwithstanding all their zeal for reformation the commons severely punished such as pretended to promote it in a tumultuous manner or dared to preach without orders  the earl of antrim and sir phelim oneal heads of the popish party in ireland having acquainted the queen the nuncio and priests about her how easily they could assume the irish government and assist his majesty against the english puritans she and charles by letters authorized them to seize the government they immediately took arms and bound themselves by oath to maintain the catholic religion and bear true and faithful allegiance to the kings majesty and his laws and defend them with their lives and estates against all opponents they called themselves the queens army and published a declaration bearing that they acted by his majestys commission under the great seal and a letter written by himself having assembled to the number of twenty or thirty thousand they judged it proper first to massacre all the protestants in ireland that they might afterward with safety march against the english or scots as his majesty or queen directed regardless of relation neighborhood or humanity they massacred about two hundred thousand of them in cold blood and in the most barbarous forms notwithstanding all the pains taken to conceal and deny it it now plainly appears from the accounts given by burnet birch and lately published papers of clarendon that charles himself as well as the queen and nuncio were deeply chargeable with this bloodshed though it is probable their agents overdid their orders the news of this massacre struck the english with the utmost consternation and the parliament devised methods for securing themselves and nation against the papists and for transporting an army to ireland for the relief of the poor remains of their protestant brethren charles insisted for sending over ten thousand forces from england but the commons dreading an insurrection of papists at home insisted for sending the ten thousand which the scots had generously offered no were their suspicions groundless charles appeare extremely unwilling to act against his popish friend he had deprived the parliament of their guard h had turned out the earl of leicester lieutenant o ireland and parsons one of the most active protestant justices in that kingdom he intercepted tw hundred thousand pounds sent by the english parliament to ireland he received deputations from the irish papists more respectfully than those from h protestant subjects even during the pacification h could scarcely forbear calling the scots rebels t bu he had almost to be compelled to call the irish cu throats such after he had done it no more tha forty copies of his declaration were allowed to b printed and not one to be dispersed without furthe orders  about eight days after his majesty returned from scotland the commons presented him with tw hundred grievances of the nation they charged the origination of them on the jesuited papists the cou bishops the corrupt clergy and some corrupt counselors who had engaged themselves in the intere of foreign powers they represented that the had been carried on by oppressing the purity an power of religion  by cherishing the arminians i the points in which they agreed with the papists  by introducing such innovations in religion as promote a reconcilement with popery  and by fomening differences between him and his parliament an encouraging him to illegal and arbitrary methods  raising supplies with respect to religion they complained of the censuring of many pious learned an laborious ministers the oppression of multitudes  faithful subjects by the bishops the almost spani inquisitorial severity of the high commission assiste by his privy council the rigor of the bisho courts which had driven many from the kingdom the preferring of those to ecclesiastical honors wh were most active promoters of superstition or viruent railers against piety and honesty the imposition f popish innovations in scotland and england in rder to effect a reconciliation with the romish church the favor shown to papists the late caens and conduct of the bishops in opposition to his supremacy they represented their desire to have a synod of the most pious and learned divines assembled for giving advice how far it is proper to reform the church and informed him of their care to promote earning and provide for the support of faithful and preaching ministers  and of their intention to have he two universities of oxford and cambridge purged of their corruptions  as the lords appeared to favor the bishops and to shift off their trial the people renewed their supplications to the commons whom they reckoned the support of religion and liberty the mayor and aldermen of london presented a petition craving that for the promoting of reformation the bishops and popish lords might be removed from the house of peers soon after the apprentices petitioned that the popish lords and other noted persons of that religion might be taken into custody and prelacy rooted out the puritan clergy besought the parliament speedily to rectify that which they found amiss in the church meanwhile two petitions were presented in favors of prelacy as the only government of apostolical institution sealed with the blood of martyrs and admirably suited to the civil government of the nation about the time the apprentices presented their petition some began to insult the bishops as they went to or returned from the parliament house they remonstrated to charles and the lords that on account of danger to their persons they absented and protested that nothing enacted by the parliament during their involuntary absence should be valid in law the lords immediately communicated their protest to the commons who upon the footing of it impeached the twelve bishops who had signed it of high treason in endeavoring to subvert the fundamental laws of the land and the ver being of parliaments the same evening they were sequestered and ten of them sent to the tower ha of norwich and his brother of durham on accoun of their former useful labors were but committe to the custody of the black rod thus william now archbishop of york and his brethren by an ac of almost pure madness entangled themselves instead of prosecuting their impeachment the parliament voted them entirely out of the house and too all temporal jurisdiction from persons in holy orders and charles in hopes that it would satisfy the people and prevent all further demands reluctantly ratified their deed as the bishops were generally hated especially at london the passing of this bill wa attended with bonefires and illumination of window  being resolved to pass no more particular acts relative to religion charles retired from london an his queen to holland  a plain signal of his intention to break with his parliament after he and they ha some altercation the scots to his great offense an their satisfaction offered to mediate between them once and again he rejected their offers and applie to the papists and the not much better collegian of oxford and cambridge but the parliament professed their readiness to accept the scots mediation and endeavored to cultivate a good correspondenc with them the scotch general assembly by  letter solicited the english parliament to promot uniformity with them in church government an worship and to extirpate prelacy as without tha they could not hope to have one confession of faith catechism or form of worship the parliament returned a kind reply desiring that the scots would join them in beseeching his majesty to call an assembly of divines and would send some of their own t it for promoting the much desired uniformity t encourage them to these things they with amazin harmony abolished that form of episcopacy which was established by the english laws but as this act only appointed it to cease about a year after and provided nothing in its place it is probable that some of the english managers hoped before that time to obtain peace with his majesty and so retain episcopacy with some modifications and indeed the whole pertinents of prelacy were never abolished till after he was reduced  about this time an uncommon seriousness and devotion prevailed among those that lived in places to which the power of the parliament chiefly extended the sabbath was sanctified with unusual strictness the churches were crowded with attentive hearers three or four times a day the officers of the peace walked in the streets and shut up all public houses nor did any travel on roads or walk in fields but in case of absolute necessity religious exercises were so universally set up in private families that at certain hours one might have traversed the streets of london without seeing one idle person or hearing any thing but the sound of prayers and praises from churches and houses the parliament prohibited stage plays as too often expressive of levity and wantonness  and other diversions as not suited to their afflicted circumstances they commanded the monthly fasts which had been appointed about a year before with his majestys consent for bewailing the deplorable ciroumstances of ireland to be exactly observed morning exercises were set up in churches to pray for persons in the army or otherwise in danger and to administer proper exhortations  morning lectures were set up for the benefit of members of parliament the laws against vice were so strictly executed that no stews or gaming houses were to be found nor was profane swearing or like debauchery to be seen or heard in the streets the like appearances of religion prevailed in the parliaments army the most of their soldiers not so much fighting for pay as for religion and liberty and they had the most noted preachers for chaplains to their regiments meanwhile most of his majestys partisans and warriors were remarkably profligate ready to take every sober person for a puritan and to plunder him on that account  by means of which not a few were induced or forced into the parliaments side many of his preachers knew little more of their business than to rail at the puritans and their doctrines of gods free grace  in      after a solemn fast in which they and the nation bewailed their own and fathers iniquities the parliament warmly requested his majesty that the laws should be strictly executed against the papists and that they should be obliged to abjure the popes supremacy transubstantiation purgatory and worship of images  and their children trained up in the protestant religion and that he would give his assent to the five acts which they had made  for suppressing innovations in gods worship for strict observation of the lords day  for the abolishment of prelacy  for the punishment of scandalous clergymen  for the restraint of pluralities of church livings with charge of souls and nonresidences of clergymen at their charges  and for calling an assembly of learned divines to advise them in settling the government and liturgy of the church but he was far enough from any honest compliance with such demands  the clergy of both sides had peculiar hardships to endure from both sides charles partisans had hanged up some of the puritan clergy if the parliament had not threatened to make reprisals the committee which the parliament appointed to purge out scandalous clergymen was obliged to subdivide itself on account of the vast extent of their work shocking discoveries were made in the lives of not a few of the conforming clergy many insulted the committees and their witnesses and threatened reprisals notwithstanding the ejection of multitudes for their scandals not a few scarcely tolerable in their practice were allowed to retain their charges the parliament supplied the place of the ejected the best way they could two congregations were sometimes committed to one pastor and some that were too weak were admitted to others meanwhile they seized the bishops lands to assist them in carrying on their war with his majesty allowing considerable pensions to such of them as had been more decent and less wicked they proceeded in appointing organs and monuments of superstition and idolatry to be removed from places of public worship besides their monthly fasts on wednesdays which charles and his friends observed on holy fridays they appointed several occasional fasts on account of their distressful circumstances the war between the different parties being carried on from the press with almost as much fury as in the field the parliament prohibited the printing of any book which was not licensed by such as they appointed for that work  different licensers being allotted to the different sciences to which books pertained  despairing of charles concurrence with them in calling an assembly of divines the parliament by themselves called one not to be an independent judicatory of jesus christ but a committee for advising them in religious matters proper to be considered and established by civil authority having had lists of the best qualified persons in the several counties transmitted to them by knights and burgesses they selected an hundred and twentyone divines to which they added ten lords and twenty commoners with equal power of debating and voting when any of these died the parliament chose his successor mest alexander henderson george gillespy samuel rutherfoord and robert bailie ministers lord maitland the earl of lowdon and archibald johnston afterward lord warriston ruling elders commissioners from the scotch general assembly were not without some reluctance admitted as members no more than about ninetysix of the english divines gave any proper attendance archbishop usher bishop brownrig henry hammond john hacket george morley robert sanderson and william nicolson the four last of whom after the restoration were bishops of litchfield winchester lincoln and gloucester never took their seats though the parliament had appointed episcopalians as well as presbyterians and independents members few of the first kind ever took their seats and those that did quickly withdrew when charles prohibited their meeting because the members had not been chosen by the clergy and many of them were either laymen or puritans they that continued in it were generally men of eminent piety learning and faithfulness to god and their country their meeting was opened july   with a sermon by dr twisse their prolocutor or moderator they agreed upon a solemn vow to be taken by every member at his admission that he should maintain no doctrine but what he believed most agreeable to the word of god and nothing in points of discipline but what he believed to be conducive to the glory of god and the peace and welfare of his church this their solemn vow or oath was read to them every monday morning to render it deep and fresh in their minds after fixing the order of their procedure they petitioned the parliament to appoint a solemn fast for divine direction in their important business and that they would take still more effectual methods for rooting out the ignorance profanation of the sabbath profane swearing cursing drunkenness and uncleanness still found in the land that they would speedily purge out ignorant and scandalous clergymen and substitute proper ministers in their stead  that they would exert themselves for the relief of those ministers whom his majestys party retained in distressful imprisonment at oxford a committee of the assembly was appointed to revise the thirtynine articles and render them more plain and pointed particularly in opposition to arminianism but after a review of fifteen rticles this was dropped and it was resolved to draw up a more full confession of faith to mark their eal against antinomianism they condemned some notions of crisp eaton and saltmarsh and labored sometimes not very circumspectly to confute them n their sermons and writings  the parliaments affairs being reduced to a low ebb they deputied the earl of rutland sir henry vane and messrs stephen marshal and philip nigh and three others to negotiate with the scotch convention of estates and general assembly for some assistance in this critical hour the assembly considering that the english had befriended them in their distress and that the protestant religion in britain was in danger and that by this means their own religion might be the better secured and an uniformity with their english brethren promoted  earnestly advised to grant their request on proper terms a draught of a solemn league with one another and covenant with god approved by the scotch assembly and convention of estates being brought up to london the parliament referred it to the assembly of divines where it met with no small opposition gataker and others refused to subscribe it till they got that which related to prelacy so circumscribed as in their view not to exclude archbishop ushers scheme of primitive episcopacy the scotch divines insisted to have prelacy abjured as sinful but most of the english opposed this the independents erastians and half episcopalians thought that the words according to the word of god sufficiently protected them against the inroads of scotch presbytery and the scots thought the following words according to the practice of the best reformed churches necessarily meant their own government and discipline when coleman the noted erastian read it to the lords in order to their swearing and subscribing it he openly declared that by abjuring prelacy they did not abjure all kinds of episcopacy but only that kind particularly described in this oath  after this covenant had been sworn by both houses of parliament the assembly of divines and the inhabitants of london the parliament appointed it to be taken by the rest of the nation above eighteen years of age and transmitted along with it an exhortation by the assembly to take it  and directions regulating the manner of doing it great numbers took it cheerfully and with a good conscience others did so because the parliament and their circumstances required it when it was imposed upon the english in holland the elector palatine of the rhine and who afterward sat for a time with the westminster assembly took it not long afterward the parliament enacted that none should be counselors in burghs or have the power of electing one unless they took it ministers were required to take it at their ordination none were to be continued in trust civil or military who obstinately refused it these mandates of the parliament were not very punctually executed richard baxter and some other puritan ministers much prevented the imposition of this covenant in the corners where they resided at oxford and many other places it was little urged unless upon such as were suspected or rather well known to favor the kings party and not so properly as a religious vow as an oath of obedience to the parliament after the war it was imposed on the royalists with much the same intent  the committee for purging out scandalous ministers sometimes made use of the covenant for discovering malignant clergymen  which occasioned a report that they were turned out for refusing it but their immoralities and disaffection to the parliament were ordinarily if not always the true cause of their sequestration nay i do not know of on single person punished for his simple refusal of thi covenant charles by a proclamation declared i traitorous and seditious and prohibited all his subjects to give or take it about the same time h agreed to a cessation of arms with the irish papists those hands were so deeply dipped in murder but he scotch troops refused to adhere to it and for everal years stood their ground against these bloody utthroats the best way they could he then caled over not only part of the duke of osmonds army but also some thousands of these popish murdeers to assist him against his parliament fifteen undred of them perished at sea such of them as came and served under himself or under montrose his agent in scotland brought their savage disposition along with them killing people in cold blood spoiling the country and burning what they could not carry off this alienated the earls of holland bedford clare and carlisle  sir henry deering and others of his best friends from him as they saw him regardless of the welfare of his kingdom the parliament ordered the assembly to inform the soreign protestants of his artifices and of the tokens of his disregard of the protestant religion notwithstanding his solemn declarations of attachment to it  charles pursued their representation at the heels with a contrary declaration but his manifest obstinacy n supporting the hierarchy and dissimulation even n receiving the sacrament from archbishop usher made it little regarded about this time died chilingworth who after revolting to the jesuits returned to the protestants and seemed to be an arian or socinian  and also the two famous commoners hampden and pym  in      charles held a small parliament at oxford while the majority of the peers and three hundred and eighty of the commons adhered to the parliament but their proposals were too pacific to please him meanwhile twentyone thousand scots having entered england for their assistance the parliament at westminster took heart and resolved to proceed in their intended reformation and to establish a new form of discipline and government the earl of manchester with two ministers were appointed to purge the university of cambridge which though under the power of the parliament had hitherto proved a sanctuary for their enemies manchester proceeded with great mildness and though he tendered the covenant to many yet such as behaved peaceably were allowed to keep their places notwithstanding they declined taking it about a hundred and fifty of the fellows kept their places most of the other two hundred had before gone of to the royal army which was now commanded by rupert prince palatines brother and almost wholl composed of furious banditti j cosins tho pak b laney s collins e martin r stern w beale t comber r holdsworth s ward r brownrigg who had zealously taught their students tha it was unlawful on any account to resist the king were turned out and l seaman r chudworth r vines b whichcot h palmer t young j arrowsmith t hill r minshul w spurstow and afterward j lightfoot were put in their place the vacant fellowships were filled up with men learned and pious as fast as they could the assembly examined the candidates before their admission i consequence of this change not only learning bu sanctification of the sabbath and other branches o piety prevailed in the colleges  the purgation o the scandalous clergy still continued near tw thousand were turned out of whom   00 were proved guilty of scandal by the oath of habile witnesses  unless they retired to his majestys quarters the parliament allowed them a fifth part of their salary for the support of their wives and children an these that labored in their stead were allowed the other four parts these were admitted by the choic of the congregations and examination by a committee of the assembly consisting of twentytwo members  finding his forces unable to resist the united strength of the parliament and their scotch allies charles professed himself ready to hearken to term of accommodation a treaty was for a time prosecuted at uxbridge in which there was perhaps too little sincerity on either side and each suspected the other charles professed chiefly to scruple at allowing or establishing of any other form of worship or government than had been long used to enlighten his conscience messrs a henderson of edinburgh s marshal and r vines held a solemn conference before him with dr stewart and others of his party concerning episcopacy and its attendent ceremonies neither party appeared convinced by their opponents but charles perhaps without any intention of performance promised that he would admit of the reduction of prelacy almost to archbishop ushers plan before the scots came to assist them the parliament would have been glad of his offer but now they would accept of nothing less than the complete abolishment of prelacy  meanwhile the work of the assembly proceeded but slowly on account of the different parties in it each of which had their supporters in parliament  the presbyterians were the most numerous having the scotch divines and london ministers for their principals and denzil hollis w waller philip stapleton j clotworthy b rudyard  maynard massey harley glyn and some others for their chief supporters in the house of commons seldom whitlock lightfoot coleman and some others like the english reformers and other erastians believed the government and discipline of the church to depend on the will of the magistrate  and had st john widdrington crew hipsley and others to support them in parliament thom goodwin ph nigh syd simson jer buroughs and w bridge supported the cause of independency allowing the magistrate little power about ecclesiastical affairs  placing the government of the church in the community of the faithful and denying the authority and subordination of sessions presbyteries or synods of church officers no anabaptists were members of the assembly but their number mightily increased without doors they sent one blunt to holland for rebaptism to himself having obtained it he returned and rebaptized blacklock their teacher who rebaptized all the rest tombs and cornwall learned divines joining them added to their credit not long after they published their confession of faith consisting of fiftytwo articles numbers of them appear to have been serious christians but they were exceedingly given to rail at ministers having stated salaries for their support and not working with their hands they had no sooner become very numerous than they split into two parties of general and particular or arminian and calvinist baptists  as the bishops refused to ordain the candidates that were not in the kings interest the assembly considered how such might be ordained before they had finished their directory notwithstanding the warm opposition of the independent brethren it was carried that a number of ministers in the present circumstances might ordain ministers till church judicatories could be got established ten of the members with thirteen others seven of whom were a quorum were appointed by the parliament for that purpose a similar committee of twentyone was appointed to ordain for the county of lancashire  the directory for worship being with much unanimity agreed upon by the assembly the parliament soon after appointed the observation of it in the kingdom instead of the book of common prayer under the penalties mentioned in the act and all that preached wrote or printed any thing against it were subjected to a fine between five and fifty pounds sterling in opposition to this charles by a proclamation prohibited the use of the directory and requiring the observation of the book of common prayer under pain of being held disaffected to both church and state  when the assembly proceeded to form stated rules for ordination of ministers they had hot contention with the erastians on the one hand and independents on the other for ten days the independents contended for the right of every congregation to ordain their own pastors when it carried that no single congregation which could unite with others ought to assume the right of ordination  goodwin nigh simson buroughs bridges carter and greenhill entered their dissent  they no less warmly disputed that no minister ought to be ordained without fixing him to a particular charge but this was got compromised and the proposition made to run that it is agreeable to the word of god and very expedient that those who are to be ordained ministers should be designed to some particular charge the independents consented to imposition of hands in ordination providing it should be attended with a declaration that it was not intended as the conveyance of office power  the directory for ordination being finished the parliament established it for the space of a year to try how it would answer after that they established it for three years longer  when the assembly entered upon the government of the church both presbyterians and independents heartily agreed against the erastians that jesus christ had fixed a particular form of government in his new testament church but when they proceeded to enquire what that particular form of church government was and whether it was perpetually binding the presbyterians had hard struggling with the independents on the one hand and the erastians on the other the erastians were content to allow presbyterian government to be most agreeable to the word of god and most proper to be settled in england but they warmly opposed the divine right of it  for fifteen days the independents combatted the divine appointment of presbytery and for as many more contended for the divine right of their own form of church government here the primitive order of the christian church the scripture warrant for ruling elders the subordination and power of church courts were largely disputed and seldom and lightfoot helped the independents in times of need the presbyterians having carried their point the independents entered their dissent and complained that they had been ill used and some of their papers refused a hearing the erastians reserved their principal effort for the house of commons in which they were sure to be joined by all the independents against the divine right of presbytery informed of their design the presbyterians studied to have their whole strength in the house very early that they might get their point carried before their opponents came fully up perceiving their intent glyn and whitlock spoke at great length upon divine right till the house was quite full and then it was carried not that presbytery is founded on the word of god  but as it still stands that it is lawful and agreeable to the word of god that the church be governed by congregational classical and synodical assemblies pierced with grief that the erastians had carried this point against them the scotch commissioners and other presbyterians instigated the council and afterward the ministers of london to beseech the commons to establish presbyterian government as the government of jesus christ this drew the frowns of the house upon the supplicants the presbyterian ministers next applied to the lords  and soon after with the mayor and aldermen of london at their head gave in a second petition to them these applications occasioned a misunderstanding between the city and parliament which at last issued in the ruin of the presbyterians cause  the assemblys lodging of the power to rebuke suspend from sacraments excommunicate the scandalous and to absolve the penitent in the hand of the presbytery or eldership as theirs by divine right occasioned a warm debate between them and the parliament while the independents claimed this power for the christian brotherhood in every congregation and pled that no civil sanction or penalty should attend it  seldom whitlock and other erastians contended that church communion ought to be left quite open and crimes be cognizable and punishable only by the magistrate but as pastors want of power to restrain scandalous persons from the lords table had been one of the late popular complaints the parliament did not think it proper to reject excommunication altogether but to render it a mere cipher they required the assembly to fix what degrees of knowledge were necessary to admission to the lords table and what sorts of scandal deserved suspension or excommunication  after no small litigation among themselves the assembly represented that such as did not know and believe the being of a god the trinity of persons in the godhead the doctrine of original sin of christs being godman and our only mediator  and that he and his benefits are applied by faith which is the gift of god the nature and importance of the sacraments the immediate entrance of departed souls into heaven or hell the resurrection of the body and the future judgment of men  should be excluded for their ignorance or error  and that all incestuous persons adulterers fornicators drunkards profane swearers and cursers murderers worshippers of images or relics saints or angels all that make images of divine persons or that are at variance with their neighbors all duellers or carriers of messages between them profaners of the sabbath by sports or civil labor keepers of stews  pimps  such as marry their children with papists consulters of witches or fortune tellers  assaulters of parents or of magistrates or their officers in the legal execution of their office and persons regularly attainted of barratry forgery extortion or bribery  should be secluded as scandalous the parliament allowed this representation and engrossed it into their act but by securing an appeal from the highest church courts to the parliamen they to the great grief of the scotch commissioner and many others effectually kept the power in their own hands they also appointed that church courts should take no cognizance of civil rights an that no confession or proof before the eldership b made use of before civil courts  not long after the parliament suspecting that the presbyterians intended to render the church altogether independent on the state  enacted that ther should be liberty of appeal from every classical prebytery to the civil commissioners of the county  they next appointed rules for the election of rulin elders and for division of the kingdom into classica presbyteries and provincial synods they appointed two elders for each minister to attend presbyteries two ministers and from four to nine elders from each presbytery to attend provincial synods an two ministers and four elders from each synod t attend the national assembly thus the power o government was chiefly lodged in the hand of the ruling elders  in this form was presbyterian government settled in      for the space of a year ti it might be discerned what further alterations were necessary it pleased no party concerned the episcopalians and independents were offended tha they were shut out without so much as a toleration such as reckoned presbyterian government founde on the word of god were offended that the power was so much reserved for the civil magistrate especially in the exclusion of persons from the lotds table  when this scheme was laid before the scotc parliament and general assembly they insisted for sundry amendments that no godly minister should be excluded from sitting as a member of presbyteries synods or assemblies that the ordinary tim for the meeting of the national assembly should b fixed allowing a power for both church and state t conveen it upon any necessary occasion that congregational elderships be allowed to determine concernng scandals not expressed that the act for the orination of ministers be made perpetual that the aricles respecting the subjection of church judicatories o the parliament  the exemption of persons of high ank from church censures and obliging of church ulers to admit persons to the lords table contrary o their conscience be altered to general satisfaction and that the article respecting perpetual offices and fficers in the church the order and power of church ourts and the directions for public penance and exommunication be fixed the english parliament eplied with some warmth that they had done what hey could and therefore thought it strange to find themselves suspected of unwillingness to establish resbyterian government because they did not in  manner inconsistent with the laws of their land stablish near ten thousand unlimited and arbitrary ourts of parochial sessions in the kingdom the resbyterian ministers in england seconded the reresentations from scotland and refused to accept f the parliaments establishment of the church till hey should part with the key of discipline and goernment highly offended with their address the commons threatened them with a praemunire for resuming to dispute with their superiors who had alled their assembly merely for advice not to allow them to be judges upon any point  to embarrass  not divide the assembly and at least to gain time ll they should see the issue of the treaty with his ajesty who had thrown himself into the scotch rmy they delivered to them a set of captious quesons relative to the divine right of church government and its several circumstances and required that the scriptures proving or disproving each parcular should be set down at large and every memer sign his opinion on each point after solemn sting and prayer for gods special direction when en had laid such an entangling snare for their feet e assembly applied themselves to their task  before this establishment of presbyterian government the independents had hoped for one to comprehend them but finding themselves disappointed they would no more listen to any proposals o comprehension with the presbyterians but pled for such an authoritative toleration as should allow them to set up by themselves and gather churches of al such as in the presbyterian parishes chose to join with them and this they required not only for themselves but for the sober anabaptists and al such others as held the fundamental principles of the christian religion though they did not seem capable to point out these principles in a precise manner  the presbyterians who already found what multitudes of sectaries had started up during the few preceding years broken state of the church and wha trouble the assembly had got with a few of them represented to them the danger schism and confusion that would be occasioned by this toleration which they requested  and offered to allow them t abstain from communion with them in the lord supper without being censurable the independent replied that they did not intend any total separation from the church while they held the most o these things which the presbyterians did in worshipping according to the directory  in retaining the sam church officers and requiring the same qualifications in order to admission to the sacraments and using the very same censures that they would hold occasional communion with them in the lords supper and in like manner admit presbyterians with them that their ministers should sometimes preac for one another and they would call presbyteria ministers to attend as companions at their ordinations that they will consent to have their congregations restricted to a certain number which may b receptacles for tender consciences the presbyterians insisted on the obvious mischiefs of tolerations and that if their independent brethren could hold occasional communion with them in sealing ordinanes it would be schismatical in them to separate  as the presbyterians insisted for close conjunction and uniformity and the independents rather extended their terms of toleration the committee of lords and commons and assembly of divines broke up without effecting any accommodation between them meanwhile the scotch parliament transmitted to the english one a declaration against the toleration of ectaries many pamphlets were published and sermons preached particularly before the parliament n this point in a letter to the assembly the london ministers beseech them to oppose such a lawless oleration as would strangle their church establishment in its very birth a smart answer to it openly led for the toleration of all opinions and that o man is answerable to civil magistrates for his opinions any farther than they interfere with the state t is certain the presbyterians opposition to the toeration lost them the favor of many especially of he army but when one considers the spawn of errors and blasphemies and the almost unnumbered orms of sectaries which then appeared in england he will the less wonder at their dislike of the desired oleration during these contentions charles offered t goodwin and p nigh large terms of liberty if hey would oppose the presbyterian government ut they informed their presbyterian brethren and o charles dropped all correspondence with them  the parliaments ordinance for introduction of presbyterial classes never took effect but in london and lancashire in other places the ministers had oluntary associations but without legal jurisdiction while both scotch and english presbyterians insisted that the parliament would complete their settlement of the desired uniformity engaged to in the soemn league and declare such as were disaffected to church and state incapable of places of power and rust the parliament gave them fair words and preended that the delay of the assemblys answers to their late questions hindered it and nothing else  meanwhile the independents and the sectarians in the army boldly pled for a toleration and got a number of the citizens of london to supplicate the parliament in their favors it is probable that the royalists in order to ruin the parliament helped forward these divisions after the erastians had not a little harrassed the assembly on the divine right of the several pertinents of presbyterian government coleman died and all the rest except lightfoot slipped off and left the presbyterians and some few independents to manage matters as they pleased at last the assembly finished their answers to the parliaments questions but for fear of a praemunire they never presented them the london divines therefore took up the controversy and published their learned view of the divine right of church government  the parliament still continued to treat with his majesty but his concluding a peace with the irish papists who had but lately massacred some hundred thousands of his protestant subjects and his passing an act of oblivion of all that they had done in the course of their rebellion  and his flight into the scotch army made them to suspect him and as he fell in his demands they rose in theirs and both seemed rather intent on outwitting than on amicably treating with one another  when he fled from oxford as it was on the point of being blocked up by fairfax the parliaments general he with two or three attendants came within ten miles of london finding it unsafe to enter the city he first directed his course toward the sea as if he had intended to leave this country and then turning northward he to their astonishment threw himself into the scotc army at newcastle without previously acquainting them on his first arrival he seemed disposed toward peace with his parliament and on may   th      wrote them to that effect and assured them that he had recalled all commissions granted by hi for making war on his subjects and had ordered the disbanding of all his forces and that he cordially intended to join with his parliament in establishing religion according to the advice of his english and scotch parliaments but some episcopalian bigots getting access to him he changed his mind the scotch army and their committee of estates at edinburgh beseeching him to satisfy his english parliament concerning religion as without his doing it they could not according to their conscience or covenant protect him against them and indeed they could not have attempted to do it without ruining their own country  charles professed his willingness to confer with any whom they should appoint concerning the lawfulness of abolishing prelacy and establishing presbytery contrary to his coronation oath mr a henderson was brought from edinburgh for that purpose but charles had been so iutoxicated with the divine right of prelacy the superlative excellence of the book of common prayer the uninterrupted succession of bishops from the apostles the right of the ancient christian doctors to be judges in controversies and the standard of interpreting scripture princes sole right to reform any thing in religion and the unlawfulness of subjects on any account taking arms against their king that mr hendersons nervous reasoning had no effect upon him his pretenses of regard to his coronation oath after he had spent the first fifteen years of his reign in a perpetual violation of it marked him determined to receive no conviction  while the parliament having by new acts rooted up the foundations of prelacy declared it for ever abolished appointed the bishops lands and privileges to be sold for defraying the expenses of the war and supporting preaching clergymen  they insisted with charles as the condition of peace that he would ratify their deeds for the reformation of religion  notwithstanding the most importunate entreaties of his trusty and sensible friends he still refused and insisted that at least bishops should be retained in his quarters the dioceses of oxford winchester bath wells and exeter he insisted with the scotch army to protect him but as neither their church nor state would hear of his coming to scotland on his own terms and they could not retain him in england without an immediate war with the parliaments forces they surrendered him up to the english parliament without either asking or receiving a single farthing on that account  in      the english lords and many others intended whenever the scots marched home to dispatch a considerable body of their own troops to act against the papists and their royal confederates in ireland and to retain at home no more than were necessary for the peace of the country and to have these commanded by persons well affected to their covenanted reformation by which means they hoped to treat with more advantage with his majesty the scotch army who on this consideration hastened their departure were scarcely at home when the english parliament made an ordinance for the suppression of heresy and schism and appointed a solemn fast for bewailing their increase they enacted that no member of the house nor any who did not take the covenant should command in the army or in garrisons nor any drunkard swearer or otherwise scandalous person and that ten thousand and six hundred foot forces should be sent to ireland and   00 horse and the soldiers in garrisons be retained at home and all the rest disbanded on the  d of june ensuing in consequence of these things charles sent them more satisfactory answers to their propositions  notwithstanding the above acts of parliament the sectaries more and more increased in the army there were still many sober and serious but things were hastening into a chaos of confusion in religion the officers became fiery disputants and often supplied the place of ministers to the regiments and officiated in the pulpits where they were quartered thomas edwards a zealous presbyterian in his gangrene of heresies reckons up sixteen different bodies of sectaries and a multitude of rampant errors but he is too keen to deserve entire credit  and indeed such was the disorder and licentiousness in religion that it was scarcely possible to reduce them to either sects or opinions we hear of enthusiasts ranters seekers etc etc many of which died in their infancy or joined with these afterward called quakers it is said that about an hundred popish clergy were sent from abroad to join the different parties in order to increase and inflame the confusions  meanwhile the confession of faith which the scotch divines had insisted for instead of the thirnine articles was finished not without dissents relative to the imputation of christs active obedience church government and discipline liberty of conscience  and along with the scripture proofs transmitted to the parliament in may      and after about thirteen months and many long debates the most part of it was approved by both houses the  0th chapter which relates to church censures that part of the   st which relates to the calling and power of synods great part of the   th concerning marriage and divorce and that part of the  0th concerning the punishment of such as vent opinions destructive to the peace of the church were referred to further consideration and at last laid aside after the confession and catechisms were finished the scotch commissioners went home and the remaining part of the assembly did almost nothing but examine candidates for the ministry and dispute concerning the divine right of presbyterian government after sitting five years and almost seven months and holding      sederunts they entirely dissolved february          for some time before their dissolution the management of ecclesiastical matters was in the hands of the provincial synod of london which met at zion college twice every week in      and all the twelve following years when they could at the end of every six months the members were changed and the synod renewed the first having little opportunity of sitting did little besides agreeing upon some rules of order the second published a solemn testimony against the errors of the times in which they declare their adherence to the confession of faith and their abhorrence of the following tenets that the scriptures of the old and new testament are not of divine authority nor the only rule of faith that god has a bodily shape and is the principal author of sin that there is no trinity of persons in the godhead that christ is inferior to the father and the holy ghost but a ministering spirit that god has equally elected all men to everlasting life that no man eternally perishes for adams first sin that christ died for all mankind and the benefit of his death is intended by god for all that every man has a free will and power in himself to repent obey the gospel and do every thing necessary for his eternal salvation that faith is not a supernatural grace that faithful actions are the only ground of our justification before god that the moral law is not a rule of life to believers that believers are as pure from sin as christ and so need not pray for the pardon of it that god sees no sin in his people nor chastises them for it that there ought to be no churches sacraments or sabbaths that baptism ought not to be continued among christians nor the infants of believers baptized that forswearing of ones self is the whole meaning of the  d commandment that brethren and sisters may lawfully marry together and divorces be founded upon indisposition unfitness or contrariety of tempers that human souls are mortal and there is neither heaven nor hell till the day of judgment they testify against the authoritative toleration of all religions as the occasion and source of errors heresies and blasphemies  they declare their adherence to the solemn league and covenant and to the divine right of presbytery and their dislike of prelacy erastianism independency brownism and their abhorrence of antiscripturism popery arminianism arianism socinianism antinomianism anabaptism libertinism and schism this testimony was subscribed by    of the principal clergy in london and afterward by    in gloucestershire    in lancashire    in devonshire and    in somersetshire  this year the army mad for a toleration of all or almost all pretenses to religion assumed a superiority over the parliament and turned out some of the presbyterian members charles at once treated with the english parliament now governed by the army and with the discontented scots that were forming an engagement and raising an army to rescue him he altered his condescensions as his circumstances changed and probably intended merely to amuse his subjects with treaties relative to religion which he never meant to fulfill notwithstanding refusal of submission and the most scurrilous abuse from the heads and students of oxford the parliaments commissioners visited that university which for some years before had rather been a garrison than a place of learning it is hard to say whether the patience of the parliament or the insolence of the university was most remarkable during the two years in which this affair was in agitation besides others nineteen or twenty masters were turned out and edward reynolds wilkins wslkinson palmer sethward wallis l moulin and others were put in their place holy days and stage plays being prohibited by the parliament multitudes in some places were highly provoked and abused such as dared to work on these holy or rather revelling seasons  but they had no reason as in place of them the parliament allowed servants the first tuesday of every month for recreation and visiting of friends  in consequence of a treaty with his majesty duke hamilton and his party of scots invaded england with an army to rescue him from the parliamentarians while the english royalists took arms for the same purpose cromwell quickly routed them both while he and his army were in the north dealing with the scots the presbyterian members resumed their seats in parliament and became the majority knowing that the army were bent for a commonwealth in the state and an authoritative toleration to attend any religious establishment in the church they instigated by the more zealous clergymen enacted that whosoever should obstinately deny the existence or perfections of god or his subsistence in three persons equal in power and glory or the reality of christs manhood or his satisfaction to gods justice for sinful men or the divine authority of the scriptures or the resurrection of the dead or the future judgment should be punished with death  that whosoever should obstinately maintain that all men shall be saved or that men can turn themselves to god or that god may be worshipped by images or that the souls of men either die with their bodies or sleep till the resurrection or that there is a purgatory or that the revelations and workings of gods spirit are a rule of faith or practice even when different from or contrary to scripture or that men are bound to believe no more in religion than they can comprehend or that the moral law is no rule of life to believers or that believers need not repent of their sin or pray for its pardon or that baptism and the lords supper are not appointed in scripture to be continued in the church or that the baptism of infants is unlawful or that the strict observation of the lords day is not agreeable to the word of god or that public and family prayers and teaching of children to pray are unlawful or that the present english form of magistracy by king and parliament is unlawful or that all use of warlike arms is unlawful  shall be obliged publicly to recant their error in the congregations in which they had spread it and in case of refusal be imprisoned till they find security that they will never more maintain and publish any such error they also made a new ordinance in which all their former acts relative to presbyterian government and discipline were collected and ratified as the standing laws of the kingdom but no penalty was denounced against such as should not submit  the parliament also labored to accommodate matters with his majesty who had slipped off to newport in the isle of wight and were extremely fond to have the treaty concluded before their army returned from the north but notwithstanding all that their learned doctors could say to persuade him that prelacy had no divine warrant and that he might consent to the abolishment of it and to the use of the directory for worship without hurting his conscience or violating his coronation oath he instigated by his bigoted episcopalians would make no concessions but what were extorted from him at last he in this manner consented that all the hierarchy except the bishops should be abolished that they should not act but in concert with presbyters that presbyterian government should continue three years that after that no episcopal authority shall be exercised but by authority of parliament that if in that time he be convinced that prelacy is not agreeable to the word of god he will utterly abolish it he soon after added that for three years he would make no new bishops and would use some other form of divine service than the book of common prayer in his chapel and prohibit the saying of mass in the queens the commons voted these concessions unsatisfactory but in a few days voted otherwise the parliaments commissioners did what they could to bring him a little further and to persuade him that no prelacy was abolished but what had been set up by human laws that there was no difficulty in the reversion of the church lands to the crown and that the assemblys directory pointed out the matter of public prayers though not the express words but notwithstanding all that they and the scotch commissioners from both church and state could do he would promise no more than to reduce episcopacy to archbishop ushers plan and to license the shorter catechism  part of the army returning from the north and finding that no toleration of dissenters from the established religion was secured by the negotiations between charles and his parliament they were enraged at both they concluded that if he could obtain the use of the service book in his own chapel independents and sectaries need expect no liberty of conscience at all and so they had been fighting to set up presbytery and get themselves banished the country or driven into corners in these views they after a solemn fast of several days resolved to assume the government of the nation cut off the kings head and erect a commonwealth on nov  0th      they presented a petition to the parliament setting forth the miscarriage of charles government and his dilatory and double dealing in treaties and required that he and other delinquents be brought to justice for their conduct that the prince of wales and duke of york surrender themselves and be declared incapable of government that for the future no king be admitted but by the free election of the people  shocked with these demands the commons shifted the consideration of them for ten days till the treaty with his majesty was quite broken off but the army detached a party to newport who on the very next day seized his person and brought him to windsor entering london they apprehended sorty of the leading commons and refused entrance to an hundred more none were left but about   0 or  00 most of them officers of the army who carried every thing by direction from the council of military officers at st albans they made an ordinance and erected a justiciary court for the trial of his majesty as a traitor to his country because the lords rejected their ordinance they no move acknowledged them none but hugh peters and john goodwin of the independent clergy had any hand in promoting his death the bigoted episcopalians encouraged him in that obstinacy which occasioned it  some episcopalians as well as presbyterians were members of the house of commons when the ordinance was made for his trial but i know not whether any of them concurred in it the papists are said to have mightily promoted it in order to throw the nation into confusion and afford opportunity of introducing popery under the popishly educated princes or otherwise but the most furious managers of the tragedy were sectarians independents anabaptists and hobbists they solicited the presbyterian ministers of london to side with the army or else be silent instead of this fortyseven of them published a monitory address to the general and council of war representing to them their perjury and wickedness in invading the rights of parliament and seizing the king as the prelatic divines to avert mens eyes from their own folly and guilt reproached the presbyterians as the cause of his majestys distress the most of those who had subscribed this address with    others published a vindication of their own conduct and a warning to all the subjects to avoid every thing tending toward the toleration of heresy or blasphemy  or to divide the kingdoms of england and scotland  and calling them to bewail the sins which had thus reduced the nation and to cry to god for his majestys deliverance nineteen clergymen about oxford mostly presbyterians but some independents addressed general fairfax and his council of war beseeching them to lay aside all thoughts against his majestys life and to endeavor to promote a right understanding between him and his parliament and protesting that they shall be free of their sovereigns death and of all the miseries that shall follow on it the scots by remonstrances from both church and state did what they could to save him but nothing could stop the wild career of the furious officers till they had condemned and beheaded him jan  0th       charles was sober temperate and chaste a kind husband parent and master but his encouraging of sports on sabbath marks him no tender christian his favor to and employment of papists while be hated and distressed his puritan subjects and his now well known hand in the irish massacre are but poor evidences of his being a sincere protestant in his treaties with his parliament want of candor and fidelity appears every where in politics his whole government was one continued series of blunders  nothing more exalted his character than the publishing of the eicon basilike in his name which represented him as extremely pious and devout amidst his manifold troubles it was printed soon after his death and had more than fifty editions but it was at last discovered that dr gauden had wrote the whole of it except the   th and   th chapters which were written by dr duppa since the restoration of his son in    0 the  0th of january has been by law observed in commemoration of his martyrdom on which many thousand falsehoods and fulsome flatteries are yearly retailed from episcopalian pulpits in the name of the lord  a commonwealth being erected cromwell and the army quickly and with no small severity reduced the papists in ireland about an hundred thousand of them fled into france and the rest were pent up in corners in which they could scarcely find subsistence episcopacy was reduced the university of dublin was purged and religion and learning flourished in it the parliament having formed an engagement or oath of allegiance to the commonwealth few episcopalians scrupled at it many of the presbyterian clergy refused it and left their parishes which were filled up with independents who mightily relished the new form of government for the sake of peace the parliament continued the establishment of presbyterian government and of the directory for worship but abolished all penalties on account of differences in religion the presbyterian ministers at their monthly fasts being apt to throw out reflections against the new government and managers of it the parliament abolished these meetings and prohibited clergymens meddling with politics they also prohibited the publication or dispersion of seditious pamphlets while the parliament provided ministers and schoolmasters for wales the presbyterian and independent clergy labored fo incessantly in the instruction of their people that sobriety prevailed almost every where in the kingdom amidst all the absurd fancies which prevailed in the army such was their strictness that when one of their quarter masters was convicted of blasphemy he had his tongue bored with an hot iron his sword broken over his head and was expelled from the troops by order of the council of the army the papists were banished twenty miles from london and excepted in the parliaments acts of indulgence and toleration though no penal laws were in force against the other parties yet every one was required to attend some place of meeting on the lords day and on days of fasting and thanksgiving unless they had some reasonable excuse several ordinances were made to restrain uncleanness profane swearing public blasphemy or the encouragement of people to vice  and for promoting the sanctification of the sabbath they appointed that every thing cried or put to sale on it or on days of humiliation and thanksgiving should be seized they appointed part of the money procured by the sale of bishops lands for the support of such bishops deans and other episcopaian clergy as stood in need of it they appointed justices of peace to marry people instead of ministers and the banns to be proclaimed on three market days not on the sabbath  professing regard to their covenant the scots had admitted charles ii as his fathers successor to their crown but by defeating his forces at dunbar and worcester cromwell quite ruiued their affairs mr gibbons a gentleman and christopher love a noted presbyterian minister at london and some other presbyterians having manifested some inclination toward the scottish king the two first were executed as traitors to the commonwealth it does not appear that mr love had any active hand but only had forborne to accuse his friends his death appeared to drown the curse of god and hatred of men on the new government  the managers finding it necessary to have a kind of sovereign cromwell by his own instigation was chosen to be their protector while he pretended his great unwillingness to accept of the charge  the instrument of government by which he obliged himself to govern the kingdom declared that the christian religion contained in the scriptures should be held forth and recommended as the public profession of these nations that none should be obliged by penalties to conform to the public religion that all such as profess faith in god by jesus christ however much they differ from the public profession shall be protected in their religious exercises excep papists prelatists and such as under profession o christianity practice or encourage licentiousness  cromwell did what he could to make all the differen parties befriend him as the presbyterians had a shadow of establishment on their side it was agreed that no alteration should be made unless in laying aside all penalties of nonconformity such bishop or other episcopalians as behaved peaceably were no pressed with the engagement  much about the time that the london minister published their divine right of the gospel ministry a a mean of restraining the disorderly preaching o laymen archbishop usher j owen t goodwin stephen marshal ph nigh sh simson together with messrs vines manton jacomb cheynel and reyner were in      appointed to fix the fundamental principles of the christian religion according to which the toleration might be limited r baxter who was put in the room of archbishop usher who declined the task insisted for no more than an adherence to the creed lords prayer and ten commandments but the rest agreed upon    articles that the scriptures of the old and new testament are the standard of mens faith and practice that there is one god in three persons that jesus christ is god and man in one person and the only mediator between god and men without the knowledge of whom there can be no salvation that he made satisfaction for our sin died rose again ascended to heaven and for ever continues a person distinct from angels and men that all men are by nature dead in trespasses and sins and must be born again repent and believe in order to eternal salvation that we are saved by the grace of god and faith in christ not by our works that continuance in any known sin is damnable that god must be worshipped according to his own will that such as despise the duties of gods worship cannot be saved that at the last day the dead shall be raised the world judged and some depart into everlasting punishment and others into life eternal by these articles deists socinians arians papists quakers and antinomians are excluded from the benefit of the toleration but as cromwell and his council were for protecting every one that lived peaceably no use was made of this draught  not choosing that presbyterial classes should have the power of admitting clergymen chiefly in their hand cromwell and his council appointed a committee of twentynine of the most eminent ministers in england partly presbyterians partly independents three anabaptists and nine gentlemen to try such as had entered the preceding year or should afterward enter to the ministry with respect to their gifts and graces five were stated a sufficient quorum to approve a man and nine to reject him as most of the members of this committee resided at london such as could not come thither were tried by a subcommittee no candidate was admitted to trial unless he produced a certificate signed by three persons of known integrity attesting upon their own knowledge that he was of an holy and good conversation finding that some sequestered episcopalians stood the trial and were admitted back to their charges cromwell and his council appointed that none such should be admitted till they were satisfied of their submission to the present government such as were rejected and their friends exclaimed terribly against the triers proceedings but baxter who was far enough from loving the chief men among them says they did much good to the church saved many congregations from drunken ignorant and ungodly teachers and admitted such as were learned godly and serious be of what tolerable opinion they would only they too much favored the independents and were too apt to reject episcopalians and arminians if the candidates learning orthodoxy piety and peaceableness were manifestly certain as in the case of fuller the historian they made little enquiry into his gracious experiences but when they knew him to be malignant immoral a pelagian or socinian they by examination of his experiences and the like labored to have him rejected  as notwithstanding all former purgations there still remained not a few scandalous or negligent pastors and teachers cromwell and his council appointed for every county a committee of laymen with ten or more ministers to purge them out and allow them a  th part of their salary for the support of their families  in      an ordinance had been made for the purgation and proper settlement of the churches in wales but though they had got   0 ministers who labored to their utmost they were not nearly supplied some itinerant preachers were therefore appointed to labor among them for the present  some of the lesser congregations were joined together and others of the largest sort were divided  new committees were appointed to visit the universities of cambridge and oxford these as well as the heads of the colleges faithfully executed their offices in consequence of which sobriety and godliness remarkably prevailed in these seminaries of learning stillingfleet pearson patrick lowth and others of the greatest men that ever appeared in the english church were bred up under these puritan doctors and nothing but horrid impiety and tyranny felt the exclusion of the royal bigots  meanwhile the presbyterian synod of london finding it impossible to establish their discipline among the english and awakened by the spread of two catechisms published by biddle a socinian bestirred themselves to promote the religious education of youth and published exhortations and directions for ministers and heads of families in their catechizing work animated by their example the associated ministers in several counties published similar exhortations  as the royalists had threatened cromwell with an assassination and had published most dangerous libels against the present government he by a proclamation ordered that no ejected episcopalians should be chaplains or schoolmasters or preach or teach any but their own families under pain of prosecution but he more secretly intimated that those who since their sequestration had or should give proper evidence of their godliness and affection to the present government should be used as kindly as could consist with the safety of the state about the same time he threatened the papists not so much for their religion as because he found them enemies to his government the protestants of savoy and piedmont being terribly persecuted he by application to the kings of sweden and denmark the states of holland and the reformed churches in germany and france procured them large contributions in england alone   0   pounds were collected he dispatched moreland his envoy to the duke of savoy to intimate to him that he intended to exert himself to his uttermost for the deliverance of his persecuted protestant brethren he wrote to lewis xiv and to cardinal mazarine his minister to the same effect unwilling to have cromwell and his troops so near him mazarine pressed the court of turin to give the protestants satisfaction to strike terror into the pope and other italian princes he gave out that as he understood they had encouraged the persecution he intended that his fleet should visit their coasts and cause the sound of his canons to be heard at rome he publicly declared that he would allow no protestants to be any where insulted and procured indulgence to those of bohemia and france how disgraceful to the protestant powers that they have ever since so little copied his example whether he had any hand in founding the charitable fund for the support of ministers widows and children which took place about this time i know not  the indulgence of so many forms of religion in england drew the famous manasseh ben israel and other rabbis of the jewish nation thither to solicit a freedom for their religion and traffic as cromwell thought they might by the pure preaching of the gospel be converted to christ and might push the english into trade he inclined to grant them their request but in order to do it peaceably he conveened a council of lawyers merchants and divines to consider whether it would consist with the laws of the land the advantage of trade and rule of the gospel some were altogether against their admission lest they should seduce people to their religion or customs of marriage and divorce or their fraud hurt the trade of the subjects others though they might be admitted providing they should speak or write nothing against the honor of christ or hi religion should hold no judicatory civil or ecclesiastical should use no christian servants should bear no public office or trust should discourage none from using means of conviction of the truth of the christian religion and that if any should apostatize to judaism they should be severely punished the opinions of these advisers being so different the affair was dropped  in      the quakers had become considerably troublesome and insolent even to cromwell himself which drew upon them some severities the papists had an oath imposed upon them abjuring the popes supremacy transubstantiation purgatory worship of images and relics  the merit of human works  the popes power to excommunicate or depose magistrates or give allowance to murder them  and declaring that they believed him to have no power at all in britain or ireland and that no power derived from him or the church of rome could absolve from this oath two thirds of their estate who refused this oath were to be seized for public use and all british subjects were prohibited to hear mass in the house of any foreign ambassador  in      brian walton afterward bishop of chester published his famous polyglot bible in six large volumes folio in the preparation and correction of which he had employed not a few of the most learned puritans and others dr owen highly commended the work but blamed walton for pretending that the hebrew points were not of divine authority and for collecting so many various readings from copies of no importance about this time also the royal society began to be founded  in      the independents by cromwells permission held an assembly at the savoy and drew up their confession of faith it differs but little from that of westminster unless that the  0th and   st chapters relative to censures and synods and part of the  0th   d and   th relative to the power of civil magistrates about religious matters and to marriage and divorce are left out it has a chapter relative to the gospel and some expressions more plainly pointed against the then rampant errors and at the end it has a chapter relative to the institution of the church and to ecclesiastical discipline  at this meeting in which there were ministers and members from  00 churches though dr owen mess goodwin nigh bridges caryl and greenhill were the principal managers it is the less wonder that they formed their confession in a few days the difference between it and that of westminster being so small that the modern independents have almost laid it aside and use that of westminster as well as the presbyterians excepting the portions above mentioned  death having that same year cut off the bold and crafty and perhaps pious protector the government devolved on richard his son a young man of a candid and peaceable temper fleetwood his brotherinlaw and desborough who had married his aunt and lambert and other discontented spirits resumed their courage and quickly obliged him to resign his authority a commonwealth of a few weeks duration ensued but the officers finding that the parliament intended to reduce the army took the government into their own hands the nation being quickly sick of these military lords the presbyterians and royalists agreed to bring home charles of scotland who had been an exile abroad having invited general monk from scotland he by ways and means dishonorable enough got to london restored the presbyterian members of parliament to their seats from which they had been excluded in      and placed guards about the house which deterred the independents from entering being now almost wholly presbyterians the commons ratified the vote of      bearing that charles is concessions from the isle of wight were a satisfactory ground of a pacification with him they annulled the engagement of      to be faithful to the commonwealth and the late oath abjuring charles stewart in consequence of a petition from the london ministers they approved the solemn league and covenant they declared the westminster confession of faith the public confession of the church of england but agreed that due liberty in religious matters be secured according to the word of god they approved as valid the ordinations of ministers according to the directory and gave presbyterian ministers full possession of their benefices in may    0 they dissolved themselves after they had in diverse forms and with several interruptions sat nineteen years four months and thirteen days  before their dissolution they had enacted that none who had warred against the parliament sice      and had not since manifested their affection to it should be elected members for the next and that all candidates should declare the parliaments war against king charles to have been just and lawful but now to avoid all choice of republicans many royalists and persons absolutely atheistical and profane were chosen meanwhile monk began to treat with charles king of scots and several of the presbyterian ministers repaired to him at breda in holland his embracement of popery beginning to make a noise he decoyed several of the most eminent protestant clergymen in france to give assurances of the contrary he transmitted to london a declaration promising a general pardon of past offenses and a liberty in religion to all his subjects if he should be restored to his throne infatuated by his guileful prayers and deceitful declarations and by the fine promises of episcopalians of whose perfidiousness they had had sufficient experience the presbyterians permitted the new parliament to invite him home without any terms after this parliament had sat about eight months they were dissolved because the members had not been chosen by virtue of royal warrants and many of them were presbyterians and they had declared the late war with his majestys father to have been lawful  charles had no sooner arrived at whitehall than for a blind he made mess manton calamy baxter bates reynolds spurstow ash case and woodbridge all presbyterians his ordinary chaplains but the old liturgy was restored in his chapel and elsewhere  pretending that the acts of the long parliament being in themselves null for want of the royal assent episcopacy and the service book were still established by law the members of parliament quickly set the nation an example in the taking the sacrament in the ceremonious form before the year ended many parochial clergymen were prosecuted for not using the service book the judges pretending that the laws returned with the king and that the breaches of them could not be dispensed with the sequestered episcopalians flocked about the court magnified their own sufferings as a kind of martyrdom for his majestys right and notwithstanding their most notorious scandals were restored to their former places and the pious learned and laborious presbyterians or independents turned out to make way for them within about six months above   0 doctors of divinity and as many of law physic etc were formed out of the selfapplauding royalists but as most of their names stand nowhere but in the registers of the university they appear to have been generally of very little importance a little before the restoration a fruitless attempt had been made to fill the vacant sees lest the episcopal succession should be ruined but deans and chapters being now restored to every cathedral ten new bishops were added to the nine survivors other four were soon after added four or five sees were kept vacant that they might be offered as a bait to the leading divines of the presbyterian persuasion  in the preceding period which has been so much reproached as an age of horrid rebellion the universities abounded with pious and learned teachers and students never did another produce so many or so remarkable ornaments to the english church better laws were never made in england nor good laws ever so well executed the dress the language and conversation of the people were sober and virtuous scarcely one instance of bankruptcy was known in a year nor could bankrupts ever regain their character drunkenness whoredom profane swearing and other debaucheries were quite out of fashion to live as beasts without worshipping god in secret and in families was held infamous not one stage play was acted for many years in the whole kingdom magistrates carefully suppressed gaming and other abuses in public houses ministers labored in praying preaching catechizing and visiting their people to the wasting of their strength but no sooner had charles ascended his throne than debauchery and wickedness of every form like an impetuous torrent brake forth and overflowed all ranks in the kingdom he set them a most brutish and infernal example he did not believe there was any such thing as honor or virtue but all men were guided by self interest atheism profane scoffing and swearing were his daily delight drunkenness and whoredom his principal business he could scarcely spare an hour from them to mind the affairs of the state if we may believe his own bishops and doctors he ordinarily came from the bed of his harlots to church or even to the lords table two play houses were erected in the neighborhood of his court female actresses were introduced on the stage plays so lewd and obscene as might have made beelzebub to blush were composed and acted scarcely any thing was to be seen at court but feasting hard drinking revelling whoredom and profane swearing the favored clergymen were taken with whores almost every week or found drunk in the streets or even in the pulpits all kinds of riot and debauchery prevailed among the people some who had been parliamentarians to redeem their credit with the court and the clerical managers threw off their former mask of religion turned profane scoffers and forged stories to render their old friends ridiculous to appear serious read the bible pray in secret or in families or to make conscience of speech or behavior characterized one a fanatic forbearing to extol the ceremonies marked one a presbyterian rebel  provoked with the presbyterians for their siding themselves in the late wars and for holding so many livings in the church in which they labored in winning souls to christ and for being capable to influence the election of members of parliament and why not also for their mad zeal in bringing home charles that plague of god to the throne clarendon and his bishops resolved to ruin them and exclude them from all comprehension in the church while james duke of york and his papists inclined to have a toleration for them that they might share in it  still the infatuated presbyterians courted the favor of those managers that wished their ruin they offered archbishop ushers plan of church government as a mean of accommodation  and insisted that the surplice the crossing in baptism and kneeling at the lords supper should be left indifferent and some corrections made upon the thirtynine articles in june    0 messrs calamy reynolds ash baxter wallis manton and spurstow introduced by the earl of manchester besought his majesty to interpose his influence for the healing of their ecclesiastical differences hoping as baxter said that he would outdo cromwell the usurper in promoting religion charles bade them draw up their proposals relative to church government and ceremonies as low as pssible and then he would procure them a conference with the episcopal doctors having finished it they along with their brethren in london presented their proposals bearing that they agreed with their brethren in the doctrinal points of religion and the substantial parts of divine worship but humbly requested that none of their serious people might be reproached with abusive language that no scandalous negligent or insufficient person might be admitted pastor in any congregation that none should be confirmed by the bishops or admitted to the lords table without a credible profession of faith and holiness that effectual care should be taken for the public and private sanctification of the lords day that episcopacy be reduced to the plan proposed by archbishop usher in      that suffragans be chosen by their respective synods that in their visitations bishops regulate their conduct by the appointments of parliament that the book of common prayer be either corrected and purged of that which is offensive or a committee of moderate episcopalians and presbyterians appointed to compile a new one as much in scripture language as possible  and ministers not be confined to precise forms  and that crossing in baptism kneeling at the lords supper observation of holy days of human appointment officiating in surplices altars in churches bowing at the name jesus or toward altars be abolished or at least not imposed on such as scruple them the answer given to this representation by the episcopalians occasioned a short and somewhat warm answer by the presbyterians  as many of the sober ministers began to be driven from their churches on account of their not using the book of common prayer the chief presbyterians besought his majesty to suspend these executions till the issue of their attempts for an accommodation were known and that he would revoke the ejection of such as had only succeeded to deceased episcopalians and prevent the return of scandalous clergymen to their former charges but all was to little purpose after hearing both parties he corrected and published his second declaration in which he promised to reform episcopacy and have the liturgy corrected and that none should be questioned for differences in religion not tending to disturb the peace of the kingdom not a few of the presbyterian clergy were pleased with this thanked his majesty for it and upon the foot of it pious edward reynolds accepted the bishopric of norwich and dr manton receiving a living in convent garden submitted to episcopal ordination by sheldon bishop of london and to the use of the service book in his church other presbyterians still dissatisfied again besought his majesty to establish archbishop ushers scheme of church government which they thought was consistent with their solemn league and covenant and insisted for further alterations in the service book than he appeared to have promised they prevailed nothing when the last mentioned declaration was first read in parliament nov  th both houses agreed on an address of thanks for it but being informed that charles and his courtiers never intended to stand to it the commons refused to give it a second reading  by this time the long infatuated presbyterians had their eyes opened and plainly perceived that his majestys declarations were but crafty expedients to keep them quiet till their episcopalian enemies could bid them defiance and they had daily more and more evidence that they had no favor at court  if they spoke or wrote in favor of their covenant with god and one another if they lamented the dreadful irruption of perfidy apostasy or vice especially of courtiers if they scrupled using of the surplice service book and ceremonies they were prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts and hundreds of them turned out to make way even for the most scandalous episcopalians who had been formerly ejected meanwhile flocks of papists came home magnified their sufferings in the late times and published a list of about     of their noblemen knights baronets and other persons of rank who had lost their lives in fighting for charles and his father his mother returned from france with a crowd of popish attendants the priests who had been in gaol were liberated and others came over from the college of douay more papists appeared in england than in all the twelve preceding years in ireland too which under the late troubles had been not a little furnished with faithful laborious and successful ministers from england and scotland the papists took possession of their old estates and turned out the protestant purchasers their priests sent over an address congratulating his majestys restoration and requesting the free exercise of their religion  their address was graciously received and they were encouraged to hope for a favorable answer  charles marriage with the infanta of portugal also contributed to the promoting of their interests  venner a winehooper and about fifty others of the fifthmonarchy men who imagined that the thousand years empire of jesus christs personal reign on earth was just to be erected took arms resolving to overturn charles government or perish in the attempt this madness crushed in a moment gave the court an handle for emitting a proclamation prohibiting all anabaptists quakers and fifthmonarchy men to meet for worship any where but in parish churches or chapels or in their own houses the independents baptists and quakers for their own vindication published a declaration of their abhorrence of venners insurrection to provoke the presbyterians to some like outrage the episcopalians or papists insulted them in the streets and disturbed them at their family worship by blowing of horns at their windows or the like amidst all this abuse they maintained a quiet and inviolated loyalty though from the press they honestly contended for their religious principles stillingfleet a very learned and as yet mild episcopalian published his irenicum in which he pled that no particular form of church government is exhibited in the new testament and with great strength of argument contended that nothing ought to be imposed in religion but what is clearly revealed in the scriptures nothing required but what is plainly indifferent nothing indifferent required as a part of worship but only as a mean of duly performing it that no penalty ought to be inflicted upon persons who scruple at any thing not clearly revealed in the word of god till they have sufficient time and means to be informed of the lawfulness of it and that religion ought not to be clogged with ceremonies as too many of them eat out the life and vigor of christianity but no reasoning was able to restrain the fury of the episcopalians against the presbyterians who had so kindly brought home their king and put them into possession of their power  the new parliament formed to the taste of the court which kept about an hundred members in pay to vote as they pleased sat down may  th      besides advancing his majestys absolute power they declared the solemn league and covenant illegal and not binding upon such as had taken it and ordered it to be publicly burnt by the hangman they restored the bishops to their jurisdiction in parliament or otherwise the restored to the episcopalian clergy all the power they had enjoyed under his majestys father except the use of the oath ex officio they denounced a premuniro against all such as should call his majesty a papist they enacted that all in places of power and trust should declare upon oath that they believed it unlawful to take up arms against the king on any pretense whatsoever and give it under their hand that they renounce the solemn league and covenant as an unlawful oath imposed contrary to the standing laws of the kingdom they appointed that none should act in any civil office who had not within a year received the lords supper according to the service book they appointed commissioners to visit all the corporations in the kingdom and turn out of office all such as were suspected of disrelishing the measures of the court a sham plot against the government fathered upon captain yarrington sparry mr baxter and others was trumpetted up and reported through the nation in order to make the penal laws against the presbyterians and other dissenters pass the more easily meanwhile several of the french protestant clergymen who had persuaded the presbyterians to receive charles without any conditions barefacedly congratulated the episcopalians upon their reestablishment and the french pastor at the savoy conformed himself to the english ceremonies  by virtue of his majestys last declaration twelve bishops and nine assistants were appointed to meet with the presbyterian chiefs at the savoy for fixing what alterations were proper for the satisfaction of tender consciences and promoting of the good of the church calamy baxter and their brethren excepted against eight things in the book of common prayer as plainly sinful viz that no minister is allowed to baptize any without using the sign of the cross that no minister is allowed to officiate in the public worship of god without wearing the surplice that none are allowed to receive the lords supper but on their knees that ministers are obliged to administer the lords supper to unfit persons whether in health or in sickness and even to some who are unwilling to receive it that ministers are obliged without any conditions to absolve from scandal and guilt of sin persons of whose repentance they have not the smallest evidence that they are obliged at funerals to give thanks for all baptized and unexcommunicated persons deceased as brethren whom god has taken to himself and that none are allowed to preach the gospel who do not under their subscription declare that there is nothing in the thirty nine articles books of common prayer and ordination contrary to the word of god they even presented a draught of a new liturgy drawn up by mr baxter the prayers in which were mostly in the express words of scripture which they begged ministers might be allowed to use the bishops took it as an horrid affront to put a production of baxter on a level with the long approved biturgy of their church as the intention of the leading episcopalians in this dispute was no to accommodate matters but to discover the presbyterians scruples that they might so fix their term of communion as effectually to exclude them they did not allow them opportunity of fair calm and thorough reasoning but by browbeating and by the hissing of their attendants studied to throw them into confusion when the conference was finished a convocation was called to rectify what was amiss in the prayer book and to supply deficiencies care was taken to have it composed of such as hated the presbyterians or were the obedient dupes of their superiors they added prayers for the annual celebration of the martyrdom of charles i on the  0th of january and of his present majestys restoration on may   th  and for persons at sea a form of baptism for adult persons they added some new holy days and some new lessons out of the apocrypha as the stupid fable of bell and the dragon and so made the book still more exceptionable they began to review the canons but made no alterations  charles and his agents did not content themselves with prosecuting such of his fathers condemnators as were still alive but dug up the bodies of bradshaw and ireton and gave them a kind of execution they also dug up the bodies of cromwells mother and daughter and of admiral blake pym dr twisse stephen marshal and fourteen others of the parliamentarians to put a public stigma upon them  these were but the most harmless pieces of their cruelty by the instigation of the court in may      the commons with great readiness and the lords with no small reluctance passed the act of uniformity importing that every minister that did not before the feast of bartholomew august   th before his congregation when publicly assembled for religious worship declare his unfeigned assent and consent to every thing contained in the book of common prayer as lately corrected and in the form of ordination of bishops priests and deacons should be ipso facto deprived of all his spiritual promotions  that all ministers or teachers in colleges schools or families who did not before said day declare under their hand that it is not lawful upon any pretense to take arms against the king and that they renounce the solemn league as unlawful and not binding on the takers of it and that they will conform to the church of england as by law established shall be deprived of their livings if they have any and eachers in colleges or schools shall for every offense suffer three months imprisonment and that none wanting episcopalian ordination shall administer the lords supper under pain of  00 pounds for every offense that no other form of common prayer shall be used in public worship that none shall be admitted as lecturers who are not approved and licensed by a bishop and read the thirtynine articles and declare their unfeigned assent and consent to the whole of them  and at their first lecture and afterward on the first lecture day of each month before lecturing or preaching read the common prayer and service  it also ratified all the laws made for uniformity of prayer etc  as there were not quite three months of interval between the passing and the final execution of this act it was impossible for the newly corrected book of common prayer to be got printed dispersed through all the corners of england and read and considered before the time elapsed nevertheless seven thousand episcopalian clergymen of whom not one in forty it is said had seen it believed as the church did and from their pulpits solemnly declared their unfeigned assent and consent to it meanwhile the presbyterian and independent ministers were so squeamish that they could not solemnly declare their unfeigned assent and consent to every thing they knew not and they had unconquerable scruples at all the new terms of the established uniformity they could not to the reproach of the foreign churches and of all their own former ministrations which god had remarkably blessed renounce their former ordination they could not allow themselves to lie concerning the holy ghost that he now moved them to take upon them the office of a deacon in order to be ordained by a bishop they could not give an unfeigned assent and consent to every thing in the service book they could not believe that baptism even of the infants of parents notoriously wicked produced real regeneration and gave undoubted certainty of salvation to such as died before commission of actual sin they could not give their assent and consent to the use of godfathers and godmothers to the exclusion of the real parents from being sponsors for their own children in baptism nor to the exclusion of christian infants from baptism for the mere want of godfathers or godmothers they could not consent to the use of the cross in baptism or to deny baptism to their infants who scrupled at the use of it most of them thought the consideration of that crossing as a representation o the cause and effects of redemption according to the  0th canon was to make it a superadded sacrament they could not consent to kneel at the lords supper at least to exclude from it all such as scrupled at it they could not assent and consent that bishops priests and deacons are theee distinct orders by divine appointment as the book of ordination asserted they could not consent with the funeral service to pronounce all those undoubtedly saved who had it allowed them viz all except the unbaptized excommunicated and selfmurderers they could no consent to read the legends of bell and the dragon or of tobit judith and baruch and other apocryphal lessons to the number of  0  chapters in the public worship of god under the title and notion o holy scripture for two months together to the exclusion of the word of god they could not approve the popish translation of the psalter even when contrary to the established translation of the bible they could not consent that none should be admitted to the lords supper before they were confirmed or desired to be so no doubt some of them scrupled at the reading of prayers the priests and people saying them by turns or the vain repetitions in them nor was it a recommendation of the    collects or short prayers that    of them had been taken out of the mass book and some of them made worse than even there they could not take the oath of obedience to their superior clergy according to the canons nor according to the import of that oath swear that they were ready to declare those excommunicated who charged the book of common prayer with containiog any thing contrary to the word of god  or who affirmed that any of the thirtynine articles cannot be subscribed with a safe conscience  or affirmed that the ceremonies of the church of england cannot be approved and used with a good conscience  or affirmed that the government of the church of england by bishops deans archdeacons etc as contrary to the word of god  or who should affirm that the english form of consecrating bishops priests and deacons contains in it any thing contrary to the word of god  or who should separate from the church of england or hold separated societies to be true churches  they could not assent and consent that all should be excommunicated who should affirm that a convocation called by the royal authority is not a true representation of the church of england  or should affirm that absents are not bound by their decrees when ratified by the king and the rather that the principal writers of the english church are far from being agreed concerning the seat of the supreme ecclesiastical power they could not under oath submit to the suspension deprivation or excommunication of such ministers as repenting of their engagements to uniformity omitted some of the ceremonies and kept private fasts they could not swear to refuse the lords supper to one who scrupled to receive it kneeling or belonged to another congregation whose pastor was scandalous or did not preach they could not swear to promote the excommunication of such as go to other parishes than their own to receive baptism and the lords supper  or to suspend people from the lords table because they do not provide surplices for their priests  or to baptize all children offered without exception  or to present to the bishop or his chancellor every year all their parishioners above the age of sixteen who did not communicate at the preceding easter that they may be prosecuted with excommunication and imprisonment for life if they afterward neglect it moreover they could not swear canonical obedience to their ordinary as he not only means the bishop but also his lay judges deacons officials commissaries surragates etc by whom church government is separated from the pastoral office contrary to the injunctions of christ though many of them had never taken the solemn league and covenant yet they could not renounce it as null and void and not binding upon the takers of it in every thing not contrary to the word of god they thought such a renunciation wicked in itself and calculated to tempt the king who had repeatedly taken it and many thousands more to harden themselves in perjury besides the scruples which some of them had at the oaths of allegiance and supremacy as then imposed they generally scrupled  solemnly to declare that it was unlawful and horrid to take arms against the king or any commissioned by him upon any pretense whatsoever for these and the like scruples about   00 of the most pious and diligent ministers in england were turned out from their charges without the allowance of one farthing for the support of their families  never had history witnessed such an extensive exclusion of church men or so barbarous at the reformation not above  00 of the popish clergy were deprived by elizabeth and even they had an allowance granted them for their subsistence when the long parliament and cromwell turned out the scandalous episcopolian clergy they allowed them a  th part of their salary to maintain them even though they were in a state of war with them as royalists  now above two thousand who had labored for his majestys restoration and were generally most pious and diligent ministers were forced from their charges without the smallest allowance baxter and some other leading men quitted their churches before the time lest false reports of their intended compliance should seduce any of their brethren  reynolds wilkins hopkins and fowler complied and were made bishops some who had dissuaded their brethren complied themselves no doubt the distressful circumstances to which the ejected were quickly reduced influenced them some of them applied themselves to civil business and were supported by donations from their friends many of them having no freedom to alienate themselves from the public service of god to which they had solemnly devoted themselves in ordinations and otherwise  unable to resist the calls of the people who begged their assistance in the salvation of their souls  afraid of the curse of the unprofitable servant who hid his lords money  sensible of the insufficiency of those that were placed in their charges  and convinced of the continuance of their office and mission from christ and of their duty to perpetuate a faithful ministry  presumed to preach the gospel for which as fast as they could be apprehended they were cast into prison where many of them perished by hunger and cold  their hearers sharing much the like persecution  the condition of the english church was now exceedingly deplorable the old clergymen were generally despised and detested because of their scandalous behavior such as had been trained up under the puritans did some service but many of them had neither due age nor experience a staunch but candid episcopalian informs us that about  000 were admitted who were unfit to take charges because of their youth that   00 clergymen were scandalous and many of them ignorant  and about    0 factious  that of   000 ecclesiastical livings  000 were impropriated and      sinecures after all these deductions how little room is left for an honest and painful ministry  charles and his popish courtiers and friends were glad how many of them were turned out from the church as they hoped it might occasion a toleration for the papists along with others when the protestant nonconformists talked of retiring to holland or new england the courtiers or papists dissuaded them by hints of a toleration  and labored to divide them from the established clergy as much as possible even the conform clergy were split into two parties the court party which furiously railed against the presbyterians and their moderate brethren  zealous bigots for the ceremonies and for passive obedience to kings let them be as tyrannical as they will but careless of the instruction or morals of their people they for forty years were most numerous and stood fair for preferment the country party to which reynolds wilkins cudworth whichcot tillotson and for a time stillingfleet belonged were much superior in sense and grieved at the exclusion and persecution of the presbyterians  encouraged by charles and his courtiers and driven by persecution the presbyterians through manton baxter and calamy besought him to devise some method of allowing them to teach his subjects obedience to him and to god clarendon and bishop sheldon of london who mortally hated them opposed every degree of indulgence nevertheless about four months after when clarendon was absent and perhaps none but real papists in the council charles declared his intentions to procure a parliamentary indulgence for his protestant and other subjects who could not in conscience comply with the established religion when the parliament met the commons presented an address against any indulgence so the presbyterian ministers were left to shift for themselves baxter bates calamy and some others attended as laymen on their parish churches before or after they had exercised their ministry in private houses others forbore all manner of conformity  in      sheldon succeeded juxon in the archbishopric of canterbury the courtiers which had procured the severity of the terms of conformity as a mean of occasioning indulgence to the papists instigated the protestant dissenters to apply for a toleration hinting that if they did not obtain it they would be forced to the uniformity established the independents applied but the presbyterians knowing that it was properly designed for the papists forbore and thus drew on themselves the frowns of both courtiers and persecuted brethren meanwhile some republicans having talked too freely it was pretended that the independents baptists and fifthmonarchists had formed a plot against the king  this served for an handle of reviving the act of elilizabeth condemning to banishment and to death in case of return such as peremptorily refused attendance at their parish churches  and further enacting that every person above sixteen years of age that should be present at any dissenting meeting for the worship of god in which above four more than the family were present should for the first offense pay five pounds or ly three months in prison  for the second pay ten pounds or ly six months in prison  and for the third pay an hundred pounds or suffer seven years banishment not to return under pain of death married women were to ly two months in prison unless their husbands paid two pounds for their redemption  and the persons in whose house the meeting was held to be liable as other offenders dreadful was the execution of this act among the protestant dissenters if they did not immediately pay their fines their goods were seized and if these did not satisfy the law their persons were hurried to prison to make the matter still worse spies and informers were placed every where who had part of the fines for their hire to avoid the penalty of obstinate absenting from church many presbyterians occasionally attended but the independents baptists and quakers looking upon persecution as an undoubted mark of a false church utterly refused their attendance such was the severity of the judges that some were afraid to pray in their families or ask a blessing on their meals if above four of their friends were present  in      the plague raging in london and places about till eight or ten thousand died in a week and about an hundred thousand were cut off most of the established clergy fled and left their people to die and be damned as they pleased but messrs chester janeway turner grimes franklin vincent and other persecuted ministers at the double hazard of their lives from the pestilence and from their persecutors flew to the city etc and by preaching to multitudes who looked for an almost immediate appearance before the tribunal of god had remarkable success in winning of souls to christ and preparing them for death instead of calling the nation to humble themselves under the mighty hand of god the parliament which had fled to oxford took this opportunity to rain down their vengeance on the puritan ministers and enacted that they should be obliged to swear that it was unlawful to take up arms against the king or any commissioned by him on any account and that they would never endeavor any alteration in the government of either church or state and further enacted that if before taking of this oath they should come within five miles of the places in which they had been pastors or of any city corporation or borough even in traveling the road they should be fined of forty pounds for every offense and that if they refused this oath they should be incapable of teaching a private school or of boarding or dieting any persons to be instructed no honest man as southamptch observed could take this oath as it stood but the judges declaring that by commissioned by the king was meant legally commissioned and by not endeavoring to alter the government was meant not unlawfully endeavoring to alter it bates how and about forty others of the presbyterian clergy took it in that sense to avoid the charge of sedition but most of the ejected ministers refused it altogether and were exposed to the most terrible hardships  some refused them houses unless at extravagant rents others were afraid to admit them into their houses lest it should render them suspected some ministers boldly preached till they were cast into prison choosing rather to perish in suffering for christ than to be starved some of them rode thirty or forty miles and preached in the night to their flocks instigated by the informers the soldiers committed terrible outrages on their families next year a fire kindled by the papists having burnt    00 dwellinghouses and eightynine churches in london several presbyterians and independents ventured to set up meetings the best way they could for preaching the gospel  clarendon having lost his credit at court and being soon after banished could no more wreak his malice against the protestant dissenters but when charles in      moved for a general toleration to nonconformists the commons begged him to put the penal laws in execution against the conventicles or meetings of protestant dissenters for worshipping of god charles grew sick of the tyrannical cruelty of sheldon and other bishops who adhered to the maxims of clarendon and blamed the indolence and misbehaviour of the established clergy for provoking the puritans to absent from the church and set up conventicles the miseries occasioned by the dutch war the decay of trade and fears occasioned by the french invasion of the low countries awakened such as had any conscience or consideration  lord keeper bridgeman judge hale bishops reynolds and wilkins doctors burton tillotson stillingfleet and others thought it high time to promote the peace of the church and the union of protestants in the nation and devised a plan of comprehension for moderate dissenters and of toleration for others wilkins and burton formed an overture of correction of the books of common prayer and ordination with which baxter bates and manton were almost pleased and no doubt dr owen and his brethren would have been glad of the three years toleration proposed judge hale prepared a bill for the parliament answerable to their agreements but the persecuting bishops prevented its appearance and contrary to his majestys inclination revived the prosecutions against the protestant dissenters  as the reasonableness of toleration began to be warmly disputed without doors s patrick afterward bishop of ely and many others who courted preferment labored by their publications to render the dissenters odious parker afterward bishop of oxford abused them in the most false and virulent manner dr owen published a sober refutation but andrew marvels rehearsal transprosed went more to the quick its delicate though keen satyr made almost every body read it nor do i know that it received any other reply than by one of parkers friends sending andrew a letter swearing that if be printed it his throat should be cut but gods providence preserved him as an honor to the house of commons and to his nation the well known sherlock abusively ridiculed the calvinist principles and experiences founded on them and was answered by polhill and alsop nay the pious behavior edifying sermons and even the texts of the puritan ministers became a leading topic of the abusive ridicule of the stage  king queen and court were altogether shameless in wickedness they went about masked entered into houses and committed the vilest indecencies and maddest frolicks wilmot afterward earl of rochester and other uncommonly debauched profligates were their principal favorites what money the parliament bestowed upon charles he threw away upon his freaks and whores nor were the commons niggardly of what was not theirs but the nations licentious profaneness prevailed in both universities the harangues of the young clergy were stuffed with encomiums on the church and satyrs against the dissenters while the truths of the gospel and practical religion were quite out of fashion regardless how many thousands or millions ran headlong to hell in ignorance or impiety the ecclesiastical managers directed all their zeal against the puritans a new act was made in    0 bearing that every such preacher should forfeit twenty pounds for the first offense and forty for the second that whoever knowingly suffered conventicles in their houses or yards should forfeit twenty pounds for each offense  that the fines should be levied by seizing and selling the offenders goods and the third part of them given to the informer that justices of peace might break into any place where they were informed of a conventicle and apprehend all the persons present  that such justices as refused to execute this act should forfeit five pounds for each offense that no defects or mistakes in the warrant for apprehending such conventiclers should render them illegal that all clauses in this act of parliament shall to the utmost be explained in opposition to conventicles and such as attend them many justices of peace who had any honesty or humanity resigned their office rather than be concerned in executing this abominable act multitudes of the vilest miscreants commenced informers and what they gained by fines almost innumerable they spent in drunkenness and whoredom archbishop sheldon sent his bishops another circular letter worthy of the spanish inquisition in order to quicken their persecution of every body concerned in conventicle  and copies of it were sent to the officers in ever parish for not bringing in pen and mead quaker guilty of attending a conventicle in the streets  london the members of the jury were fined in fort marks sterling each and thrown into prison till the paid it  while these quakers themselves were sine and imprisoned  assisted by the lords clifford and shaftsbury wi the earl of arlington and dukes of buckingham and lauderdale commonly called the cabal charles made wide steps toward absolute power the exchequer was shut up that no payment of public debt could be obtained at the instigation o lewis xiv of france who pensioned the king an his courtiers with a million sterling yearly it wa resolved to destroy the dutch because they were protestants in      charles published an indulgence but it was principally in favors of the papists of whose increase the commons had complained  though the dissenters mightily disliked an indulgenc founded on the kings arbitrary power to dispens with the laws yet many of them took the opportunity of setting up meetings for public worship a weekly lecture was set up at pinners hall in which four leading presbyterians and two independents agreed to preach by turns in defense of the doctrine of the reformation in opposition to popery socinianism and infidelity baxter bates manton jenkins drs owen and collins and afterward alsop how cole etc chiefly distinguished themselves at these meetings  in the parliament      charles and shaftsbury his chancellor extolled this indulgence but the commons having become less tractable than their predecessors held it as destructive to the liberties of the kingdom none were more zealous against it than the dissenters alderman love a member from the city of london declared that notwithstanding all that they had suffered for the twelve preceding years he and all his fellow protestant dissenters would rather want their own rightful liberties than have them in a way destructive of the liberties of the nation and of the protestant cause charles was therefore obliged to part with his indulgence and to call in the licenses which he had given for meeting houses the commons perhaps affected by loves generosity brought in a bill for relieving protestant dissenters from the penalties of not coming to church and of holding conventicles but by the influence of the court and bishops it miscarried  charles having refused to dismiss the papists whom he had openly admitted to places of power and trust the parliament in      enacted that none under the penalty of five hundred pounds should hold any office of profit or trust unless they had sworn the oaths of allegiance and supremacy  and had received the lords supper in the manner of the english church and solemnly renounced the doctrine of transubstantiation this act requiring the reception of the lords supper before the minister church wardens and other two credible witnesses as a condition of admission to civil offices under the crown still remains in force to the dishonor of christ and reproach of religion by the above act the cabal was dissolved and shaftsbury and buckingham became advocates for the liberties of the kingdom  provoked with this exclusion of papists from places of power and trust charles and his courtiers labored to increase the severities against the dissenters  their clergy were imprisoned plundered and ruined sheldon by another circular letter quickened their persecution but the judges were become more mild and shunned the informers who had rendered themselves odious multitudes of lay conformists pitied their neighbors when they saw them imprisoned and spoiled for nothing but a scrupulous conscience or an holy life in vain the court attempted an act of parliament requiring that every voter in the election of members of parliament and all members of it or of the privy council should swear that it is unlawful upon any pretense whatsoever to take up arms against the king or those commissioned by him and that they should never endeavor any alteration of either church or state quite infuriated with the loss of this arbitrary and enslaving bill the courtiers to their utmost opposed all toleration of the dissenters and a new encouraged the infamous informers and inflamed the cruel persecution sir roger l estrange a most profligate scoundrel was hired to expose them from the press and to encourage the severest treatment of them as a people who had ruined the late king and done every thing horrid while the lower clergy retailed his calumnious abuse from their pulpits the bishops opposed every motion for accommodation of differences with the puritans and applied to his majesty for a more vigorous prosecution of the penal laws against them  in      a popish plot for rendering charles and his successors absolute monarchs and for introduction of the popish religion broke out the parliament committed five popish lords to the tower issued forth a proclamation against all papists and requested the king to remove james duke of york his brother who had for several years professed himself a papist from his person and councils the court did all that in them lay to stiffle the evidence of this popish plot and employed l estrange to represent it as ridiculous the patriots employed one carr to publish weekly discoveries of the frauds and superstition of the church of rome but he was quickly fined and his paper prohibited by the kings bench nevertheless the parliament by an act disqualified from a seat with them all such as refused to abjure the doctrine of transubstantiation and worship of saints to avert the odium from themselves the papists pretended to discover a presbyterian plot dangerfield the principal manager having conveyed a number of seditious letters into one marshals house sent the officers to search for prohibited goods who soon found the letters he had laid fair for their hand but they being proven counterfeits he confessed that the popish lords in the tower and others had hired him to forge them  in      the parliament attempted to exclude the duke of york from succeeding to the crown because he was a papist baffled in this they attempted a comprehension of the dissenters the papists being now almost able to balance all the protestants in the kingdom baffled in this also they with no small opposition in the house of lords repealed the statute of elizabeth concerning the penalties of nonattendance upon established churches but the clerk of the crown by charles secret instructions withdrew this act when along with others it should have received the royal assent  in imitation of the court some conformist clergymen changed their wonted moderation into furious rage and persecution instead of an irenicum stillingfleet now published his mischief of separation and highly condemned all the dissenters of the most criminal schism he was answered by owen baxter alsop how and barret meanwhile it seems charles hired fitzharris an irish papist to forge a new presbyterian plot he sent letters to the peers who had protested for the exclusion of the duke of york from the crown reviling the king and his family as papists and calling them to take up arms against him but the farce was discovered  in      the parliament again attempted to exclude the duke of york from the throne but charles dissolved them to prevent it and notwithstanding his solemn promise never called another  the university of cambridge and many others sent him flattering addresses in favors of arbitrary power and some pressed the vigorous execution of the penal laws against protestant dissenters hence they were now persecuted with uncommon fury not a few of the established clergy in country places who could drink and swear as abandoned rakes were made justices of peace they readily judged in their own cause and fined such dissenters as absentted from their churches but a single day to speak against popery was enough to make one suspected and reproached as a puritan the very quakers from whose hostilities no body was in danger were imprisoned and spoiled of their goods most of the clergy extolled passive obedience to sovereigns let them act as wickedly and tyrannically as they could by their published decree the university of oxford declared it impious seditious scandalous damnable heretical blasphemous and infamous to christianity itself to maintain that there is any original contract between the king and his subjects or that kings may be resisted when they subvert the constitution of the kingdom and become absolute tyrants  the imprudent talk of some persons in taverns or the like gave the courtiers an handle to pretend what they called the ryehouse plot by witnesses bribed for the purpose the earl of essex lord russel algernon sidney rumbold and houblon were impeached as guilty not content with the murdering of these innocent patriots the court made their own farce a reason of new cruelties against the dissenters twenty young men at newcastle were imprisoned a year for meeting together for private prayer and spiritual conference meanwhile the clergymen published their three and twenty cases against dissenters in order to persuade the world that all the severities used against them were just and reasonable the dissenters were shut out from their own vindication by the restriction of the press more daring than some others tho de laune an anabaptist schoolmaster when publicly challenged for an answer by dr calamy a furious conformist published his sensible plea for the nonconformists and on that account was cast into prison where notwithstanding all he could do for relief he continued till he and his wife and two children perished of hunger and cold or the like  in      charles died not without strong suspicious of poison from popish hands for the establishment of whose religion he was thought not sufficiently zealous and active james duke of york a bigoted papist succeeded him and solemnly engaged to preserve the government of both church and state as if such a sovereign had been an inestimable blessing the conformists pulpits all over the nation rang with thanksgivings and all the counties sent up their fulsome addresses the university of oxford in the most unlimited manner declared that it was impossible to move them from an unlimited subjection to all his commands his parliament procured to his liking by bribery and other too common arts settled two millions sterling yearly upon him that he might never be embarrassed for want of money as his brother and father had been and they besought his vigorous execution of the laws against the protestant dissenters the persecution was revived and occasion was taken from monmouth charles bastard soninlaws invading the kingdom to make it more and more terrible the royal army in the west lived on the people at free quarter  colonel kirk caused a number of prisoners without any trial to be hung up for diversion while he and his companions drank and danced beside the gibbets jefferies now chief justice whose savage temper had been sufficiently manifested was appointed judge in the western circuit always drunk or in a fury he raged among the poor people as an absolute infernal by repeated confinements he forced juries to bring in people guilsy whether they had proof or believed them guilty or not he persuaded many of the prisoners to plead guilty in hopes of a pardon and then ordered them to be executed immediately without having a moment for recommending their souls to god about six hundred were hanged and the quarters of two or three hundred were fixed on trees and gibbets by the way sides to the great annoyance of travelers he sold a multitude of pardons from the rate of ten to fourteen thousand guineas a piece by such methods some dissenters were forced into the church and multitudes fled to holland or america and spademan rastric buroughs scoffin quipp and other conforming clergymen were by the power of conscientious convictions forced from the church to join the persecuted dissenters  meanwhile the popish party mightily increased  multitudes of jesuits and regular priests were invited from abroad jesuitical seminaries of learning were erected in london and in the country masschapels were erected in almost every considerable town four popish bishops were consecrated in the royal chapel multitudes of tracts for seducing people to popery were published multitudes frequented the popish chapels as that and zeal for james absolute power were the sole road to preferments all the subjects were prohibited to speak disrespectfully of his majestys religion at last some conformists opened their eyes and began to preach against popery james prohibited the inferior clergy to touch upon controverted points of religion hereupon drs tillotson stillingfleet tennison patrick wake whitby sharp atterbury and others began to copy the example which the dissenters had set them some years before in their morning exercises and published a number of sensible discourses against the principal corruptions of popery it seems that richard baxter and some other nonconformists offered to assist them in writing on these points  but their productions were not allowed to be printed the established clergy did not appear fond of their help nor had they proper access to the books necessary for such work nor would it have been prudent to have provoked james beyond what they had done in refusing to concur in the repeal of the test act provoked with the conformists opposition to his religion james declared against the cruelty of the church of england and encouraged by the judges who interpreted the laws he by his absolute dispensing power granted an indulgence to the dissenters courted their affection and encouraged them to set up their conventicles they improved this opportunity of preaching the gospel but had no good opinion of his end in granting it  after a constant persecution of twenty six years the extremity of the puritans sufferings now came to an end about sixty thousand had suffered much on religious accounts five if not rather about ten thousand had perished in prisons of the quakers alone three hundred and fifty died in jail and about fourteen hundred were now released multitudes had retired to america holland etc nevertheless the number of remaining dissenters was much the same as at the beginning of the persecution  their firmness and constancy in sufferings convinced the world that they were not governed by humor but by conscience their sermons being plain and practical had no small success their morals were remarkably answerable to the commandments of christ they had carefully trained up their children their own way and labored to impress their minds with a sense of religion they studied to keep up a succession of faithful ministers these things together with the persecuting rage and licentious behavior of the conformists made the numbers of puritans continue amidst all their temporal discouragements  james and his priests being thoroughly enraged against their conformist opposers he appointed commissioners all over the kingdom to enquire into the oss sustained by the dissenters that their persecutors might be obliged to refund it the informers judges and many others laid their account with immediate ruin but the puritans generally concealed their injuries when it was in their power to have them revenged and their loss refunded by the advice of chancellor jesseries and contrary to a standing law of      and to james own subjection to the pope a new high commission was erected to visit the nation reform the disorders of the church and punish clerical offenders with suspension deprivation excommunication etc sancroft archbishop of canterbury was afraid to act in this terrible work but the bishops of durham and rochester jefferies himself the earl of sunderland herbert and wright chief justices and fenner recorder of london some of them professed papists were not so squeamish  the universities of cambridge and oxford were commanded to fill up their vacancies with scandalous popish fellows and governors but they obstinately refused  by his absolute power james now published a declaration of his intentions or rather a promise to protect the church of england as by law established  and to grant a toleration in religion to all his subjects and to abolish all penal laws against dissenters  or imposition of oaths or tests upon such as held public employments the baptists quakers independents and presbyterians thanked him for his favor but promised no absolute obedience notwithstanding the presence of two courtiers most of the presbyterian clergy at their general meeting seemed willing rather to forfeit their liberty granted than declare for his majestys power sir james shorter mayor of london declined his freedom from the test and from conformity to the english church which displeased the king lobb an independent minister penn the quaker and some few other dissenters complied not a little with james and his courtiers measures but the bulk of the dissenters stood off and notwithstanding all that the court could do refused to assist in the destruction of those that had so long persecuted them these persecutors now implored their assistance and promised a redress of their grievances as soon as their common danger from popery should blow over some of the bishops waited upon the leaders of the dissenting clergy and besought them to use their influence with their party to stand aloof from the court in doing which they might assuredly expect redress of their burdens as soon as possible the marquis of halifax by advice of the church dignitaries represented to the dissenters that they had no ground to trust the papists and that they ought not to prosecute their resentment at the expense of the public safety and that they might see how the conformists resentment had brought themselves to the brink of ruin about twenty thousand copies of this letter were dispersed and had a very good effect  the rupture between james and the church of england having become quite open and manifest both parties prepared for their own defense by turning out magistrates and placing others in their room according to the powers claimed by him in the new charters and by displacing such officers in the kingdom as disliked his absolute power and by a tour through the country to ingratiate himself with his people james labored to procure a parliament for repealing the penal statutes concerning religion mild methods not succeeding to his wish he abandoned himself to the direction of his furious popish priests made father petre one of them his prime minister intending to make him archbishop of york and a cardinal of the holy conclave  the earl of castlemain was dispatched ambassador to rome and the popes nuncio received a solemn audience at windsor notwithstanding the law of henry viii still made it treason to correspond with his holiness parker bishop of oxford was employed to publish reasons of abrogating the test in his performance he said what he could to excuse transubstantiation and to clear the papists from the charge of idolatry but a smart reply by dr burnet sunk the reputation of parker in ireland every thing was modelled for an immediate introduction of popery in england james was busy at the like work protestant officers were turned out of the army portsmouth and hull the principal ports of the kingdom were committed to papists irish papists came over in multitudes some regiments being formed only of papists and scarcely a troop or company without some placed in them by order from court the army was brought to black heath to awe the city of london and the parliament  there being still danger from a protestant successor as mary his eldest daughter had been married to william prince of orange son of mary daughter of charles i james wrote her a letter for persuading her to embrace his popish religion and employed one james stewart a scotch lawyer to cause fagel williams principal confident labor to promote his conversion to popery or at least his approbation of the repeal of the penal laws against it william and marys answers giving james no ground to expect their conversion he resolved to have a new heir to his crown by his long barren queen the jesuits pretenses that she obtained this child by a vow to the virgin mary of loretto and their predictions that it would be a prince  together with the total neglect of the requisite proofs of the queens pregnancy and delivery and many other suspicious circumstances made most of the protestants in the nation believe it an imposture encouraged by the hopes of an unborn successor james in april      by his absolute power over all laws published his second declaration for liberty of conscience and appointed the bishops to cause it to be read from every pulpit during the time of divine worship crew of durham barlow of lincoln cartwright of chester wood of litchfield walters of st davids sprat of rochester parker of oxford and herbert of hereford complied and all but herbert returned their fulsom addresses of thanks to james eighteen bishops and the chiefs of their clergy refused to publish it so that it was ead in no more than about  00 churches seven of them in london sancroft of canterbury loyd of st asaph ken of bath and wells turner of ely lake of chichester white of peterborough and trelawney of bristol in an address to james attempted to justify their not publishing his declaration as they could not but think the dispensing power contrary to the laws of the land for their presumption they were sent to the tower which indeed they richly deserved on another account as they had for twentyseven years labored to establish kings arbitrary power and passive obedience to it till it came to be turned against themselves upon the   th of june after a trial of ten hours these bishops to james inexpressible vexation but to the joy of the city and part of the army were acquitted  finding that mary his princess was now excluded from the british crown by an heir whose royal birth was at best extremely doubtful william began to listen more attentively to the many invitations he received from england beseeching him to come over and deliver the nation from popery and slavery  lewis xiv of france informed james of his soninlaws intention to invade his kingdom and offered him fifteen thousand troops or more if necessary to withstand him but the earl of sunderland who had been lately converted to popery persuaded him not to accept of these offered troops as it would make all the protestants believe that he intended an overthrow of their religion and liberties persuaded of williams intentions to invade his kingdom james to regain the favor of his protestant subjects issued forth warrants for calling a parliament  by advice of the bishops took off the suspension of the bishop of london which had been inflicted for his refusing to suspend dr sharp for preaching against popery before he had tried him  dissolved the ecclesiastical commission restored the charter of london and the fellows of magdalen college at oxford and renounced several other illegal practices but he no sooner heard that williams sleet was dispersed by a storm than he stopped his redressing of grievances  upon nov  st william again put to sea with fourteen thousand men and on the  th landed at torbay in the south of england the wind having almost miraculously favored him and restrained james fleet he published a declaration in which he enumerated the grievances of the nation relative to religion and liberty and the fruitless attempts which had been made to have them redressed  and protested that his intention in his expedition was to procure a free parliament in which these grievances might be redressed and an agreement established between the church of england and the protestant dissenters  finding by this declaration that william had been invited by not only nobles and others but also by a number of the bishops and that they refused to declare their detestation of his invasion james placed all his hopes in his army which he endeavored to strengthen from scotland and especially from ireland in so much that many in britain were afraid of a new popish massacre this fright being over the london mob pulled down the popish chapels  father petre with shoals of jesuits and priests who had flocked about the court fled out of the kingdom several of james ministers of arbitrary power left him and concealed themselves jefferies was apprehended in a sailors habit and would have been torn to pieces by the mob had not a strong guard escorted him to the tower where he died before he came to his trial when william came to exeter many of the nobility signed an association in which they promised to assist him in the pursuance of his declaration and to revenge whatever attempt should be made on his person finding that so many of his nobles and part of his army had gone over to his soninlaw that anne his younger daughter and her husband prince george of denmark had left him and that the university of oxford archbishop sancroft and seven or eight other bishops had signed the above mentioned association  james after not a little perplexity contempt and abuse followed his queen into france when william came to london many of the established clergy and about ninety dissenters in a body presented their congratulatory addresses to him and were graciously received when he and mary his consort were enthroned the dissenters presented an address to each of them which were favorably accepted and indeed during their whole reign the dissenters were their most hearty and steady friends  many of the clerical conformists now behaved in a most shocking manner after they had long preached up the unlimited power of the king and encouraged the imposition of oaths acknowledging it they plainly showed that they regarded it only so far as it was exercised to support themselves after they had seduced james into his extravagancies they left him to perish in his ruins after they had solemnly engaged to support william they almost constantly labored to compass the ruin of his person and government sancroft of canterbury loyd of norwich turner of ely frampton of gloucester thomas of worcester lake of chichester and white of peterborough refused to swear allegiance to him many who did swear it by their distinction between a king de facto and one de jure plainly manifested that they submitted to william and mary as mere usurpers whom they thought it their duty to pull down if ever they could no sooner was their danger from the papists over than they cast all their kind promises to dissenters at their heels and appeared as ready to persecute them as ever the eight bishops above mentioned pretended to move for a comprehension of some dissenters and for a toleraon of the rest and meanwhile instigated their friends to oppose it and to represent the promoters of it as enemies to the church the bigoted clergy threatened their moderate brethren with a new separation if any important mitigation of the terms of communion were allowed to the dissenters and by that means deterred them from correcting the book of common prayer lest these zealots by adhering to the old form of it should draw over the body of the nation to their side  when king william came to his first parliament      he recommended the exclusion of papists from all places of power or trust and the unhampered admission of all his protestant subjects some members moved that the receiving of the lords supper at least in the manner of the established church should not be held a necessary qualification for a civil office but the contrary was carried the dispensing with kneeling at the lords supper or crossing in baptism and an allowance for persons to explain assent and consent in their subscription of the thirtynine articles were refused in the house of lords  an act of toleration for all protestants except socinians by which they were exempted from the penalties of nonconformity providing they take the oaths to the government and subscribe the doctrinal articles of the english church was got carried but with great difficulty  during the dependence of the above acts in parliament a motion was made in the house of lords for a comprehension of the moderate dissenters and a removal of these things at which they principally scrupled some moved that as under henry viii and edward vi a mixed committee of clergymen and laymen should prepare the draught of corrections and terms of agreement this motion was rejected by a small majority burnet laments that he opposed it for fear of offending the established clergy by the advice of dr tillotson king william referred it to a synod of clergymen that their body might the more readily receive it and the papists have less handle of objecting against it lamplugh archbishop of york loyd sprat burnet and six other bishops  stillingfleet tillotson sharp beveridge scot grove patrick kidder tennison fowler and ten other divines were appointed to meet and prepare such alterations of the liturgy and canons  and to frame overtures for the reformation of the ecclesiastical courts  and to consider every other like matter which might tend to the peace and welfare of the church bishops mew and sprat and two divines withdrew that they might have no hand in relieving the dissenters some who remained pled that making of alterations upon the constitutions of the church for gratifying an obstinate and peevish party would but render them more insolent would occasion a rent in the church and make people disesteem the liturgy which needed correction  nevertheless the committee finished their work and agreed that certain parts of canonical scripture be read in place of the apocryphal lessons and that the athanasian creed might be omitted and that ascribed to the apostles used instead of it they drew up new collects more agreeable to the epistles and gospels kidder formed a new version of the psalms from the hebrew they substituted more plain and safe expressions instead of those which had been excepted against in the liturgy they agreed that the singing of gods praise by musical instruments in cathedrals be laid aside that legendary saints days should be omitted in the calendar and not observed that the use of the cross in baptism and of godfathers and godmothers be left to the option of parents that kneeling in the lords supper be left indifferent that the use of the surplice be left indifferent and at the discretion of the bishop of the diocese that the reordination of such as have been ordained by presbyters be only conditional that the name of priest be changed into that of minister etc etc these alterations would have probably brought in three fourths of the dissenters to the established church but the bulk of the clergy relished no such condescensions while the committee were employed in their work many raised a terrible outcry that king william and his agents intended to pull down episcopacy and set up presbytery the universities of oxford and cambridge furiously declared themselves against all alterations and that such as promoted them were undoubted enemies to the church  care was taken to appoint such members for the convocation as would so judge of the work of the committee as to put an end to all attempts of alterations when they met k william desired them to consider what he had to lay before them with due and impartial zeal for the welfare of the church but the lower house at the first resolved to enter on no debate relative to the book of common prayer and constitutions of their church they had scarcely temper enough to thank his majesty for his promised protection of them and their church nor could the bishops bring them to acknowledge any christian fellowship with the protestant churches abroad as had been done in the address of the upper house  finding the lower house behave in this furious manner william dissolved their meeting and since they were in no temper to do good he by proroguing their assemblies restrained them from doing any hurt for ten years to come the settlement of presbytery in scotland was improved by these mad zealots as an handle for calumniating his majesty and opposing all condescension toward the dissenters  terrible was now the contention between the episcopalian clergy that took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to k william and such as did not the nonjurants represented their opponents as men who had trampled on their consciences for the sake of preferment  and pretended that the imposition of the oath warranted them to separate from their brethren that they had their spiritual authority from christ and could not be deprived of it by the civil powers  and so were still bound to take care of the souls of their people the jurants replied that they were schismatics in separating from the church that though the state had deprived them of their livings they ought not to revenge it upon the church in a schismatical withdrawment from her communion and that magistrates may lawfully deprive clergymen of their extrinsical power of exercising their ministry all along from the reformation and especially for near  0 years past the episcopalian clergy had maintained the power of princes in ecclesiastical causes and an unlimited passive obedience to them but now the high church party refused to admit of his majestys power in spiritual causes and both they and the williamites gave up with their doctrine of passive obedience  having now lost hopes of access to the established church the bulk of the presbyterians and independents formed a plan of concord between themselves bearing that all who are united to christ are members of his catholic invisible church and all visible believers and their children members of the visible that societies of visible believers who under christ statedly join together for communion in all the ordinances of the gospel are particular churches that none ought to be admitted as members to all sealing ordinances but such as know and believe the fundamental truths of the gospel and are of blameless lives marked with visible godliness and honesty that a competent number of visible saints become the subjects of stated church fellowship upon their agreement to walk together according to gospel rules that though parochial churches are not of divine institution yet for edification the members of a particular church ought to live as contiguously as possible that every particular church has a right to choose their own pastors and being furnished with them has authority from christ for the exercise of government and dispensation of ordinances within itself that in administrating church power it belongs to officers to rule and to the brotherhood to consent that all christians as they have opportunity ought to join and steadfastly continue in communion with some particular church that the ministerial office is appointed by jesus christ for the gathering edification and government of his church till the end of the world that such as are called or admitted to the ministerial office ought to be marked with proper gifts grace and holy conversation  that in ordinary cases none ought to be ordained pastors but in relation to some particular church that it is proper that the pastors of neighboring congregations be consulted in the calling of ministers and assist at their ordination that it is proper that the gifts of candidates for preaching the gospel be tried by pastors and that they be sent forth with solemn approbation and prayer that in every church admonitions and excommunications of scandalous persons ought to have place that in order to promote the communion of churches all the members ought to walk christianly toward one another  no church ought to usurp authority over one another nor to decoy members from another or to blame the proceedings of another till it has had an opportunity of defending itself  and every one ought readily to give account of its procedure in order to prevent offense that deacons who take care of the poor are appointed by christ that no breach ought to be made with respect to the institution of ruling elders that synods ought to be held at least for consultation about church affairs and their decisions to be received with reverence and none to dissent from them without apparent ground from the word of god that all men ought to pray for obey and support civil magistrates  they agreed pretty well in condemning the expressions of davis of rothwel sundry of which bordered on antinomianism or anabaptism but soon fell into a terrible flame of contention relative to some of the distinguished truths of the gospel for almost forty years preceding richard baxter had been attempting to form a medley of calvinistical and arminian doctrines particularly concerning our redemption by christ and justification before god and had been refuted by dr owen crandon brown and many others nevertheless his fame of piety and penetration had decoyed most of the english presbyterians to his side in    0 the sermons of the eminently pious dr crisp who had flourished about fifty years before and had been blamed for approaching too near antinomianism were republished by his son several ministers attested that they believed the additional sermons to be genuine this attestation was pretended to be a countenancing of their contents mr williams published his gospel truth stated and vindicated in which he attempted to refute several positions laid down by dr crisp as he steered a middle course betwixt baxterianism and calvinism or rather refined upon baxter it was not difficult to procure a solemn approbation of his book from clergymen of his acquaintance but it was refuted with great warmth by isaac chauncey in his neonomianism unmasked robert trail also published a letter in vindication of the protestant doctrine of justification through the imputed righteousness of christ alone and of the practisers and professors of it from the unjust charge of antinomianism  great pains were taken by some to heal this unhappy breach which hindered the success of the gospel and mightily pleased the conformist enemies of both parties but by mutual reproaches it was more and more widened a breach was made in the lecture at pinners hall nothing less than the exclusion of williams could satisfy his opponents  bates how and alsop who were all inclined to his sentiments went off with him mead and t cole remained and had four others added in place of those that went off mather lobb goodwin and others appeared in opposition to williams scheme of the gospel being a new law and his denial of a legal change of person between the elect and christ as their surety lobb appealed to stillingfleet now bishop of worcester and to dr john edwards both of whom favored dr williams scheme after the two parties by hot debates of several years continuance had rendered themselves a reproach they in some sort referred their differences to herman witsius a dutch professor of divinity to compose them he published his animadversiones irenicae in which he with great candor meekness and precision pointed out the truth and reproved the illguarded expressions of them that held it he showed that all the sins of elect men being laid upon borne and satisfied for by christ as their surety there behoved to be an exchange of persons between him and them in lawreckoning that though christ bore the sins of his people not not only during his last sufferings but in his whole state of humiliation he ought not to be represented as a sinner blasphemer adulterer etc or as abominable to and abdicated by his father that though christ absolutely and unconditionally purchased eternal redemption for all his elect yet his righteousness is not imputed to their persons till the moment of their regeneration and spiritual unition to him that though christ and his elect were legally united together from all eternity that their sins might be laid on him and satisfaction demanded from him in the fullness of time yet their mystical union is not begun till he apprehend them by his spirit nor completed till they receive him by faith that christs holiness of nature and life under the law as well as his satisfactory sufferings are imputed by god to all believers which constitute them perfectly holy and righteous in lawreckoning before him as their infinitely exact judge that mens justification before god in no respect depends upon any kind of works of theirs nor on faith which is and necessarily produces good works as a work as a condition or disposing cause but merely as an instrument of receiving christ and his righteousness and justification through it that though many true believers have not any bold confidence that christ and his salvation are theirs in possession yet faith in itself is a most firm persuasion of ones own particular right to christ and all his saving benefits and this persuasion is weak or strong as faith itself is in the heart that repentance in the root of it being coeval with the habit of faith may be said to precede actual pardon of sin as well as faith that though all the sins of believers past present and to come be fully and irrevocably pardoned in their justification on account of which god as a legal judge can see no sin in them in order to condemnation yet as an omniscient and holy father he sees much sin in them to be highly displeased with them and which exceedingly hurts and defiles them  and therefore they ought to be burdened with confess and mourn over it and pray for the pardon of it that though christs suretyrighteousness be the only proper condition of the covenant of grace yet the lord has appointed faith to be the mean of his elects entrance into the actual enjoyment of the blessing of it that though our graces and good works are of no avail as the condition of our justification before god nay as dwelling in our sinful nature and proceeding from us are but as loss dung and filthy rags before him as a judge yet as proceeding from the holy ghost and accepted through christ they are of great use as a preparation for heaven and as means of averting gods judgments and drawing his delights and benefits on us as his friends and children in christ that the law of god as a covenant of works and as a rule of life and the gospel particularly as strictly taken ought to be carefully preached in their proper connexions with each other and that though the beginning of our spiritual life is produced by the gospel strictly taken conveying gods grace into our heart the progress and increase of it is produced both by the gospel and by the law as a rule of life  these contentions had more abundantly exposed the dissenters concerned to the ridicule of their conformist neighbors had they not been as hotly engaged among themselves mr how had published a letter pleading with both conformists and nonconformists that they would think of and behave christianly and charitably towaad each other as the points in which they differed were of small importance in respect of those in which they agreed but whatever good effect this might have upon some dissenters it had none upon most of the conformists stillingfleet and others exceedingly grudged at the late toleration to allay their heats lock so well known in the learned world at different times published his letters on toleration in which amidst not a few loose hints he has exhausted his subject and showed that force is an improper mean of conviction and that men ought not to be compelled by it into the faith profession and practice of religion  after patient waiting for several years the sees of the nonjurant deprived bishops were filled up in      and the rather as turner of ely had been accused of having a hand in a conspiracy against king william john tillotson was made archbishop of canterbury ed fowler bishop of gloucester sam patrick of ely j more of norwich rich kidder of bath and wells rich cumberland of peterborough robert grove of chichester and edward stillingfleet of worcester tillotson died about three years after greatly lamented by all the friends of ingenuity charity and moderation and was succeeded by tennison many of the inferior clergy refused to hold communion with these new bishops but adhered to the old and thus formed a church of nonjurors they maintained that james still continued the only lawful king of britain that all such as acknowledged another were by the  d canon ipso facto excommunicated that the deprivation of bishops by civil authority is utterly invalid and ought not to be regarded that the authority of the church of england and consequently the church itself resides in the nonjurors and their successors who have steadfastly adhered to her true constitutions and that all that depart from them or join the new schismatical bishops are schismatics and all such clergy as do so forfeit their office and cannot dispense the ordinances of god to any edification hicks kettlewell and lesly were principal supporters of this scheme hellier and others but especially hoadly afterward bishop of winchester opposed them  as king william had long restrained the convocation from meeting and transacting business at the same time with the parliament a remonstrance was published in      bearing that convocations were now as necessary as ever they had been in the christian church that william had sworn to maintain the rights of the english church that the convocation ought to be called whenever the parliament sits that they are a spiritual parliament consisting of an upper and lower house  and have power to proceed against such as are guilty of heresy schism or any other spiritual offenses without restriction by any act of parliament and that their canons are binding if agreeable to common sense his majestys prerogative and the laws of the land this kindled a new controversy which was not soon if ever adjusted dr wake afterward archbishop of canterbury in several tracts labored to prove the power of christian princes over ecclesiastical synods and was answered by hill and atterbury in his rights powers and privileges of an english convocation stated and vindicated who in their turn were answered by kennet burnet etc  the contests of the dissenters concerning the doctrines of the gospel and of the episcopalians concerning church government were not finished when the convocation sat down in a d   00 bent upon asserting their own independency of the upper the lower house refused to adjourn when required by the archbishop without any allowance from the king they collected and read several books and marked their errors some members complained with great warmth of burnets exposition of the thirtynine articles they intended to have strengthened the church with additional canons but as his majesty had given them no license to proceed to business the archbishop prorogued their meeting till may after they had sitten some months to no purpose a new contest ensued whether the lower house of convocation have power to adjourn or continue themselves as they please many tracts relative to this point were published the upper house labored by all the expedients they could devise to have peace and harmony with the lower till at last his majestys death in march   0  for a time hushed their debate  anne had scarcely succeeded him when the presbyterian independent and baptist dissenters presented her with a joint address their conforming enemies already hoped to revive their former oppression before this clarkson had published his account of the primitive bishops and liturgies king his constitution of the primitive church james owen his plea for the validity of presbyterian ordination and tongue his vindication of the dissenters  none of which pleased the episcopalian bigots sir humphrey edwin a dissenting mayor of london about five years before had carried the regalia or badges of his office to the meeting at pinners hall some tracts had been published for and against the occasional conformity of dissenters bearing public office  having got rid of king william whom they heartily hated and got a queen of their own temper their enemies resolved to hamper their toleration with additional restrictions and conditions and to exclude them from all public office unless they fully and constantly conformed to the church  no sooner had the parliament met than the commons appeared chiefly bent for carrying a bill for the exclusion of all occasional conformists from public offices under the crown and bearing that whosoever after taking of the sacramental test for offices of trust or magistracy in corporations frequented any meeting of dissenters for the public worship o god should pay a fine of  00 pounds sterling and five pounds more for every day he retained his office after he had been at any such meeting as the lords would not agree to it it was dropped in   0  the commons altered their bill a little but the lords again rejected it in   0  the commons brought it in a third time and many of them attempted to tack it to a money bill that the one might not be got rejected without the other but this miscarried and the lords refused the bill a second reading none opposed it more earnestly than bishop burnet and his moderate episcopal brethren  this bill occasioned a prodigious number of publications for and against occasional conformity the enemies of the dissenters pled that if they could occasionally conform for the sake of an office their separation was not matter of conscience with them but a real schism that if occasional conformity was lawful constant conformity must be so likewise and that either their occasional conformity or their stated nonconformity must be hypocritical the dissenters and other friends of occasional conformity pled that though they thought it duty to maintain stated communion with such as they reckoned wrongfully excluded from the national church  as a testimony against such persecution  with such as administered christs ordinances with least mixture of human inventions  with such as asserted the liberty of christians from human impositions in the worship of god  with such as denied admission of persons ignorant or scandalous to the seals of his covenant  with such whose principles most admitted of christian charity  and in whose administrations their souls experienced most spiritual edification  yet they reckoned occasional conformity lawful that therein they might imitate the practice of john baptist and of jesus christ and his apostles that they might show their charity and regard to those of different sentiments and their readiness to join the established church if they had but a proper opportunity afforded them after both parties had written themselves out of breath an act against the admission of occasional conformists to any places of power and trust passed in       instigated by bishop burnet anne in   0  remitted the arrears of the tithes to the poor clergy and offered to allot her whole share of the first fruits and tithes for that end the parliament passed an act for alienation of this branch of the revenue for said end and for forming a corporation to see to the application of it accordingly and they repealed the statute of mortmain so far as to allow persons to dispone what they pleased for the augmentation of benefices this kindness did not reconcile the clergy to burnet whom they had long so heartily hated the lower house of convocation still contended with their superiors in the upper they besought her majesty to protect them and take the point of debate between them into her own hand for decision in   0  the upper house having drawn up an address of thanks to her for her affectionate care of the church which the parliament had lately declared to be in no danger the lower one without offering any reason refused to concur in it and formed one of their own in a very different strain which was rejected by the archbishop in consequence of this the address was dropped and all communication between the two houses shut up the queen by a letter signified to the archbishop that she resolved to maintain her supremacy and the due subordination of presbyters to bishops and hoped that he and his suffragans would act accordingly  in doing which they might expect her protection and she appointed him to impart this declaration to the bishops and clergy and to prorogue the convocation to such time as should appear most convenient  in   0  the parliament readily agreed to make the perpetual security of the church of england a fundamental article of the incorporating union with the scots but the lower house of convocation still continued to wrangle with their superiors  they resolved to remonstrate to the commons against the union as dangerous to their church apprized of their intentions her majesty required the archbishop to prorogue them for three weeks  before the expiration of which the act for the union had passed in parliament they remonstrated to the upper house against the prorogation and pretended that the convocation had never been prorogued during the sitting of parliament but from the records it appeared that on several occasions it had been prorogued while the parliament sat and in some instances had sat after the parliament had been dissolved informed of their behavior the queen wrote to the archbishop that she looked on them as invading her supremacy and that if they attempted any such thing for the future she would take care to punish the offenders about the same time the french protestants prosecuted elias marion john cavalier and durand fage before compton bishop of london they were declared impostors notwithstanding this sentence was confirmed by the bishops these french prophets or rather enthusiasts held their assemblies in london under the countenance of sir richard bulkley and john lacy  reviled the established clergy  and denounced the judgments of god against london and the whole british nation the french protestants therefore again prosecuted them and each of them was sined in twenty marks and condemned to stand twice on a scaffold with papers on their breast exhibiting their offense  for twenty years multitudes of the english conformists had continued reviling the revolution k william had scarcely expired when his character and conduct were most rudely abused so loud were the outcries of the church being in danger especially by those that lived more like brutes or devils than like christians that the parliament in   0  had been obliged to take this matter into consideration and had resolved that the church was in a flourishing condition and that whoever attempted to persuade people that she was in danger should be held an enemy to the queen church and kingdom notwithstanding all this dr h sacheverel in   0  published two sermons in which he pretended that the necessary means of bringing about the revolution were odious and unjustifiable that the act tolerating protestant dissenters was unreasonable and unwarrantable that the established church of england was in great danger under her majestys administration that the present administration of both church and state tended to destroy their constitution the commons declared his sermons scandalous and seditious libels and impeached himself of high crimes and misdemeanors before the lords the commons too warm prosecution of him disgusted many that were of moderate principles the tories pretended that the whigs had formed a design to pull down the church and by this prosecution meant to try their strength in the parliament before they attempted their principal object these reports were too readily credited and spread by many of the clergy in order to inflame their people in favor of sacheverel during his trial of three weeks continuance her majesty every day attended in the house though not in her royal appearances and crowds of people attended him to and from it and pressed to kiss his hand as if he had been some famous confessor  they beset the queens chariot and cried that they hoped she was for dr sacheverel after his council had finished their defense he in a speech solemnly justified his intentions toward her majesty and government respectfully mentioned the revolution and protestant succession to the crown but maintained the doctrine of passive obedience to sovereigns as a maxim of the english church as anne secretly favored his cause her chaplains encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church  after much virulent altercation he was found guilty condemned to forbear preaching for three years and his sermons to be publicly burnt by the hangman of london his friends considered the lenity of his sentence as a proof of their victory over his opponents  being presented to a living in north wales he went thither with all the pomp and magnificence of a prince was received by the university of oxford and the magistrates of several towns in his way in much the same manner as if a king and was often attended by about a thousand horse and nothing was heard but the cry of the church and dr sacheverel no sooner was his sentence expired in      than the new house of commons called him to preach before them and the queen presented him to the rich benefice of st andrews london  q anne having turned out all her whig ministers except the duke of marlborough and dissolved her whiggish parliament great care was taken to provide members to her taste for the next such was the enthusiastical zeal for dr sacheverel that few were returned members but such as had distinguished themselves in opposition to the whig administration being met in      they appointed fifty new churches to be built in london and excluded the dissenters from all civil offices or places of power and trust unless they became constant conformists the lower house of convocation chose dr atterbury a furious tory for their prolocutor and director while the queen marked her contempt of the bishops many of whom were too whiggish for her new schemes of introducing a popish pretender and overturning the liberties of both church and state she called the two houses of convocation to repress the attempts of profane persons against religion  atterbury drew up a representation of the state of religion ever since the revolution containing most severe strictures upon the administration the bishops drew up one more moderate and proposed several regulations but the houses could agree in almost nothing but the censuring of the arian tenets vented by whiston professor of mathematics in the university of cambridge but as they did not censure himself and the queen did not ratify their censure on his doctrine he continued publicly justifying and pleading that the apostolical constitutions were not only canonical scripture but in point of authority preferable to our gospels to prevent the growth of schism the parliament in      notwithstanding great opposition in both houses enacted that no dissenters should be allowed to teach in any school or academy but the queen dying on the very day on which the force of this statute commenced it became null and void  when king george i came to the throne he marked an evident bias toward the whigs who had so earnestly labored for his advancement this provoked the tories and even the populace against him dangerous tumults were raised at birmingham bristol chippenham norwich reading etc the cry of the party was down with the whigs and up with sacheverel for ever as the disputes relative to the trinity which had been carried on about twenty years still increased his majesty required the bishops to see that nothing should be taught on that head but what is contained in the holy scripture and that no clergymen should meddle with the affairs of state the parliament in      repealed the act against admission of occasional conformists into places of power or trust and the act prohibiting protestant dissenters to teach in schools and academies hoadly now bishop of bangor distinguished himself in pleading for the repeal as he thought that no man ought to be deprived of civil privileges on account of his religious opinions as he had published a preservative from the principles and practices of the nonjurors and a sermon on the nature of christs kingdom the convocation appointed drs moss sherlock friend sprat canon and bisse to examine them in their remarks they represented both as tending to subvert all discipline and government in the church of christ and to reduce it to anarchy and confusion and as impugning the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical and the power of the parliament to enforce obedience in religious matters by civil sanctions to restrain their heats his majesty appointed the archbishop to prorogue them their publications afterward exposed them to the derision of moderate on lookers snape and sherlock were hoadlys principal antagonists never since has the convocation been allowed to transact any business besides complimentary addresses to the king  the prosecution of bisse for maintaining james to be lawful king of britain and george an usurper and that for  0 years past there had been neither king laws nor parliament  and his condemnation to stand on the pillory at charing cross and at the royal exchange and to ly four years in prison and pay a fine of  00 pounds  the parliaments admission of a solemn declaration from the quakers instead of an oath and their condemnation of atterbury bishop of rochester in      as a traitor to forfeit all his dignities and benefices and to banishment from the kingdom never to return under pain of death  the attempt of the quakers to get themselves freed from payment of ecclesiastical dues  the intended naturalization of foreign protestants and jews  the proposal of correcting the book of common prayer the act for the public solemnization of marriage and the late attempt of arians socinians and others to have the subscription of the thirtynine articles laid aside and the act for toleration of papists are perhaps too late or too unimportant for a place in this abridgment it is more pleasant to observe that within these fifty years past the doctrines of the free grace of god reigning through the imputed righteousness of jesus christ have by hervey and others in the established church as well as by dissenters of different denominations been not a little revived and successfully spread and are at present preached by hundreds though too often with a restriction of the gospel offer to sensible sinners  brief sketch of the history of the church of ireland perhaps by means of the diocletian persecution in england and france the gospel had been introduced into ireland in the  th century about a d     palladius the deacon with twelve assistants being sent to form the believers there into an episcopal church landed in leinster and gained some proselytes and founded three churches but being rudely treated by the heathen inhabitants he retired to north britain and ended his labors among the picts patrick a native of bretagne in france or rather of scotland near glasgow was fired with zeal for the conversion of the savage irish being driven from leinster after he had converted cormac a prince and some others he fled to ulster where dichu a prince and the whole court of tarah were converted to christ it is said that he established a bishopric at clogher and an archbishopric at ardmach committing the first to mcurtin and the last to the pious binen and that soon afterward he carried thirty holy men from britain to ireland and made them all bishops and that by his incessant labors of about sixty years continuance he spread the christian religion through leinster ulster and munster baptized twelve thousand converts and erected     bishoprics to be sure not diocesan ones and died in a d     about seventy years after one columb is represented as coming from the west of scotland with no less than twenty bishops forty priests fifty devoted monks and thirty students in his train and pushing his way into the convention of estates which was sitting at dromoeat some writers represent ireland in these times as famous for learning and piety but i could never find any proper evidence of it beside monkish devotions congall columba aidan finan fursey cuthbert colman clement albin claude john erigena and the famous cormac archbishop of cashell and king of munster who settled the psalter of cashell are marked as their principal men of learning but i suspect the most of these were rather natives of scotland  the almost perpetual wars of the many irish kings one with another  the invasions of the country by the picts and by the welsh etc in the  th century rendered the nation miserable enough but the depredations and conquests of the danes and norwegians in the ninth and tenth centuries rendered their condition absolutely wretched these northern savages not only almost extirpated all appearances of christianity but by fire and sword barbarously wasted and took possession of the best of the country  notwithstanding these heathens were at last driven out about a d  0 0 there was but little regard paid to true christianity when the english in consequence of a grant of the country by the pope to king henry ii and an invitation by one of the seven kings a vile adulterer for his own protection conquered at least part of it and introduced their laws into it about a d    0 during these two centuries marian scot tigernach melisa of munster gilbert of limerick and malachy the famed archbishop of ardmach who is said to have emitted the prophecy of the popes were their principal learned men in order to render the irish church liker to the english henry after splendidly feasting the princes and other chiefs conveened a national synod at cashell which enacted that none should marry their cousins or any other of their near kinsfolk that children should be catechized without the church door and be baptized in the fonts appointed for that end in the churches that the tithes of corn cattle and other increase and profits should be faithfully paid to the church that all church land and property should be free from all secular exactions and impositions that no clergyman however near of kin should pay any part of eric or composition for murder that christians being sick shall make their testament before the priest and their neighbors dividing their movables which remain after payment of all debts into three parts one for the widow another for the children and a third for the performance of the will and if he have no children one half for the widow and the other for the performance of his testament that all that die in the catholic faith be brought to church and regularly buried and that all the parts of divine service be performed in the churches of ireland in the same order and manner as in the church of england  either at the college of oxford or by means of some waldenses that had fled into ireland richard archbishop of ardmach appears to have obtained some discernment of the popish abominations which occasioned to him not a little trouble from the pope and his monks king henry viii having broken off from the pope because he refused to dissolve his marriage with catherine of arragon introduced his english reformation into ireland and required the clergy to abjure his holiness authority and acknowledge himself head of their church in his stead but except brown archbishop of dublin few of the dignified clergy heartily complied the primate of ardmach not only hindered most of his suffragans and inferior clergy from submission but laid a curse on all the people that should own henrys supremacy pretending that as the country had been characterized the the holy island it belonged to none but the bishop of rome and indeed such was the brutish ignorance of both clergy and laity and their zealous attachment to the idolatries and superstitions of rome that they needed no instigation the parliament meeting in a d      confirmed his majestys ecclesiastical as well as civil supremacy and asserted his power to reform heresies errors and other ecclesiastical corruptions and enacted that none should appeal to rome under pain of praemunire that the pope had no authority in ireland that whoever dared to assert or defend his usurped jurisdiction should incur a praemunire that all persons in civil or ecclesiastical offices should swear the oath of supremacy appointed or be liable to the pains of treason that none should slander his majesty or queen or their title under pain of treason that the monasteries be suppressed that clergymen pay their annats or revenues of the first year to the king that the twentieth part of the annual profits belonging to any archbishopric or any other spiritual promotion be yearly paid to him and his successors that no benefices be given to any that cannot speak english unless where such as speak it cannot be got and that if necessity require the admission of one that has only the irish language he shall give his oath that he will do his utmost to learn the english language and observe the english order and teach these under him to do the like and will keep an english school in the parish for that purpose that no peter pence or any other pension or portion be ever hereafter paid to the pope or his agents  lord gray lieutenant by king henrys order labored to force the irish to acknowledge the royal supremacy but though many of them swore the oath few of the native irish intended any real submission the pope instigated by the archbishop of ardmach transmitted an order prohibiting both clergy and laity to acknowledge henrys supremacy and fixing his dreadful eurse upon all such as had done it unless they penitentially confessed their fault within forty days  and requiring them to swear to maintain and defend to the utmost of their power the supremacy of the pope in all things spiritual as well temporal  and all the laws liberties and privileges of the roman church against every opposer and not to obey but oppugn all edicts or commands of heretics made in opposition to the church of rome  and to hold all such as should obey them however near relations or friends accursed  not long after k edward vi came to the throne in      he transmitted orders to ireland which about five years before had been declared a kingdom instead of a lordship that the liturgy and prayers of the church as now translated into english should be used by the clergy there st ledger the lieutenant called an assembly of the clergy and represented to them his majestys order and the reasons of it dowdal of cordmach still opposed and at last withdrew with all his suffragan bishops except the bishop of mead brown of dublin readily complied not long after edward not only required his deputy to propagate the worship of god in the english language but also to get the service translated into the irish language where the english was not understood  on q marys accession to the throne in      the popish religion was reestablished the married clergy were turned out and lancaster bishop of kildare travers of leighlin bale of ossory and casy of limerick being protestants left the country and popish prelates were installed in their room but the rebellious irish scarce allowed the governors any opportunity of persecuting the handful of heretics in that country  q elizabeth having succeeded her sister in      a parliament meeting in the beginning of    0 restored the protestant religion to much the same condition it had been in during the reign of edward vi abolished the popes authority repealed the statutes of mary concerning heresy and declared that nothing should be held such but what had been determined so by express scripture or by the first four or some other general councils  nor any man held guilty of it but on the deposition of two proper witnesses  restored the supreme jurisdiction spiritual as well as temporal to the crown and required that all persons in either civil or ecclesiastical offices should take the oath of supremacy under pain of losing his office  and enacted that there be an uniformity in common prayer as in england and in the consecration of bishops and archbishops that the first fruits or annats and  0th part of spiritual benefices be faithfully paid to the crown that such as maintain the popes or any foreign authority over either church or state should for the first offense lose all his goods or be imprisoned for a year if he had not  0 pounds worth of goods  and also lose his benefice if a clergyman  and should for the second incur a praemunire  and for the third incur the pains of high treason  that such as should speak against the queens right to the crown should incur a praemunire and such as should write against it be held guilty of treason another meeting of parliament some years afterward appointed that as many of the ecclesiastical dignities were enjoyed by the bastards of the popish dignitaries who could not speak the english language but had got in by force simony or the like the lord lieutenant should for ten years have the sole nomination of the most of the inferior clergy in munster and connaught that had not charge of souls and none should be presented unless he were of full age and in church orders and could speak english and would reside at his charge they also enacted that schools should be erected in all the shire towns by the direction of the bishop and sheriffs and their salaries paid by the bishops and their clergy and that the bishops of ardmach dublin mead and kildare should nominate english schoolmasters for their respective dioceses encouraged by pope pius excommunication of elizabeth and his plenary indulgences granted to such as took up arms against her and by the assistance of the spaniards the irish papists more generally than formerly brake out into an open rebellion against her under the earl of tyrone and others which continued about twenty years  the spanish university of valladolid having it seems informed the irish papists that they ought not to obey or assist a protestant king it was not without difficulty that king james could be got proclaimed in ireland and notwithstanding the late submission of tyrone the cities of cork waterford waxford and many others restored the popish religion by force the papists sent over their commissioners to complain of the usage they had met with whom james graciously received and entertained with a long pedantic harangue which not satisfying them they appeared as ready to revolt from their benevolent friend as they had from his haughty and excommunicated predecessor provoked with their behavior james was obliged to think of some new method of restraining them though the english had for more than four hundred and thirty years claimed the government of ireland no more than about a third or fourth part of it in the provinces of leinster and munster or counties of lowth mead dublin and kildare had really been subject to them in the rest of the country crimes could not be punished or taxes levied but by military force and even within their pale the english inhabitants were often terribly harrassed by the irish natives in their neighborhood ulster the largest province of ireland having been possessed by the most rude and ungovernable part of the irish had by means of tyrones obstinate and repeated rebellions been rendered an almost desolate wilderness james having attainted the rebels seized on their lands and ordered them to be distributed to such british protestants as could and would undertake rightly to plant them the difficulties of planting that country country infested by wolves and other wild beasts and by still more barbarous irish papists obliged both james and the undertakers to encourage both scots and english to go thither being persecuted at home not a few of the presbyterians went thither from scotland and of the puritans from england in order to enjoy their liberty of worshipping god according to his own word to encourage them james granted full liberty of conscience to them as well as he did afterward to the planters of new england the chiefs of the established church were far more moderate and kind to the puritans than their courtfavoured brethren in britain loftus archbishop of dublin invited over mr travers who had been persecuted by whitgift of canterbury and in      made him provost of the newly erected college of that city messrs fullerton and hamilton two scotch presbyterians the last of them tutor to the afterward famous bishop usher were two of the first fellows of that college these gave several of the irish doctors and dignitaries a tincture of puritanism the lord deputy who had been a pupil of cartwright at cambridge brought over mr hubart his fellow pupil and fixed him minister at carrickfergus sir john clotworthy entertained messrs ridge and calvert the first of whom was placed at antrim and the other at carrickfergus from scotland mess bryce came to broad island cuningham to holywood dunbar to learn welsh to templepatrick and afterward hamilton to ballywater blair to bangor stewart to dunagor and livingston to killinshie etc etc all of whom though presbyterians enjoyed the established churches and tithes knox bishop of rapho and some others of his brethren were so condescending as to require no more in the ordination of presbyterian ministers than that themselves should be present as ministers to make the deed legal along with such others as the candidates pleased and allowed all the passages of the form of ordination at which these candidates scrupled to be omitted the bishops consulted them about affairs of common concern to the church and some of them were members of the convocation in      at the desire of the bishop of down mr blair preached before the judges of assize on the lords day before his curate administered the sacrament to them they had no presbyteries for the exercise of church discipline but every minister with his session exercised it in his own congregation yet they had a monthly meeting at antrim in which they used to spend two days in praying preaching and religious conference and in devising proper means for the further spread of the gospel and extirpation of popery by their amazing diligence in praying preaching catechizing visiting from house to house observation of solemn fasts and celebration of the lords supper the planters were remarkably reformed their communions which they observed in each congregation at least twice a year were exceedingly crowded and many thousands thereat converted to christ it is said that about a thousand underwent that blessed change at one sacramental occasion  their piety peaceableness and usefulness in reforming the people made archbishop usher and his moderate brethren and the civil governors of the country approve protect and encourage them but no sooner had laud become bishop of london and especially when advanced to be primate of canterbury than he by stirring up enemies against them both in england and ireland labored to ruin them and so weaken the protestant interest in that kingdom messrs livingston blair cunningham ridge bryce hamilton and calvert were deposed by the bishop  they and about   0 others in the end of      failed about  00 leagues for new england but by a dreadful storm were driven back to ireland from whence several of them soon after came to scotland and assisted in the remarkable reformation there in       hitherto the few irish protestants had contented themselves with a practical regard to the thirtynine articles of the english church but the protestant religion being now somewhat established their convocation in      agreed after the manner of other protestant churches to draw up a confession of faith of their own which might at once manifest their principles and mark their independence on the church of england usher then provost of the college of dublin drew it up in  0  articles concerning the scriptures and creeds gods nature persons purposes and works of creation and providence mans fall and natural state of sin and misery christs person and mediation union with him in effectual calling justification and faith  sanctification and good works service and worship of god power of civil magistrates duty to neighbors church and her gospel ministry church authority general councils and bishops of rome state of the old and new testament sacraments baptism and lords supper state of departed souls  resurrection  and last judgment in this confession   the antiarminian articles of lambeth mentioned in our english history are plainly incorporated   the morality of the christian sabbath is strongly asserted and the spending of it wholly in religious exercises is required art      the observation of lent is declared not to be religious but merely for promoting political advantages art  0   the validity of ordination by presbyters is acknowledged art      the power of the keys is said to be only declarative of the will of christ art      the pope is declared antichrist art  0   probably to avoid all distinguishing between bishops and priests no mention is made of the consecration of archbishops or bishops   no power of making canons or of censuring the infringers of them is ascribed to the church  these articles were approved by the irish convocation and parliament and ratified by his majesty k james and his council they appear to have been contrived to compromise the differences between the church and the puritans and they had that effect till by the influence of archbishop laud and the earl of strafford they were set aside in      and those of the church of england adopted in their room  king james had not a little indulged the papists charles i had no sooner come to the throne and married a bigoted papist than they mightily increased and became extremely bold and insolent  being as bishop bedell informed laud about nine parts of ten of the nation and having priests settled in almost every parish while the established clergy not knowing their language were of little or no use in a great part of the island when lord falkland the deputy conveened their chiefs at dublin in      for contributing toward the defense of their country against a spanish invasion they roundly told him that they would contribute nothing unless they got an authoritative toleration and liberty to build religious houses this awakened the protestant bishops to meet and form a solemn protestation bearing that as the religion of papists is superstitious and idolatrous and their church apostatical the granting of them a toleration would be exceedingly sinful as it would involve the granters and approvers in an approbation of all the abominations of popery and in the perdition of these souls that perish thereby and that to grant them it on account of money any way given by them would be to set religion to sale and with it the souls which christ had redeemed by his blood this was signed by archbishop usher and eleven of his fellow bishops and presented to the lord deputy and council this retarded thesr desired toleration they nevertheless became more and more insolent and erected public oratories colleges mass houses and convents their archbishops and other rulers exercised their authority derived from rome and excommunicated such as appeared at the courts of the protestant bishops and even openly said mass in the established churches lord falkland published a proclamation against their conduct but without effect in      they obtained a toleration in consideration of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds to be paid to government within three years  archbishop laud being now chancellor of the university of dublin and having strafford the deputy ready to assist him insisted in the convocation      that for silencing the papists objection of the protestants diversity of principles the thirtynine articles of the english church should be adopted as their ecclesiastical standard the convocation inadvertently complied and even made a canon appointing that whosoever should maintain that any of these articles might not be subscribed by him with a good conscience should be excommunicated  thus they denounced a sentence of excommunication against all the puritans they excluded their own articles which so plainly condemned arminianism and maintained the popes sanctification of the christian sabbath this together with the prosecution of the presbyterian ministers above mentioned by bishop bramhall and others divided weakened and dispirited the protestants while it encouraged the papists in their hopes of speedily carrying all before them no sooner had strafford heard of the scots reformation and their entering into covenant with god in      than he imposed an oath on all scotch men and scotch women promising an unlimited obedience to all his majestys commands and to enter into no oath or covenant without his authority and to renounce all covenants contrary to this oath the dissenters generally refused this oath because it was not imposed by the parliament  they knew that his majesty was bound by his coronation oath to rule his subjects according to the word of god and laws of the land the allegiance promised in it was explained to them as including an observation of all the ceremonies and government of the church established or to be established by his majesty they thought it absurd to swear that they would not enter into a bond of mutual self defense against the papists without his majestys command they saw that it was intended to disgrace or root the scots out of ireland and bound the swearers to renounce and condemn the scotch covenanters protestations and covenants they grudged that it bound them never to resist the king or any commissioned by him they liked it the worse that an army of eight thousand irish papists were sent to force this oath upon them in ulster which obliged the refusers of it to flee into scotland this forced flight was made the mean of their preservation from the subsequent massacre in which most of the compliers not only lost their worldly substance for the sake of which they had defiled their conscience but their lives and the lives of their families  encouraged by laud and strafford bramhall and other highflying bishops and clergymen all along from      to    0 exceedingly distressed the scotch of whom there were then about an hundred thousand and the english puritans in ulster in their petition for redress of grievances presented to the english parliament in    0 they complain that even before they had so much as a pretended canon for their warrant some of the bishops had violently urged the observation of their ceremonies  had silenced several of their most learned and faithful ministers and oppressed others in their courts for noncompliance that in      the convocation had made such canons as enjoined many corruptions in the worship of god and government of his church and which exceedingly retarded the work of reformation encouraged papists and made way for many popish superstitions that their most painful pious and learned ministers had been silenced deprived nay forced to flee the country and afterward excommunicated and some of them lost their lives that while ignorant lazy erroneous profane and cruel men had been obtruded on them for ministers others for scrupling at the new ceremonies or even merely for their holy lives were kept out of office that while faithful ministers were hindered from executing their office or enjoying their benefice bishops held many livings in commendam and conferred four five or six livings on their children or other favorites who were no way capable to take care of souls but hired some pitiful curates as cheap as they could while themselves were permitted to reside where they pleased that while the bishops seldom preached themselves they earnestly suppressed afternoon sermons on the lords day and all weekly lectures so that a lecturing minister is in more danger before them than a popish priest or trafficking jesuit that to prevent faithful and pious scruplers at the ceremonies from being useful in teaching schools they urged on schoolmasters a subscription beyond their canons and excommunicated such as refused it that they favored popery permitted papists to keep schools some of them so large as to resemble universities in which not only languages but also liberal sciences were taught and permitted multitudes of mass priests publicly to celebrate mass and permitted friaries and nunneries in their dioceses that the bishops published or encouraged wicked libels and used profane raileries and cursings etc to render the scots and their late reforming procedure odious that they practiced and encouraged the selling of church censures and sacraments  and by the most base means draw in gain to themselves from old superstitious customs  and will not marry the poor who cannot pay the dues nor suffer their dead to be decently buried  and excommunicated multitudes for not payment of the most unjust or trifling demands that in their high commission court they sat judges in their own and all other causes and terribly oppressed men by fines and imprisonments etc that they not only condemned the scotch covenant of      but had concurred with strafford in imposing an oath for renouncing it in consequence of which many thousands had been hunted out apprehended fined or imprisoned and even women just before childbirth seized threatened and terrified that these bishops and their faction had unjustly seized upon the best lands bereaving almost every gentleman of part of his inheritance that by their own swearing cursing drunkenness and sabbathbreaking and by their having the most profane servants in the kingdom they were a reproach to the gospel and a stumbling block to the papists  in      k charles finding himself obliged to yield to the scots and not a little embroiled with his english parliament by the instigation of his queen appears to have encouraged the papists in ireland to seize the government of that country and then to assist him with an army against the puritans in england or presbyterians in scotland glad of this opportunity the papists encouraged by their clergy resolved on a general massacre of all the protestants in the kingdom without regard to station age sex or relation they laid their scheme and kept their secrets so well that it was in a great measure out of the protestants power who were but about a sixth part of the nation if so much to prevent the execution of it it was discovered by owen oconolly an irishman who being servant to sir john clotworthy had become a presbyterian dissenter by means of which the seizure of dublin was prevented  and the scots in the north of ireland were empowered to take arms against the popish murderers and the lords justices transmitted accounts of their desperate condition unless they should be speedily relieved with men and money to charles and his english parliament notwithstanding his fair pretenses he in many things behaved like one that wished these protestants utter destruction and the papists success in their work and that was exceedingly averse to declare them rebels meanwhile they pushed on their murdering work in the end of october      and afterward in the province of ulster alone    000 are said to have been destroyed in the cruellest forms the day before the massacre began the priests dismissed the people from mass with an encouragement to seize on the property of the protestants and to kill them as a certain preservative against the pains of purgatory when it began the popish gentry persuaded many of their protestant neighbors to bring them their goods and they would preserve them for them and at least secure them a safe retreat from the country having got their goods they next stripped many of them particularly women and children stark naked and turned them out to perish amidst the frost and snow by cold and hunger so many thousands of them died that the living being insufficient to bury them their carcases were heaped up together in large holes of the earth multitudes they sportfully drowned hanged or stabbed to death even after they had given them promises of safe conduct  or had cruelly driven them along pushing them forward with stabs of their swords or bayonets sometimes they dispatched them so quickly by hewing them in pieces or otherwise that they would allow them no time to pray sometimes they shut them up in loathsome dungeons with or without bolts or fetters on their legs that they might languish to death in great misery others they buried alive or hanged up on tenter hooks or dragged them by ropes through waters woods or bogs others particularly  women or children had their bellies ripped up and guts taken or let fall out the unborn babes that fell from their mothers belly they trod under foot gave to their dogs and swine to eat or cast into ditches other infants they held upon the point of their swords that their sprawling might divert them  some they cruelly slashed in their heads faces breasts etc and then left them wallowing in their blood to languish starve and pine to death other they shut up in houses and sportfully burnt them in them or they plucked out their eyes and cut off their hands and then turned them out to wander in the fields till they perished some they decoyed to murder their own parents or to profess themselves papists and then cut their throats or drowned them others they worried with dogs or by ripping up their belly tied one end of their tripes to a tree and drove them round about it till all their bowels were gradually pulled out ln these and many similar forms the protestants were murdered many of their dead bodies were left unburied and especially these of women exposed and abused in the most shameful manner and had candles made of their grease one papist boasted that his hands were so wearied with killing protestants that he could not lift them to his head another that he had killed sixteen of them in a few hours others that they had killed so many that the grease which stuck to their swords might make an irish candle nay two boys boasted that at several times they had murdered    women and children  the popish women were no less ready to instruct excite to or assist their husbands and children in cruelty such bibles as were found were profanely trodden under foot or otherwise destroyed such was the piety and humanity of the papists whom we have lately adopted as our dear friends and children  though the embroiled state of affairs in britain not a little hindered their assisting of the irish protestants yet the scots who took arms in the north assisted by six thousand brave troops from their mother country repressed the papists power in ulster while the english troops under coots and monk gave them several rebuffs in leinster  notwithstanding all that owen roe their great general who had come to their assistance could do to prevent it they who had a little before in their convention labored in planning a form of government for the kingdom were in      disposed to offer their submission to charles a cessation of arms was agreed on for a year which neither pleased the zealous protestants nor the bigoted papists the latter of whom paid little regard to it but went on with their murdering work the popish chiefs represented to their popish queen that if they could obtain a peace to their mind they would assist charles with ten thousand troops against his parliament in england in consequence hereof not ormond lord lieutenant who was too zealous for the protestant church of england but the earl of glamorgan was by charles empowered to conclude a secret treaty of peace with the irish papists while ormond and they were for a sham traveling to establish a public one by this private treaty the papists had the free exercise of their religion and all the churches which they had possessed since      secured to them and were fully freed from all the authority of the episcopal church  notwithstanding these favors the irish were not so ready as charles expected to send over their ten thousand troops to england pretending that they had only bound themselves to assist in transporting them over by sea meanwhile this secret treaty was discovered finding that both english and scots were highly displeased with it charles in his deceitful manner disavowed the solemn commission which he had given to glamorgan and that nobleman was imprisoned by ormond the presbyterians of ulster as well as the whole protestants of munster declared themselves against this infamous peace nor did the irish papists take care to fulfill the conditions of it while duke hamilton and his party in scotland projected their relieving of king charles in      without any limitations of his power ormond by the instigation of the queen and prince of wales now in france concluded a peace with the papists bearing that they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion and enjoy all churches and livings which they now possessed and all jurisdiction respecting them without being required to swear the oath of supremacy to the king that a parliament be held within six months or whenever after the papists desire that all laws and indictments of papists shall be vacated that papists shall be admitted members of parliament and enjoy all honors trusts and employments equally as protestants that not only shall every thing done by papists in the time by past be passed in oblivion but such of them as have had their estates taken from them or wronged by grants since king james came to the throne shall have their grievances redressed and losses refunded that his majesty shall grant whatever is necessary to papists charles himself in a letter to ormond but which came not to his hand till after the treaty was finished disavowed it ormond however probably by private directions from the king or queen made twelve papists sharers with him in his authority that he could neither levy soldiers nor raise money nor erect garrisons without the consent of a majority of them  no wonder that the true protestants in britain and ireland were highly dissatisfied with this treaty since by it these bloody murderers who had filled their skirts with the innocent blood of about two hundred thousand protestants and by rapine treachery and cruelty had laid waste a flourishing kingdom during the last seven years were not only pardoned but well rewarded for their work and their idolatrous and wicked religion had such security given it as it had never before received in ireland the number of these malcontents in ireland was greater than could have been well expected in      the most of the episcopalian clergy were either murdered or had fled into england the scots not only sent over ministers with their troops in      but afterward on applications from ireland sent over in different years a considerable number of presbyterian ministers who labored with remarkable succss in the work of the lord not a few who had fled from straffords persecution returned to ireland as soon as the scotch inhabitants and troops had almost cleared ulster of the popish massacrers these all with great zeal avowed their adherence to the doctrine worship discipline and government represented by the assembly of westminster in the standards which they compiled and entered into the solemn league and covenant for the perpetual maintenance thereof the english parliament required the rest of the protestants in ireland to do the same according to their ordinance for that effect in the kingdom of england in obedience to which not a few took it few of these covenanters perhaps above an hundred thousand in all but were highly dissatisfied with the late treaty of peace  during the preceding years ormond had labored to gain over the parliaments party in ireland particularly their military commanders jones coots monk etc but without success he now labored to unite the several parties in the kingdom for charles ii who from the hague had written him a letter confirming the late peace and continuing him lord lieutenant of ireland he had no success with jones coots and other parliamentarians but he had more success with the scots of ulster who like their fellow presbyterians in britain were many of them infatuated in favor of their royal family and easily imposed upon by charles and his agents fair pretenses sir john clotworthys regiment laid down their arms rather than enter into an army with malignants and popish confederates but these under the lord of ards as well as those commanded by monro who had just returned from scotland whither he had gone to assist in the hamiltonian engagement  joined ormond and turned their arms against their fellow covenanters and took belfast and carrickfergus as the irish presbyterians had renewed their covenant with god about the end of      messrs greig of carrickfergus and cuningham of broad island and other ministers reflected on those that had joined with ormond and his popish confederates  they were therefore threatened by both scotch and irish officers and obliged to flee for their safety this alarming the people the lord of ards now viscount and commander of all his majestys forces in the province of ulster published a declaration representing the reasons of his conduct and many fair promises to take care of their religion and liberties to the utmost of his power as soon as the parliaments forces should be driven out the presbytery of bangor in july      published a counter declaration in which they testify against all compliance with the sectaries on the one hand or with ormond and his malignants and papists on the other but patiently to suffer rather than sin  and faithfully expose the deceit of ards proclamation and warn all that wish to be faithful to their covenant with god to give him and his party no countenance  as the righteous vengeance of god would quickly overtake them which indeed it did within about a month after by the parliaments army ormond had no success with the bigoted papists who were headed by the popes nuncio and who sometimes assisted the parliamentarians against him but they at last obliged him to retire to france and leave the earl of clanrickard general of his majestys army and lieutenant of ireland in his room charles renunciation of his confirmation of the peace and his approbation of the scotch covenant and professed resolution to hold the friends or enemies of it for his friends or enemies made the irish papists lay aside their intentions to push him into his throne they then entered into an agreement with charles iv duke of lorrain to accept of him as their sovereign but their dissatisfaction with clanrickard and the parliaments forces taking their towns one after another put a stop to it their conquest of the country being finished in may      fleetwood ludlow corbet jones and weaver esquires were appointed by the english parliament to command the army and to govern the nation in their name high courts of justice were erected at dublin before which sir phelim oneal the chief manager of the massacre and about   0 others of these murderers were tried condemned and executed  during the following eight years the popish interest was lower than ever it had been in ireland since its first introduction into it multitudes perhaps above an hundred thousand of them fled into france and spain such as remained were generally pent up in connaught the western province of that island while their estates in other places were parcelled out among the conquering troops and other adventurers their very name was reckoned detestable independents anabaptists and others from england went thither and while they labored in propagating the gospel of christ had the peculiar countenance of the government the zeal of the presbyterian clergy for the royal family exposed them to manifold hardships immediately after the execution of king charles i they published a declaration against the actors of it as traitors and murderers from all their pulpits and warned their people to beware of owning their authority when colonel venables came to their country they continued to testify against the usurpations of the sectaries and to pray publicly for the restoration of charles ii to his throne  many of them were therefore imprisoned or forced to flee their houses and walk disguised and to preach in the fields or hills as they and their people when before the council of war at carrickfergus unanimously refused to take the engagement against kingly government an act of banishment was passed against the ministers because they kept alive the interest of the king among the people and reproached those in power as treacherous to his majesty and breakers of covenant no persuasion could prevail with them to present any addresses to cromwell when the most of the three nations did it they would never pray for him nor his underlings or read the causes of their fasts or thanksgivings or observe their days of humiliation because they could not own them as magistrates no encouraging offers or affrighting threatenings of cromwell or his fellow usurpers could detach them from their loyalty to the really profligate but as yet masked charles during their troubles these presbyterian ministers were not a little useful in winning many souls to christ  no sooner did the motions for charles restoration to his throne begin to gain ground than the presbyterian ministers of ireland like their infatuated brethren in britain pushed it on with all their might at first charles entertained them with fair words and a promise of  00 pounds sterling to these ministers that survived and to their widows who had died before his restoration as a reward of their attachment to him during the ten preceding years but he was no sooner fixed on his throne than he and his agents having restored episcopacy and indulged popery expelled them from their churches and persecuted them as well as the independents and anabaptists to their utmost as circumscribed by their indulgence it is probable they had been more cruelly handled had it not been for giving some color to the courtindulgence practically granted to papists these very men who had complied in every thing with cromwell and his sectaries now reproached them as disloyal and treacherous most of the papists that had retired to france or spain now returned they and their brethren expected that as charles had been bred up in their religion and had not long before solemnly professed himself a member of their church they would enjoy the favors granted by the treaty of      above mentioned and every one of them have his lands restored to him which had been given to soldiers or undertakers for the expense of the war by cromwells settlement the english parliament supported cromwells settlement in this matter and ordered such lands only to be restored to the papists as had any flaw in the conveyance the determination of these disputed claims occasioned no small contention between the papists and protestants in consequence of the papists insolence the english parliament in      petitioned his majesty that he would maintain the act of settlement of property in ireland and recall his commission of inquiry granted january last because it includes new powers tending to invalidate that settlement and to occasion many unnecessary lawsuits that he would order that no papist be continued or hereafter admitted to be any kind of judge in that kingdom that he would command all the popish archbishops particularly talbot archbishop of dublin and other dignitaries who exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction by the popes authority to depart out of ireland and all other his dominions and that all convents and other popish seminaries of learning should be dissolved that no irish papist be allowed to dwell in any part of the kingdom without special license and that he would recall his letter of      and the order of council founded thereon which require that none prosecute any of the irish for any thing committed during the last rebellion but this no way hindered the increase of popery the popish plot in england which happened soon after occasioned some severe orders against them but their influence was quickly suspended  james ii had no sooner ascended the throne in      than his popish brethren in ireland hoped to carry every thing before them and in about three or four years committed more insolences upon the english than these had done upon them in five hundred years past they did all they could to inform against such protestants as they suspected to be ill affected to james with respect to their words deeds or meetings the duke of ormond resigned his sword of state to the archbishop of ardmach and the earl of granard though the chief power was really vested in the earl of tyrconnel who being lieutenant of the army modelled his troops so as might best answer his masters designs he was soon after advanced to be lord lieutenant in that station he acted in the most arbitrary and despotic manner he turned the english protestants out of the army in the most reproachful and afflicting manner he could by frequently changing the seven or eight thousand standing troops he got five times that number taught the use of their arms he issued forth quo warrantos against all the charters of the nation at once in order to subvert the corporations and secure a popish parliament popish judges were appointed in each court papists were also appointed high sheriffs and justices of peace and members of privy council so that they were able to rule all wherever they came  james had not long retired to france from before his soninlaw who invaded his kingdom in order to rescue it from his tyrannical oppressions when he landed from thence in ireland with about two thousand staunch british and irish papists to support his interests as king william had greatly overlooked the circumstances of ireland and colonel hamilton had treacherously deserted him and reduced his friends in that country to the very brink of destruction james had here the most promising appearances in his favor all the kingdom except ulster being in obedience to him tyrconnel had ready for him an army of about forty thousand horse and foot had james taken the advice of claverhouse and others of his friends to transport his powerful army to britain he might have shook if not overturned the unsettled authority of his soninlaw  but he chose first to make himself master of every corner of ireland he therefore besieged the remains of the protestant troops in londonderry notwithstanding the cowardice or treachery of lundie their commander and the villainy of general kirk in not making due haste to relieve them  and notwithstanding the dreadful famine they suffered in the siege they held out against the enemy rosen a french general under james provoked by the valor of the besieged now reduced to skeletons with hunger caused his troops to burn every house for ten miles around and to bring all the inhabitants men women and children to him these to the number of six or seven thousand he drove with drawn swords under the walls of the city threatening the besieged that if they did not surrender the place within ten days he would put every one of these poor people to the sword before their eyes this horrid device shocked the besiegers and animated the besieged with a furious valor after these poor creatures had continued two days without any food such as were able were permitted to go away but the destruction or plunder of all that had belonged to them rendered them absolutely miserable  after that about  000 of the besieged had perished with hunger and otherwise and these that remained were sunk with fatigue and had no more than provision for two days they offered to capitulate hereon kirk making a bold attempt to throw in some provisions sent up the river three victualling ships with a man of war to protect them by warmly discharging her guns on the batteries which the enemy had planted on the sides of the river the warship drew their fire on herself meanwhile the foremost of the victuallers having a favorable gale of wind pushed forward with such force as to break the strong iron boom which king james had laid across the river but ran herself aground by the violence of the stroke to the inexpressible grief of the besieged and joy of the besieging beholders but in a few minutes by the rebound of her own discharged guns she got off and along with her two followers got safe into the harbor james and his papists raised the siege next day after continuing it about three months and an half his army under schomberg being unsuccessful king william came over himself to command them  and by his own victory at the river boyne and general ginkles at agrim and the taking of limerick just when the french fleet were ready to relieve it finished the war the limerickers obtained for themselves and their fellow papists very advantageous conditions that without taking any other but the oath of allegiance they should enjoy the same freedom of exercising their religion and the same title to their civil property as under king charles ii their repeated insolence occasioned by the commissioners management of the forfeited estates prompted the parliament of   0  to restrict this act and to appoint that all the estates of papists should be equally divided among their children unless that he to whom they were left took the sacramental test and joined in the communion of the established church but this act has been lately repealed  the protestant dissenters presbyterians independents and others had an authoritative toleration granted them by king williams first parliament  some of the established bishops exceedingly grudged them this liberty and the rather that their number was about double to that of the established church messrs boyse and mbride two of the most bold and faithful dissenting ministers had their share of troublesome prosecution on account of some free speeches they were said to have uttered against episcopacy and its superstitious connexions  by means of influence from england queen annes first parliament imposed the sacramental test on the dissenters as a condition of their admission to any share in the government what trouble any of them endured for refusing this or the oath of abjuration imposed about the same time i know not meanwhile emlyn who had learned the arian tenets in england came over and for eleven years was assistant to mr boyse at dublin where he secretly spread them  notwithstanding all his subtilty he was at last detected by mr boyse and obliged to return to england where till about      he assisted dr clark and jackson to impugn the true divinity of jesus christ in opposition to dr waterland and his orthodox assistants but the infection which he had introduced continued and even spread among the dissenters in ireland and occasioned no small contention between    0 and    0 the synod of ulster in seven several meetings had very warm disputations concerning the propriety of requiring candidates for the ministerial office to declare their adherence to the westminster or any similar confession of faith by subscription or otherwise many other dissenting clergymen who detested the arian blasphemies became tainted with baxterian and arminian errors attended with not a little looseness of practice offended herewith not a few of their presbyterian hearers soon after the deposition of the seceding ministers in scotland by the assembly    0 applied to them for the supply of evangelical preaching and other ministrations in consequence of which there are now about fifty or sixty seceding congregations in that kingdom especially in the province of ulster of about four and twenty hundred thousand inhabitants in ireland it is said that about two thirds only are now professed papists and the other eight hundred thousand protestants but i fear scarce the half of these deserve the protestant name  brief sketch of the history of the protestant churches in america it is probable that america was for the most part peopled from the eastern parts of asia  but when columbus in a d      first discovered that country there did not appear in it the smallest vestiges of the gospel of christ nor did the spaniards murdering of about fifty millions of the inhabitants in the least instruct them in or attach them to it elizabeth and james cruel persecution of the english puritans obliged part of them to flee to holland and afterward to america where they landed in the country since called new england  finding that their independent congregation was like to dwindle to nothing in holland part of mr robinsons people after a solemn fast and much fervent prayer first set sail for america in two ships and after terrible distress by the way occasioned by the treachery of the shipmasters and the bad weather they at last in nov    0 arrived to the number of about an hundred having lost one of their ships in the place to which providence directed them contrary to their own inclinations god had prepared room for them by a plague which in the preceding year had carried off about nine tenths of the inhabitants but the fatigue of their voyage and the severity of the winter cut off not a few of them some others of them were killed by the savage natives it was not till midsummer that supply came to them from england the season being very untoward their first crop was bad contentions kindled by incendiaries among themselves added to their misery in expectation of mr robinson and the rest of his congregation following them they had no minister among them for eight years but mr brewster who had been ruling elder of their church at leyden preached visited and examined them and at their week day meetings some of the elder brethren prayed and expounded some portion of scripture to the rest  hearing of mr robinsons death they in      chose and ordained for their pastor one mr ralph smith by fasting and laying on of the hands of the elders except their placing the supreme government of the church in the community of the faithful under christ and holding every particular congregation for an entire christian church independent of their presbytery or synod their principles were the same with those contained in the westminster confession of faith directory for worship and form of church government they admitted such as were communicants in the french dutch and scotch churches to communion with them  in      mr conant and his friends instigated by mr white of dorchester retired to america and in      got a royal patent for so much of the country they after some consultation and solemn covenanting with god and with one another to avouch the lord for their god and to walk soberly righteously and godly before him and to be obedient to their superiors in both church and state and to train up their children and servants in the knowledge and fear of the lord  joined together and chose mr skeleton for their pastor mr higginson for their teacher and mr houghton for their ruling elder  who were ordained to their offices by prayer and laying on of the hands of these appointed to represent the brethren meanwhile some prelatists and one christopher gardener a disguised papist gave them some trouble and misrepresented them in england messrs wilson cotton hooker stone mather and seventytwo other ministers who had fled from the persecution in england had all settlements and some of them numerous flocks of the persecuted people who had come along with them as early as      about twenty others had not got settlements or had been turned out for their ill behavior or for their episcopalian and anabaptist principles the harvard college for the education of youth in all the literal arts was erected at newtown or cambridge about six or eight miles from boston and soon after furnished with a valuable library meanwhile their state had no small trouble with the indian savages in their neighborhood and their church no less with the antinomian and familistical errors that sprung up among them the male members of the church at boston used to meet once a week to repeat the sermons they heard on the lords day and to debate on their contents as none of the women were allowed to mingle in these debates some of them resolved on having separate meetings of their own  mrs hutchinson having set up one at her house had soon sixty or eighty women at her weekly meeting to hear her pray and repeat and explain mr cottons sermons under pretense of exalting the free grace of god she taught her disciples that believers in christ are personally united with the holy ghost that commands to work out our salvation with fear and trembling belong only to unbelievers that sanctification is not a sufficient evidence of a gracious state that believers have immediate revelations concerning future events as infallible as the scriptures themselves etc the women readily embraced these notions and insinuated them into their husbands as the doctrines of mr cotton such as continued otherwise minded were reproached as legalists and the old ministers were starved away and mechanics set up in their room violent struggles were made to have new fashioned gospellers for the only magistrates and officers in their armies  mrs hutchisons modest behavior before mr cotton and his too charitable opinion of her rendered him too tardy in opposing her seductions but both church and state being like to be thereby ruined a synod for consultation and advice composed of ministers and messengers of the churches and some magistrates was held at newtown in august      during three weeks and after hearing all that the antinomians could say about eighty of their opinions were unanimously condemned excepting that mr cotton differed at least in words from his brethren on three or four of them but mrs hutchison and her followers so insolently opposed the determination of the synod that it was found necessary for both church and state to exert themselves in repressing them  the civil war breaking out in england the puritans got liberty at home and the colonies of new england for twenty years instead of receiving new recruits lost a number of their gentlemen together with mess samuel mather giles furmin hugh peters and nine other ministers who returned to england  the planters who had already built fifty towns and villages and thirty or forty churches etc resolved to seize on the islands on the coast and propagate the gospel among the natives they also granted three of their ministers to the virginians but the governor ordered them to leave the country unless they would conform to the english ceremonies a war with the indians quickly issued in a treaty of peace and in a more close confederation of the four colonies of new england about      mr elliot in the province of massachusett and mr mayhew in marthas vineyard applied themselves to the instruction of the indians with an amazing assiduity and zeal and were instrumental in converting several thousands of them to christ elliot translated the bible catechisms and some other practical books into the language of his indians the english parliament      established a corporation of sixteen for the propagation of the gospel in new england and appointed a collection for that purpose which enabled the society to purchase an estate of five or six hundred pounds sterling yearly rent bedinfield a papist from whom they bought it after charles restoration seized upon it but the society now increased to the number of    with no small trouble recovered it  with the rent of which and with the large collections gathered in new england they have been sometimes able to maintain ten missionaries and to erect schools and educate indian children it is to be lamented that for some time past part of the money is too readily applied for supporting naughty episcopalian ministers in that country and that any american missionaries that appear bent on winning souls to christ are so much opposed and discouraged by the english planters and merchants  the second synod of new england met at cambridge in      and approved the westminster confession of faith their chief work was to frame a platform of church discipline in this they assert that all the parts of church government are exactly described in the word of god and no man may add diminish or alter any thing in it that even circumstances of time and place must be regulated by the apostolical prescription of doing all things decently and in order that the catholic church comprehends all elected and redeemed men that though the state of the visible militant church under the law was national it is now under the gospel only congregational that a congregational church consists of a company of saints by calling united into one body by an holy covenant for the public worship of god and mutual edification of one another in the fellowship of christ or consists of such as understand the principles of religion profess their repentance and faith in christ and walk in blameless obedience to all his commands that every particular church has a ministry appointed for its particular service and no other and the members ought never to be more than can conveniently meet in one place nor fewer than carry on church work that the form of a particular visible church is that covenant by which they give up themselves to the lord christ to observe his ordinances in the same society that all believers ought to join themselves as they have opportunity to some particular church that they may profess their subjection to the order and ordinances of the gospel that the supreme power over the church belongs to christ power of office to the eldership and power of privilege and appointing to office to the brotherhood that church officers are appointed by christ as necessary to the wellbeing of his church till the end of the world  and are either extraordinary as apostles prophets evangelists or ordinary as elders teaching and ruling and deacons that pastors and teachers are distinct officers but both are to administer sacraments and church censures that ancient widows ought to minister in the church in attending on the sick that none should be ordained officers in the church without sufficient trial and the power of election as well as deposition is in that particular church in which they serve that the church ought not only to choose but by laying on of hands ordain their officers  that election constitutes one a church officer and ordination does but solemnly admit him to his work the laying on of hands is to be performed by the elders of that church or other elders desired by them or by some of the brethren chosen for that purpose that if any officer be discharged from his office in his own church he may not exercise it in any other until he be again called to office and be reordained that the power granted to the brotherhood lies in their admitting members choosing and deposing officers and in determining differences  and the power of the elders to feed and rule the church conveen them on proper occasions preside and keep order in debates examine officers and members in order to admission receive accusations pronounce sentences and bless the people in the name of the lord that as it is the duty of people decently to support their ministers deacons and magistrates ought to see to their doing it that in order to admission to be church members they be examined concerning their faith and repentance and profess the same  but if they be unable to declare the work of god on their souls before the church it may suffice to do it before the elders who may relate it before the church that members may not remove from any particular church without her consent unless where duty safety or subsistence render it absolutely necessary that in offenses originally private one is only to be excommunicated if obstinately deaf to private dealings and admonition of the church but if the offense be of a very heinous and public nature he is to be excommunicated at once that excommunication does not deprive men of their civil offices or rights nor exclude them from hearing the word or occasional admonitions that none should withdraw from the communion of a church because some disorderly persons cannot be removed out of it that sister churches should care for consult with admonish and hold occasional fellowship with one another and when a church becomes too numerous it ought to form another of such members as are willing to remove that synods composed of elders and messengers of churches are very often necessary to the well being of churches  to debate and determine controversies of faith and cases of conscience  to give directions from the word of god in worship and government  and to bear witness against corruption of manners and maladministration  but they are not to inflict any censure or make any authoritative act that such synods may be called either by the churches themselves or by the magistrate that magistrates may not compel their subjects to become church members or partake of sacraments nor meddle with any work proper to church officers that magistrates ought to restrain and punish not only dishonesty murder and the like but also idolatry blasphemy heresy open profanation of the sabbath contempt of the word or disturbance of the worship of god or even schismatical disturbance of churches some of these rules have been long disused ministers have administered the sacraments to vacant churches only the neighboring ministers lay on hands at ordinations none are required publicly to declare the work of god upon their soul and ruling elders are generally dropped  for supporting religion and virtue of every kind a set of the most excellent civil laws were gradually established  some falling into the anabaptist opinions about    0 and setting up a separate meeting gave both the churches and magistrates no small trouble and loaded them with plenty of contempt some of the quakers arriving from england in      were still more troublesome nor could the cutting off of their ears or banishment restrain their seditious conduct two of them were put to death on account of their obstinate refusal to comply with their sentence of banishment this drew upon the magistrates a torrent of obloquy and obliged them to publish a vindication of themselves which was not universally approved the magistrates therefore resolved to execute no more of the turbulent quakers but to whip them as vagabonds out of their jurisdiction k charles also transmitted an order in      that put an end to the prosecution of quakers for their public blasphemies and profanities such as womens running naked through the streets or into assemblies met for worship and abusing and threatening magistrates etc  as the ministers baptized none but the children of their own members many children of such as had not joined themselves to any church remained unbaptized there arose a warm debate whether children had a right to baptism by their grandparents being church members though their immediate parents had never entered into communion a synod met by order of the magistrates to consider this question they were mostly of opinion that the children of church members are under the care and government of the church and liable to her censures though not admittable to the lords supper or to have their children baptized till they have solemnly joined themselves to the church but if they appeared to have been properly qualified but were hindered by death or some other extraordinary providence from publicly joining themselves to a church their children were to be baptized this decision was not a little opposed especially by davenport who succeeded the pious and peaceable mr wilson at boston in this same year      fourteen ministers who had been driven from their charges in england came over hither and labored in the work of the lord in place of those that had come over above twenty years before most of whom were now dead  an uncommon meteor in the form of a spear and some other incidents stirred up the magistrates in      to issue an exhortatory letter to the ministers begging of them to be more and more diligent in their visitation of families and in training up of the youth  which by the blessing of god proved effectual for the restraining of vice and immorality  and for keeping alive the dying power of religion among the rising generation the severity of the magistrates against the anabaptists who had gathered one church at boston and another at swanzey drew a remonstratory letter from drs goodwin owen and eleven others of the independent clergy in england but it had but little effect some few of the quakers being punished for their disorderly practices their friends in england presented a remonstrance to the king and parliament in which they without any regard to truth exceedingly aggravated their sufferings eleven of the principal presbyterian independent and anabaptist ministers also wrote a letter to a minister of boston in their favor after all the quakers then and since had no reason to complain of severities but what they drew upon themselves by refusing to pay the fines imposed for not attending the military exercises on four training days a year with arms and ammunition or not assisting in the military watches kept in the towns or not paying the stipends annexed to the estates which they held they wanted to enjoy the protection of government but refused to do any thing for the support of it  for about forty years the people of new england had met with little disturbance from their indian neighbors but at last in      a most bloody war with philip king of the wompanoags commenced and continued almost two years till philip was betrayed and killed in this war the christianized indians proved remarkably faithful in assisting the english no sooner was the war ended than the people gave over their solemnities of fasting and prayer and many began to grow intolerably licentious in their morals  pride intemperance swearing sabbath breaking and covetousness came to an uncommon height the general court of the massachusetts called a synod to meet at boston for preventing the further growth of this impiety and profaneness  they agreed that ministers and magistrates in their different stations should labor to their utmost in order to reform the country from these vices and they recognized and confirmed their forementioned platform of church discipline  after new hampshire had been separated from the massachusetts by the influence of one mason who quickly employed in his new government persons mean base or of desperate fortunes who assisted him in oppressing the people king charles in      took their charters from the colonies of massachusett plymouth and connecticut while that of rhode island peaceably submitted to his pleasure thus the whole country had their ancient constitution destroyed and was made absolutely dependent on the crown of england this with another indian war of ten or rather fourteen years continuance and the cruel oppressions of ardross their governor brought the country to the brink of ruin but king william coming to the british throne the people took arms against their oppressors and got themselves reestablished in their wonted privileges excepting that the king in their new charter reserved for himself the appointment of their principal governors and for his governor the whole power of the militia and of appointing justices and sheriffs with the consent of his council together with a negative upon all laws elections and acts of government of the general assembly and council  and all laws made by the general assembly and approved by the governor were to be transmitted to his majesty for his approbation the colonies were far from being pleased with these encroachments on their liberties but judged it best to submit about the same time their ministers of the independent and presbyterian persuasions having considered the articles of agreement between their english brethren of these denominations in    0 adopted the same and have ever since lived together in considerable peace and friendship upon the footing thereof  dreadful was the distress of new england in      for while the french and indians were ravaging the frontiers the inhabitants were hanging one another for suspected witchcrafts and sorceries the daughter and niece of the reverend mr paris of salem girls about ten years of age suddenly began to play unaccountable pranks and to fall into convulsion fits and to be struck dumb and have their mouth and limbs strangely distorted and to complain of being bitten and pinched by invisible agents and particularly of being pinched pricked and tormented by an indian woman that lived in the house and two other women in the town as the physicians could not account for the distemper it was soon blazed abroad that they were bewitched and mr paris kept several days of fasting and prayer on their account the women accused were called before the magistrate examined and imprisoned the indian frightened out of her wits and forcibly instigated by her master confessed herself to be guilty and accused the other women as her partners in the witchcraft the contagion like a pestilence spread through several parts of the province till the prisons could scarcely contain the number of the accused the afflicted had their bodies horribly distorted  pinched black and blue  blisters raised upon them or pins run into them they pretended to see the shapes of the persons who tormented them while others around did not probably part of these afflicting appearances were counterfeited but i cannot possibly conceive how they all could be so or produced by natural causes the witnesses deponed many odd things respecting the accused as they that confessed themselves witches or wizards and accused others were ordinarily spared no doubt severals were hereby as well as by the confounding tediousness of their examinations and sometimes tortures led to confess themselves guilty when they were not an assembly of ministers summoned by the governor in june declared themselves of opinion that considering the power and craft of satan apparitions of persons afflicting others or alterations made on the afflicted by a look or touch of the accused were no proofs of their being witches and that a good name obtained by a good life ought not to be forfeited by mere spectral accusations  but this declaration was too little regarded twentyeight were condemned to death and nineteen of them executed all of whom died protesting their innocence  the number of the confessing witches who accused others to save themselves now amounting to fifty and the afflicted overdoing their part people began to fear every one for himself and his friends they who had a little before been in danger of being torn to pieces by the mob or had been put to death especially such as had died with remarkable appearances of seriousness were universally pitied prosecutions were stopped and about   0 relieved from their imprisonment one of the judges and the twelve jurymen publicly acknowledged their mistake in the prosecution mr paris who had begun and zealously promoted it acknowledged his sin and begged pardon of god and men but nothing less than his removal from them would satisfy his congregation it was certainly faulty that the accusers were not strictly tried and brought to condign punishment  since the beginning of this century except as to a gradual decay of the power and even of the appearances of religion the church in new england has continued on much the same footing independents connected with half presbyterians compose their established church but episcopalians anabaptists and quakers are freely tolerated by the ministrations of messrs jonathan edwards george whitefield gilbert tennent and others very remarkable impressions were made on the souls and even on the bodies of multitudes in      and    0 this many highly extolled as an extraordinary work of the spirit of god while others decried it as a delusion of satan it is certain that the imprudence and error of some of the ministers and especially of the illiterate exhorters who promoted it and their rash censures of others and their pretenses to visions prophecy and absolute perfection in holiness and other extravagancies  and the sudden return of multitudes of the subjects of these impressions to their wonted or greater abominations tended much to essen the credit of it the truly great mr edwards seems to have been at last convinced that thre was a sad mixture of delusion incorporated with or joined to it at present i do not know that the state of the church in new england is much preferable to that in britain about    0 the province of massachusett contained about  00 english congregations and  0 indian ones  of all which not above three or four followed the forms of the english church  another revival of religion is said to have taken place in it of late there are about seven or eight hundred churches in new england of which thirtysix are episcopalian and not a few presbyterian  the province of new york continued in the hands of the dutch from a d   0  to      when the english took it from them about      king james gave order for admission of the french missionaries from canada into it in order to convert the inhabitants to popery but dungan the popish governor perceiving that these missionaries would decoy the people into the french interest commanded them to leave the country since which though that of the church of england has had a sort of establishment yet not only the dutch and swedes who continued in the country but all others except papists have been here tolerated in the free exercise of their religion whether lutherans calvinists presbyterians independents baptists etc  new jersey was taken from the dutch about the same time with new york james duke of york being constituted principal proprietor perhaps for a trial of what might be expected from his like conduct in britain  indulged if he did not encourage papists rigid episcopalians quakers presbyterians independents and baptists to become proprietors and settlers in it notwithstanding the encouragement given to the episcopalians from england the far greater part continued to profess themselves of the other denominations while the dutch and swedes persevered in their own forms  pennsylvania so called from penn the famous quaker to whom king charles granted it in      has all along had quakerism for its established religion as the greatest part of the inhabitants at least of the proprietors have professed their adherence to that but to invite others to settle among them penn and his council made it the first fundamental article of their constitution that every man should have an unlimited freedom to worship god in what manner he thought best providing that he did not disturb or injure his neighbors in their civil property hence lutherans from sweden and germany dutch and scotch presbyterians independents moravians episcopalians  and dunkards whose men and women live in separate communities much like the popish monks and nuns but in a much more decent laborious simple and inoffensive manner have all their full liberty the episcopalians have not many churches here but it is said that some of their congregations particularly that in philadelphia is exceedingly large it is said that presbyterians have near  00 congregations in this country near to philadelphia is the flourishing college of new jersey of which davis dickinson burr edwards etc have been the respectable presidents  maryland began to be possessed by lord baltimore and his popish friends from britain about      hence many of the inhabitants continued adhering to the romish church his successor in      got the assembly of the province to enact that christians of every denomination should be allowed the free exercise of their own religion but by a division of the province in      into thirty parishes sixteen of which were settled with episcopalian clergy from england and by dr brays transmitting thither a number of practical protestant books the prelatica party became the most powerful and a kind of established church  virginia had its plantation with english begun by sir walter raleigh about      it had its name from queen elizabeth but has always made a poor figure in religion about forty years ago it was divided into    parishes of the form of the church of england and had only two presbyterian and three quaker meetings  carolina about a d      began to be peopled with some who had fled from the frontiers of virginia and new england to avoid being massacred by the neighboring savages these it is said drew over sundry of the natives to embrace the christian religion in      lord clarendon and some other englishmen of rank obtained a grant of it from king charles ii as sundry of these were no friends to the english act of uniformity they to encourage people to settle on their lands agreed that dissenters should not there be obliged to approve or submit to the government or worship of the english church lock who drew up the original constitutions for this province took care therein to secure full freedom not only for all scrupulous protestants but even for jews and heathens but meanwhile to require every one above seventeen years of age to join himself to some particular worshipping society under pain of forfeiting all the protection of law  about   0  the governor and his council enacted that none should be admitted into office without taking the sacramental test and conforming to the english church but such loud complaints of this imposition were transmitted to queen anne and her lords that it was dropped as contrary to the original constitution of the colony about      a colony of  00 swisse protestants settled here as one of scots had done sometime before and another of vaudois did soon after about the same time also a number of the twenty thousand saltzburgers who had left their own german dwellings to enjoy freedom of conscience settled here while others of them fixed their residence in georgia all these after some contention with the quakers and episcopalians etc lived peaceably together  georgia did not begin to be occupied by the english till a d      the first settlers were generally of the english church messrs j wesley and g whitefield had charges here which they forsook and commenced itinerant preachers in britain and america dissenters of every denomination have had much the same freedom here as in other colonies  it is said that archbishop secker had formed a plan to bring all these colonies under the yoke of the english church but his death and the late war prevented it mr whitefields orphan house is now a thriving seminary of learning  in which and the episcopalian colleges of virginia and new york not a few are educated in the liberal sciences but for ought i know divinity is much overlooked  in these parts which still pertain to britain popery is properly the established religion in canada the french inhabitants of nova scotia still adhere to their popish idolatries while the protestants are allowed to choose their ministers of any denomination they please the islands or west indies are under the inspection of the bishop of london as most of the english provinces of america lately were but i cannot find that the bulk of the inhabitants deserve to be ranked in any denomination of christians any more than those pertaining to britain in the east indies  nay their ignorance of and inattention to every spiritual and eternal concern  their atheistical neglect of gods worship and profanation of his name and sabbath  their whoredom and other uncleanness  their robbery murder and cruel enslaving especially of the poor heathens  render the most of them a disgrace to human nature  the british parliament had scarcely established the antichristian abominations in their lately conquered province of canada when god began to tear from them thirteen of those american provinces which they had formerly governed and which contain about three millions of inhabitants  having procured their independence by antichristian assistance these provinces in their new constitutions of government have generally placed jesus christ and his adversary the devil on an equal footing in giving the same establishment to the delutions errors blasphemies superstitions and idolatries invented by the one as to the infinitely precious truths declared and the true worship of god appointed by the other only the constitution of the massachusetts and of the two carolinas appear to restrict their establishment to such things as these called protestants have adopted under the notion or religious sentiments or practices and merely to tolerate papists etc  about    0 both seceders and old dissenters in consequence of repeated applications began to send their respective missionaries to america which issued in the settlement of a considerable number of their ministers there particularly in the province of new york jerseys and pennsylvania after these had long acted in three separate communions answerable to the state of their connexions in britain they having observed that their subjection to judicatures in britain did rather involve them in dry local controversies which were improper to affect the communion of saints in america if any where especially after its becoming independent on the civil government of britain than do them any service  did in      agree to unite in one body under one synod on the following terms viz that they should cleave to the westminster confession of faith larger and shorter catechisms directory for worship and form of church government as their ecclesiastical standards except that they left these articles in the confession which respect magistrates power about religious matters to a future candid examination that they approved the british covenants of their fathers with god and with one another and all other regular contendings and testimonies to the truths of christ in the present and preceding ages and resolve to prosecute the ends therefore as far as their circumstances allow that while they continue to honor their brethren in britain and ireland they resolve to drop all disputes relative to burgess oaths in scotland or requisites to the legaly of british magistrates that their terms of fixed church fellowship shall be soundness in the christian faith submission to the government and discipline of the church and a holy conversation and that none shall be either deposed or excommunicated but for gross errors or practical violations of gods law that though for preventing disorderly confusions it be requisite that they use great caution with respect to occasional communion with these christians that are not embodied with them yet they reckon it their duty to treat the godly of other denominations with great attention and tenderness  and particularly to be very cautious in admitting either persons or societies which had belonged to their fellow presbyterians in the country to any fixed communion with them  they have since composed a formula of questions to be put to ministers elders and deacons at their ordination to their office in answering which they must declare their approbation of their above mentioned constitutional articles which are to be always read on such occasions  and promise te adhere thereto in opposition to all deistical popish arian socinian arminian neonomian and sectarian and other errors which are contrary to sound doctrine and the power of godliness  that they will meekly submit to the admonitions of brethren and not follow any divisive courses either by complying with the defections of the times or giving up themselves to a detestable neutrality in the cause of god  that zeal for the glory of god and the edification of souls are their principal motives inducing them to accept their office  that they hava used no undue methods to procure their call to it  that they will study an holy and exemplary conversation in their personal family and official conduct  and that they will faithfully and diligently perform all the duties pertaining to their respective offices  they have also enacted several rules for the right ordering of their synod presbyteries and sessions  the end
