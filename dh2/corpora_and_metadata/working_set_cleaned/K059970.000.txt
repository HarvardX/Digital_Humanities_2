everybodys business is nobodys business  everybodys business is nobodys business or private abuses public grievances exemplified in the pride insolence and exorbitant wages of our womenservants footmen etc  with a proposal for amendment of the same as also for clearing the streets of those vermin called shoecleaners and substituting in their stead many thousands of industrious poor now ready to starve with diverse other hints of great use to the public  humbly submitted to the consideration of our legislature and the careful perusal of all masters and mistresses of families  by andrew moreton esquire  london sold by t warner at the black boy in paternoster row a dodd without temple bar and e nutt at the royal exchange      price six pence  everybodys business is nobodys business this is a proverb so common in everybodys mouth that i wonder nobody has yet thought it worth while to draw proper inferences from it and expose those little abuses which though they seem trifling and as it were scarce worth consideration yet by insensible degrees they may become of injurious consequence to the public like some diseases whose first symptoms are only trifling disorders yet by continuance and progression their last periods terminate in the destruction of the whole humane fabric  in contradiction therefore to this general rule and out of sincere love and wellmeaning to the public give me leave to enumerate the abuses insensibly crept in among us and the inconveniences daily arising from the insolence and intrigues of our servant wenches who by their caballing together have made their party so considerable that everybody cries out against em and yet to verify the proverb nobody has thought of or at least proposed a remedy although such an undertaking mean as it seems to be i hope will one day be thought worthy the consideration of our king lords and commons  women servants are now so scarce that from  0 and  0 shillings a year their wages are increased of late to     and   pounds per annum and upwards insomuch that an ordinary tradesman cannot well keep one but his wife who might be useful in his shop or business must do the drudgery of household affairs and all this because our servant wenches are so puffed up with pride now a days that they never think they go fine enough it is a hard matter to know the mistress from the maid by their dress nay very often the maid shall be much the finer of the two our woollen manufacture suffers much by this for now nothing but silks and sattins will go down with our kitchen wenches and it is to support this intolerable pride that they have insensibly raised their wages to such a height as was never known in any age or nation but this  let us trace this from the beginning and suppose a person has a servant maid sent him out of the country at  0 shillings or   pounds a year the girl has scarce been a week nay a day in her service but a committee of servant wenches are appointed to examine her who advise her to raise her wages or give warning to encourage her to which the herbwoman or chandlerwoman or some other old intelligencer provides her a place of   or   pounds a year this sets madam cockahoop and she thinks of nothing now but vails and high wages and so gives warning from place to place till she has got her wages up to the tiptop  her neats leathern shoes are now transformed into laced shoes with high heels her yarn stockings are turned into fine worsted ones with silk clocks and her high wooden pattens are kicked away for leathern clogs she must have a hoop too as well as her mistress and her poor scanty linseywoolsey petticoat is changed into a good silk one   or   yards wide at the least not to carry the description farther in short plain country joan is now turned into a fine londonmadam can drink tea take snuff and carry her self as high as the best  if she is tollerably handsome and has any share of cunning the apprentice or her masters son is enticed away and ruined by her thus many good families are impoverished and disgraced by these pert sluts who taking the advantage of a young mans simplicity and unruly desires draw many heedless youths nay some of good estates into their snares and of this we have but too many instances  some more artful shall conceal their condition and palm themselves on young fellows for gentlewomen and great fortunes how many families have been ruined by these ladies when the father or master of the family preferring the flirting airs of a young wanton prinkt up strumpet to the artless sincerity of a plain grave and good wife has given his desires aloose and destroyed soul body family and estate but they are very favorable if they wheedle nobody into matrimony but only make a present of a small live creature no bigger than a bastard to some of the family no matter who gets it when a child is born it must be kept  our sessions papers of late are crowded with instances of servant maids robbing their places this can be only attributed to their devilish pride for their whole enquiry now a days is how little they shall do how much they shall have  but all this while they make so little reserve that if they fall sick the parish must keep em if they are out of place they must prostitute their bodies or starve so that from chopping and changing they generally proceed to whoring and thieving and this is the reason why our streets swarm with strumpets  thus many of em rove from place to place from bawdy house to service and from service to bawdy house again ever unsettled and never easy nothing being more common than to find these creatures one week in a good family and the next in a brothel this amphibious life makes em fit for neither for if the bawd uses them ill away they trip to service and if their mistress gives em a wry word whip they are at a bawdy house again so that in effect they neither make good whores or good servants  those who are not thus slippery in the tail are light of finger and of these the most pernicious are those who beggar you inchmeal if a maid is a downright thief she strips you at once and you know your loss but your retail pilferers waste you insensibly and though you hardly miss it yet your substance shall decay to such a degree that you must have a very good bottom indeed not to feel the ill effects of such moths in your family  tea sugar wine etc or any such trifling commodities are reckoned no thefts if they do not directly take your pewter from your shelf or your linen from your drawers they are very honest what harm is there say they in cribbing a little matter for a junket or a merry bout or so nay there are those that when they are sent to market for one joint of meat shall take up two on their masters account and leave one by the way for some of these maids are very charitable and can make a shift to maintain a small family with what they can purloin from their masters and mistresses  if you send em with ready money they turn factors and take   d or   d in the shilling brokeridge and here let me take notice of one very heinous abuse not to say petty felony which is practiced in most of the great families about town and that is when the tradesmen gives the housekeeper or other commanding servant a penny or two pence in the shilling or so much in the pound for every thing they send in which from thence is called poundage  this in my opinion is the greatest of villainies and ought to incur some punishment yet nothing is more common and our topping tradesmen who seem otherwise to stand mightily on their credit make this but a matter of course and custom if i dont says one another will for the servant is sure to pick a hole in the persons coat who shall not pay contribution thus this wicked practice is carried on and winked at while receiving of stolen goods and confederating with felons which is not a jot worse is so openly cried out against and so severely punished  and yet if a master or mistress enquire after any thing missing they must be sure to place their words in due form or madam huffs and flings about at a strange rate what would you make a thief of her who would live with such mistrustful folks thus you are obliged to hold your tongue and sit down quietly by your loss for fear of offending your maid forsooth  again if your maid shall maintain one two or more persons from your table whether they are her poor relations country folk or servants out of place or whether they are shoecleaners charewomen porters or any other of her menial servants who do her ladyships drudgery and go of her errands you must not grumble or complain at your expense or ask what is become of such a thing or such a thing although it might never so reasonably be supposed that it was altogether impossible to have so much expended in your family but hold your tongue for peace sake or madam will say you grudge her victuals and expose you to the last degree all over the neighborhood  thus have they a salve for every sore cheat you to your face and insult you into the bargain nor can you help your self without exposing yourself or putting yourself into a passion  another great abuse crept in among us is the giving of vails to servants this was intended originally as an encouragement to willing and handy servants but by custom and corruption it is now grown to be a thorn in our sides and like other good things abused does more hurt than good for now they make it a perquisite a material part of their wages nor must their master give a supper but the maid expects the guests should pay for it nay sometimes through the nose thus have they spirited people up to this unnecessary and burdensome piece of generosity unknown to our forefathers who only gave gifts to servants at christmasstide which custom is yet kept up into the bargain insomuch that a maid shall have   pounds per annum in a gentlemans or merchants family and if her master is a man of a free spirit and receives much company she very often doubles her wages by her vails thus having meat drink washing and lodging for her labor she throws her whole income upon her back and by this means looks more like the mistress of the family than the servantwench  and now we have mentioned washing i would ask some good housewifely gentlewomen if servantmaids wearing printed linnens cottons and other things of that nature which require frequent washing do not by enhauncing the article of soap add more to housekeeping than the generality of people would imagine and yet these wenches cry out against great washes when their own unnecessary dabs are very often the occasion  but the greatest abuse of all is that these creatures are become their own lawgivers nay i think they are ours too though nobody would imagine that such a set of slatterns should bamboozle a whole nation but it is neither better or worse they hire themselves to you by their own rule  that is a months wages or a months warning if they dont like you they will go away the next day help yourself how you can if you dont like them you must give them a months wages to get rid of them  this custom of warning as practiced by our maidservants is now become a great inconvenience to masters and mistresses you must carry your dish very upright or miss forsooth gives you warning and you are either left destitute or to seek for a servant so that generally speaking you are seldom or never fixed but always at the mercy of every new servant to divulge your familyaffairs to inspect your private life and treasure up the sayings of yourself and friends a very great confinement and much complained of in most families  thus have these wenches by their continual plotting and cabals united themselves into a formidable body and got the whiphand of their betters they make their own terms with us and two servants now will scarce undertake the work which one might perform with ease yet notwithstanding they have raised their wages to a most exorbitant pitch and i doubt not if there be not a stop put to their career but they will bring wages up to twenty pounds per annum in time for they are much about half way already  it is by these means they run away with a great part of our money which might be better employed in trade and what is worse by their insolent behavior their pride in dress and their exorbitant wages they give birth to the following inconveniences  first they set an ill example to our children our apprentices our covenantservants and other dependants by their saucy and insolent behavior their pert and sometimes abusive answers their daring defiance of correction and many other insolences which youth are but too apt to imitate    dly by their extravagance in dress they put our wives and daughters upon yet greater excesses because they will as indeed they ought go finer than the maid thus the maid striving to outdo the mistress the tradesmans wife to outdo the gentlemans wife the gentlemans wife emulating the lady and the ladies one another it seems as if the whole business of the female sex were nothing but excess of pride and extravagance in dress    dly the great height to which womenservants have brought their wages makes a mutiny among the menservants and puts them upon raising their wages too so that in a little time our servants will become our partners nay probably run away with the better part of our profits and so make servants of us vice versa and yet with all these inconveniences we cannot possibly do without these creatures let us therefore cease to talk of the abuses arising from em and begin to think of redressing em i do not set up for a lawgiver so shall lay down no certain rules humbly submitting in all things to the wisdom of our legislature therefore what i offer shall be under correction and upon conjecture my utmost ambition being but to give some hint to remedy this growing evil and leave the prosecution to abler heads  and first it would be necessary to settle and limit their wages from forty and fifty shillings to four and five pounds per annum that is to say according to their merits and capacities for example a young unexperienced servant to have  0 s per annum till she qualifies herself for a larger sum a servant who can do all housholdwork or as the good women term it can take her work and leave her work should have four pounds per annum and those who have lived seven years in one service should ever after demand five pounds per annum for i would very fain have some particular encouragements and privileges given to such servants who should continue long in a place it would incite a desire to please and cause an emulation very beneficial to the public  i have heard of an ancient charity in the parish of st clementsdanes where a sum of money or estate is left out of the interest or income of which such maidservants who have lived in that parish seven years in one service if they please to demand it receive a reward of ten pounds a piece  this is a noble benefaction and shows the public spirit of the donor but everybodys business is nobodys for i have not heard that such reward has been paid to any servant of late years a thousand pities that a gift of that nature should sink in oblivion and not be kept up as an example to incite all parishes to do the like  the romans had a law called jus trium liberorum by which every man who had been father of three children had particular honors and privileges this incited the youth to quit a dissolute single life and become fathers of families to the support and glory of the empire  in imitation of this most excellent law i would have such servants who should continue many years in one service meet with singular esteem and reward  the apparel of our womenservants should be next regulated that we may know the mistress from the maid i remember i was once put very much to the blush being at a friends house and by him required to salute the ladies i kissed the chamberjade in to the bargain for she was as well dressed as the best but i was soon undeceived by a general titter that gave me the utmost confusion nor can i believe myself the only person who has made such a mistake  things of this nature would be avoided if our servantmaids were to wear liveries as our footmen do or if they were obliged to go in a dress suitable to their station what should ail them but a jacket and petticoat of good yardwide stuff or callimanco might keep em decent and warm  our charity children are distinguished by their dress why then may not our women servants why may they not be made frugal per force and not put all on their backs but save something against a rainy day i am therefore entirely against any servants wearing of silks laces and other superfluous finery it sets them above themselves and makes their mistresses contemptible in their eyes i am handsomer than my mistress says a young prinkd up baggage what pity it is i should be her servant i go as well dressed or better than she this makes the girl take the first offer to be made a whore and there is a good servant spoiled whereas were her dress but suitable to her condition it would teach her humility and put her in mind of her duty  besides the fear of spoiling their clothes makes them afraid of housholdwork so that in a little time we shall have none but chambermaids and nurserymaids and of this let me give one instance my family is composed of my self and sister a man and a maid and being without a servant a young wench came to hire her self as a servant the man was gone out and my sister above stairs so i opened the door my self and this person presented herself to my view dressed completely and more like a visitor than a servantmaid she not knowing me asked for my sister pray madam said i be pleased to walk into the parlour and she shall wait on you presently accordingly i handed madam in who took it very cordially after some apology i left her alone for a minute or two while i stupid wretch runs up to my sister and told her there was a gentlewoman below come to visit her dear brother said she dont leave her alone go down and entertain her while i dress my self accordingly down i went and talked of indifferent affairs with madam mean while my sister dressed herself all over again not being willing to be seen in an undress at last she came down dressed as clean as her visitor but how great was my surprise when i found my fine lady a common servantwench  my sister understanding what she was began to ask what wages she expected she modestly asked but eight pounds a year the next question was what work she could do to deserve such wages to this she answered that she could clean a house or dress a common familydinner but cannot you wash replied my sister or get up linen she answered in the negative and said she would undertake neither nor would she go into any family that did not put out their linen to wash and hire a charewoman to scour she desired to see the house and after having carefully surveyed it said the work was too hard for her nor could she undertake it this put my sister beyond all patience and me into the greatest admiration young woman said she you have made a mistake i want a housemaid and you are a chambermaid no madam replied she i am not needlewoman enough for that and yet you ask   pounds a year replied my sister yes madam said she nor shall i bate a farthing then get you gone for a lazy impudent baggage said i you want to be a boarder and not a servant have you a fortune or estate that you dress at that rate no sir said she but i hope i may wear what i work for without offense what you work for interrupted my sister why you dont seem willing to undertake any you will not wash or scour you cannot dress a dinner for company you are no needlewoman and our little house of two rooms on a floor is too much for you for gods sake what can you do madam replied she pertly i know my business and dont fear a service there are more places than parish churches if you wash at home you should have a laundrymaid if you give entertainments you must have a cookmaid if you have any needle work you should have a chambermaid and such a house as this is enough for a housemaid in all conscience  i was pleased at the wit and astonished at the impudence of the girl and so dismissed her with thanks for her instructions assuring her that when i kept four maids she should be housemaid if she pleased were a servant to do my business with cheerfulness i should not grudge at five or six pounds per annum nor would i be so unchristian as to put more upon any one than they can bear but to pray and pay too is the devil and it is very hard that i must keep four servants or none  in great families indeed where many servants are required these distinctions of chambermaid housemaid cookmaid laundrymaid nurserymaid etc are requisite to the end that each may take her particular business and many hands may make the work light but for a private gentleman of a small fortune to be obliged to keep so many idle jades when one might do the business is intolerable and matter of great grievance  i cannot close this discourse without a gentle admonition and reproof to some of my own sex i mean those gentlemen who give themselves unnecessary airs and cannot go to see a friend but they must kiss and slop the maid and all this is done with an air of gallantry forsooth and must not be resented nay some gentlemen are so silly that they shall carry on an underhand affair with their friends servantmaid to their own disgrace and the ruin of many a young creature nothing is more base and ungenerous yet nothing more common and withal so little taken notice of d  me jack says one friend to another this maid of yours is a pretty girl you do so and so to her by g  d this makes the servantmaid pert vain and impudent and spoils many a good servant  what gentleman will descend to this low way of intrigue when he shall consider that he has a footboy or an apprentice for his rival and that he is seldom or never admitted but when they have been his tasters and the fool of fortune though he comes at the latter end of the feast yet pays the whole reckoning and so indeed would i have all such silly cullies served  if i must have an intrigue let it be with a woman that shall not shame me i would never go into the kitchen when the parlourdoor was open we are forbidden at highgate to kiss the maid when we may kiss the mistress why then will gentlemen descend so low by too much familiarity with these creatures to bring themselves into contempt  i have been at places where the maid has been so dizzied with these idle compliments that she has mistook one thing for another and not regarded her mistress in the least but put on all the flirting airs imaginable but this behavior is no where so much complained of as in taverns coffeehouses and places of public resort where there are handsome barkeepers etc these creatures being puffed up with the fulsome flattery of a set of fleshflies that are continually buzzing about em carry themselves with the utmost insolence imaginable insomuch that you must speak to them with a great deal of deference or you are sure to be affronted i was at a coffeehouse the other day where one of these ladies kept the bar and had bespoke a dish of ricetea but madam was so taken up with her sparks that she had quite forgot it i spoke for it again and with some temper but was answered after a most taunting manner not without a toss of the head a contraction of the nostrils and other impertinencies too many to enumerate seeing my self thus publicly insulted by such an animal i could not choose but show my resentment woman said i sternly i want a dish of ricetea and not what your vanity and impudence may imagine therefore treat me as a gentleman and a customer and serve me with what i call for and keep your impertinent repartees and impudent behavior for the coxcombs that swarm round your bar and make you so vain of your blown carcass and indeed i believe the insolence of this creature will ruin her master at last by driving away men of sobriety and business and making the place a den of vagabonds and rakehells  gentlemen therefore ought to be very circumspect in their behavior and not undervalue themselves to servantwenches who are but too apt to treat a gentleman ill when ever he puts himself into their power  let me now beg pardon for this digression and return to my subject by proposing some practicable methods for regulating of servants which whether they are followed or not yet if they afford matter of improvement and speculation it will answer the height of my expectation and i will be the first who shall approve of whatever improvements are made from this small beginning  the first abuse i would have reformed is that servants should be restrained from throwing themselves out of place on every idle vagary this might be remedied were all contracts between master and servant to be made before a justice of the peace or other proper officer and a memorandum thereof taken in writing nor should such servant leave his or her place for men and maids might come under the same regulation till the time agreed on be expired unless such servant be misused or denied necessaries or show some other reasonable cause for their discharge in that case the master or mistress should be reprimanded or fined but if servants misbehave themselves or leave their places not being regularly discharged they ought to be amercd or punished but all those idle ridiculous customs and laws of their own making such as a months wages or a months warning and such like should be entirely set aside and abolished  when a servant has served the limited time duly and faithfully they should be intituld to a certificate as is practiced at present in the woolcombing trade nor should any person hire a servant without a certificate or other proper security a servant without a certificate should be deemed a vagrant and a master or mistress ought to assign very good reasons when they object against giving a servant his or her certificate  and though to avoid prolixity i have not mentioned footmen particularly in the foregoing discourse yet the complaints alleged against the maids are as well masculine as feminine and very applicable to our gentlemens gentlemen i would therefore have them under the very same regulations and as they are fellow servants would not make fish of one and flesh of the other since daily experience teaches us that never a barrel the better herring  the next great abuse among us is that under the notion of cleaning our shoes above ten thousand wicked idle pilfering vagrants are permitted to patrol about our city and suburbs these are called the blackguard who black your honors shoes and incorporate themselves under the title of the worshipful company of jappanners  were this all there were no hurt in it and the whole might terminate in a jest but the mischief ends not here they corrupt our youth especially our menservants oaths and impudence are their only flowers of rhetoric gaming and thieving are the principal parts of their profession but japanning the pretense for example a gentleman keeps a servant who among other things is to clean his masters shoes but our gentlemens servants are above it now adays and your mans man performs the office for which piece of service you pay double and treble especially if you keep a table for you are well off if the jappanner has no more than his own diet from your table  i have often observed these rascals sneaking from gentlemens doors with wallets or hats full of good victuals which they either carry to their trulls or sell for a trifle by this means our butchers our bakers our poulterers and cheesemongers bills are monstrously exaggerated not to mention candles just lighted which sell for five pence a pound many other perquisites best known to themselves and the pilfering villains their confederates  add to this that their continual gaming sets servants upon their wits to supply this extravagance though at the same time the masters pocket pays for it and the time which should be spent in a gentlemans service is loiterd away among these rakehells insomuch that half our messages are inefectual the time intended being often expired before the message is delivered  how many and frequent robberies are committed by these jappanners and to how many more are they confederates silverspoons spurs and other small pieces of plate are every day missing and very often sound upon these sort of gentlemen yet are they permitted to the shame of all our good laws and the scandal of our most excellent government to lurk about our streets to debauch our servants and apprentices to support an infinite number of scandalous shameless trulls yet more wicked then themselves for not a jack among em but must have his gill  by whom such indecencies are daily acted even in our open streets as are very offensive to the eyes and ears of all sober persons and even abominable in a christian country  in any riot or other disturbance these sparks are always the foremost for most among em can turn their hands to picking of pockets to run away with goods from a fire or other public confusion to snatch any thing from a woman or child to strip a house when the door is open or any other branch of a thiefs profession  in short it is a nursery for thieves and villains modest women are every day insulted by them and their strumpets and such children as run about the streets or such servants as go on errands do but too frequently bring home some scraps of their beastly profane wit insomuch that the conversation of our lower rank of people runs only upon bawdy and blasphemy notwithstanding our societies for reformation and our laws in force against profaness for this lazy life gets them many proselites their numbers daily increasing by runaway apprentices and footboys insomuch that it is a very hard matter for a gentleman to get him a servant or for a tradesman to find an apprentice  innumerable other mischiefs accrue and others will spring up from this race of catterpillars who must be swept from out our streets or we shall be overrun with all manner of wickedness  but the subject is so low that it becomes disagreeable even to my self give me leave therefore to propose a way to clear the streets of these vermin and to substitute as many honest industrious persons in their stead who are now starving for want of bread while these execrable villains live though in rags and nastiness yet in plenty and luxury  i therefore humbly propose that these vagabonds be put immediately under the command and inspection of such taskmasters as the government shall appoint and that they be employed punished and rewarded according to their capacities and demerits that is to say the industrious and docible to woolcombing and other parts of the woollen manufacture where hands are wanted as also to husbandry and other parts of agriculture  for it is evident that there are scarce hands enough in the country to carry on either of these affairs now these vagabonds might not only by this means be kept out of harms way but be rendered serviceable to the nation nor is there any need of transporting em beyond seas for if any are refractory they should be sent to our stannaries and other mines to our coalworks and other places where hard labor is required and here i must offer one thing never yet thought of or proposed by any and that is the keeping in due repair the navigation of the river thames so useful to our trade in general and yet of late years such vast hills of sand are gathered together in several parts of the river as are very prejudicial to its navigation one of which is near london bridge another near white hall and another near battersea these two last in particular are of very great hindrance to the navigation and indeed the removal of them ought to be a national concern which i humbly propose may be thus effected  the rebellious part of these vagabonds as also other thieves and offenders should be formed in bodies under the command of proper officers and under the guard and awe of our soldiery these should every day at low water carry away these sandhills and remove every other obstruction to the navigation of this most excellent and useful river  it may be objected that the ballastmen might do this and that as fast as the hills are taken away they would gather together again or that the watermen might do it to the first i answer that the ballastmen instead of taking from these hills make holes in other places of the river which is the reason so many young persons are drowned when swiming or bathing in the river besides it is a work for many hands and of long continuance so that ballastmen do more harm than good the second objection is as silly as if i should never wash my self because i shall be dirty again and i think needs no other answer and as to the third objection the watermen are not so public spirited they live only from hand to mouth though not one of em but finds the inconvenience of these hills every day being obliged to go a great way round about for fear of running a ground insomuch that in a few years the navigation of that part of the river will be entirely obstructed nevertheless every one of these gentlemenwatermen hopes it will last his time and so they all cry the devil take the hindmost but yet i judge it highly necessary that this should be made a national concern like dagenhambreach and that these hills be removed by some means or other  and now i have mentioned watermen give me leave to complain of the insolences and exactions they daily commit on the river thames and in particular this one instance which cries aloud for justice  a young lady of distinction in company with her brother a little youth took a pair of oars at or near the temple on may day last and ordered the men to carry them to pepperalleystairs one of the fellows according to their usual impertinence asked the lady where she was going she answered near st olaces church upon which he said she had better go through bridge the lady replied she had never gone through bridge in her life nor would she venture for an hundred guineas so commanded him once more to land her at pepperalleystairs notwithstanding which in spite of her fears threats and commands nay in spite of the persuasion of his fellow he forced her through london bridge which frightened her beyond expression and to mend the matter he obliged her to pay  are and mobbd her into the bargain  to resent which abuse application was made to the hall the fellow summoned and the lady ordered to attend which she did waiting there all the morning and appointed to call again in the afternoon she came accordingly but they told her the fellow had been there and was gone so they appointed another friday she attended again but to the same purpose nor have they yet produced the man but tired out the lady who has spent above ten shillings in coachhire been abused and baffled into the bargain  it is pity therefore that there are not commissioners for watermen as there are for hackneycoachmen or that justices of the peace might not inflict bodily penalties on watermen thus offending but while watermen are watermens judges i shall laugh at those who carry their complaints to the hall  the usual plea in behalf of abusive watermen is that they are drunk ignorant or poor but will that satisfy the party aggreivd or defer the offender from reoffending whereas were the offenders sent to the house of correction and there punished or sentenced to work at the sandhills aforementioned for a time suitable to the nature of their crimes the terror of such punishments might make them fearful of offending to the great quiet of the subject  now it will be asked how shall we have our shoes cleaned or how are these industrious poor to be maintained to this i answer that the places of these vagabonds may be very well supplied by great numbers of ancient persons poor widows and others who have not enough from their respective parishes to maintain em these poor people i would have authorized and stationd by the justices of the peace or other magistrates each of these should have a particular walk or stand and no other shoecleaner should come into that walk unless the person misbehave and be removed nor should any person clean shoes in the streets but these authorized shoecleaners who should have some mark of distinction and be under the immediate government of the justices of the peace  thus would many thousands of poor people be provided for without burthening their parishes some of these may earn a shilling or two in a day and none less then six pence or thereabouts and least the old jappanners should appear again in the shape of linkboys and so knock down gentlemen in drink and lead others out of the way into dark remote places where they either put out their lights and rob em themselves or run away and leave em to be pillaged by others or perform any other part of the thieving function i would have no person carry a link for hire but some of these industrious poor and these not without some ticket or badge to let people know who they trust thus would the streets be cleared night and day of these vermin nor would oaths skirmishes blasphemy obscene talk or other wicked examples be so public and frequent all gaming at orange and gingerbreadbarrows should be abolished as also all penny and half penny lotteries thimbles and balls etc so frequent in moorfields lincolnsinnfields etc where idle fellows resort to play with children and apprentices and tempt them to steal their parents or masters money  there is one admirable custom in the city of london which i could wish were imitated in the city and liberties of westminster and bills of mortality which is no porter can carry a burden or letter in the city unless he be a ticketporter whereas out of the freedompart of london any person may take a knot and turn porter till he be entrusted with something of value and then you never hear of him more this is very common and ought to be amended i would therefore have all porters under some such regulation as coachmen chairmen carmen etc a man may then know whom he intrusts and not run the risque of losing his goods etc nay i would not have a person carry a basket in the markets who is not subject to some such regulation for very many persons oftentimes lose their dinner in sending their meat home by persons they know nothing of  thus would all our poor be stationd and a man or woman able to perform any of these offices must either comply or be termed an idle vagrant and so sent to a place where they shall be forced to work by this means industry will be encouraged idleness punished and we shall be famed as well as happy for our tranquillity and decorum  finis
