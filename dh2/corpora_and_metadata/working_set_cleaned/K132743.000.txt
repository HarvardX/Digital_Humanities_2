the tragedy of sophonisba acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  by mr thomson  london printed for a millar at buchanans head over against st clements church in the strand m dcc xxx  to the queen madam the notice your majesty has condescended to take of the following tragedy emboldens me to lay it in the humblest manner at your majestys feet and to whom can this illustrious carthaginian so properly fly for protection as to a queen who commands the hearts of a people more powerful at sea than carthage more flourishing in commerce than those first merchants more secure against conquest and under a monarchy more free than a commonwealth itself  i dare not nor indeed need i here attempt a character where both the great and the amiable qualities shine forth in full perfection all words are faint to speak what is universally felt and acknowledged by a happy people permit me therefore only to subscribe my self with the truest zeal and veneration  madam your majestys most humble most dutiful and most devoted servant james thomson  preface it is not my intention in this preface to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece i am afraid there are too many but those who are best able to discover will be most ready to pardon them they alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is and this is a first attempt  i beg leave only to mention the reason that determined me to make choice of this subject what pleased me particularly though perhaps it will not be least liable to objection with ordinary readers was the great simplicity of the story it is one regular and uniform not charged with a multiplicity of incidents and yet affording several revolutions of fortune by which the passions may be excited varied and driven to their full tumult of emotion  this unity of design was always sought after and admired by the ancients and the most eminent among the moderns who understood their writings have chosen to imitate them in this from an entire conviction that the reason of it must hold good in all ages and here allow me to translate a passage from the celebrated monsieur racine which contains all that i have to say on this head  we must not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of those who made it nothing can touch us in tragedy but what is probable and what probability is there that in one day should happen a multitude of things which could scarce happen in several weeks there are some wh think that this simplicity is a mark of barrenness  invention but they do not consider that on the contrary invention consists in making something out of nothing and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets who did not find in their genius either richness or force enough to engage their spectators for five acts together by a simple action supported by the violence of passions the beauty of sentiments and the nobleness of expression  i would not be understood to mean that all these things are to be found in my performance i only show the reader what i aimed at and how i would have pleased him had it been in my power  as to the character of sophonisba in drawing it i have confined myself to the truth of history it were an affront to the age to suppose such a character out of nature especially in a country which has produced so many great examples of public spirit and heroic virtues even in the softer sex and i had destroyed her character entirely had i not marked it with that strong love to her country disdain of servitude and inborn aversion to the romans by which all historians have distinguished her nor ought her marrying masinissa while her former husband was still alive to be reckoned a blemish in her character for by the laws both of rome and carthage the captivity of the husband dissolved the marriage of course as among us impotence or adultery not to mention the reasons of a moral and public nature which i have put into her own mouth in the scene betwixt her and syphax  this is all i have to say of the play itself but i cannot conclude without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation they have indeed done me more than justice whatever was designed as amiable and engaging in masinissa shines out in mr wilkss action mrs oldfield in the character of sophonisba has excelled what even in the fondness of an author i could either wish or imagine the grace dignity and happy variety of her action have been universally applauded and are truly admirable  prologue by a friend spoken by mr williams when learning after the long gothic night fair over the western world renewed his light with arts arising sophonisba rose the tragic muse returning wept her woes with her the italian scene first learnt to glow and the first tears for her were taught to flow her charms the gallic muses next inspired corneille himself saw wondered and was fired what foreign theaters with pride have shown britain by juster title makes her own when freedom is the cause it is hers to fight and hers wken freedom is the theme to write for this a british author bids again the heroine rise to grace the british scene here as in life she breathes her genuine flame she asks what bosom has not felt the same asks of the british youth  is silence there she dares to ask it of the british fair to night our homespun author would be true at once to nature history and you wellpleased to give our neighbors due applause he owns their learning but disdains their laws not to his patient touch or happy flame it is to his british heart he trusts for fame if france excel him in one freeborn thought the man as well as poet is in fault nature informer of the poets art whose force alone can raise or melt the heart thou art his guide each passion every line whatever he draws to please must all be thine be thou his judge in every candid breast thy silent whisper is the sacred test the persons represented masinissa king of massylia by mr wilks syphax king of masoesylia by mr mills narva friend to masinissa by mr roberts scipio the roman general by mr williams laelius his lieutenant by mr bridgewater sophonisba by mrs oldfield phoenissa her friend by mrs roberts messenger slave guards and attendants   scene the palace of cirtha sophonisba a tragedy act i scene i sophonisba phoenissa sophonisba this hour phoenissa this important hour or fixes me a queen or from a throne throws sophonisba into roman chains detested thought for now his utmost force collected desperate distressed and sore from battles lost with all the rage of war illfated syphax makes his last effort but say thou partner of my hopes and fears phoenissa say while from the lofty tower our straining eyes the field of battle sought ah thought you not that our numidian troops gave up the broken field and scattering fled wild over the hills from the rapacious sons of still triumphant rome  phoenissa the dream of care and think not madam syphax can resign but with his ebbing life in this last field a crown a kingdom and a queen he loves beyond ambitions brightest wish for whom nor moved by threats nor bound by plighted faith he scorned the roman friendship that fair name for slavery and from the engagements broke of scipio famed for every winning art the towering genius of recovered rome  sophonisba oh name him not these romans stir my blood to too much rage i cannot bear the fortune of that proud people  said you not phoenissa that syphax loved me which would fire his battle and urge him on to death or conquest true he loves me with the madness of desire his every passion is a slave to love nor heeds he danger where i bid him go nor leagues nor interest hence these endless wars these ravaged countries these successless fights sustained for carthage whose defense alone engaged my loveless marriagevows with his but know you not that in the roman camp i have a lover too a gallant brave and disappointed lover full of wrath returning to a kingdom whence the sword of syphax drove him  phoenissa masinissa  sophonisba he young masinissa the massylian king the first addresser of my youth for whom my bosom felt a fond beginning wish extinguished soon when once to scipios side won over and dazzled by the enchanting glare of that fair seeming hero he became a gay admiring slave yet knew it not ever since my heart has held him in contempt and thrown out each idea of his worth that there began to grow nay had it been as allpossest and soft as here is who sits in secret shades or by the falling stream and wastes her being in unutterd pangs i would have broke or cured it of its fondness  phoenissa heroic sophonisba  sophonisba no phoenissa it is not for the daughter of great asdrubal descended from a long illustrious line of carthaginian heroes who have often filled italy with terror and dismay and shook the walls of rome to pine in love like a deluded maid to give her life and heart highbeating in her countrys cause meant not for common aims and household cares to give them up to vain presuming man much less to one who stoops the neck to rome an enemy to carthage masinissa  phoenissa think not i mean to check that glorious flame that just ambition which exalts your soul fires on your cheek and lightens in your eye yet would he had been yours this rising prince for trust me fame is fond of masinissa his various fortune his resplendent deeds his courage conduct deepexperiencd youth and vast unbroken spirit in distress still rising stronger from the last defeat are all the talk and terror too of afric who has not heard the story of his woes how hard he came to his paternal reign whence soon by syphax unrelenting hate and jealous carthage driven he with a few fled to the mountains then i think it was hemmed in a circle of impending rocks that all his followers fell save fifty horse who thence escaped through secret paths abrupt gained the clupean plain there overtook and urged by fierce surrounding foes he burst with four alone sore wounded through their ranks and all amidst a mighty torrent plunged seized by the whirling gulf two sunk and two with him obliquely hurried down the stream wrought to the farther shore thastonishd troops stood checked and shivering on the gloomy brink and deemed him lost in the devouring flood mean time the dauntless undespairing youth lay in a cave concealed curing his wounds with mountainherbs and on his horses fed nor here even at the lowest ebb of life stooped his aspiring mind what need i say how once again restored and once again expelled among the garamantian hills he since has wandered till the roman arm revived his cause and who shall reign alone syphax or he this day decides  sophonisba enough thou needst not blazon thus his fame phoenissa were he as glorious as the pride of woman could wish in all her wantonness of thought the joy of humankind wise valiant good with every praise with every laurel crowned the warriours wonder and the virgins sigh yet this would cloud him over this blemish all his mean submission to the roman yoke that false to carthage afric and himself with proferrd hand and knee he hither led these ravagers of earth  but while we talk the work of fate goes on even now perhaps my dying country bleeds in every vein and the warm victor thunders at our gate  scene ii sophonisba phoenissa and to them a messenger from the battle sophonisba ha whence art thou speak though thy bleeding wounds might well excuse thy tongue  messenger madam escaped with much ado from yon wide death   sophonisba no more at once thy meaning flashes over my soul oh all my vanished hopes repairless chance of undiscerning war  and is all lost an universal havoc  messenger madam all for scarce a masoesylian save my self but is or seized or bites the bloody plain the king   sophonisba ah what of him  messenger his fiery steed by masinissa the massylian prince pierced threw him headlong to his clustering foes and now he comes in chains  sophonisba it is wondrous fit absolute gods all afric is in chains the weeping world in chains  oh is there not a time a righteous time reserved in fate when these oppressors of mankind shall feel the miseries they give and blindly fight for their own fetters too  the conquering troops how points their motion  messenger at my heels they came loudshouting dreadful in a cloud of dust by masinissa headed  sophonisba hark arrived the murmuring crowd rolls frighted to the palace thou bleedst to death poor faithful wretch away and dress thy wounds if life be worth thy care though rome methinks will lose a slave in thee would sophonisba were as near the verge of boundless and immortal liberty  scene iii sophonisba phoenissa after a pause sophonisba and wherefore not when liberty is lost let slaves and cowards live but in the brave it were a treachery to themselves enough to merit chains and is it fit for me who in my veins from asdrubal derived hold carthaginian enmity to rome on whom i have lavished all my burning soul in everlasting hate for whose destruction i sold my joyless youth to syphax arms and turned him fierce upon them fit for such a native restless unrelenting foe to sit down softlypensive and await the approaching victors rage reserved in chains to grace his triumph and become the scorn of every roman dame  gods how my soul disdains the thought and this shall set it free offers to stab her self phoenissa hold sophonisba hold my friend my queen for whom alone i live hold your rash point nor through your guardian bosom stab your country that is our last resort and always sure the gracious gods are liberal of death to that last blessing lend a thousand ways think not i would have you live to drag a chain and walk the triumph of insulting rome no by these tears of loyalty and love ere i beheld so vile a sight this hand should urge the faithful poynard to your heart and glory in the deed but while hope lives let not the generous die it is late before the brave despair  sophonisba thou copy of my soul and now my friend indeed show me but hope one glimpse of hope and i will renew my toils call patience labor fortitude again the vexed unjoyous day and sleepless night nor shrink at danger any shape of death show me the smallest hope alas phoenissa too kindly confident hope lives not here fled with her sister liberty beyond the garamantian hills to some steep wild some undiscovered country where the foot of roman cannot come  phoenissa yes there she lived with massinissa wounded and forlorn amidst the serpents hiss and tigers yell   sophonisba why namst thou him  phoenissa madam in this forgive my forward zeal from him proceeds our hope he loved you once nor is your form impaired warmed and unfolded into stronger charms ask his protection from the roman power you must prevail for sophonisba sure from masinissa cannot ask in vain  sophonisba now by the prompting genius of my country i thank thee for the thought true there is pain even in descending thus to beg protection from that degenerate youth but oh for thee my sinking country and again to gaul this hated rome what would i not endure it shall be done phoenissa though disgust choked up my struggling meaning shall be done kneels but here i vow propitious juno hear could every pomp and every pleasure joined love empire glory a whole kneeling world unnerve my smallest purpose and remit that most inveterate enmity i bear the roman state may carthage smoke in ruins rome rise the mistress of mankind and i there an abandoned slave drag out a length of life in loathsome baseness and contempt this way the trumpet sounds let us retire  scene iv masinissa syphax in chains narva guards etc syphax is there no dungeon in this city dark as is my troubled soul that thus i am brought to my own palace to those rooms of state wont in another manner to receive me with other signs of royalty than these looking on his chains masinissa i will not wound thee not insult thee syphax with a recital of thy tyrant crimes a captive here i see thee fallen below my most revengeful wish and all the rage the noble fury that inspired this morn is sunk to soft compassion in the field the flaming front of war there is the scene of brave revenge and i have sought thee there keen as the hunted lion seeks his foe but when a broken enemy disarmed and helpless lies a falling sword an eye with pity flowing and an arm as weak as infant softness then becomes the brave now sleeps the sword the passions of the field subside to peace and my relenting soul melts at thy fate  syphax this this is all i dread all i detest this insolence refined this barbarous pity this affected goodness pitied by thee  is there a form of death of torture and of infamy like that it kills my very soul  ye partial gods i feel your worst why should i fear you more hear me vain youth take notice  i abhor thy mercy loath it  poison to my thoughts would thou be merciful one way alone thou can oblige me  use me like a slave as i would thee delicious thought were thou here crouching in my power  masinissa outrageous man if that is mercy i will be cruel still nor can thou drive me by thy bitterest rage to an unmanly deed not all thy wrongs nor this worse triumph in them  syphax ha ha wrongs i cannot wrong thee when we lanch the spear into the monsters heart or crush the serpent destroy what in antipathy we hold the common foe can that be called a wrong injurious that absurd it cannot be  masinissa i am loath to hurt thee more  the tyrant works too fierce already in thy rankled breast but since thou seem to rank me with thy self with great destroyers with perfidious kings i must reply to thy licentious tongue bid thee remember whose accursed sword began this work of death who broke the ties the holy ties attested by the gods which bind the nations in the bond of peace who meanly took advantage of my youth unskilled in arms unsettled on my throne and drove me to the desert there to dwell with kinder monsters who my cities sacked my country pillaged and my subjects murdered who still pursued me with inveterate hate when generous force proved vain with ruffian arts the villains dagger base assassination and for no reason all brute violence alone thy plea  what the least provocation say can thou but pretend  syphax i needed none nature has in my being sown the seeds of enmity to thine  nay mark me this could thou restore me to my former state strike off these chains give me the sword again the scepter and the wideobedient war yet must i still implacable to thee seek eagerly thy death or die my self life cannot hold us both  unequal gods who love to disappoint mankind and take all vengeance to your selves why to the point of my longflatterd wishes did ye lift me then sink me thus so low just as i drew the glorious stroke that was to make me happy why did you blast my strong extended arm strike the dry sword unsated to the ground but that to mock us is your cruel sport what else is human life  masinissa thus always joined with an inhuman heart and brutal manners is irreligion to the ruling gods whose schemes our peevish ignorance arraigns our thoughtless pride  thy lost condition syphax is nothing to the tumult of thy breast there lies the sting of evil there the drop that poisons nature  ye mysterious powers whose ways are evergracious everjust as ye think wisest best dispose of me but whether through your gloomy depths i wander or on your mountains walk give me the calm the steady smiling soul where wisdom sheds eternal sunshine and eternal joy then if misfortune comes she brings along the bravest virtues and so many great illustrious spirits have conversed with woe the pride of adverse fate as are enough to consecrate distress and make even death ambition  syphax torture racks the common trick of insolent success unsuffering pride this prate of patience and i know not what it is all a lie impracticable rant and only tends to make me scorn thee more but why this talk in mercy send me hence yet  ere i go  oh save me from distraction i know hot youth thou burnest for my queen but by the majesty of ruined kings and that commanding glory which surrounds her i charge thee touch her not  masinissa no syphax no thou needst not charge me that were mean indeed a triumph that to thee but could i stoop again to love her thou what right have thou a captive to her bed nor life nor queen nor ought a captive has all laws in this roman and carthaginian all agree  syphax here here begins the bitterness of death here my chains grind me first  masinissa poor sophonisba she too becomes the prize of conquering rome what most her heart abhors alas how hard will slavery sit on her exalted soul how piteous hard but if i know her well she never will endure it she will die for not a roman burns with nobler ardor a higher sense of liberty than she and though she married thee her only stain false to my youth and faithless to my vows yet i must own it from a worthy cause from public spirit did her fault proceed  syphax blue plagues and poison on thy meddling tongue talk not of her for every word of her is a keen dagger griding through my heart oh for a lonely dungeon where i rather would talk with my own groans and great revenge than in the mansions of the blessed with thee hell whither must i go  masinissa unhappy man and is thy breast determined against peace on comfort shut  syphax on all but death from thee  masinissa narva be syphax thy peculiar care and use him well with tenderness and honor this evening lelius and to morrow scipio to cirtha come then let the romans take their prisoner  syphax there shines a gleam of hope across the gloom  from thee delivered  ease breathes in that thought  lead on  my heart grows lighter  scene v masinissa alone what dreadful havoc in the human breast the passions make when unconfined and mad they burst unguided by the mental eye the light of reason which in various ways points them to good or turns them back from ill o save me from the tumult of the soul from the wild beasts within  for circling sands when the swift whirlwind whelms them over the lands the roaring deeps that to the clouds arise while thwarting thick the mingled lightning flies the monsterbrood to which this land gives birth the blazing city and the gaping earth all deaths all tortures in one pang combined are gentle to the tempest of the mind the end of the first act act ii scene i masinissa narva masinissa  it is true my friend thou good old man by whom my youth was formed the firm companion of my various life i own it is true that sophonisbas image lives in my bosom still and at each glance i take in secret of the bright idea a strange disorder seizes on my soul which burns with stronger glory need i say how once she had my vows till scipio came resistless man like a descending god and snatched me from the carthaginian side to nobler rome beneath whose laureled brow and ample eye the nations grow polite humane and happy then thou may remember such is this womans high impetuous spirit that allcontrouling love she bears her country her carthage that at this she sacrificed to syphax unbelovd her blooming years and won him off from rome  narva my generous prince applauding afric of thy choice approves fame claps her wings and virtue smiles on thee of peace thou softner and thou soul of war but oh beware of that fair foe to glory woman and most of carthaginian woman who has not heard of fatal punic guile of their sly conquests their insidious leagues their asdrubals their hannibals with all their wily heroes and if such their men what must their women be  masinissa you make me smile i thank thy honest zeal but never dread the firmness of my heart my strong attachment severe to rome to scipio and to glory indeed i cannot would not quite forget the grace of sophonisba how she looked and talked and moved a pallas or a juno accomplished even in trifles when she stooped ambitions flight and with a softened eye gave her quick spirit into gayer life then every word was liveliness and wit we heard the muses song and the dance swam through all the maze of harmony i flatter not believe me narva yet my panting soul to scipio taken in the fair pursuit of fame and for my peoples happiness resigned this sophonisba and though now constrained by soft necessity to see her and she a captive in my power will still resign her  narva let me not doubt thy fortitude my masinissa thy exalted purpose not to be lost in love but ah we know not often till experience sighs it to the soul the boundless witchcraft of ensnaring woman and our own slippery hearts from scipio learn the temperance of heroes i will recount the instructive story what these eyes beheld perhaps you have heard it but it is pleasing still though told a thousand times  masinissa i burn to hear it lost by my late misfortunes in the desert i lived a stranger to the voice of fame to scipios last exploits exalt me now great actions raise the mind but when a friend a scipio does them then with more than wonder even with a sort of vanity we listen  narva when to his glorious first essay in war new carthage fell there all the flower of spain were kept in hostage a full field presenting for scipios generosity to shine and then it was that when the hero heard how i to thee belonged he with large gifts and friendly words dismissed me  masinissa i remember and in his favor that impressed me first but to thy story  narva what with admiration struck every heart was this  a noble virgin conspicuous far over all the captive dames was marked the generals prize she wept and blushed young fresh and blooming like the morn an eye as when the blue sky trembles through a cloud of purest white a secret charm combined her features and infused enchantment through them her shape was harmony  but eloquence beneath her beauty fails which seemed on purpose poured out by lavish nature that mankind might see this action in its highest luster soft as she passed along with downcast eyes where gentle sorrow swelled and now and then dropped over her modest cheek a trickling tear the roman legions languishd and hard war felt more than pity even scipios self as on his high tribunal raised he sat turned from the piercing sight and chiding asked his officers if by this gift they meant to cloud his glory in its very dawn  masinissa oh gods my fluttering heart on stop not narva  narva she questioned of her birth in trembling accents with tears and blushes broken told her tale but when he found her royally descended of her old captive parents the sole joy and that a hapless celtiberian prince her lover and beloved forgot his chains his lost dominions and for her alone wept out his tender soul sudden the heart of this young conquering loving godlike roman felt all the great divinity of virtue his wishing youth stood checked his tempting power by infinite humanity   masinissa well well and then  narva disdaining guilty doubt at once he for her parents and her lover called the various scene imagine how his troops looked dubious on and wondered what he meant while stretched below the trembling suppliants lay racked by a thousand mingling passions fear hope jealousy disdain submission grief anxiety and love in every shape to these as different sentiments succeeded as mixed emotions when the man divine thus the dread silence to the lover broke  we both are young both charmed the right of war  has put thy beauteous mistress in my power  with whom i could in the most sacred ties  live out a happy life but know that romans  their hearts as well as enemies can conquer  then take her to thy soul and with her take  thy liberty and kingdom in return  i ask no more but when you view these eyes  these charms with transport be a friend to rome  masinissa there spoke the soul of scipio  but the lovers  narva joy and extatic wonder held them mute while the loud camp and all the clustring crowd that hung around rang with repeated shouts fame took the alarm and through resounding spain blew fast the fair report which more than arms admiring nations to the romans gained  masinissa my friend in glory thy awakened prince springs at thy faithful tale it fires my soul and nerves each thought anew apt often perhaps too much too much to slacken into love but now the soft oppression flies and all my mounting powers expand to deeds like thine thou pattern and inspirer of my fame scipio thou first of men and best of friends what man of soul would live my narva breathe this idlepuffing element and run day after day the stillreturning round of lifes mean offices and sickly joys but in compassion to mankind to be a guardian god below to dissipate an ardent being in heroic aims do something vastly great like what you told something to raise him over the grovelling herd and make him shine for ever  oh my friend bleed every vein about me every nerve with anguish tremble every sinew ache be toil familiar to my limbs ambition mix all my thoughts in an incessant whirl the third time may i lose my kingdom and again wander the false inhospitable syrts yet oh ye liberal gods in rich award and amplest recompense  i ask no more  share me the wreath of fame from scipios brow but see she comes mark her majestic port  scene ii masinissa sophonisba narva phoenissa sophonisba behold victorious prince the scene reversed and sophonisba kneeling here a captive over whom the gods thy fortune and thy virtue have given unquestioned power of life and death if such a one may raise her suppliant voice once music to thy ear if she may touch thy knee thy purple and thy victorhand oh listen masinissa let thy soul intensely listen while i fervent pray and strong adjure thee by that regal state in which with equal pomp we lately shone by the numidian name our common boast and by those household gods who may i wish with better omens take thee to this palace than syphax hence they sent as is thy pleasure in all beside determine of my fate this this alone i beg never oh never into the cruel proud and hated power of romans let me fall since angry heaven will have it so that i must be a slave and that a galling chain must bind these hands it were some little softning in my doom to call a kindred son of the same clime a native of numidia my lord but if thou can not save me from the romans if this sad favor be beyond thy power at least to give me death is what thou can here strike  my naked bosom courts thy sword and my last breath shall bless thee masinissa  masinissa rise sophonisha rise to see thee thus is a revenge i scorn and all the man within me though much injured by thy pride and spirit too tempestuous for thy sex yet blushes to behold thus at my feet thus prostrate low her for whom kings have kneeled the fairest but the falsest of her sex  sophonisba spare thy reproach  it is cruel thus to lose in ranckling discord and ungenerous strife the few remaining moments that divide me from the last evil bondage  roman bondage yes shut thy heart against me shut thy heart against compassion every human thought even recollected love yet know rash youth that when thou see me swell their lofty triumph thou see thy self in me this is my day to morrow may be thine but here assured here will i lie on this vile earth forlorn of hope abandoned since despised by thee these locks all loose and sordid in the dust this sullied bosom growing to the ground scorched up with anguish and of every shape of misery full till comes the soldier fierce from recent blood and in thy very eye lays raging his rude sanguinary grasp on these weak limbs and clinches them in chains then if no friendly steel no nectard draught of deadly poison can enlarge my soul it will indignant burst from a slaves body and joined to mighty dido scorn ye all  masinissa oh sophonisba it is not safe to hear thee and i mistook my heart to trust it thus hence let me fly  sophonisba you shall not masinissa here will i hold you tremble here for ever here unremitting grow till you consent and can thou think oh can thou think to leave me exposed defenseless wretched here alone a prey to romans flushed with blood and conquest the subject of their scorn or baser love sure masinissa cannot and though changed though cold as that averted look he wears sure love can never in generous breasts be lost to that degree as not from shame and outrage to save what once they loved  masinissa enchantment madness what would thou sophonisba  oh my heart my treacherous heart  sophonisba what would i masinissa my mean request sits blushing on my cheek to be thy slave young prince is what i beg here sophonisba kneels to be thy slave yet kneels in vain but you are a slave thy self and can not from the romans save one woman her who was once the triumph of thy soul ever they seduced it by their lying glory immortal gods and am i fallen so low scorned by a lover by a slave to rome naught can be worth this baseness life nor empire i loath me for it  on this kinder earth then leave me leave me to despair and death  masinissa what means this conflict with almighty nature with the whole warring heart  rise quickly rise in all the conquering majesty of charms o sophonisba rise while here i swear by the tremendous powers that rule mankind by heaven and earth and hell by love and glory the romans shall not hurt you  romans cannot for rome is generous as the gods themselves and honors not insults a generous foe yet since you dread them take this sacred pledge this hand of surety by which kings are bound by which i hold you mine and vow to treat you with all the reverence due to ruined state with all the softness of remembered love all that can sooth thy fate and make thee happy  sophonisba i thank thee masinissa now the same the same warm youth exalted full of soul with whom in happier days i wont to pass the sighing hour while dawning fair in love all song and sweetness life set joyous out ere the black tempest of ambition rose and drove us different ways  thus dressed in war in nodding plumes overcast with sullen thought with purposed vengeance dark i knew thee not but now breaks out the beauteous fun anew the gay numidian shines who warmed me once whose love was glory  vain ideas hence  long since my heart to nobler passions known has your acquaintance scorned  masinissa oh while you talk enchanting fair one my deluded thought runs back to days of love when fancy still found worlds of beauty ever rising new to the transported eye when flattering hope formed endless prospects of increasing bliss and still the credulous heart believed them all even more than love could promise  but the scene is full of danger for a tainted eye i must not dare not will not look that way o hide it wisdom glory from my view or in sweet ruin i shall link again disaster clouds thy cheek thy color goes retire and from the troubles of the day repose thy weary soul worn out with care and rough unhappy thought  sophonisba may masinissa never want the goodness he has shown to me  scene iii masinissa narva masinissa the dangers over i have heard the syrens song yet still to glory hold my steady course i marked thy kind concern thy friendly fears and own them just for she has beauty narva so full so perfect with so great a soul informed so pointed high with spirit as strikes like lightning from the hand of jove and raises love to glory  narva ah my prince too true it is too true her fatal charms are powerful and to masinissas heart but know the way too well and art thou sure that the soft poison which within thy veins lay unextinguishd is not roused a new is not this moment working through thy soul doft thou not love confess  masinissa what said my friend of poison love of loving sopkon sba yes i admire her wonder at her beauty and he who does not is as dull as earth the cold unanimated form of man ever lighted up with the celestial fire whereer she goes still admiration gazes and listens while she talks even thou thy self who saw her with the malice of a friend even thou thy self admirst her  do thou not say speak sincerely  narva she has charms indeed but has she charms like virtue though majestic does she command us is her force like glory  masinissa all glorys in her eye perfection thence looks from his throne and on her ample brow sits majesty her features glow with life warm with heroic soul her mien  she walks as when a towering goddess treads this earth but when her language flows when such a one descends to sooth to sigh to weep to grasp the tottering knee oh narva narva oh expression here is dumb  narva alas my lord is this the talk of sober admiration are these the sallies of a heart at ease of scipios friend and was it the calm sense of fair perfection that the while she kneeled for what you rashly promised seized your soul stole out in secret transports from your eye that writhed you groaning round and shook your frame  masinissa i tell thee once again too cautious man that when a woman begs a matchless woman a woman once beloved a fallen queen a sophonisba when she twines her charms around our soul and all her power of looks of tears of sighs of softness plays upon us he is more or less than man who can resist her for me my steadfast soul approves nay more exults in the protection it has promised and naught though plighted honor did not bind me shall shake the happy purpose of my heart naught by the avenging gods who heard my vow and hear me now again  narva and was it then for this you conquered  masinissa yes and triumph in it this was my fondest wish the very point the plume of glory the delicious prize of bleeding years and i had been a brute a greater monster than numidia breeds a horror to my self if on the ground cast vilely from me i the illustrious fair one had left to bondage bitterness and death nor is there ought in war worth what i feel in pomp and hollow state like this sweet sense of infelt bliss which the reflection gives me of saving thus such excellence and beauty from her supreme abhorrence  narva masinissa my friend my royal lord alas you slide you sink from virtue on the giddy brink of fate you stand  one step and all is loft  masinissa no more no more if this is being lost if this mistaken is forsaking virtue and rushing down the precipice of fate then down i go far far beyond the din of scrupulous dull precaution  leave me narva i want to be alone to find some shade some solitary gloom there to shake off this weight of life this tumult of mankind this sick ambition on it self recoiling and there to listen to the gentle voice the sigh of peace something i know not what that whispers transport to my heart  farewell  scene iv narva alone struck and he knows it not  so when the field elate in heart the warrior scorns to yield the streaming blood can scarce convince his eyes nor will he feel the wound by which he dies the end of the second act act iii scene i masinissa alone in vain i wander through the shade for peace it is with the calm alone the pure of heart that there the goddess talks  but in my breast some busy thought some secreteating pang throbs inexpressible and rowls from  what from charm to charm on sophonisba still earnest intent devoted all to her oh it must out  it is love almighty love returning on me with a stronger tide i will doubt no more but give it up to love come to my breast thou rosysmiling god come unconfined bring all thy joys along all thy soft cares and mix them copious here but why invoke i thee thy power is weak to sophonisbas eye thy quiver poor to the resistless lightning of her form and dull thy bare insinuating arts to the sweet mazes of her flowing tongue quick let me fly to her and there forget this tedious absence war ambition noise even friendships self the vanity of fame and all but love for love is more than all scene ii masinissa narva masinsssa welcome again my friend  come nearer narva lend me thine arm and i will tell thee all unfold my secret heart whose every pulse with sophonisba beats  nay hear me out  swift as i mused the conflagration spread at once too strong too general to be quenched i love and i approve it dote upon her even think these minutes lost i talk with thee heavens what emotions have possessed my soul snatched by a moment into years of passion  narva ah masinissa   masinissa argue not against me talk down the circling winds that lift the desert and touched by heaven when all the forests blaze talk down the flame but not my stronger love i have for love a thousand thousand reasons dear to the heart and potent over the soul my ready thoughts all rising restless all are a perpetual spring of tenderness oh sophonisba sophonisba oh  narva is this deceitful day then come to naught this day that set thee on a double throne that gave thee syphax chained thy deadly foe with perfect conquest crowned thee perfect glory is it so soon eclipsed and does yon sun yon setting sun who this fair morning saw thee ride through the ranks of long extended war as radiant as himself with every glance wheeling the pointed files and when the storm began beheld thee tread the rising surge of battle high and drive it on the foe does he now blushing see thee sunk so weak caught in a smile the captive of a look i cannot name it without tears  masinissa away i am sick of war of the destroying trade smoothed over and gilded with the name of glory thou needst not spread the martial field to me my happier eyes are turned another way behold it not or if they do behold it shrunk up far off a visionary scene as to the waking man appears the dream  narva or rather as realities appear the virtue pomp and dignities of life in sick disordered dreams  masinissa think not i scorn the task of heroes when oppression rages and lawless violence confounds the world who would not bleed with transport for his country tear every dear relation from his heart and greatly die to make a people happy ought not to taste of happiness himself and is lowsould indeed  but sure my friend there is a time for love or life were vile a sickly circle of revolving days led on by hope with senseless hurry filled and closed by disappointment round and round still hope for ever wheels the daily cheat impudent hope unjoyous madness all till love comes stealing in with his kind hours his healing lips his cordial sweets his cares infusing joy his joys ineffable that make the poor account of life complete and justify the gods  narva mistaken prince i blame not love but   masinissa slander not my passion i have suffered thee too far  take heed old man  love will not bear an accusation narva  narva i will speak the truth when truth and friendship call nor fear thy frown unkind  thou have no right to sophonisba she belongs to rome  masinissa ha she belongs to rome  it is true  my thoughts where have you wandered not to think of this think ever i promised ever i loved  confusion i know not what i say  i should have loved though jove in muttering thunder had forbid it but rome will not refuse so small a boon whose gifts are kingdoms rome must grant it sure one captive to my wish one poor request so small to them but oh so dear to me here let my heart confide  narva delusive love through what wild projects is the frantic mind beguiled by thee  and think thou that the romans the senators of rome these gods on earth wise steady to the right severely just all incorrupt and like eternal fate not to be moved will listen to the sigh of idle love they when their country calls who know no pain no tenderness no joy but bid their children bleed before their eyes that they will regard the light fantastic pangs of a fond heart and with thy kingdom give thee their most inveterate foe from their firm side like syphax to delude thee and the point of their own bounty on themselves to turn thou can not hope it sure  impossible  masinissa what shall i do  be now the friend exerted for love and honor press me love and honor all that is dear and excellent in life all that or sooths the man or lifts the hero bind my soul deep  narva rash was your vow my lord i know not what to counsel  when you vowed you vowed what was not in your power to grant and therefore it is not binding  masinissa never never oh never will i falsify that vow ever then destruction seize me yes ye romans if it be so there take your kingdoms back your royal gewgaws all for sophonisba hold  let me think a while  it shall be so by all thinspiring gods that prompt my thought this very night shall solemnize our vows and the next joyous sun that visits afric see sophonisba seated on my throne  then if they spare her not  not spare my queen  perdition on their stubborn pride called virtue be theirs the world but sophonisha mine  narva and is it possible ye gods that rule us can masinissa in his pride of youth in his meridian glory shining wide the light of afric and the friend of scipio he take a woman to the nuptial bed who scorned him for a tyrant old and peevish his rancorous foe and gave her untouched bloom her spring of charms to syphax  masinissa horrid friendship this this has thrown a serpent to my heart while it oerflowd with tenderness with joy with all the sweetness of exulting love now naught but gall is there and burning poison yes it was so  curse on her vain ambition what had her meddling sex to do with states the business of men for him for syphax forsook for him my love for his gross passion the thought is hell  oh i had treasured up a world of indignation years of scorn but her sad suppliant witchcraft soothed it down where is she now that it may burst upon her bear her unbounded from me down the torrent far far away and though my plighted faith shall save her from the romans yet to tell her that i will never never see her more ha there she comes  pernicious fair one  leave me  scene iii sophonisba masinissa sophonisba forgive this quick return  the rage confusion and mingled passions of this luckless day made me forget another warm request i had to beg of generous masinissa for oh to whom save to the generous can the miserable fly  but much disturbed you look and scowl upon me a denial repentance frowns on your contracted brow already weary of my sinking fate you seem to droop and for unhappy syphax i shall implore in vain  masinissa for syphax vengeance and can thou mention him oh grant me breath  sophonisba i know young prince how deep he has prove okd thee how keen he sought thy youth through what a fire of great distress from which you come the brighter on dull indifferent objects or perhaps disliked a little it is but common bounty to shower relief but when our bitterest foe lies sunk disarmed and desolate then then to feel the mercies of a pitying god to raise him from the dust and that best way to triumph over him is heroic goodness oh let unhappy syphax touch thy heart victorious masinissa  masinissa monstrous this still do thou blast me with that cursed name the very name thy conscious guilt should shun oh had he heaped all ills upon my head while it was young and for the storm unfit had he but driven me from my native throne from regal pomp and luxury to dwell among the forest beasts to bear the beam of red numidian suns and the rank dew of cold unshelterd nights to mix with wolves to hunt with hungry tigers for my prey and thirst with dipsas on the burning sand i could have thanked him for his angry lesson the fair occasion that his rage afforded of learning patience fortitude and hope still rising stronger on incumbent fate and all that tried humanity can dictate but there is one cursed bitterness behind one injury the man can never pardon that scorches up the tear in pitys eye and even sweet mercys self converts to gall i cannot  will not name it  heart of anguish down down  sophonisba ah whence this sudden storm this madness that hurries all thy soul  masinissa and do thou ask ask thy own faithless heart snatched from my vows from the warm wishes of my springing youth and given to that old hated monster syphax perfidious sophonisba  sophonisba nay no more with too much truth i can return thy charge why did thou drive me to that cruel choice why leave me with my country to destruction why break thy love thy faith and join the romans  masinissa by heavens the romans were my better genius saved me from fate and formed my youth to glory but for the romans i had been a savage a wretch like syphax a forgotten thing the tool of carthage  sophonisba meddle not with carthage impatient youth for that i will not bear though here i were a thousand fold thy slave not one base word of carthage  on thy soul  masinissa how vain thy phrenzy go command thy slaves thy fools thy syphaxes but i will speak speak loud of carthage call it false ungenerous  yet shall i check me since it is thy country while the romans are the light the glory   sophonisba romans perdition on the romans  and almost on the too  romans are the scourge of the red world destroyers of mankind the ruffians ravagers of earth and all beneath the smooth dissimulating mask of justice and compassion as if slave was but another name for civilized all vengeance on the romans  while fair carthage unblemished rises on the base of commerce and asks of heaven naught but the general winds and common tides to carry plenty joy civility and grandeur round the world  masinissa no more compare them for the gods themselves declare for rome  sophonisba it was not always so the gods declared for hannibal when italy blazed all around him all her streams ran blood all her incarnate vales were vile with death and when at trebia thrasymene and cannae the carthaginian sword with roman blood was drunk  oh that he then on that dread day while lifeless consternation blackened rome had razed the accursed city to the ground and saved the world  when will it come again a day so glorious and so big with vengeance on those my soul abhors  masinissa avert  heaven the romans not enslave but save the world from carthaginian rage   sophonisba i will bear no more nor tenderness nor life nor liberty nothing shall make me bear it  perish rome and all her menial friends  yes rather rather detested as ye are ye romans take me oh pitying take me to your nobler chains and save me from this abject youth your slave  how can thou kill me thus   masinissa i meant it not i only meant to tell thee haughty fair one how this alone might bind me to the romans that in a frail and sliding hour they snatched me from the perdition of thy love which fell like baleful lightning where i most could wish and proved destruction to my mortal foe oh pleasing fortunate  sophonisba i thank them too by heavens for once i love them since they turned my better thoughts from thee thou  but i will not give thee the name thy mean servility from my just scorn deserves  masinissa oh freely call me by every name thy fury can inspire enrich me with contempt  i love no more  it will not hurt me sophonisba  love long since i gave it to the passing winds and would not be a lover for the world a lover is the very fool of nature made sick by his own wantonness of thought his feaverd fancy while to your own charms imputing all you swell with boundless pride shame on the wretch who should be driven from men to live with asian slaves in one soft herd all wretched all ridiculous together for me this moment here i mean to bid farewell a glad farewell to love and thee  sophonisba with all my soul farewell  yet ere you go know that my spirit burns as high as thine as high to glory and as low to love thy promises are void and i absolve thee here in the presence of the listening gods  take thy repented vows  to proud cornelia i would rather be a slave to scipios mother than queen of all numidia by the favor of him who dares insult the helpless thus pausing still do thou stay behold me then again hopeless and wild a lost abandoned slave and now thy brutal purpose must be gained away thou cruel and ungenerous go  masinissa no not for worlds would i resume my vow dishonor blast me then all kind of ills fill up my cup of bitterness and shame when i resign thee to triumphant rome oh lean not thus dejected on the ground the sight is misery  what roots me here aside alas i have urged my foolish heart too far and love depressed recoils with greater force oh sophonisha  sophonisba by thy pride she dies inhuman prince  masinissa thine is the conquest nature by heaven and earth i cannot hold it more wretch that i was to crush the unhappy thus the fairest too the dearest of her sex for whom my soul could dye  turn quickly turn o sophonisha my beloved my glory turn and forgive the violence of love of love that knows no bounds  sophonisba and can it be can that soft passion prove so fierce of heart as on the tears of misery the sighs of death to  to torture what it loves  masinissa yes it can be thou goddess of my soul whose each emotion is but varied love all over love its powers its passions all its anger indignation fury love its pride disdain even detestation love and when it wild resolves to love no more then is the triumph of excessive love did thou not mark me mark the dubious rage that tore my heart with anguish while i talked thou did and must forgive so kind a fault what would thy trembling lips  sophonisba that i must die for such another storm so much contempt thrown out on carthage so much praise on rome were worse than death why should i longer tire my weary fate the most relentless roman what could he more  masinissa oh sophonisba hear see me thy suppliant now talk not of death i have no life but thee  alas alas had thou a little tenderness for me the smallest part of what i feel thou would  what would thou not forgive but how indeed how can i hope it yet i from this moment will so devote my being to thy pleasure so live alone to gain thee that thou must if there is human nature in thy breast feel some relenting warmth  sophonisba well well it is past to be inexorable suits not slaves  masinissa spare spare that word it stabs me to the soul my crown my life and liberty are thine oh give my passion way my heart is full oppressed by love and i could number tears with all the dews that sprinkle over the morn while thus with thee conversing thus with thee even happy to distress  enough enough have we been cheated by the trick of state for rome and carthage suffered much too long and led by gaudy fantoms wandered far far from our bliss but now since met again since here i hold thee circle all perfection the prize of life since fate too presses hard since rome and slavery drive thee to the brink let this immediate night exchange our vows secure my bliss our future fortunes blend set thee the queen of beauty on my throne and make it doubly mine  a wretched gift to what my love could give  sophonisba what marry thee this night  masinissa thou dear one yes this very night let injured hymen have his rights restored and bind our broken vows  think serious think on what i plead  a thousand reasons urge  captivity dissolves thy former marriage and if it is with the meanest vulgar so can sophonisba to a slave to syphax the most exalted of her sex be bound besides it is the best perhaps sole way to save thee from the romans and must sure bar their pretensions or if ruin comes to perish with thee is to perish happy  sophonisba yet must i still insist   masinissa it shall be so i know thy purpose it would plead for syphax he shall have all thou dearest shall have all crowns trifles kingdoms all again but thee but thee thou more than all  sophonisba aside bear witness heaven this is alone for carthage to him gained by goodness i may be thine expect no love no sighing perhaps hereafter i may learn again to hold thee dear if on these terms thou can here take me take me to thy wishes  masinissa yes yes sophonisba as a wretch takes life from off the bleeding rack  all wild with joy thus hold thee press thee to my bounding heart and bless the bounteous gods  can heaven give more oh happy happy happy  come my fair this ready minute sees thy will performed from syphax knocks his chains and i my self even in his favor will request the romans oh thou have smiled my passions into peace so while conflicting winds embroiled the seas in perfect bloom warm with immortal blood young venus reared her over the raging flood she smiled around like thine her beauties glowed when smooth in gentle swells the surges flowed sunk by degrees into a liquid plain and one bright calm sat trembling on the main  the end of the third act act iv scene i sophonisba phoenissa phoenissa hail queen of masaesylia once again and fair massylia joined this rising day saw sophonisba from the height of life thrown to the very brink of slavery state honors armies vanquished nothing left but her own great unconquerable mind and yet ere evening comes to larger power restored i see my royal friend and kneel in grateful homage to the gods and her ye powers what awful changes often mark the fortunes of the great  sophonisba phoenissa true it is awful all the wondrous work of fate but ah this sudden marriage damps my soul i like it not that wild precipitance of youth that ardor that impetuous stream in which his love returned at first my friend he vainly raged with disappointed love and as the hasty storm subsided then to softness varied to returning fondness to sighs to tears to supplicating vows but all his vows were idle till at last he shook my heart by rome  to be his queen could only save me from their horrid power and there is madness in that thought enough in that strong thought alone to make me run from nature  phoenissa was it not auspicious madam just as we hoped just as our wishes pland nor let your spirit sink your serious hours when you behold the roman ravage checked from their enchantment masinissa freed and carthage mistress of the world again this marriage will approve then will it rise in all its glory virtuous wise and great while happy nations then delivered join their loud acclaim and had the white occasion neglected flown where now had been your hopes your liberty your country where your all think well of this think that think every way and sophonisba cannot but exult in what is done  sophonisba so may my hopes succeed as love alone to carthage to the public led me a marriagevictim to the temple and justifies my vows  ha syphax here what would his rage with me  phoenissa stay but this one trial more  heroic truth support me now  scene ii syphax sophonisba phoenissa syphax you seem to fly me madam to shun my gratulations  here i come to join the general joy and i sure i who have to dotage have to ruin loved you must take a tender part in your success in your recovered state  sophonisba it is very well i thank you sir  syphax and gentle masinissa say will he prove a very coming fool all pliant all devoted to your will a glorious wretch like syphax  ha not moved speak thou perfidious can thou bear it thus with such a steady countenance can thou here see the man thou have so grossly wronged and yet not sink in shame and yet not shake in every guilty nerve  sophonisba what have i done that i should tremble that i should not dare to bear thy presence was my heart to blame i would tremble for my self and not for thee proud man nor would i live to be ashamed my soul it self would die could the least shame on her unspotted fame be justly cast for of all evils to the generous shame is the last deadlypang  but you behold my late engagement with a jealous false and selfish eye  syphax avenging juno hear and can thou think to justify thy self i blush to hear thee traitress  sophonisba o my soul can thou hear this this base opprobrious language and yet be tamely calm  well well for once it shall be so  in pity to thy madness  impatient spirit down  yes syphax yes yes i will greatly justify my self even by the consort of the thundering jove who binds the holy marriagevow be judged and every public heart not meanly lost in little low pursuits to wretched self not all devoted will absolve me too but in the tempest of the soul when rage loud indignation unattending pride and jealousy confound it how can then the nobler passions how can they be heard yet let me tell thee   syphax thou can tell me naught away away naught but illusion falsehood   sophonisba my heart will burst in honor to my self if here i speak not though they rage i know can never be convinced yet shall it be confounded  and must i renounce my freedom forgo the power of doing general good must yield my self the slave the barbarous triumph of insolent enraged inveterate rome and all for nothing but to grace thy fall nay by my self to perish for thy pleasure for thee the romans may be mild to thee but i a carthaginian i whose blood holds unrelenting enmity to theirs who have my self much hurt them and who live alone to work them woe what what can i hope from their vengeance but the very dregs of the worst fate the bitterness of bondage yet thou thou kind man would in thy generous love would have me suffer that be bound to thee for that dire end alone beyond the stretch of nature and of law  syphax confusion law i know the laws permit thee the gross laws that rule the vulgar i am a captive true and therefore may thou plead a shameful right to leave me to my chains  but say thou base one ungrateful say for whom am i a captive for whom these many years with war and death defeats and desolation have i lived for whom has battle after battle bled for whom my crown my kingdom and my all been vilely cast away for whom this day this very day have i been stained with slaughter with yon last reeking field  for one ye gods who leaves me for the victor for the wretch i hold in utter endless detestation fire fury hell  oh i am richly paid  but thus it is to love a woman  woman the source of all disaster all perdition man in himself is social would be happy too happy but the gods to keep him down cursed him with woman fond enchanting smooth and harmless seeming woman while at heart all poison serpents tigers furies all that is destructive in one form combined and gilded over with beauty  sophonisba hapless man i pity thee this madness only stirs my bosom to compassion not to rage think as you list of our unhappy sex too much subjected to your tyrant force yet know that all we were not all at least formed for your trifles for your wanton hours our passions too can sometimes soar above the household task assigned us can expand beyond the narrow sphere of families and take in states into the panting heart as well as yours ye partial to yourselves and this is my support my joy my glory the conscience that my heart abhors all baseness and of all baseness most ingratitude this sure affronted honor may declare with an unblushing cheek  syphax false false as hell false as your sex when it pretends to virtue you talk of honor conscience patriotism a female patriot  vanity  absurd even doting dull credulity would laugh to scorn your talk was ever woman yet had any better purpose in her eye than how to please her pride or wanton will in various shapes and various manners all all the same plagues or open or concealed the bane of life  sophonisba must i then must i syphax give thee a bitter proof of what i say i would not seem to heighten thy distress not in the least insult thee thou art fallen so fate severe has willed it fallen by me i therefore have been patient from another such language such indignity had fired my soul to madness but since driven so far i mu stremind thy blind injurious rage of our unhappy marriage   syphax horror  oh blot it eternal night  sophonisba allow me syphax hear me but once if what i here declare shines not with reason and the clearest truth may i be base despised and dumb for ever i pray thee think when unpropitious hymen our hands united how i stood engaged i need not mention what full well thou know but pray recall was i not flattered young with blooming life elate with the warm years of vanity sunk in a passion too which few resign yet then i married thee because to carthage deemed a stronger friend for that alone on these conditions say did thou not take me court me to thy throne have i deceived thee since have i dissembled to gain one purpose  pretended what i never felt thou  say i have and if that  inspired my marrying  cannot now be wrong nay since my native city wants assistance more and sinking calls for aid must be more right   syphax this reasoning is insult  sophonisba i am sorry that thou do oblige me to it then in a word take my fullopend soul all love but that of carthage i despise i formerly to masinissa thee preferred not nor to thee now masinissa but carthage to you both and if preferring thousands to one a whole collected people all natures tenderness whatever is sacred the liberty the welfare of a state to one mans frantic happiness be shame here syphax i invoke it on my head this set aside i careless of my self and scorning prosperous state had still been thine in all the depth of misery proudly thine but since the public good the law supreme forbids it i will leave thee with a kingdom the same i found thee or not reign my self alas i see thee hurt  why came thou here thus to inflame thee more  syphax why sorceress why thou complication of all deadly mischief thou lying soothing specious charming fury i will tell thee why  to breathe my great revenge to throw this load of burning madness from me to stab thee   sophonisba ha   syphax  and springing from thy heart to quench me with thy blood  phoenissa interposes sophonisba off give me way phoenissa tempt not thou his brutal rage me me he dares not murder if he dares here let his fury strike for i dare die what holds thy trembling point  phoenissa guards  sophonisba seize the king but look you treat him well with all the state his dignity demands  syphax goodness from thee is the worst death  the roman trumpets  ha now i bethink me rome will do me justice yes i shall see thee walk the slave of rome forget my wrongs and glut me with the sight be that my best revenge  sophonisba inhuman that if there is death in afric shall not be  scene iii laelius syphax laelius syphax alas how fallen how changed from what i here beheld thee once in pomp and splendour at that illustrious interview when rome and carthage met beneath this very roof their too great generals asdrubal and scipio to court thy friendship of the same repast both gracefully partook and both reclined on the same couch for personal distaste and hatred seldom burn between the brave then the superior virtues of the roman gained all thy heart even asdrubal himself with admiration struck and just despair owned him as dreadful at the social feast as in the battle this thou may remember and how thy faith was given before the gods and sworn and sealed to scipio yet how false thou since has proved i need not now recount but let thy sufferings for thy guilt atone the captive for the king a roman tongue scorns to pursue the triumph of the sword with mean upbraidings  syphax laelius it is too true curse on the cause  laelius but where is masinissa the brave young victor the numidian roman where is he that my joy my glad applause from envy pure may hail his happy state why that contemtuous smile  syphax too credulous roman i smile to think how that this masinissa this romedevoted hero must still more attract thy praises by a late exploit in every thing successful  laelius what is this these public shouts a strange unusual joy over all the captive city blazes wide what wanton riot reigns to night in cirtha within these conquered walls  syphax this laelius is a night of triumph over my conqueror over masinissa  laelius masinissa how  syphax why he to night is married to my queen  laelius impossible   syphax yes she the fury she who put the nuptial torch into my hand that set my throne my palace and my kingdom all in a blaze  she now has seized on him will turn him soon from rome  i know her power her lips distill unconquerable poison o glorious thought  will sink this hated youth will crush him deep beneath the mighty ruins of falling carthage  laelius can it be amazement  syphax nay learn it from himself  he comes  away ye furies snatch me from his sight for hell its tortures all are gentle to the presence of a triumphant rival  laelius what is man  scene iv masinissa laelius masinissa thou more than partner of this glorious day which has from carthage torn her chief support and tottering left her i rejoice to see thee  to cirtha welcome laelius  thy brave legions now taste the sweet repose by valor purchased this city pours refreshment on their toils i ordered narva   laelius thanks to masinissa all that is well i here observed the king but loosely guarded true indeed from him there is not much to fear the dangerous spirit still not unworthy fear our matchless prize is his imperious queen is sophonisba the pride the rage of carthage live in her how where is she  masinissa she laelius in my care think not of her i will answer for her conduct  laelius yes if in chains till then believe me prince it were as hopeful answering for the winds that their broad pinions will not rouse the desert or that the darted lightning will be harmless as promise peace from her  but why so dark you shift your place your countenance grows warm it is not usual this in masinissa pray what offense can asking for the queen the roman captive give  masinissa laelius no more you know my marriage  syphax has been busy  it is unkind to dally with my passion  laelius ah masinissa was it then for this thy hurry hither from the recent battle is the first instance of the roman bounty thus thus abused they give thee back thy kingdom and in return are of their captive robbed of all they valued sophonisba   masinissa robbed how laelius robbed  laelius yes masinissa robbed what is it else but i this very night will here assert the majesty of rome and mark me tear her from the nuptial bed  masinissa oh gods oh patience as soon fiery roman as soon thy rage might from her azure sphere tear yonder moon  the man who seizes her shall set his foot first on my bleeding heart of that be sure  and is it thus ye treat your firm allies thus kings in friendship with you of human passions strip them  slaves indeed if thus denied the common privilege of nature what the weakest creatures claim a right to what they love  laelius out out  for shame this passion makes thee blind here is a war which desolates the nations has almost laid waste the world how many widows orphans and lovelorn virgins pine for it in rome even her great senate droops her nobles fail her circus shrinks her every luster thins nature her self by frequent prodigies seems at this havoc of her works to sicken and our ausonian plains are now become a horror to the sight at each sad step remembrance weeps yet her the greatest prize it hitherto has yielded her whose charms are only turned to whet its cruel point thou to thy wedded breast have taken her have purchased thee her beauties by a sea of thy protectors blood and on a throne set her this day recovered by their arms can thou thy self thou think of it with patience nor to a roman mention king  a roman would scorn to be a king  the roman people took liberty from out the very dust and for great ages urged it to the skies the dread of kings  masinissa be not so haughty laelius it scarce becomes the gentle scipios friend suits not thy wonted ease the tender manners i still have marked in thee i honor rome but honor too my self my vows my queen nor will nor can i tamely hear thee threaten to seize her like a slave  laelius i will be calm this thy rash deed this unexpected shock such a peculiar injury to me thy friend and fellowsoldier has perhaps snatched me too far for have thou not dishonored by this last action a successful war our common charge entrusted us by scipio  masinissa ay there it is  has not thy vain ambition oh where is friendship pland her for thy triumph to think on it death to think it is dishonor at such a sight the warriours eye might wet his burning cheek and all the roman matrons who line the laureled way ashamed and fad turn from a captive brighter than themselves but scipio will be milder  laelius i disdain this thy surmise and give it up to scipio those passions are not comely  here to morrow comes the proconsul mean time masinissa ah harden not thy self in flattering hope scipio is mild but steady  ha the queen i think she hates a roman  and will leave thee  scene v sophonisba masinissa sophonisba was not that roman laelius as i entered who parted gloomy hence  masinissa madam the same  sophonisba unhappy afric since these haughty romans have in this lordly manner trod thy courts i read his fresh reproaches in thy face the lessond pupil in thy fallen look in that forced smile which sickens on thy cheek  masinissa oh say not so thou rapture of my soul for while i see thee meditate thy charms i smile as cordial as the sun in may deep from the heart in every sense of joy i fondly smile  sophonisba nay tell me masinissa how feels their tyranny when it is brought home when lawless grown it touches what is dear pomp for a while may dazzle thoughtless man false glory blind him but there is a time when even the slave in heart will spurn his chains nor know submission more  what said his pride  masinissa his disappointment for a moment only burst in vain passion and   sophonisba you stood abad you bore his threats and tamelysilent heard him heard the fierce roman mark me for his triumph oh bitter  masinissa banish that unkind suspicion the thought enflamed my soul i vowed my life my last massylian to the sword ere he should touch thy freedom with the least dishonor but that from scipio   sophonisba scipio  masinissa that from him   sophonisba i tell thee masinissa if from him i gain my freedom from my self conceal it i shall disdain such freedom  masinissa sophonisba thou all my heart holds precious doubt no more nor rome nor scipio nor a world combined shall tear thee from me till outstretchd i lie a nameless wretch  sophonisba if thy protection fails of this at least be sure be very sure to give me timely death  masinissa cease thus to talk of death of romans of unkind ambition my softer thoughts those rugged themes refuse can turn alone to love  all all but thee all nature is a passing dream to me fixed in my view thou do for ever shine thy form forthbeaming from the soul divine a spirit thine which mortals might adore despising love and thence creating more thou the high passions i the tender prove thy heart was formed for glory mine for love  the end of the fourth act act v scene i masinissa narva masinissa hail to the joyous day with purple clouds the whole horizon glows the breezy spring stands looselyfloating on the mountaintop and deals her sweets around the sun too seems as conscious of my joy with brighter eye to look abroad the world and all things smile like sophonisba love and friendship sure have marked this day from out their choicest stores for beauty raised by dignity and virtue with all the graces all the loves embellished oh sophonisbas mine and scipio comes  narva my lord the trumpets speak his near approach  masinissa i want his secret audience  leave us narva  scene ii scipio masinissa masinissa scipio more welcome than my tongue can speak oh greatly dearly welcome  scipio masinissa my heart beats back thy joy  a happy friend with laurel green with conquest crowned and glory raised by his prudence fortitude and valor over all his foes and on his native throne amidst his rescued shouting subjects set say can the gods in lavish bounty give a sight more pleasing  masinsssa my great friend and patron it was thy timely thy restoring arm that brought me from the fearful desartlife to live again in state and purple splendour and now i wield the scepter of my fathers see my dear people from the tyrants scourge from syphax freed i hear their glad applauses and to complete my happiness have gained a friend worth all o gratitude esteem and love like mine with what divine delight ye fill the heart  scipio heroic youth thy virtue has earned whatever thy fortune can bestow it was thy patience masinissa patience a champion clad in steel that in the waste attended still thy step and saved my friend for better days what cannot patience do a great design is seldom snatched at once it is patience heaves it on from savage nature it is patience that has built up human life the nurse of arts and rome exalts her head an everlasting monument of patience  masinissa if i have that or any virtue scipio it is copied all from thee  scipio no masinissa it is all unborrowd the spontaneous growth of nature in thy breast  friendship for once must though thou blushest wear a liberal tongue must tell thee noble youth that long experience in councils battles many a hard event has found thee still so constant so sincere so wise so brave so generous so humane so well attemperd and so fitly turned for what is either great or good in life as casts distinguished honor on thy country and cannot but endear thee to the romans for me i think my labors all repaid my wars in afric masinissas friendship smiles at my soul be that my dearest triumph to have assisted thy forlorn estate and lent a happy hand in raising thee to thy paternal throne usurped by syphax the greatest service could be done my country distracted afric and mankind in general was aiding sure thy cause to put the power the public power into the good mans hand is giving plenty life and joy to millions but has my friend since late we parted armies since he with laelius acted such a brave auspicious part against the common foe has he been blameless quite has he considered how pleasure often on the youthful heart beneath the rosy soft disguise of love all sweetness smiles and seeming innocence steals unperceived and lays the victor low i would not cannot put thee to the pain   it pains me deeper  of the least reproach  let thy too faithful memory supply the rest pausing thy silence that dejected look that honest color flushing over thy cheek impart thy better soul  masinissa oh my good lord oh scipio love has seized me tyrant love inthralls my soul i am undone by love  scipio and art thou then to ruin reconciled tamed to destruction will thou be undone resign the towering thought the vast design with future glories big the warriours wreathe the glittering files the trumpets sprightly clang the praise of senates an applauding world the patriots statue and the heroes triumph all for a sigh all for a soft embrace for a gay transient fancy masinissa for shame my friend for honors sake for glory sit not with folded arms despairing weak and careless all till certain ruin comes like a sick virgin sighing to the gale unconquerable love  masinissa how changed indeed the time has been when fired from scipios tongue my soul had mounted in a flame with his  where is ambition flown hopeless attempt can love like mine be quelled can i forget what still possesses charms my thoughts for ever throw scornful from me what i hold most dear not feel the force of excellence to joy be dead and undelighted with delight soft let me think a moment  no no no  i am unequal to thy virtue scipio  scipio fie masinissa fie by heavens i blush at thy dejection this degenerate language what perish for a woman ruin all all the fair deeds which an admiring world hopes from thy rising day only to sooth a stubborn fancy a luxurious will how must it think you sound in future story young masinissa was a virtuous prince and afric smiled beneath his early ray but that a carthaginian captive came by whom untimely in the common fate of love he fell the wise will scorn the page and all thy praise be some fond maid exclaiming where are those lovers now  o rather rather had i never seen the vital light of heaven than like the vulgar live and like them die ambition sickens at the very thought  to puff and bustle here from day to day lost in the passions of inglorious life joys which the careless brutes possess above us and when some years each duller than another are thus elapsed in nauseous pangs to die and pass away like those forgotten things that soon become as they had never been  masinissa and am i dead to this  scipio the gods young man who train up heroes in misfortunes school have shook thee with adversity with each illustrious evil that can raise expand and fortify the mind thy rooted worth has stood these wintry blasts grown stronger by them shall then in prosperous times while all is mild all vernal fair and glory blows around thee shall then the dead serene of pleasure come and lay thy faded honors in the dust  masinissa o gentle scipio spare me spare my weakness  scipio remember hannibal  a signal proof a fresh example of destructive pleasure he was the dread of nations once of rome when from bellonas bosom nursed in camps and hard with toil he down the rugged alps rushed in a torrent over italy unconquered till the loose delights of capua sunk his victorious arm his genius broke perfumed and made a lover of the hero and now he droops in bruttium feared no more sinks on our borders like a scattered storm remember him and yet resume thy spirit ere it is quite dissolved  masinissa shall scipio stoop thus to regard to teach me wisdom thus and yet a stupid anguish at my heart repel whatever he says  but why my lord why should we kill the best of passions love it aids the hero bids ambition rise turns us to please inspires immortal deeds even softens brutes and makes the good more good  scipio there is a holy tenderness indeed a nameless sympathy a fountainlove branched infinite from parents to their children from child to child from kindred on to kindred in various streams from citizen to citizen from friend to friend from man to man in general that binds supports and sweetens human life but is thy passion such  list masinissa while i the hardest office of a friend discharge and with a necessary hand a hand though harsh at present really tender i paint this passion and if then thou still art bent to sooth it i must sighing leave thee to what the gods think fit  masinissa o never scipio o never leave me to my self speak on i dread and yet desire thy friendly hand  scipio i hope that masinissa need not now be told how much his happiness is mine with what a warm benevolence i would spring to raise confirm it to prevent his wishes o luxury to think  but while he rages burns in a fever shall i let him quaff delicious poison for a cooling draught in foolish pity to his thirst shall i let a swift flame consume him as he sleeps because his dreams are gay shall i indulge a frenzy flashed from an infectious eye a sudden impulse unapprovd by reason nay by thy cool deliberate thought condemned resolved against  a passion for a woman who has abused thee basely left thy youth thy love as sweet as tender as the spring the blooming hero for the hoary tyrant and now who makes thy sheltering arms alone her last retreat to save her from the vengeance which even her very perfidy to thee has brought upon her head  nor is this all  a woman who will ply her deepest arts ah too prevailing as appears already will never rest till syphax fate is thine till friendship weeping flies we join no more in glorious deeds and thou fall off from rome i too could add that there is something mean inhuman in thy passion does not syphax while thou rejoicest die the generous heart should scorn a pleasure which gives others pain if this my friend all this considered deep allarm thee not not rouse thy resolution and call the hero from his wanton slumber then masinissas lost  masinissa oh i am pierced in every thought am pierced it is all too true  i wish i could refuse it  whither whither through what enchanted wilds have i been wandering they seemed elysium the delightful plains the happy groves of heroes and of lovers but the divinity that breathes in thee has broke the charm and i am in a desert far from the land of peace it was but lately that a pure joyous calm overspread my soul and reason tuned my passions into bliss when love came hurrying in and with rash hand mixed them delirious till they now ferment to misery  there is no reasoning down this deep deep anguish this continual pang a thousand things whenever my raptured thought runs back a little  but i will not think  and yet i must  oh gods that i could lose what a fond few hours memory has engraved on adamant  scipio but one strong effort more and the fair field is thine  a conquest far excelling that over syphax what remains since now thy madness to thy self appears but an immediate manly resolution to shake off this effeminate disease these soft ideas which seduce thy soul make it all idle unaspiring weak a scene of dreams to puff them to the winds and be my former friend thy self again i joy to find thee touched by generous motives and that i need not bid thee recollect whose awful property thou have usurped need not assure thee that the roman people the senators of rome will never suffer a dangerous woman their devoted foe a woman whose irrefragable spirit has in great part sustained this bloody war whose charms corrupted syphax from their side and fired embattled nations into rage will never suffer her when gained so dear to ruin thee too taint thy faithful breast and kindle future war no fate it self is not more steady to the right than they and where the public good but seems concerned no motive their impenetrable hearts nor fear nor tenderness can touch such is the spirit that has raised imperial rome  masinissa ah killing truth  but i have promised scipio have sworn to save her from the roman power my plighted faith is passed my hand is given and by the conscious gods who marked my vows the whole united world shall never have her for i will die a thousand thousand deaths with all massylia in one field expire ere to the lowest wretch much more to her i love to sophonisba to my queen i violate my word  scipio my heart approves thy resolution thy determined honor for ever sacred be thy word and oath virtue by virtue will alone be cleared and scorns the crooked methods of dishonor but thus divided how to keep thy faith at once to rome and sophonisba how to save her from our chains and yet thyself from greater bondage this thy secret thought can best inform thee  masinissa agony distraction these wilful tears  o look not on me scipio for i am a child again  scipio thy tears are no reproach tears often look graceful on the manly cheek the cruel cannot weep even friendships eye gives thee the drop it would refuse itself i know it is hard wounds every bleeding nerve about thy heart thus to tear off thy passion but for that very reason masinissa it is hoped from thee the harder thence results the greater glory  why should we pretend to conquer rule mankind be first in power in great assemblies honor place and pleasure while slaves at heart while by fantastic turns our frantic passions rage the very thought should turn our pomp to shame our sweet to bitter and when the shouts of millions meet our ears whisper reproach  o ye celestial powers what is it in a torrent of success to bear down nations and overflow the world all your peculiar favor real glory springs from the silent conquest of ourselves and without that the conqueror is naught save the first slave  then rouse thee masinissa nor in one weakness all thy virtues lose and oh beware of long of vain repentance  masinissa well well no more  it is but dying too  scene iii scipio alone i wish i have not urged the truth to rigor there is a time when virtue grows severe too much for nature and even almost cruel scene iv scipio laelius scipio poor masinissa laelius is undone betwixt his passion and his reason tossed in miserable conflict  laelius entering scipio he shot athwart me nor vouchsafed one look hung on his clouded brow i marked despair and his eye glaring with some dire resolve fast over his cheek too ran the hasty tear it were great pity that he should be lost  scipio by heavens to lose him were a shock as if i lost thee laelius lost my dearest brother bound up in friendship from our infant years a thousand lovely qualities endear him only too warm of heart  laelius what shall be done  scipio here let it rest till time abates his passion nature is nature laelius let the wise say what they please but now perhaps he dies  haste haste and give him hope  i have not time to tell thee what  thy prudence will direct  whatever is consistent with my honor my duty to the public and my friendship to him himself say promise shall be done i hope returning reason will prevent our farther care  laelius i fly with joy  scipio his life not only save but sophonisbas too for both i fear are in this passion mixed  laelius it shall be done  scene v scipio alone if friendship pierces thus when love pours in his added violence what are the pangs which masinissa feels scene vi sophonisba phoenissa sophonisba yes masinissa loves me  heavens how fond but yet i know not what hangs on my spirit a dismal boding for this fatal scipio i dread his virtues this prevailing roman even now perhaps deludes the generous king fires his ambition with mistaken glory demands me from him for full well he knows that while i live i must intend their ruin  phoenissa madam these fears   sophonisba and yet it cannot be can scipio whom even hostile fame proclaims of perfect honor and of polished manners smooth artful winning moderate and wise make such a wild demand or if he could can masinissa grant it give his queen whom love and honor bind him to protect yield her a captive to triumphant rome it is baseness to suspect it it is inhuman what then remains  suppose they should resolve by right of war to seize me for their prize ay there it kills  what can his single arm against the roman power that very power by which he stands restored distracting thought still over my head the rod of bondage hangs shame on my weakness  this poor catching hope this transient taste of joy will only more imbitter death  phoenissa a moment will decide madam till then   sophonisba would i had died before and am i dreaming here here from the romans beseeching i may live to swell their triumph when my free spirit should ere now have joined that great assembly those devoted shades who scorned to live till liberty was lost but ere their country fell abhorred the light whence this pale slave he trembles with his message  scene vii sophonisba phoenissa and to them a slave with a letter and poison from masinissa slave kneeling this madam from the king and this  sophonisba ha  stay  reads the letter rejoice phoenissa give me joy my friend for here is liberty my fears are air the hand of rome can never touch me more hail perfect freedom hail  phoenissa how what my queen ah what is this pointing to the poison sophonisba the first of blessings death  phoenissa alas alas can i rejoice in that  sophonisba shift not thy color at the sound of death for death appears not in a dreary light seem not a blank to me a losing all those fond sensations those enchanting dreams which cheat a toiling world from day to day and form the whole of happiness they know it is to me perfection glory triumph nay fondly would i choose it though persuaded it were a long dark night without a morning to bondage far prefer it since it is deliverance from a world where romans rule where violence prevails  and timely too  before my country falls before i feel as many stripes as many chains and deaths as there are lives in carthage  glorious charter by which i hold immortal life and freedom come let me read thee once again  and then to thy great purpose reads the letter aloud masinissa to his queen the gods know with what pleasure i would have kept my faith to sophonisba in another manner but since this fatal bowl can alone deliver thee from the romans call to mind thy father thy country that thou have been the wife of two kings and act up to the dictates of thy own heart i will not long survive thee   oh it is wondrous well ye gods of death who rule the stygian gloom ye who have greatly died i come i come i die contented since i die a queen by rome untouched unsullied by their power so much their terror that i must not live and thou go tell the king if this is all the nuptial present he can send his bride i thank him for it  but that death had worn an easier face before i trusted him his poison tell him too he might have spared these times may want it for himself and i live not of such a cordial unprovided add hither had he come i could have taught him how to die  i linger not remember i stand not shivering on the brink of life and but these votive drops which grateful thus taking them from the poison to jove the high deliverer i shed assure him that i drank it drank it all with an unaltered smile  away drinks  scene viii sophonisba phoenissa sophonisba my friend in tears my friend dishonor not my death with womanish complaints weep not for me weep for thy self phoenissa for thy country but not for me there is a certain hour which one would wish all undisturbed and bright no care no sorrow no dejected passions and that is when we die when hence we go never to be seen again then let us spread a bold exalted wing and the last voice we hear be that of wonder and applause  phoenissa who with the patriot wishes not to die  sophonisba and is the sacred moment then so near the moment when yon sun those heavens this earth hateful to me polluted by the romans and all the busy slavish race of men shall sink at once and strait another state new scenes new joys new faculties new wonders rise on a sudden round but this the gods in clouds and horror wrap or none would live how liberal is death  methinks i seem to touch the happy shore  behind me frowns a stormy sea with tossing mortals thick while unconfined and green before me lies the land of bliss and everlasting freedom where walk the mighty dead all of one mind one blooming smile one language and one country oh to be there  my breast begins to burn my tainted heart grows sick  ah me phoenissa how many virgins infants tender wretches must feel these pangs ere carthage is no more soft  lead me to my couch  my shivering limbs do this last office and then rest for ever i pray thee weep not pierce me not with groans the king too here  nay then my death is full  scene ix sophonisba phoenissa masinissa laelius narva masinissa has sophonisha drank this cursed bowl oh horror horror what a sight is here  sophonisba had i not drank masinissa then i had deserved it  masinissa exquisite distress oh bitter bitter fate and this last hope compleats my woe  sophonisba when will these ears be deaf to miserys complaint these eyes be blind to mischief wrought by rome  masinissa too soon too soon  ah why so hasty but a little while had thou delayed this horrid draught i then had been as happy as i now am wretched  sophonisba what means this talk of hope of coward waiting  masinissa what have i done oh heavens i cannot think without distraction hell and burning anguish on my rash deed  but while i talk she dies and how what where am i then  say can thou forgive me sophonisba  sophonisba yes and more more than forgive thee thank thee masinissa had thou been weak and dallyd with my freedom till by proud rome enslaved that injury i never had forgiven  masinissa i came with life laelius and i from scipio hasted hither but death was here before us  this vile poison  sophonisba with life  there was some merit in the poison but this destroys it all  and could thou think me mean enough to take it  oh phoenissa this mortal toil is almost at an end  receive my parting soul  phoenissa alas my queen  masinissa dies dies and scorns me  mercy sophonisba grant one forgiving look while yet thou can or death it self the grave cannot relieve me but with the furies joined my frantic ghost will how for ever  quivering and pale have i done this  sophonisba come nearer masinissa  out stubborn nature   masinissa misery these pangs to me transferred were ease  a moment only an agonizing moment while i have an age of things to say  sophonisba we but for rome might have been happy  rouse thee now my soul the cold deliverer comes  be mild to syphax  in my surviving friend behold me still  farewell  it is done  o never never carthage shall i behold thee more dies masinissa dead dead oh dead is there no death for me snatches laeliuss sword to stab himself laelius hold masinissa  masinissa and would thou make a coward of me laelius have me survive that murdered excellence did she not stir ha who has shocked my brain it whirls it blazes  was it thou old man  narva alas alas  good masinissa softly let me conduct thee to thy couch  masinissa the grave were welcome  but ye cannot make me live oppressed with life  off  crowd not thus around me for i will hear see think no more  thou sun keep up thy hated beams and all i want of thee kind earth is an immediate grave ay there she lies  why to that pallid sweetness can not i nature lay my lips and die throws himself beside her laelius see there the ruins of the noble mind when from calm reason passion tears the sway what pity she should perish  cruel war it is not the least misfortune in thy train that often by thee the brave

now i am afraid the modest taste in vogue demands a strong highseasond epilogue else might some silly soul take pitys part and odious virtue sink into the heart our squeamish author scruples this proceeding he says it hurts sound morals and good breeding nor sophonisba would he here produce a glaring model of no private use ladies he bid me say behold your cato what though no stoic she nor
