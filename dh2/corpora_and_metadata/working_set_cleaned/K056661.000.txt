an essay on the sovthsea trade  an essay on the sovthsea trade  with an enquiry into the grounds and reasons of the present dislike and complaint against the settlement of a south sea company  by the author of the review  london printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row       an essay on the south sea trade a new trade being now to be set on foot and in a new manner with a capital stock and by the encouragement of the government it has been long expected when some able pen would have undertaken to guide the people of this unsettled age how to think about it  there has not been in our memory an undertaking of such consequence and so generally to be engaged in nor has there been an undertaking about which the people even those who are to be concerned have been so uneasy their opinions of it so confused and their knowledge of the manner and circumstances of it so small  there has not been an undertaking in this age introduced in such a method against which so many people upon so differing foundations are pleased perhaps some of them hardly knowing why to oppose themselves before it was formed it had the general suffrage of all mankind every man talked of it as a thing fit to be undertaken worthy of the encouragement of parliament government queen and nation the omitting it was taxed in print as a token of national blindness and a want of judgment in the ministry or managers of all the past years of this war the advantages the french made of it were looked upon as the great supports of the war to them and what encouraged them to carry it on and we were reckoned unaccountably negligent in that we either did not make those advantages ourselves or prevent the enemy from making use of them against us  several public printed pamphlets disposed to ridicule the carrying on a war in spain have laid down this as the main point which the first contrivers of that war should have attempted in the stead of it and have made a jest of their politics for the defect and when the great quantities of silver which the french squadrons and private merchant ships have brought home from the southseas have been spoken of it has been frequently accompanied with reflections and a general regret that those happy advantages should pass by us alleging that the english nation who are so much better qualified every way both by their manufactures to trade with islands to trade from and naval strength to manage and protect that trade should so long lie still and leave unattempted a trade which in the enemies hand is so fatal to us and which in our hands might be so fatal to them  yet notwithstanding all this such is the evil genius of our times that now such an undertaking is set on foot either it is so ill digested or the persons ushering it into the world are thought so disagreeable or unskilful or the thing itself so ill placed in our view that no undertaking of the kind has met with such a fate as this and if it must go on it seems thronged with difficulties calculated to destroy it in its infancy  it is needful therefore with the utmost impartiality to enquire into the case and see where the objections lie for against the trade itself quasi a trade to the southseas no body will or can raise any objection the objection must be founded either on the manner the method the persons the time of its introduction or against some part of the proposed scheme of carrying on this trade   to enquire out this to weigh duly the substance of the objections and set the whole in a true light that we may determine whether this trade is to be carried on or no is the design of this essay  the act of parliament which gives the power and limits the extent of this new trade has given it birth and a name but has not in the least directed in what posture the persons to be concerned shall put themselves in what manner they shall carry it on how they shall proceed or where they shall begin nor was it necessary that this should be made any part of the foundation which principally belongs to the superstructer the power of an act of parliament was necessary to establish a company to give them exclusive privileges to limit and restrain these privileges and settle bounds between them and other trades but how this trade is to be begun how carried on where they shall fix their footing from whence to go on progressively to the end designed this is left entirely to the dispose of the body to whom the power and privilege of such trade is deputed  now though in the order of things we see nothing can be objected against the regularity of this proceeding yet this seeming on one hand to leave the world in the dark as to the manner of carrying on this trade has on the other hand filled us with the crude and indigested or illdigested notions and guesses of the town every man giving his own opinion in such a manner that from the variety of proposals which every one makes from the difficulties raised and from the objections brought up against the manner of carrying on this trade we are now brought by unhappy degrees to all manner of confusion of thoughts about it and from every body laying down a way how to carry it on to every body crowding in their suspicions their suggestions of this and that being impracticable and the other too hazardous one way not safe another not just a third not feasible and the like as if because ye are not at a certainty which way it shall be done or which is the best way to do it that therefore it cannot be done at all  whether it be the real opinion of these objectors that the thing is impracticable in itself or whether some men for reasons worse grounded think it convenient if possible to have it appear so is not the present debate if the mist may be taken off by cool reasoning and people brought to see by a clear light they will be the less influenced by the design of any who may find it convenient for other purposes that this case should be as much perplexed as possible  to this end this short tract is made public in which if the case may be stated clearly the false glosses mists and shadows with which this age is amused taken away and the prejudices of people on either hand removed perhaps we may come to a right understanding of the case having premised this by way of introduction it seems naturally to lead the reader to a view of the doubts now started among us about this trade    whether this trade to the southseas can be carried on or no   whether the manner of proposing this trade be rational and just it seems indispensably necessary to enquire into these things first before we meddle with the manner how it is to be carried on since the objections that seem most to perplex the town now whether by design or no are laid against the thing in general that it will come to nothing that it is a chimera a sham has nothing in it is impracticable will be dropped again was taken up to serve a turn and the like  the allegations to sustain this are such as these    they say the scheme is impracticable that you propose a thing not to be done impossible in the general notions of trade that this was not a season for it that the countries you propose to trade with are in the possession of the french and spaniards our declared enemies that it is time enough to talk of trading thither when you have some of the country in possession that conquering nations is a work which does not belong to merchants and companies whose stock will be exhausted by any attempt of that kind that to talk of trade before conquest and conquest before any attempt made are equally ridiculous    that when any part of this country may be taken from the enemy and possessed it ought to be proved that the enemy shall not be in any manner able to dispossess you again to attack or molest you in which case commerce and trade will not only be interrupted but entirely disappointed    that neither of the nations who possess south america viz the french or spaniards will ever capitulate with you or upon any terms whether in peace or war consent to a free trade and therefore it cannot be expected that the scheme as it is proposed can answer the ends of trade    that it is evident the affair of trade was not the main end of the proposal but other aims are couched under this pretense which other aims are not pleasing to the parties concerned and therefore were glossed over with this pretended advantage to make them pass the more easily and undiscovered with the people but that the pretense being equally liable to objection as the thing designed so both together render the minds of the people more uneasy than they were before  the second question lies against the manner of proposing this trade which they say is violent and unusual a force upon the people against their will inconsistent with their liberty and that therefore it is entered upon with a general dissatisfaction cursed by them that are to go into it hated by those that refuse it and ridiculed by all that it is a mere project of a party a contrivance to serve the turn they are carrying on by it and to put a face of payment upon a debt which they know not what to do with and which made them uneasy and all this without a reality that they might stifle the clamor of those whose just demands upon the government could no otherwise be answered  if the objectors have not full scope given them here in relating their objections it is only because the reproaches and reflections which they study to set them off with and which they very plentifully bestow upon the government and upon the persons who they think are the instruments of it are left out as things which seem not to be necessary at all either to make their argument more forcible or add to the number of reasons and this omission it is hoped they will excuse in an author who is not writing to reproach any side but to calm and quiet the minds of every side and bring things if possible to a clear and right understanding  the reader will pardon the breach of order if in speaking to the objections the latter come first in course because as they lie rather against the part already acted introductory to the south sea trade rather than against the part that shall afterward be acted they seem to demand to be first spoken to  in order to this it may seem necessary a little historically to enter into the steps taken on every hand to introduce this affair into the world and this without excusing or accusing one side or other may be sufficient to give a right view of the thing and restore people to their temper in judging about it  in the consultations which of course employ the heads of the ministers of state every year about the time of the sitting of the parliament these three things generally are the chief    how and where to carry on the war   how to pay debts and support credit   how to raise money when these things in their ordinary course came to be debated the last parliament two things with a more than ordinary weight seemed to press upon the public    a vast debt which whether by the misconduct of the former managers or by the necessity of the public affairs is not to the purpose here was lying upon the nation in the several offices of the navy victualling ordnance etc together with other deficiencies amounting to several millions which as justice on one hand called loudly upon them to make good so on the other hand the public credit was touched by it and if some provision was not made for it there was reason to fear parliamentary credit would receive a blow which would not be easy to recover and which might be fatal to all the schemes and proposals for funds and loans which might follow since the people who had trusted the government with such great sums of money would too much influence the future lending and lenders of money if no care was taken to make payment to them whose debts were so just as well as so great    the second weight was the long omitted article of attacking the enemy in that most sensible part from whence they derived so eminently their chief support and from whence the sinews of war  viz their money were constantly supplied to them i mean their colonies in america the omission of which seemed a most unaccountable neglect in former times and persons and the attempting which seemed so inviting at this time on two accounts first as it would interrupt the advantageous commerce of the enemy and secondly as it would open a door of trade to our people which they never yet had opportunity to meddle with and this occasion being lost we were not to hope for another  note this last notion is founded on the treaty of the general confederacy called more commonly the grand alliance wherein by the  th article it is stipulated  that it shall be lawful for his royal majesty of great britain and the lords the states general by common advice and for the benefit and enlargement of the davigation and commerce of their subjects to seize by their forces what land and cities they can belonging to the spanish dominion in the indies and whatsoever they shall so take shall be their own vid the treaty of the grand alliance p     note this is the occasion which as above it is humbly presumed may never happen again and therefore was not now to be omitted  these two material articles coming into consideration at the same time it came into the heads of some whose thoughts were more especially intent upon applying proper remedies to both these maladies  that perhaps some method might be found out to cure them both with one plaster or as we say more vulgarly kill both these birds with one stone to exexplain it more fully  a scheme is formed wherein it is suggested that bringing both cases together  viz the debt which was to be paid and the attacking the enemy in america which was necessary to be done one might be so made assisting and concurring to and with the other that both might be with the more ease effected and brought to pass  in examining nicely the state of these several cases it appeared they were naturally to b divided into two heads of proposals contained in the following abridgement    the payment of the debt  and this required two considerations    to pay the principal debt o r    to establish a fund for the payment of the interest redeemable and until redeemed by paliament    the falling upon the enemy in their american plantations and this also had two branche    the dispossessing the french of the footin they had gained among the spaniards togethe with gaining such a possession in that part of amrica now called new spain as might answer the great end  viz pinching the enemy in that mo sensible part  viz the fountain of wealth a treasure by which as before they have be enabled to carry on the war and    the planting our own people in those rich climates where by laying a foundation of trade which was never yet engaged in our subjects might come to be enricd and made full amends for the loss of their spanish trade and also the channel of silver which has hitherto flowed with so full a stream into france and spain to the support of our enemies might be turned and might with the same fullness and freedom empty itself among our merchants and farther the settlements to be made there might be so many magazines of wealth to us and our posterity  it is unhappy that a design big with so many advantages has met with this misfortune that the joining together these two though great and just prospects has been casually and eventually the ruin of both not that we grant them yet ruined but that the difficulties started and the uneasinesses among us raised at the beginning are the causes of ruinous quarrels breaches and clamours about it which it is most easy to prove are founded upon the want of a right understanding and distinguishing the case by which also if perhaps in the contriving and joining these great events together any mistake has been made it might with ease come to be rectified without gratifying those who seem glad of private mistakes in order to push on the greater mistake viz the design of rendering the whole abortive and ineffectual  to distinguish therefore rightly of this matter and thereby come to a clear understanding in it we ought to debate it two ways    in its separate preexistent state as a debt and as a trade respectively    in the now conjoined circumstance as blended together whereby the debt and the trade is called though wrong and erroneously one south sea stock  in its separate or preexistent state we find as before two things upon the wheel or to speak more plain the ministry had two things upon their hands either of them necessary to be done and both having their respective difficulties in the management    the debt of the navy ordnance victualling etc it is no part of this work to enquire how the government came to be embarrassd with so great a debt unprovided for whether the concealing it from the nation so long or the very being a debt may be laid to any mans door or no is not the case here perhaps the writer of these sheets differs something from every side in his opinion and may reserve that opinion to defend those who may be defended and charge those who may be charged at another time at present it is of no signification to the point in hand and is therefore much better let alone than meddled with  the case of the debt is evident the act for making provision for it has set it forth at large there remained due and owing great sums for which there seemed to be no parliamentary provision made other than the credit of the public and which there seemed to be an absolute necessity to make some present provision for both as it respected the people concerned who were in distress for their money and as it respected the public credit which began to suffer by the high discounts allowed on sale of these debts  the debts are as follows l s d q to the navy    0    0  0  0 to the ordnance           0     to the transport        0  0     to army and transport debentures  0         0     deficient tallies on loans   0   0  00 0 again in the several offices        0  0     subsidies to hannover and zell       00 00 0 arrears of interest   000 00 00 0 in all          0    0  not reckoning into this account the principal and interest of money lent the year before upon the general mortgage and the interest of the whole sum from the   th of march to the   th of december      being nine months both which sums amount to one million seven hundred fiftyseven thousand seven hundred fiftythree pound nine shillings one penny more  this is the account as by the act of parliament for settling this matter it is cast up a vast debt  a vast debt to be cleared in one session of parliament and that in a session too in which so great a sum for the ordinary service of the coming year was absolutely necessary to be given and was given accordingly amounting to above six millions sterling so that inclusive of the sum above voted to be provided for this parliament were obliged to raise such a sum as never was heard of in the world and such a sum as when talked of in foreign countries in the dialect of their finances will make such a sound as must amaze the world and make them conclude that a nation which can raise such sums can never be subdued for want of money let any man but think of fourteen millions sterling to be raised in one session of parliament making in spain seven and forty millions of pieces of eight or in french livres or german florins above one hundred and sixtyfour millions  these things are not hinted to enlarge the sound of words but the sum being really thus great which was of necessity to be raised seems to argue very strongly with those gentlemen who being creditors to the government in the articles above seem to quarrel the manner of their being paid viz by an established interest that they ought to have been paid in money though with time that they should have been left to payments in course and that they had interest running on their bills and were better before than now  where i an utter enemy to the very name and persons of the present managers of public affairs were i bent to quarrel at all they did because they did it were i to set apart a pen dipped in gall to asperse and reproach every action of their ministry and resolved as far as in me lay to be a general evil genius to blast and scandalize things for the sake of men men for the sake of parties and parties for the sake of prejudice a practice too much the mode among us for some years past were this paper i say directed by such a spirit as this yet i could not find any room in this part of the affair to raise the least objection for i cannot see speaking with the utmost impartiality that in the circumstances of public affairs as they then stood the parliament could do any thing less or more than they did    they could not do less than take some care to bring the debt to some point of certainty  the demand was great and loud the sum was branched out into multitudes of hands and those hands such as being the trading sort of people could not the best of any be without their money this was attended with several intolerable evils    it caused the poor people to run to the stockjobbers to the maneating discounters and moneylending extortioners either to pledge or sell their bills and the payments in course appearing every day more and more remote and uncertain those cannibals for in some sense they are such made every day their advantage of it to prey upon the necessitous and indigent people till the discount of these bills came to near  0 per cent and the tickets of poor sailors to above  0 per cent discount if sold and loans upon them were worse they being not to be had under  0 to    per cent interest which in a few years would swallow up the whole debt principal and interest as is plain without putting the reader to the trouble to run over tables of calculation    this every day sunk the credit of the navy etc so that the rates of every thing rising in proportion to the discount of their bills would soon have brought the queens affairs to the same or a wose posture than his late majesty king william struggled with when the sum given by parliament through the extravagance of discount prices of goods and deficiences of funds etc were generally to be accounted in real aid of the public service to be not above one third of what they were called in the votes of the house  these things being before them it is left to any one to consider whether the parliament only giving money for the ordinary service of the navy victualling ordnance transport etc every year and so leaving payments to be made in course had been either prudent or practicable since every year the ordinary service brought us in debt farther than the sums demanded by accidents unforeseen and impossible to be provided for  there might be much more said but it is left to the most dissatisfied rational man in the nation to say whether to have left the case to payments in course as above had been any thing else than just a putting off the evil day and leaving the debt as a growing disease which may at present be borne with but will at last infallibly prove mortal bring a slow but certain death upon the body increasing every day till at last it should have been so great that they could never have paid it at all this i take to be the true impartial state of the case at that time and therefore i say the parliament could not have done less than they did  viz to bring the debt to a point fix the sum establish a fund of interest for the payment and annual discharge of the increase that they might know what they were in debt and might hereafter take a convenient occasion as the public affairs would permit to discharge the whole  to have paid neither principal nor interest must at last have made the debt intolerably great reduced the creditor to unsufferable hardships and in time the discount of those bills would have run at  0 and  0 per cent and the offices would have been able to have bought no stores or provisions at all but what they must have advanced ready money for which ready money either they would not have to pay or the payments in course must entirely stop  let any man judge this with impartiality and censure it if they can i must own i do not see what the parliament could do less than they did in the case of the debt  viz to put it upon a fund for the payment of the interest till provision may be made for the principal which principal it is evident they were not in a condition to make a present provision for and this leads me to the second head  viz    that i do not see what they could do more there are but two articles in the case of a debt   payment of principal   payment of interest  if the first cannot be done the last must this is only a consideration for the partys staying till the other can be done no man though he cannot pay a debt can be called a bankrupt if he offers security and pay the interest it is no reproach to the nation or the government to say they cannot pay this great principal debt at least now but you are offered in the nations behalf the payment of interest and that interest continued till the principal be paid so that in the common course and the nature of things the nation is no way to be termed bankrupt the debt is secured and were there not something else in it this payment would have been allowed to be very good for why should we tread on one anothers heels to purchase annuities of interest at but six per cent and pay our ready money with such eagerness for them and yet refuse the same interest for a debt which we would before have sold for  0 per cent discount or perhaps had bought with that allowance this is a most unaccountable paradox and to consider the debt in its separate capacity it is really something mysterious on other accounts of which hereafter  i might add here also to increase the wonder that the settlement allows the past interest to be cast up and to be added to the principal and the running interest for the future to be paid upon the whole so that the creditor turns usurer upon the government and receives interest upon interest which he had no title to before and which i mention because it will occur again to be spoken of as being a full equivalent to all that advance which can be recalled out of his hands for the stock of the south sea company of which by itself    this brings us to the consideration of this affair in its complex posture in its conjoined circumstances  viz as the payment of this debt is blended together with a thing foreign say some in its nature exotic and remote to the notions and understandings of the generality of the people particularly concerned in this debt out of their way foreign to their business and consequently disagreeable and unsatisfying  the ministry if i may venture to say so i believe had quite other notions of this part of the case and annexed this article to the other as an additional consideration to the debt aforesaid expecting no doubt that the exclusive privilege of a trade to the southseas should be received with a particular satisfaction should be valued at something in the rate of their debt and should have made the subscription more worth to those that subscribed that it was given in as an encouragement to all people who should hereafter trust the government that in consideration of their having been kept out of their money these things were thrown in both to gratify and oblige them   the turning their past interest into principal and   the giving them an exclusive trade to the southseas a trade so improved in the hands of the french and so capable to be improved in ours  i am persuaded speaking without the least respect of persons the projectors who contrived the government or ministry who managed nay the very parliament who granted this act understood this case in some measure as i have put it and the reasons are these    because really in the nature of the thing abstracted from prejudice and party it seems that it is certainly so how infinitely then does the plague of parties influence all our affairs and how does it change the very nature and consequence of things    because had they not conceived thus of it they would never have tacked it to a thing of this value and consequence since i believe it will be readily granted that either of these things  viz the settling a fund of interest for the debt and the erecting a public company for a trade to the southseas would have been leaped at apart by every one concerned in the first or capable of venturing in the last and i think i do not speak without book in either of these  it remains to enquire why that which in a separate consideration is so clear and without exception should fall under such a general dislike when brought together that there are some reasons to be assigned which are invidious personal and which the author of this cares not to mention is a thing rather to be sighed for than disputed but some reasons other than these may be hinted at    the seeming force there is in the act to make these the company and none else and to oblige these to be the people    the unhappy sorting of the people in the consequence of the act putting them upon the trade who are neither qualified by circumstances or genius to it and who by their ignorance have brought themselves to dislike it even because they do not understand  both these i take to be misfortunes to the proposers of this affair and yet both are things which   they could not easily foresee and   foreseeing they could not easily prevent without putting all upon a hazard    they could not easily foresee it for who could have imagined that a thing so generally applauded before which we had been blamed so often and so publicly for neglecting which our enemies the french have made such infinite advantage of should not be esteemed an advantage to us or that to oblige them all to an equal and proportioned subscription would be taken as an imposition i must own i am against all manner of force and think it had been better here left more to choice but how better i do not mean better for the people but better for the ministry that their work had been easier and the popular clamor less without it for the advantage proposed is to the people not to the ministry and the force then is no more than as you would have forced a child or a lunatic out of a house that was on fire and i rather put it thus upon a supposition that there is some constraint than argue though the case might hear it strictly speaking that really here is no force at all    but suppose the ministry had foreseen that the notion of a force how much soever to our advantage is so irksome a thing that it would hazard the bringing the proposal into a general dislike since liberty is so nice a thing that it should not be touched upon though it was never so much to the advantage of the person yet i own i do not see how they could go forward  viz in joining the two proposals and leave the thing more to choice than they have done  liberty is an invaluable privilege and no man can in his right understanding be easily able to be too careful of it  i remember a story of two english soldiers in catalonia this very war  the general finding that the liberty our people took in eating grapes and other luscious fruits in those hot countries was very destructive to the health of the men that it threw them into fluxes and fevers and destroyed great numbers of them made an order that none of the men under great penalty should eat any grapes  two english soldiers had transgressed the order and carried the punishment along with the crime for they fell into a flux and were dangerously iii  the officer ordered them to be brought before him in order to punish them one of the men answered the general may even let us alone for we shall not trouble him long however sick as they were orders in the army must be observed and they were brought before him for go they could not the officer asked them how they durst eat grapes when they knew the order the fellow boldly told him that in all his orders as to the service they had obeyed punctually and never transgrest but in this a what concerned themselves only they were english men and freemen and thought they ought to be at liberty to kill themselves whenever they had a mind to it  indeed upon these nice principles of liberty here may be some force alleged but in the main it cannot be so properly called force because every man that does not think fit to come in may remain in the state he was before nor do i think that state is or can be made worse than before because other provision than a parliamentary fund of interest could never be made or be expected to be made and if i judge right of the additional article which they call the south sea stock which is reckoned an encumbrance it stands upon this foot  viz that it takes nothing from the subscription which it does not first add to it because the interest which is paid by this subscription upon the arrear of interest allowed to be added to the principal amounts in time to much more than the  0 per cent which is to be called in by the company to form the stock for carrying on the trade  perhaps this has not been much thought of by those who complain of the hardships that this trade is to them and this may be farther improved by such whose business it is to defend the proposal in general these sheets are not prepared to defend one side against another but as far as is possible to set the matter in a clear light between both that they may see for themselves what it is proper to do or say in the case  it seems very unhappy to this nation that such uneasiness and such strife and clamor and partymaking should be among us about not the things themselves but the mere joining them together since as it is noted before take them asunder and i make no doubt but we should be very ready to embrace them both i explain my self thus  i cannot think but that all the persons concerned in the debt upon the navy transport victualling ordnance etc whose debt was in the posture and condition as was before observed would have been very well contented and satisfied with an act of parliament establishing a fund of perpetual interest at   per cent for their debt till the principal shall be paid and would have taken it as a very great advantage to have the arrear of interest added to the principal debt had the act gone no farther than this i firmly believe every one had been fully satisfied and thankful my reasons for it are these    why should we not think so when we reflect on the precarious condition of those debts before   how impossible to be paid in many ages by the course of the navy   how certain to increase every year by the same necessity that brought em to the height they were at    why should we not think so when we reflect how well content people were with the like method though with but   per cent interest in former cases as in that of the orphans debts in the city of london and how long and earnestly the creditors of the exchequer debt have been soliciting for the same grace in either of which cases the debt was not less just or more unlikely to be some time or other paid than this but if these are thought remote instances there are other nearer our view which i need not name let such as question this look back to our old transport debt parliamentary deficiencies loans on coals and culm glass etc irish estates army debentures and many other the odd ends of the late wars for which during the long solicitation in parliament and at the treasury this used to be the plea if they cannot pay us the debt let them give us a fund for the interes and we are satisfied then we can sell it then we can make something of it    why should not we think so when we see as is hinted above annuities settled on funds of interest at the same rate or rather lower and which annuities are but just the same thing a this so eagerly purchased with ready money so easily filled before the very signing of the act and bought afterward at the advance of a years and a year and halfs purchase  these are some of the reasons why i think had this fund of interest stood by itself as a security for the payment of this debt adding the arrear of interest to the principal debt and turning the whole into an annuity of    years at   per cent with the principal money to be then repaid nay though the principal money had been then to sink it would gladly have been accepted  now let us see the misfortune of our divisions and breaches among ourselves which occasions all this murmur  the annexing to this fund of interest the privilege of this trade to the south sea to be carried on by a stock to be raised upon  0 per cent only of this debt and even this  0 per cent obtained in the subscription over and above the debt by giving an interest upon the arrear of interest in the debt this is the fly in the sweet ointment of the apothecary which causes it however healing in itself to send forth a stinking savor  now it would be enquired here why this was added by the government was it for some gain the ministry were to make of it or was it given in as a supposed advantage to the subscribers to encourage them and to make amends for the loss they sustained by being out of their money  as to any advantage to the government by granting the privilege of a trade to the southseas and erecting a company for that purpose i shall give full space for any one that can to set those advantages down i profess myself ignorant of any real advantage made by it no not one farthing to the government or to the ministry either public or private  if there is any supposed advantage in the putting that part of the stock which remains in the treasury into a form so as it may be passed in payment etc as it now is i answer this is no advantage at all because the same would have been made in the annuities or funds of interest without it and perhaps more to the satisfaction of the receiver as well as to the credit of the payer and therefore this cannot be placed to the account of the south sea trade or brought as a reason why the government joined it to the interest of the debt nor indeed upon the strictest examination can i find that ever any advantage was pretended either by the ministry in proposing it or charged upon them by the objectors to it but that truly and bona fide the ministry proposed this merely as an advantage to the subscribers as an encouragement to the people concerned and as a means to promote a trade which might be in the end so glorious to the nation so profitable to the parties concerned and so manifest a foundation of the increase of wealth and commerce to the whole if there are any other clauses of advantage to the government than these i must own they are laid out of my sight nor i believe can the greatest enemies of the present project find them out at least i have never heard them assigned and shall say more to it when i do  on the other hand had the ministry proposed such a trade by itself had books been laid open in the city for a voluntary subscription of a stock to carry it on had the adventure been proposed with the favor and under the protection of the government with all its hazards with all its supposed impracticable parts had the privileges and limitations of the present act been offered what think you gentlemen objectors will you speak your thoughts impartially without party prejudice under this ministry or any ministry would it have been rejected would not any sum have been subscribed would adventurers have been found or no i am persuaded no man will say it would have failed no man can doubt it if they will consider the forward humor of the age in new adventures or the long interruption of trade by the war which has left the merchants of this city and nation less room to extend their commerce than formerly if they consider the flush stocks which our trading people are furnished with and their readiness to launch out where there are probable advantages these things considered there can be no doubt but such a proposal standing by itself had been very well relished by the generality of our people nay i will not say but they would have purchased the privileges and protection now slighted with the advance of money as was done in the east india trade and has been offered in others nor am i alone i believe in my opinion  but have we not something then peculiar in the fate of this nation which an indifferent man must needs lament that the surface of affairs can so much alter our temper and that our judgments are so over ruled by our prejudices that we cannot approve of that joined together which we would so freely embrace if offered apart i am not writing satyrs here nor pleading for a party if i were i should take some freedom on both sides i should perhaps reproach those people who will reject public advantages for the sake of private prejudices and because they cannot go along with the public in all their proceedings will not therefore go along with them in those wherein the general good is evidently carried on  i should on the other hand perhaps say that the joining these two unhappy happy thoughts together was no token of making a right judgment of the temper of our times and the only cause of the disorder that has happened among us upon this head  unhappy conjunction that two good things should make one bad one two things equally happy asunder advantageous pleasing and profitable apart but put together pleases every body the less and hardly and body so well as they would do asunder  if any man enquires why this is so why that which in itself is agreeable useful and profitable should not be so when joined with another thing equally so answer might be given several ways in brief thus    the thing is partycurst it is attacked by a variety of clashing quarrelling people some cry it so much up beyond its real merit and others run it down so far below that the strife has rendered it a bone of contention    some find fault with it because they do not understand it and some because they think they do  and the multitude of inquirers on one hand and expositors on the other some asking what it is who know well enough before others pretending to tell them what it is while they know nothing of it themselves by this the text is rendered intricate which in itself was plain enough and we amuse ourselves with difficulties where there are none    the project and the people are unhappily ill sorted by putting the trade as an appendix to the debt had the debt been settled on a fund as above had six per cent been allowed for interest till the principal had been paid or had they added one per cent more and sunk the principal the people had gone away well satisfied and they had sold for the full value if the government had had any reserved stock of them they would have been as current as chequer bills and might have been issued out on any account whatsoever but clogged with this south sea trade like two men in the water who are but young swimmers alone they might make shift to get out well enough and people at hand would help them but clasping together they sink out of reach and drown one another  so of the trade it falls among people unacquainted with trade that have no occasion to venture to sea understand nothing of merchandising and therefore they cannot think of it with any temper butchers grasiers cheesemongers ship chandlers carpenters smiths and other handicrafts brewers bakers coopers and the like and an infinite number of these to talk to these of a south sea trade is to talk hebrew and arabic like esops cock they spurn the diamond with contempt and will sell two of them for an handful of barley  these are some of the grounds and reasons of the contempt of the south sea trade the answers and remedies i reserve to speak of in its course  i come now to the particular article of the trade to the southseas and since it is to no purpose to object against the conjunction let us enquire into them complexly    is the annuity the worse for the south sea stock    is the stock the worse for the annuity  the annuity is the worse for the stock thus far  viz that  0 per cent upon the original stock is liable to be called for to be set apart as a stock for carrying on a trade to the southseas so far you may say the annuity is the worse  but then this is also upon a supposition that this south sea trade shall entirely miscarry and these objections lie against that supposition    if it does miscarry it does not follow that they must run out all their stock there are instances of many undertakings in trade where the parties finding a stop to the prospect or an improbability of success have laid it down with little loss perhaps one quarter lost or more and is all this clamor worth while for the hazard of   and    per cent supposing it should imscarry for it does not follow they must wind off all the bottom it is very probable the company will see whether they are likely to stand or no get or lose hold or fail before they have run out one quarter part of so great a stock as is proposed to be adventured here    if it should not miscarry but the trade be established and thrive all this argument is then at an end then happy would be the day that the stock was subscribed happy the thought that laid the scheme and he that cries it must down now flatters us then soonest with his good opinion of it and pretends he thought so from the beginning nor can the trade be then the worse for the annuity  but how can this be say the objectors succeed it cannot succeed the thing is not practicable the door is not open for a trade to set people to trade now is as if the government wanted more confederates and were to incorporate a body of men to make war not to trade that the new company shall join in the grand alliance and like a little republic help to carry on the war that we must fight our way through and trade au coup de canon a trade says one it must be a trade in blood we see no other trade in view for let which party soever prevail the trade must be carried on by force neither king philip nor king charles will let their subjects trade with you but by force on pain of the gallows and with all possible difficulty and hazard it is therefore but an amusement of trade say they without any reality and this being so visible a collusion they tell us makes all the rest be suspected and is a great argument of the general dislike  and thus i am brought to enquire as in the title whether this trade is to be carried on yea or no whether in reality such a trade is probable or feasible or whether it is impracticable and not to be attempted but with a folly next to lunacy which is suggested  to come at this question in a posture that may render the answer intelligible it seems necessary to state the thing itself questioned about and to lay down in as clear terms as possible what this thing called the south sea trade is what it means as it is now vulgarly accepted and what we are to understand by it  by the trade to the south seas we are to understand one of these three things    an open free commerce of the british nation to and in the several ports and places of america possessed by the spaniards either such as are or shall be reduced by us or by king charles iii with liberty to carry our manufactures and merchandises ships and factor thither directly without stop in old spain and to lade return and bring back from thence such goods as shall be purchased there and in short to trade thither as the french do now with the spaniards under king philip or as we do to the east indies  and in this sense i think it can be no offense to say this trade can never be carried on    or we are to understand a settling in some part of the spanish dominions in america whether by way of conquest factory or otherwise as by the  th article of the grand alliance quoted before we are allowed to do and keeping the said settlement as our own erect there a free market for our european goods the spaniards having free access to come thither to buy and we having liberty from thence to trade to their dominions above  and in this sense it is as impracticable to carry on this trade as in the other    or by a trade to the southseas we are to understand our seizing some such part or place in america whether already possessed or not possessed as we shall think proper and taking it as our own by virtue of the treaty above noted to settle plant and inhabit the same as a colony erecting there such trade with the adjacent countries whether spaniards or others and improving the native fruitfulness of the place as much as possible taking at the same time all opportunities to open a trade with the spaniards as much as circumstances will admit and which there is no question will be considerable  and this is the way a trade may be carried on  this i am of the opinion is the way of trade the government proposes and what they mean by a trade to the southseas and this is so far from being little or inconsiderable however it may be less than the golden mountains some people have formed notions of in their imagination that this trade is not only probable to be great but capable of being the greatest most valuable most profitable and most increasing branch of trade in our whole british commerce well worth all the hazard adventure expense and pains of the undertaking sufficient to encourage us in the prospect and reward us in the execution a trade which had it been offered to the merchandising part of mankind who understood trade who were employed in commerce and accustomed to adventures and not unhappily joined in and tied down to a rabble of casual subscribers neither inclined to capable of or in the least having a genius to trade it would no doubt have met with another kind of reception than now it has  it were to be wished that in order to set things right among us people would give themselves leave to distinguish a little between what is and what is not the design in this thing called the south sea trade and between what may be done and may not be done that we may not presently argue ourselves out of all the trade because we have not the gates of mexico opened to us this is no part of the thing the very word southseas in the act of parliament denotes otherwise the words find out and discover mentioned in the act tell us otherwise  we are to find out or discover some place or places in america where we may fix and settle a british colony which by the treaty is to be our own and is not this enough will not trade fall in will not the country produce to us as well as to the spaniards are we less industrious than they if we fix in a barren spot that is our fault but why not somewhere among the gold the silver the drugs the indico cocoa cocheneal and the like as well as they and being situated here fixed and settled can we want a trade did any man think all we were to do was only to carry goods to cartagena and panama and bring home money this bears no proportion to the design nor is of a duration worth our depending upon for it would be every day in the power of the spaniards to put an end to it and prohibit it again but our business is to seize and possess mark the word in the article of the grand alliance and to keep it for our own  this is then what we are to understand by a trade to the southseas  viz that we shall under the protection in the name and by the power of her majesty seize take and possess such port or place or places land territory country or dominion call it what you please as we see fit in america and keep it for our own keeping it implies planting settling inhabiting spreading and all that is usual in such cases and when this is done what are we to do with it why we are to trade to it and from it whither wherever we can with spaniards or any body that will trade with us and it is not saying we shall have no trade with the spaniards when we say they will not suffer their people freely to trade with us but let the english get a good footing on the south sea coast of america and let them and the spaniards alone for trading with one another let the king of spain prevent it if he can  this is what i am willing to have called the true design of this south sea company and i am the rather so because i have seen no scheme nor can i form any scheme in my thoughts upon any other foundation that is feasible in its nature or practicable in any of its parts  the contrivers of this undertaking know too well the temper constitution and state of affairs of the spaniards in america to have promised to themselves that by any treaty capitulation or stipulation either in new spain or old they will ever be brought to lay open the trade of their indies to the english or indeed to any nation of the world  perhaps they might be brought to admit a trade to particular places for provisions fish corn or such things as they may more particularly want in those places for the subsistence of their people or they may be brought to treat with you for an assento or permission to bring negroes to them a thing more proper for the african company than any other and the reason for that may be only because they know not where else to have them but that they will permit you to a free importation among them of your european manufactures and exportation of bullion from them is so contrary to the nature of their trade so destructive to their own interest and would be so fatal to the very life and being of the spanish dominions in europe i mean as to commerce that unless the spaniards are to be divested of common sense infatuate and given up abandoning their own commerce throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world and in short bent to their own ruin we cannot suggest that they will ever on any consideration or for any equivalent part with so valuable indeed so inestimable a jewel as the exclusive power of trade to their own plantations in america  the mistaking of this i believe to be another reason and perhaps one of the chief too of the pretended dislike and complaint against this undertaking  it is always a disadvantage to any undertaking to have it represented in unintelligible terms and to have it make high pretensions even to things impracticable in their own nature and nothing has been more the misfortune of this affair before us  i have spoken to this largely elsewhere and therefore shall say the less here but without doubt they who first represented this design as an undertaking to settle a free trade with the consent and by the concession of the government of spain to the ports and places possessed by the spaniards in america either ignorantly amused themselves by their own wrong conceptions of things or formed these notions and spread them about to amuse other people with a design to perplex their heads about it and bring the thing itself into contempt since noing can tend more directly to render a project  than to fill the peoples thoughts  notions of things impracticable in themselves and then banter them with the impossibility of putting them in execution  this is so much the worse too in this case by how much there was no manner of reason or occasion for this mistake and that the design of planting settling and possessing as is above noted on the continent of america or southseas is every way sufficient to all the ends and to all the reasonable wishes of the government in the first proposal fruitful of all manner of improvement capable of as many and indeed many more advantages than the supposed free trade with the spanish dominions which are already planted and this if it were duly considered would set us right in our thoughts about it i mean as to the proposal of such a trade being advantageous to england  had the subjects of this project been merchants bred to business acquainted with trade and whose business it is as well to understand as to seek out new adventures it had been embraced with all imaginable eagerness and satisfaction far from being run down and blown up in this manner by the town the disaster lies in this as before noted that the debt and the trade going together is ill sorted with the people it falls upon they that are qualified to claim the debt being some of them the worst qualified to embark in the trade of any people in the town and consequently the best qualified to find fault with and make a noise about it  no men are so apt to dislike and complain of a thing especially of this nature as those who do not understand it and as they are forwardest to complain so are they hardest to be answered and satisfied by reason and this perhaps is not the least disafter which at present attends this project which perhaps will never recover the blast of reproach thus cast upon it but by length of time the remedy which cures many distempers of the state besides this  i know there is another popular reason given us for the general dislike of this thing and that is the obliging all the people to subscribe whether they will or no and much is said on this article calling it a force an invasion of property and a breach of english liberty  now though the act of parliament may be pleaded in bar of this charge because what is done in parliament is every mans act and deed and a voluntary concession can be no force also it is no kind of a force that the law defends and the nature of the thing obliges to yet is here no real force in the literal sense nor does it say that those who will not comply to subscribe his debt shall never be paid it does indeed exclude them from the present benefit but it takes away none of their claim to both the principal and interest from the government as before however this is not my business here the parliament no question will defend the justice of their own acts  my business now is to enquire how this latter trade upon the foot of a colony or plantation can be carried on for having advanced and i think with good reason that it can be done no other way if i do not show you that it may effectually be done this way i should be supposed writing a satyr upon the undertaking which i assure you i am not  the design of possessing part of america i think a project worthy the nation and worthy the parliament and that this war has been the only juncture for it that has happened these fifty years and the like whereof may never happen again i see no misfortune in it but its being tacked to the debt abovementioned and consequently a set of people adapted to the concern who are every way unsuitable to it and incapable of understanding it better qualified to rail at it than embark in it this i say i count the misfortune of the nation in it and nothing but an exquisite management can prevent the evil effects of this misfortune nor had this disaster happened to it but from the earnest desire the proposers had to make the people some amends over and above for the scop of payment they had met with in their public debts and in any age but ours perhaps it would have past for an amends and for an advantage nay in ours it would have pst so had it not fallen upon such a promiscuous multitude of people not in circumstances to receive the advantages to understand the thing or put any hand to help forward the success of it  if these things have joined in with the public uneasiness of the times to render the project as it now stands unacceptable i cannot think that this does yet in the least lessen the value of a south sea undertaking in general as such and as it is a taking possession of some part of america to establish an english colony and erect a trade thither from england as aforesaid against which abstracted from the ministry the public credit parties and factions among us with which in this argument i have nothing to do against this i say i believe no man will raise one objection but all unanimously agree that we wish to see it put in execution as a foundation upon which may be built an immense trade a new and very much wanted vent for our manufactures of britain a new and as much wanted vent for the provisions and cattle the produce of our colonies on the north of america and a wonderful increase of our navigation strength and people  it is impossible for the author of this to finish what he had resolved to do here toward describing the nature of and subsequent measures for pursuing this design if this short essay appears acceptable i may in a second part go forward with it and therein distinguish more plainly between carrying on this affair as an improvement of trade and carrying it on as a national interest i know the endeavors used to make it appear a test of parties and a trial of skill between sides of this i shall take no cognizance but if a second part of this work comes to be published i shall endeavor rather to show what you may do than what i fear you will not do  i shall distinguish the conquest of that part we may plant in and the planting itself or in short between the queens part and the merchants and show you how absolutely necessary it is that they be kept asunder that the trade must be entirely unincumbered with war that it is the governments part not only to take possession but to keep the possession when taken that protection must be effectually provided for or else no attempt can be successful i shall endeavor to explain what this protection will be against whom in what manner needful what probable opposition may be expected and from who    i may give you an essay at the great question where this settlement may or can or must be made and in doing this i may make public some of the schemes which i had the honor to lay were laid before his late majesty in the beginning of this war and which were so approved of both by himself and several of those whom his majesty was pleased to communicate them to that nothing but the unhappy death of that glorious prince prevented that this attempt instead of that which has proved so fatal at barcelona had taken up the last seven years with the blood and treasure of this nation which in all probability ever now would have brought back as many millions as the other has carried out    i shall in such an essay give convincing proofs that if such an attempt may be made and in due manner carried on such a trade may be raised from it as shall sufficiently recompense the long tedious and expensive fatigues of the whole war  i shall conclude this with what i heartily wish    that those two likely and encouraging prospects of the public good had not been thus unhappily joined    that the parliament may if it pleases god so far to enlighten them yet separate them or rather restore them to their independent existence which i doubt not would equally satisfy the people concerned the first proposer and the whole nation  and what the advantage of both to the nation might be in such a restored separated estate shall be the subject of farther consideration  finis
