tree eden owain the place where i first made my entrance into this busy world the principal house in this township downing was built in the year      downing it certainly had no pretensions to the english name of downing which doubtlessly was a corruption from eden owain the tree or township in which it stands the founder was john pennant son of nicholas pennant a younger son of hugh pennant of bychton he married the heiress of the place and built a house which was much too large for the estate the stones were brought from nantybi a dingle opposite to the house there is a tradition that the stones were rolled along a platform from the top of the quarry raised on an inclined plane till they reached the building and there were elevated as the work increased in height till the whole was finished the house is in form of a roman h a mode of architecture very common in wales at that period on the front is the pious motto frequent on the welsh houses heb dduw heb ddim a duw a dign which signifies without god there is nothing with god enough there were only four generations of this branch thomas the last died in      and was buried in whiteford church on june  th of the same year he bequeathed his estate to my father who made the house his residence his own father being living and the house much better than our paternal  m earth p to pre all disputes about the place and time of  th be it known that i was born on june   th      old style in the room now called the yellow room that the celebrated mrs cayn of srowsbury ushered me into the world and delivered me to miss jy perry of merton in this parish who to her dying day never failed telling me ah you rogue i remember you when you had not a shirt to your back  ancient mode of nursing i was according to ancient custom put out to nurse at a neighboring farmhouse called pentre covered with thatch and which at present would be deemed a cottage my nurses maiden name was pennant and from the time of this great event she resumed it notwithstanding she had long used that of her husband john pierce a freeholder of above a hundred a year he and she were fond of this charge which was ever esteemed a peculiar favor and honor the affection and connection is still retained in many parts of ireland but what is unfortunate in more civilized wales both seem at present almost extinguished  of the affection between the fosterfather fostermother affection of oster fathers etc and fosterbrother the instances were frequent the fidelity of robin ap inko fosterbrother to jevan ap vychan of the house of gwedir in the reign of edward iv was a most noted one in a fatal feud between jevan and his brotherinlaw rys ap howel the latter expecting a fray provided a butcher to murder jevan in the confusion of the battle and to him he gave orders in these terms the butcher not being acquainted with jevan ap rys said thou shall soon discern him from the rest by his stature and he will make way before him there is a fosterbrother of his one robin ap inko a little fellow that uses to match him behind take heed of him for be the encountre never so hot his eye is ever on his fosterbrother  and so it happened robin suspected the treachery and seeing the butcher watching his opportunity came behind him and knocked him on the head in the moment in which he had come behind jevan and had aimed one at that of his beloved fosterbrother the patrimony of his faithful follower was in the parish of llanderfel and to this day retains the name of tyddin inko  in those days there was great competition for the honor of fostering the children of great men horrid murden the parson of llanvrothen near traethmawr had taken a child of jevan ap robert to nurse this so grieved the wife of rys her husband having more land in the parish than jevan had that she determined to have the poor parson put to death a woman was sent to his house who was kindly taken in at midnight she set up hideous cries pretending that the parson had attempted to ravish her this only was a pretense for revenge the woman had as the historian says to her brethren three notable rogues of the damned crew fit for any mischief being followers of howel ap rys these watched the parson and as he went one morning to look to his cattle cruelly murdered him the sequel is told in the welsh tour vol i p     and the proper end of the villains  these extracts are taken from the history of the gwedir family a curious publication for which we are indebted to my true friend the honorable daines barrington  when i came into possession of downing by the death of my excellent father david pennant the house had partly transome partly sashed windows by consulting a drawing of it in that state may be known the changes made by myself with the estate i luckily found a rich mine of lead ore which enabled me to make the great improvements i did the grounds were much hurt by a vile road running in front and on one side of the house and through the middle of the demesne to the hamlet called gwibnant gwibnant or the meandring glen the house was planted up almost to the door which gave it a very melancholy gloom but i soon laid open the natural beauties of the place and by the friendly exchange sir roger mostyn made with me enlarged the fine scenery of the broken grounds the woods and the command of water the walks in the near grounds the fields and the deep and darksome dingles are at left three miles in extent and the dingle not ill united with the open grounds by a subterraneous passage under the turnpike road i am not a little flattered by the admiration of those who visit the place mr boydel has published a fine engraving of the house among his welsh feats i have as a headpiece to p   of this work given it in the prettiest representation  grounds  downing   my grounds consist of very extensive walks along the fine swelling lands beneath the shady depth of the glens grounds or through the contracted meads which meander quite to the shore views the views are various toward the hills and the ancient pharos on garreg over the channel of the dee the hilbree isles on one of which had been a cell of benedictines dedicated to our lady and dependent on chester and possibly the hermitage called hilburghey which in the second of edward iii received ten shillings a year from a charity belonging to the castle at chester the dreary woodless tract of wiral a hundred of cheshire stretches eastward as far as its capital chequered with black heaths and with corn a bad return to the prospect of our wooded slope yet formerly was so well clothed as to give occasion to this distich from blacon point to hilbree a squirrel might leap from tree to tree but our sea view is animated with the sight of the numerous fleets entering and sailing out of the port of liverpool now swelled into a vast emporium from a century and a half ago a most insignificant fishing town  in the near view below the house are the ruins of the abbey of molandina notwithstanding they are not very considerable they do not want their beauties let me confess that this is a trap for antiquaries the name derived from mola being a deserted mill antiquated by myself as an imposture innocente fairy oak above this is a spreading oak of great antiquity size and extent of branches it has got the name of the fairy oak in this very century a poor cottager who lived near the spot had a child who grew uncommonly peevish the parents attributed this to the fair and imagined that it was a changeling they took the child put it in a cradle and left it all night beneath the tree in hopes that the tylwydd teg or fairy family or the fairy folk would restore their own before morning when morning came they found the child perfectly quiet so went away with it quite confirmed in their belief shakspeare and spenser allude to this popular fiction spenser is particularly allusive to the above and her base elrin breed there for thee left such man do changelings call so changed by fairies theft besides this oak is another on a spot within the pleasuregrounds called mount airy it probably is of superior age to that i have just mentioned it is truly picturesque and has in it furrows so deep and of aspect so uncommonly venerable as to render its shade as worthy of the solemn rites of the druids as those of mona in its most prosperous days at a small distance below are three evergreen oaks of a considerable size i do not know how they came there for the wood in my fathers time was in a state of nature below those is a very ancient towering oak of great size and in a dingle near the field called the coxet is a tree of the same species of great size and beauty yet retaining the very habit of a vigorous sapling these and a fine spanish chestnut are the boast of my sylvan shades if i digrese beyond them let me mention a most ancient pear tree which gives name to a field coitia pren gellig the stem has not a relic of sound timber it consists entirely of  rotten wood yet bears annually most plentiful crops of a choaky pear  the house itself has little to boast of house i fortunately found it incapable of being improved into a magnitude exceeding the revenue of the family it has a hall which i prefer to the rural impropriety of a paltry vestibule a library thirty feet by eighteen a parlor capable of containing more guests than i ever wish to see at a time septem convivium novem convicium and a smoakingroom most antiquely furnished with ancient carvings and the horns of all the european beasts of chase this room is now quite out of use as to its original purpose above stairs is a good drawing room in times of old called the dining room and a tearoom the sum of all that are really wanted  i have cowleys wish realized a small house and large garden  the library is filled by a numerous collection of books library principally of history natural history and classics my own labors might fill an ordinary bookroom many of them receive considerable value from the smaller drawings and prints with which they are illustrated on the margins as well as by the larger intermixed with the leaves among the latter are several drawings of uncommon beauty by that eminent hand mr nicholas pococke these relate either to the ferroe isles or to iceland others to the distant tibet or boutan i was favored by john thomas stanley esquire with permission to have copies made of the first and by warren hastings esquire of the last among my own labors outlines of the globe i value myself on my ms volumes of the outlines of the globe in xxii volumes folio on which uncommon expense has been bestowed in ornament and illuminations  hall in the hall are some very good pictures by peter paou a fine painter of animals and birds four express the three climates two of them are of the torrid zone one the temperate and another the frigid all illustrated by suitable animals and scenery the two last have much merit besides there is a romantic view in otabeite and another of part of an isle of ice near the antartic circle with three different species of those strange birds the pinguins and two different species of the petrels this was taken from an original sketch made on the spot by doctor john reinhold forster  portraits the parlor is filled with numbers of portraits and other paintings the greater part of the first are reduced from the originals by moses griffith in a most masterly manner a few excepted they are family pictures a very large one covers the end of the room the figures are three quarters and dressed in the manner in which vandyk did his the man has a remarkable good look long hair whiskers and small beard his wife is by him between them a boy with a basket of flowers and by him a grehound david pennant wife and child these represent david pennant sheriff of the county in      his wife margaret pennant of merton and their eldest son piers this piece is done in a superior style a good imitation of vandyk a grand column and a rich carpet is introduced a flattery of the artist for in those days we were far from being able to pay for even a performance of that value it probably was done in the troublesome times when some painter of merit might have wandered about the country and have been glad of working for his meat and his drink and some trifle for other necessaries  my great great grandfather was an officer in the garrison of denbigh when it was besieged and taken by my maternal great great grandfather general mytton my loyal ancestor suffered there a long imprisonment bychton was plundered and the distress of the family so great that he was kept from starving by force of conjugal affection for his wife often walked with a bag of oatmeal from the parish of whiteford to denbigh to relieve his wants  notwithstanding the zeal of his house for the loyal cause it suffered very little in respect to the general composition of delinquents the bychton estate only paid    l    s whereas robert pennant of downing paid not less than     l for his estate which was very far inferior to the other the occasion was this robert pennant had the misfortune to have a hotheaded young fellow in his house when a small detachment of the adverse party with a cornet at the head approached the place he persuaded the family to resist the doors were barricadoed a musket fired and the cornet wounded the house was soon forced and of course plundered but such was the moderation of the party no carnage ensued and the only revenge seems to have been the disproportionate fine afterward levied  notwithstanding his brother hugh is not delivered down to us on canvas mayor hugh pennant i cannot omit the mention of him as a brave and faithful officer in the royal army serving in north wales he attained the rank of major and particularly distinguished himself in the isle of anglesey in      that island in imitation of several of the english counties rose in order to set the king at liberty and to restore monarchy to the oppressed kingdom numbers of royalists resorted to this island from different parts of north wales and made a general muster in the middle of the island under the command of thomas lord bulkeley the parliament determined on their reduction and made conwy the place of rendezvous general myttn was the commanding officer he landed at cadnant where hugh pennant was posted who after undergoing a severe fire from the rocks and hedges being left unsupported was obliged to retreat two captains posted at porthaethwy made so speedy a flight that it was said that one of them at lest had previously received the bribe of  0 l for his treachery in the battle which soon after was fought near beaumaris hugh pennant charged the enemy with great spirit and was very near taking that brave officer colonel lothian prisoner some others of the loyal officers conducted themselves with spirit but in general the islanders are allowed by their own historian a schoolmaster of beaumaris to have behaved very ill an anglesey captain was directed to keep the church he posted his men in it locked them safely up and then ran away with the key in his pocket the historian tells us that he was called captain church to his dying day they certainly had great valor at distant danger as soon as the enemy appeared marching over penmaenmawr at lest four miles from beaumaris the anglesey people began to bustle drums beat trumpets sounded and great vollies of small shot and great were discharged at which the enemy says the sage pedagogue took little or no notice major pennant was probably taken in beaumaris castle with the royal army to which place it had retired after the defeat as soon as he obtained his liberty he resided at brynshone in the parish of yskivig where he died on march  0th      and was interred at whiteford  he was married to margaret aungier baroness of longford one of the daughters of sir thomas cave of slimford in the county of northampton knight this lady had four husbands she paid our country the compliment of beginning and ending with a welshman her first was sir john win of gwedir junior they lived unhappily together which sent him on his travels into italy where he died at lucca she then took one of the milesian race for she married sir francis aungier master of the rolls in ireland afterward created baron of longford thirdly she gave her hand to an englishman sir thomas wenman of oxfordshire and finally she resigned her antiquated charms to our valiant major who in the year      deposited her with his ancestors in the church at whiteford  the next is a single figure a halflength of pyers pyers pennant son of david pennant with long hair a long laced cravat and in a singular gown his wife is in another frame a handsome woman with her neck naked and long tresses flowing on each side she was one of the celebrated seven sisters of the house of gwysanney near to mold who were all married about the same time and all became widows and of them only two of them renewed the nuptial vow these ladies being much talked of even to this day i add their names and those of their spouses let me premise that they were daughters of robert davies by anne eldest daughter of sir peter mutton knight chief justice of north wales and owner of llanerch in the vale of clwyd  anne their first daughter married john thelwall of plascoch katherine pyers peant of bychton dorothy married george hope of doddleston elizabeth thomas humphries of boddlewiddan margaret john holland of tyrddan ellen george win of leeswood jane thomas edwards of rhual pyers pennant who occasioned this notice died in       i cannot well ascertain the next portrait which is of a handsome young man in long hair flowing and curling gracefully on his shoulders he is dressed in the military dress of the time a laced turnover and an elegant buff coat much ornamented and a musket with an awkward old lock in his hand and a sword by his side i suspect him to have been a son of pyers pennant who was slain the illconducted expedition to the isle rhi under the duke of buckingham in      he probably was in the company of his neighbor captain richard mostyn a younger son of mostyn who fell in the same spot  peter pennant the portrait of my grandfather peter pennant represents what i well remember him to have been a fine person and of a jovial complexion he is dressed in a white tyewig and a red coat on the death of his first wife catherine second daughter of the wynnes of glynne in merionethshire he went into the army in the reign of queen anne and served at the siege of brussels disgusted with his colonel sir thomas prendergast after demanding satisfaction which sir thomas declined he resigned and passed the remainder of his days at bychton where he lived in great hospitality and died in october      aged     his uncle john pennant in a full brown wig john pennant of chelsea and brown gwn by his jolly rubicund face he appears to have been a thoough bonvivant yet with much the air of the gentleman the original a well painted picture was given to us by john win of coperleney in this neighborhood who by the inscription on the back seems to have taken as much pride in being thought the friend of john pennant as sir fulke grevil did in being the friend of sir philip sydney many a bottle had they emptied during their thirty years friendship he resided at chelsea where my father often visited him during the boyish holydays my father told me he was frequently taken by him to the coffeehouse where he used to see poor richard cromwell a little and very neat old man with a most placid countenance the effect of his innocent and unambitious life  i imagine that the coffeehouse was don salteros to which he was a benefactor and has the honor of having his name inserted in the catalogue i have when a boy seen his gift to the great saltero which was a lignified hog i fear that this matchless curiosity is lost at left it is omitted in the last or   th edition of the catalogue  what author of us can flatter himself with delivering his works down to posterity in impressions so numerous as the labors of don saltero  john pennant died in   0  aged    and was interred in the churchyard of chelsea and had a small monument to his memory erected against the wall of the church by his wife daughter to mr parry of merton a house and small estate which we now possess above a mile from downing her affection provided the following epitaph which i give more on that account than for the excellency of the composition  epitaph near this place under a stone with his name on it lies the body of john pennant gent second son of david pennant of bichton in the county of f esquire who departed this life the  th of june   0  aged    in whose memory this monument was erected by his mournful widow who designs to be interred in the same grave had virtue in perfection power to save the best of men from the devouring grave pennant had lived but it is in vain to fly the fatal stroke where all are doomed to die farewell loved spouse since want of words appears to express my grief i will moan thy loss with tears which like nles cataracts shall rumble down and with their briny floods my passion drown here may thy ashes undisturbed remain till thy wifes dust revisits thee again then sacred quiet till the day of doom seal the enclosure of our catacomb his arms are those of the pennants here is those of edwyn lord of tegengle  robert pennant another of my kindred lies in pancras churchyard i may be excused for mentioning him as his epitaph is far from inelegant this youth robert pennant was son to pierce pennant by katherine one of the seven sisters of gwysanney and was snatched away at the age of twentyfour in the year      he was attended to his grave as was then the custom by a most numerous set of friends among whom were the two bishops and numbers of the first gentry of north wales who happened then to be in town thus is delivered his amiable character gentilibus suis compositus robertus pennant filius  dus lyercei pennant de bychton in com flint arm

nostri et vale  elizabeth pennant the portrait of my venerable aunt elizabeth pennant was drawn in water colors in her old age by moses griffith and does him much credit it is a very strong likeness dressed in the old fashion with a long white handkerchief flung carelessly over her cap the countenance shows the goodness of her heart i speak gratefully of a friend who doated on me and mine i lost

of my power to reap from him every advantage that his good sense good heart and polished manners wished to instill into my susceptible mind  i conclude the accounts of the portraits of our family with

portraits that from the fine picture of sir roger mostyn knight sir roger mostyn knt of whom more will be said when i arrive at the house is an admirable performance  superior even to the portrait of

last is by rysbrack a painter born at antwerp about the middle of the last century  i may conclude with a very neat drawing by moses griffith of the ancient gardens of llanerch in the italian taste of the middle of the last century made by mr mutton davies after his return from italy they were fine in that style decorated with waterworks statues dials etc etc emitting water to the astonishment of

to our family in the last century it was inhabited by my grandfather during the lifetime of his father my uncle john pennant and two of my aunts were born there i have often heard it said with pride that once three baronets were entertained there by the hospitable owner i vehemently suspect from the size of the house that at lest two of them must have slept together  my father has often told me a ridiculous story of the effect of a jolly evening passed there by some of the convivial neighbors they had made very free with some ale which had been brewed with malt made of soul barley unfortunately mixed with the seeds of certain plant which brought on a temporary blindness the guests had not gone far before the symptoms seized them and they were led back to their host who was in the same condition they were suddenly alarmed with a violent scream in a female voice it seems that the butleress or female butler had in her repeated visits to the cellar sipped too plentifully of the cwrw and terrified with the effect betrayed herself by giving unguardedly full vent to her fears  in those days the neighbors were much addicted to terming terming i e brewing a barrel of ale at some favorite alehouse and staying there till it was all drunk out they never went to bed even should the term last a week they either slept in their chairs or on the floor as it happened then awoke and resumed their jollity at length when the barrel was exhausted they reeled away and the hero of this bacchanalian rout always carried the spiggot in triumph coursing was very frequently the occasion of these terms each gentleman brought his grehound and often made matches more for the glory of producing the best dog than for the value of the bet  at half a mile distance south of this

peckham archbishop of canterbury containing among numbers of other grievances the wrong done to the men of merton the archbishop whom in      came down on the christian design of reconciling the differences between edward i and llewelyn seemed to pity their sufferings but it it not probable that the king paid any attention to their representations as he was then in full march against our gallant countrymen determined to make an effectual conquest of an enemy who gave him so much serious disturbance  above three hundred yards from my house downing ucha on the opposite side of a dingle stands another downing the seat of my worthy neighbor and friend thomas thomas esquire his good father came into possession of it about the year      by marriage with miss mary lloyd heiress of the place and descended from edwyn prince or lord of tegengl his llys or palace was near northop my muchlamented friend the reverend john lloyd of caerwys was of opinion that the fat figure on one of the tombstones in northop church represented this chieftain  mr thomas was of llechweddgarth in montgomeryshire cruel fed see tour in wales ii     descended from brochwel yscythrog prince of powis who bore sable three nags heads erased argent before mr thomass arrival a fierce feud raged between the two houses as usual in days of yore which on his appearance was changed into lasting peace i cannot but mention a cruel revenge which the montagues used to take on their neighbor capulet by the advantage of a stream which ran through their grounds in its way to our kitchen where it was applied to the purpose of a jack for the turning of a spit how often has that important engine been stopped before it had performed half its evolutions our poor capulet swearing lady crying cogess fuming and nurse screaming but to hear the children mutter when they lost their bread and butter it would move a heart of stone   in the footway to bychton is the wood whiteford wood the sylva mentioned in the doomsday book at the time of that compilation it was valued at  0 s only possibly the value did not increase greatly in the beginning of the sixteenth century when my ancestor hugh pennant of bychton eighteenth in descent from their common stock married jonet daughter of richard ap howel of mostyn who led his troops to bosworth field tradition says that money being wondrous scarce in those days he was offered this wood as a portion with the lady which our family rejected as of no value in a country of forests i cannot estimate the thousands it would have been worth at present or in course of time  a llys in this wood are the remains of some ancient llys or palace as my friend the late antiquary of cherwys used to maintain i can only say that to judge of the foundations our palaces in those days were not very splendid  line of tudor trevor the line of tudor trevor with all its branches is so frequently spoken of that i shall here continue his descent he was son of yger ap cadvarch earl of hereford in right of his wife rhiengar daughter and heir of llwdocea ap karadoc vreichvras or the earl of hereford grandson to the said karadoc and greatgrandson to karadoc vreichvras earl of hereford and marchiogen in the time of prince arthur and who had besides the honor of being one of the knights of the rou ble tudor married angbarad daughter to howel dda prince of wales renowned for his wise laws who quitted his government and retired to rome and there died in     whose death was sore bewailed of all men for he was a prince that loved peace and good order and that feared god i am sorry to deprive our ancestor of his title of earl the welsh had none such among them our great men had that of arglwydd or lord and the chief or monarch that of twisog or prince tudor had in right of his mother immense possessions in herefordshire and in all that country then called ferlys which lies between the wye and the severn he was also lord of whittington in shropshire see tour in wales i p   0 and made that castle his residence let me observe that many of his estates being in the marches of wales he was called of the tribe of march to distinguish him from the other tribes  the families descended from this chieftain were exceedingly numerous but those still existing in the male line are only the following thomas trevor hampden viscount hampden richard pennant lord penrhyn sir roger mostyn and the mostyns of bryngwyn of segrwyd branches of his family and sir pyers mostyn eytons of eyton wynnes of gwerninvawr joness of llwynon and jeffriess of acton existing in my friend the rev dr jeffries residentiary of st pauls and worthy rector of whiteford and the pennants of bychton  adjacent to this wood is my paternal seat bychton i may say the primaeval seat of our family the date on a piece of wood over an added window is      this gives an idea of the house of a gentleman of middling estate in those days there was a much more ancient date on a beam in the barn which was inadvertently destroyed when i new built it i lived at this seat in      and      at that time i recollect buying of the tenant who with great civility quitted it to me his stock of wheat at   s the hobbet consisting of two measures of fortyone quarts each  let me contrast this to a year of scarcity in our country that of      when i find by a diary kept by a peter roberts of st asaph that in the same year wheat was sold at    s the hobbet rye at    s and vetches at    s change this into the present value of silver the hobbet of wheat at this time would be equal to    s of barley to  0 s   d and vetches to    s   d  a calculation for which i am indebted to the ingenuity of my good assistant the rev mr henry parry of holywell  summer house very near to the house stood a summer house a building very frequent near the seats of welsh gentry with a cellar beneath these were used as retreats for the jovial owners and their friends to enjoy remote from the fair their toasts and noisy merriment mine was so near to ruin that i was obliged to pull it down i remember oaks of a vast size growing near to the house this and i may say the other lower parts of the parish are finely wooded with that noble species of tree which grows spontaneously was this part deserted it would relapse into its original state and become an impenetrable forest  madoc ap meiler now let the whole welshman

on the mountains of carno in the county of montgomery in the same year was owing to the valor of philip the usurper was defeated and slain after the bloodiest contest in our annals gryffydd was

dominions historia gryffyd ap conan ms no    gddaeth library  of which one of his sons inherited bychton it remained in the male line only one generation after yswittan as we have above said if we reckon thirty years to a generation the match between madoc ap meiler and alice must have taken place very early in the next century if not in the same this gives us a priority of landed possession in the parish of whiteford to any other freeholder madoc being only tenth in descent from tudor trevor  this my ancestor madoc probably lived also by the sword for i cannot with any certainty prove that before this time he had any landed property i presume he was content with his acquisition of the fair alice and the bychton estate not putecaine as the barbarous normans made it in the doomsday book at which period  widfor i e whiteford was terra unius carucae et ibi erat cum duobus villanis et xii inter servos et ancilla ibi piscaria and sylva or the wood above mentioned but i fear we had been long before robbed of the wood at lest and possibly of our piscaria etc either by our own countrymen or the tyrant saxons madoc sat down quietly on his lands his offspring seem to have been much respected for his son jerwerth married the daughters of two princes his first wife was daughter of owen lord of tegangl and his second the daughter of the lord of allington and ruthenland we went on begetting sons and daughters for a long space my son may boast of being sixteenth in descent from the great madoc or twentyfifth from tudor trevor where for brevity sake i take up the pedigree otherwise i might reach the renowned krda wlodig after passing through five most celebrated descents  arms madoc assumed the arms of yswitan wyddel his wifes grandfather viz fyelde silver three bars wavey azure on the mydle bar three shieldrakes of the first and for his next coat by the name philip phichdan three boars in palle silver these are so defined and placed quarterly by that able genealogist john charles brook esquire somerset herald whose untimely end i find daily reason to deplore the three boars were the arms of yona ap grwy of penley in mawr hundred in the county of flint my father had some small possessions in that country which he sold to improve our estate nearer home those probably were derived from philip phicdan and devolved to madoc on his marriage with his daughter alice  i observe that the descendants of yswyctn wyddel varied in their first coat margaret one of the daughters and heiress of david ap kynric ap philip phycdan bose in a white field two sesses azure and in each the three shieldrakes she married william salusbury of llewenni says the salusbury pedigree p    b who served in parliament for the borough of leominster in the sixth of edward iii and several other parlements as late as that of the thirtyeighth of the same prince  the family assumed afterward their proper arms those of tudor trevor in the year    0 a patent for a crest the antelopes head most strangely disfigured with heraldic liberty was granted to pyers pennant one of the four gentlemenushers to queen elizabeth and to the posterity of his father hugh pennant in this patent which i have in high preservation the first coat is that of the trevors the fyelde party par bend sinister ermen and ermyne a lion rampant goulde langued and armed gules the two next are as described above and the fourth by the name of gruffydd lloyd the fyelde azure three flowerdeluces of the fyelde and such is the dictum of robert cook alias clarentieux rov darmes    0  the mostyns of mostyn bear as their crest a lion rampant  the trevors who were the pencenedl or head of the whole line had for their crest the wivern or dragon on a cap of dignity the present lord hampden is its true pencenedl but by heraldic rules on the descent of the hampden estate to his lordship from the alliance of his ancestor sir john trevor with the hampdens the talbot the crest of that family supersedes the ancient dragon  the dragon was worn as a cogniance by all our princes particularly by cadwaledr who died in     it was adopted by henry vii who clamed descent from him and wore it in he battle of bosworth it took its origin from the legend of uther pendragon father of king arthur who is said to have received the addition of pendragon from his wearing that imaginary animal on his helmet  our bards united with the poet the office of herald at first our pedegrees were preserved by oral communication afterward committed to writing and preserved in the houses of our great men the heralds office is at present a great repository of these kinds of treasure  by the first we are assured of many other illustrious descents from princes ancestors to our tudor trevor from the princes of powis from rywalbon conwyn who with his brother kynric were joint princes of north wales from even roderic the great and from cadwaladr and finally from vortigern the unfortunate king of the britons who fled from the rage of his subjects for his invitation of the saxons into britain and died ingloriously about the year     in the darksome nant y gwrtheyrn in the county of caernarvon tour

plantagenet duke of york father to edward iv i leave arthur collins vol iii p         to adduce the proofs why will my ingenious countrywoman after admitting these honors british synonymy i p      deny to us birth by distinction fine as either and as imperceptible allowing us only the advantage of family and notwithstanding the ladys justlyfavored johnson makes birth and lineage synonymous yet my cousin will allow us no more of the former than what that great writer defines the act of coming into the world the act which graced our country with its fair synonymist  i hope the reader will not think me too warm for thus vindicating my clame to birth in common with my worthy brotherinlaw i am jealous that the honors which i possess by means of our marriage with his aunt shonet ten ascents higher should receive any abatement and i trust that the lady concerned will as a welshwoman even applaud my warmth on so very interesting an occasion  our house has always been the pencenedl or chief of the name we had several branches all which excepting those i have enumerated are extinct in the male line unless it be in the gentleman who of late years spread our celebrity in the capital under the title of pennants parcel post  the first who branched from us was the hospitable the useful the valiant thomas pennant abbot of basingwerk son of david pennant ap tudor before mentioned he flourished in the reign of edward iv and is highly celebrated by guttun owain a bard of the year    0 who records the hospitality of the abbot in a poem printed in the collection of mr rhs jones the poet is so liberal of his praise as to say that he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine  er bwrw yno aur brenhin of a roes deufwy ar win and among his other luxuries i think he enumerates sugar which a rich abbot of the fifteenth century might easily indulge himself in for it had been a great article of commerce in sicily as early as the year       guttun owain also adds t da ir d or tu draw t brag sydd t bics iddaw a good granary on the other side a malthouse and a house of bricks which last was probably a material in building of recent introduction in our country  guttun owain and tudor aled another noted bard speak not only of his works of utility of the water and of the windmills he erected of his having enlarged and beautified the abbey but also compliment him on his prowess in battle neither is guttun silent on a subject pleasing to every welsh ear the pedigree of his patron whom he derives from edwyn and from rhs sais a direct descendant from tudor trevor  it is probable that our abbot discovered that celibacy did not suit his constitution he quitted his profession and became in the law term a monk deraigne and married into the great house of peurbyn a lady of the name of angharad he became the father of four children of them edward the eldest succeeded to the fortunes which he seems to have secured in the parish of holywell thomas the second son became vicar of holywell and nicholas the third in due time abbot of basingwerk he was the last and became founder of a family as i shall have occasion to mention more also will be said of the line of edward who may be considered as the first of the house of bagilt  we did not assume the name of pennant till the time of david pennant ap tudor fifteenth in descent from tudor trevor it is a true welsh name taken from pen a head and nant a dingle our house of bychton being seated at the head of a very considerable one the name is very common in north wales applied to places such as pennant st melangl pennant mowddwy pennant lliw etc etc i have found it in cornwall and again in the great bay of douarnenez in bretagne where among numbers of other welsh names is that of point pennant  it has been delivered down to us gics that in some distant time a gang of gypsies used to haunt this dingle and that eighteen of them were executed after which the gipsey race never more frequented the neighborhood i cannot learn their crime possibly there was none for they might have been legally murdered by the cruel statute of the  st and  d of philip and mary which enacts that if within forty days next after proclamation of this present act shall be made that then he or they which shall not depart and avoid within the said time of forty days according to the true meaning of this act shall be judged and deemed according to the laws of this realm of england a felon and felons and shall suffer therefore pains of death loss of lands and goods as in other cases of felony and shall be tried as is aforesaid and without having any benefit or privilege of sanctuary or clergy sir matthew hale tells us that in suffolk a few years before the restoration were executed at a single assizes not less than thirteen but none on that barbarous law have suffered since that time in these humane days the gypsies may wander in peace provided they behave inoffensively wheresoever they chance to make their transient abode for the bloody act was repealed in the twentythird year of his present majesty  our first mge with an englishwoman david pennant was the first of us who married into a saxon family he took to wife anne daughter of john done of utkinton in cheshire by anne daughter of richard heaton of heaton in the county of lancaster he begat many sons and daughters among them was the famous abbot thomas and also sir hugh pennant offeiriad or priest whom the great lhuyd in his aaelogic p     calls an able poet in the time of henry viii and i find also that in      he was at an fisteddfod at caerwis secondary student in vocal song and  he was the only musical man in all our line  our first sheriff till the advancement of richard pennant to the title of penrbyn our house was never distinguished by any honors beyond the most useful one that of justice of the peace i should blush if a pennant should be found who through lack of public spirit sloth or selfishnese could decline that great constitutional office the first sheriff of our house was pyers pennant who discharged that trust in      he had the lot of marrying the daughter of a family not famed for placidity or the milder virtues valde valde irritabile genus and from them tom a most worthy aunt of mine used often to tell me we got our passion  and frequently added the wise welsh caution beware of a breed  the fruits of this marriage appeared very soon thomas the eldest son in a furor brevis killed his miller was indicted for the manslaughter tried and convicted but received his pardon dated in the first of charles i or the year      this grace preserved him from the ignominious part of the sentence and the more important advantage of preserving his personality which would otherwise have been forfeited to the crown  this is sufficient to show that the offense did admit of every palliation but a stronger proof than that may be drawn from the following honor having been conferred on him when we find that in eight years afterward in      he was entrusted with the care of the county of flint by having the office of high sheriff committed to his charge he died the next year cujus animae propitietur deus this unfortunate man married a granddaughter of that nuptialloving dame catherine y berran see tour in wales vol ii p    mary daughter of edward wynn of ystrad son of morris wynn of gwydir fourth and last husband of our famous catherine there was no issue from this match so bychton descended to david the next brother  in those days and long preceding presents to sheriffs it was customary for the friends and neighbors of the sheriff to make presents to him to assist in defraying the expenses i have among my papers two long rolls of gifts to give the whole would be very tedious i extract only a few of the most remarkable among which are several in money which his friends were not ashamed to offer nor the sheriff to receive the cash received in      was l  0    s   d

probably the fiery dram was not then in fashion in wales yet nurse in romeo and juliet calls for it amain under the name of aqua vitae some aqua vitae ho my lord my lady it appears to have been chiefly used in those days for medical purposes  in captain wyndhams voyage to guinea there was brandy on board for the use of the sick sailors it was said to have been invented by raymundus lullius the famous alchemist who died in the year      charles the bad king of navarre came to a most horrible end says mezerey i     who to restore his strength weakened by debauchery was wrapped in sheets steeped in au de his valet by accident set fire to them after the third day he died in the most dreadful tortures and it is to be hoped thus expiated the crimes of his most execrable life i am indebted for the origin of brandy to a most elaborate essay on it which i received from mr william tailor of norwich by favor of my friend dr atkin  william pennant g i now in gratitude take up the

and sir hugh myddleton left sole executor  the entertaining james howel strange story of john pennant in the xliiid letter of his epistolae hoelianae makes john pennant third son of pyers pennant of byhn and brother of the worthy william the instrument of presages to our kingdom of the evil days and evil times which were advancing with rapid pace the relation is very properly addressed to that mirror of credulity sir kenelm digby knight  d a ens heart it was my fortune says the solemn historian to be in a late communication where a gentleman spoke of a hideous thing that happened in high holborn how one john pennant a young man of    being dissected after his death there was a kind of serpent with diverse tails found in the left ventricle of his heart which you know is the most defended part being thrice thicker than the right and is the cell which holds the purest and most illustrious liquor the arterial blood and the vital spirits the serpent was it seems three years ingendring for so long time he found himself indisposed in the breast and it was observed that his eye in the interim grew more sharp and fiery like the eye of a cock which is next the serpents eye in redness so that the symptom of his inward disease might have been told by certain exterior rays and signatures  god preserve us from public calamities for serpentine monsters have been often ill favored presages i remember in the roman story to have read how when snakes or serpents were found near the statues of their gods at one time about jupiters neck another time about minervas thigh there followed bloody civil wars after it  this portentous story is given most scientifically by dr edward may in a thin quarto pamphlet of forty pages the title page will inform the reader of his various other titles which savor most strongly of quackery  a most certain and trve relation of a strange monster or serpent found in the left ventricle of the heart of john pennant gentleman of the age of    years  by edward may doctor of philosophy and physic and professor elect of them in the college of the academy of noblemen called the musaeum minervae  physician also extraordinary unto her most sacred majesty queen of great britain etc  london printed by george miller mdcxxxix  engraved title page  the epistle dedicatory is to the renowned peer of this kingdom edward earl of dorset the book itself to sir theodore maiherne knight in that he lays before him the wonderful case he tells us that he was sent on october  th      by lady herris wife to sir francis herris knight to dissect her nephew john pennant who had deceased the night before to know the cause of his death the doctor brought with him master jacob heyden surgeon to assist in the enquiry mr heydon made incision into the left ventricle of the heart which was full of blood on thorough examination the monster was discovered the head of which was so like to that of a serpent that lady herris shivered to see it to judge by the prints all the upper part of it was cylindrical toward the lower part bifurcated and each fork divided into five long and slender fibrillae i leave to the reader the perusal of the rest of dr mays most curious disquisition  this is not the only instance of similar appearances in the heart but we hear no more of serpents the name was changed to polypuses to which for their numerous ramifications they might bear the resemblance in our philosophical transactions are more than one paper on the subject in mr lowthorps abridg iii p  0 and tab p   0 is an account and the figure of one found in the heart of a man at oxford and in mr martyns abridg ix p     is the account of several discovered in numbers of sailors who died immediately on their return from the west indies this paper was written by the celebrated dr huxbam he quotes malpighius bartholinus tulpius and pechlin as giving incontestible instances of the existence of polypi in the heart in the strictest sense this opinion is now exploded the only uncommon circumstance my ingenious friend dr haygarth assures me is that the left ventricle of the heart and probably the aorta which after death are usually empty were in these cases full of blood the crassamentum upon coagulation had taken the form of the arteries in which it was contained  i break a little into chronology barbarous events to conclude with an event relative to another of my house of little moment indeed but merely to give a picture of the barbarous days even of the beginning of the last century which i collected from the journal kept by peter roberts of st asaph before mentioned he records that on july   d      hugh pennant brother to pyers pennant esquire of bychton died of a broken head given him at denbigh by pyers hughes that in the year      rowland evan a vicar of st asaph was killed at an alehouse in llandrillo eiderneon that on october  d      mr richard thelwal was slain at his own house at ruthen and that in      one foulkes of cilowen killed his wife and cut his own throat  the mention of ale house tempts me to speak of a house of mine by the seaside in the township of bychton lletty gonest called lletty gonest or the honest house it had been formerly in the highest repute for its excellent ale brewed by a good alewife yclepd jane of lletty whom i well remember she acquired both fame and wealth both of which i may say she bequeathed to her descendants who to this day by their own industry continue to flourish on the effect of here is  the house was originally built by one smith from worcester partly for the purposes of distilling and partly for a warehouse i am told that it occasionally had served for the place of confinement for impressed men at the time in which the colliers had such great trade with dublin the strong bars in the lower windows favor that notion  singular head above the door is a very singular sculpture cut in basrelief in stone and let into the wall one part is a strange chimerical figure of a monster with four legs and the head of an owl fixing its claws in the side of a human head the face is averted and expressing much agony the eyelids are drawn up the eyes the same the mouth half opened and the teeth closely fixed together the face is young but has a pair of whiskers and is far from being ill cut it has the character of one of le bruns passions article pain it evidently never was designed for this place but seems originally to have been one of those fanciful gothic sculptures belonging to some ancient church  smuggling in the reign of king william this house was remarkable for the violent hands laid on a vast seizure of french wines to the amount of sixty pipes which had been smuggled into the great barn at trelacre in the parish of llanasa destined for the use of the welsh gentry in this and the neighboring counties it must be observed that in those days portwine was in very little use in our country the officers had conveyed this prize with safety as far as lletty gonest where they intended to sleep that night at midnight they were alarmed by the entry of multitudes of colliers who tied every body in the house neck and heels they removed the wine into other carriages and conveyed it into places so secure that it never more could be heard of many of the colliers were observed to have rings on their fingers and fine linen in fact numbers of them were the gentlemen interested in the wine and concerned in the recapture who mixed with the colliers to direct them in their operations a proclamation was issued out for the discovery of the offenders but such was the fidelity of our people that they were never detected the poor tapster in particular knew perfectly well who they were and large rewards were offered to him by the customhouse but nothing could shake his attachment to his friends he lived long after supported by the grateful contributions of the neighboring squires  high above lletty gonest stands a summer house built by my grandfather to which he often adjourned with his guests to regale them with the delicious beer brewed by the famous jane many years after when i became master of the estate i also had my adjournment but it was either to eat shrimps or to drink tea an honest vicar of a distant parish who had been a most intimate friend of my convivial grandfather enquired whether i ever went to the summer house and was answered now and then to drink tea struck with horror at the degeneracy of the grandson the good man with indignation exclamed drink tea his grandfather would have scorned it  the turnpike road designed for the enabling the smelters and others to convey our coal to the places of its destination from the mostyn and bychton pits passes by lletty gonest and goes along the shore toward holywell in the space of a mile it passes by three smeltinghouses shopgoch the property of sir roger mostyn and penyro and llanerchymor belonging to me the last disputes antiquity with most in the county the late works at gadlis excepted  above the last is the neat house of kinsale inhabited by my good friend and tenant mr ralph richardson who for several years had with great success and integrity carried on the smelting business with the advantage of shipping the produce from the very spot after a short carriage to the vessels  a small marsh begins a little beyond lletty gonest and widens as it extends southward it borders on the manor of mostyn but itself owns no lord but the king the same may be said of the valuable remainder as far as the manor of coleshill in the parish of flint the minor of greenfield in the parish of holywell was long supposed to have been the property of one or other of two clamants who fell into dispute about the right the matter was referred to two gentlemen of the law eminent for their abilities and not less so for their probity after examining all the proofs adduced by the rivals they adjudged that neither had any clame to the lordship so it is now left to the freeholders under our sovereign lord the king a rich tract for future enclosures  a little beyond kinsale is the end of our parish on this side the boundary between it and the parish of holywell is a small ll called avon marsh siambr avon marsh siambr above on an eminence is the old seat of the pierces a family now extinct and the property passed into other hands it bears the name of is glan from the name of the township in which it stands  about a mile higher up is merton the seat of the reverend mr john foulkes he derives his right to it from margaret daughter and heiress to thomas parry ap william parry win she married john foulkes of penyeba luy in the parish of shyiog greatgrandfather to the present owner who died in july      and was interred in whiteford churchyard  tree mostyn bounds tree bychton on the west tree mostyn this township is considered as containing one fourth of the parish it reaches to the seaside on which as well as the whole trees of every kind grow most admirably  it is divided from tree bychton in the lower part by the turnpike road which extends from the seaside to henllan sixteen miles distant originally designed for the conveyance of coal from the pits of this township and that of tree bychton to the great limeworks near denbigh the first act was obtained in      the second in    0 before which our roads were scarcely passable if either sir roger mostyns family or our own wanted to get to chester we were to reach the seaside then to flint as we could and from thence at low water cross the ford of the dee a way not always unattended with danger  opposite to mostyn gates on this part of the turnpike road the rhewl is a hamlet called the rhewl yr heol platea a way or street on each side are a few houses the swan a small alehouse my property was noted for its vast trade about the beginning of this century when the coal trade was in the height of its prosperity and cww da then unexcised by kings thomas edwards who several years was tenant there educated a family of numbers of children at no inconsiderable expense and is supposed to have acquired by the tap at lest fifteen hundred pounds  from the rhewl opens the principal gates to mostyn hall mostyn hall or more properly moston hall for such for many ages was the spelling of the names of both the mansion and its ancient owners on this approach is a most venerable avenue which goes for a considerable way in a direct line then turns short and terminates with a view of the old part of the old mansion the park is small but beautifully broken and clothed in various parts with fine oaks and most magnificent beeches but amidst the trees is suffered to remain rugged with the vestiges of the ancient collieries the ground slopes finely to the sea facing the north east the trees grow with vigor close to the water unhurt by the rude winds with which they are affailed  the house is placed about half a mile from the shore i find some difficulty in making a description i shall therefore refer the reader to the first plate of welsh seats by mr boydel and to my own as the only method of giving him some idea of the singularity of the structure that plate attempts the front  if front it might be called that shape had none distinguishable for it consists of the most ancient hall a lesser designed for a sort of symposium for servants and on the outside annexed and jutting out is the quondam chapel now converted into a bedchamber i have a sketch of the whole as it was in the year      made by a mr thomas dinely an attendant on henry first duke of beaufort then lord president of the council in the principality of wales and lord lieutenant of the twelve counties who in that year made a reviewing progress of the militia of north wales and of course paid his respects to the great man of our country  the porch had been rebuilt in      it has on it the arms of the four great alliances of the family rudely cut on the stone mostyn hall  they seem to have been copied from the great chimneypiece in the hall  i cannot trace the time of building of this part of the house it must have been at lest early in the time of henry vi but probably more ancient for in bolton hall in bowland yorkshire the most antique seat we know is a hall in a lesser scale indeed but greatly similar and in that house it is well known that the unfortunate prince concealed himself for a long time posterity may find the account in my tour in part of the mercian and northumbrian kingdoms the great gloomy hall is furnished with a dais or elevated upper end the old hall and with a long table for the lord and his jovial companions and another in the side the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer to this day the similitude of the old times is kept up when the family is at home the head servants take their dinner at the dais and the numerous inferior servants fill the long table the roof is lofty crossed with long beams the nenbren or topbeam was in all times a frequent toast whenever the master of the houses health was drank and  jached y nenbren y ty was the cordial phrase the chimneypiece is magnificently plain unless where the arms of the house and its alliances are cut on the stone and properly emblazoned  the first are the arms a lion rampant ermin coats of arms ermine of jevan vychan of pengwern near llangollen see tour in wales vol i p     sixteenth in descent from owen tudor by the marriage of jevan with angharad daughter and sole heiress of howel ap tudor ap ithel vychan of mostyn he added that estate to his paternal acres in the reign of richard ii  it seems from the mostyn pedigree that in      jevan had farmed the estate he wisely determined to turn the lease into a perpetuity and gaining the ladys affections connubio junxit stabili propriamque dicavit  the next are the arms of his spouse the heiress of mostyn directly descended from the edwyn lord of tegengle before mentioned argent a cross engrailed sable between four cornish choughs  the third are the arms of gloddaeth gules a chevron argent between three plates acquired by the marriage of howel ap evan vychan son of the former in    0 with margaret daughter and heir of gryffydd ap rhys ap gryffydd ap madoc gloddaeth ap madoc ap jerweth goch of cryddyn the hundred in which the house stands  the fourth are the arms of sir gryffydd lloyd morfydd one of his daughters and coheiresses married madoc gloddaeth who with her received tregarnedd in the isle of anglesey as her portion that estate followed the succession of the house till gloddaeth was united with that of mostyn in which it continued till the year    0 then it was alienated by the late sir thomas mostyn to the late mr owen williams of anglesey  the walls are furnished in a suitable manner with ancient militia guns swords and pikes with helmets and breastplates with funeral achievements falcon vast flight of one and with variety of spoils of the chase a falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room with two bells a greater and a lesser hung to each foot on two silver rings are inscribed the name of the owner mr kinloch of kulrie in the county of angus on the eastern side of scotland with these encumbrances it flew from its owner on the morning of the   th of september      and was killed near this house on the morning of the   th the precise time it reached our country is not known therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pursuit of a woodcock or that which made a flight out of westphalia into prussia in a day  instances recorded by the learned sir thomas brown  the adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the ancient apartments of the lady of the house kitchen at a period when the odors of the pot and spit were thought no ill savors from the commanding height of the gallery the good lady might give her orders to her coges or shecook as syrus is humorously described by terence to do to his scullion dromo  let the great eel sport a little longer in the water  see that you gut the other fishes and stew the great carp well  freshen the salt fish  look to the baked meats good douse  crisp the pig nicely  pray do not overroast the surloin again  boil the pudding sufficiently and do not spare plums and suet  be sure not to smoke the flummery  remember no onions today  neighbor p dines with us etc etc  in the roof to this gallery are numbers of small roostingholes to which the inferior maidens of the family nightly repair to rest from their labors  at one end of the gallery is a great room great room remarkable for a singular event during the time that henry earl of richmond was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of york he passed concealed from place to place in order to form an interest among the welsh who favored his cause on account of their respect to his grandfather owen tudor their countryman while he was at mostyn a party attached to richard iii arrived there to apprehend him he was then about to dine but had just time to leap out of a back window and make his escape through a hole which henry vii to this day is called the kings richard ap howel then lord of mostyn joined henry at the battle of bosworth and after the victory received from the king in token of gratitude for his preservation the belt and sword he wore on that day he also pressed richard greatly to follow him to court but he nobly answered like the shunamitish woman i dwell among mine own people the sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years it is observable that none of our historians account for a certain period of henrys life previous to his accession it is very evident that he passed the times when he disappeared from bretagny in wales many cotemporary bards by feigned names record this part of his life under those of the lion the eagle and the like which were to restore the empire to the britons for the inspired favorers of the house of lancaster did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical for fear of the reigning prince  square tower in all probability the original of mostyn was a square tower such as may be exemplified entire at tower the seat of the reverend the late dr win see tour in wales ii p     part of that at mostyn is still remaining but concealed by the additional buildings it is fully shown in the view of mostyn as it was in the year      the upper part ought to have been embattled but the top had been in later times covered with an awkward dome these square towers are still very frequent on the borders of scotland built in savage times as i have attempted to mostyn as in       describe in my tour in scotland second edition volume ii p    in the plate of mostyn is given the view of the seat of a gentleman of large fortune in ancient times in that of bychton one of middling fortune in that of the late mr parrys of merton one of small fortune as to our estate i think the rentroll in the year      might amount to about  00 l a year consisting of a little money and rents in kind and services  before i quit the old house let me say that the best view of the chaotic additions backward is from the garden from a very handsome summer house built by the first baronet as appears by his arms quartered with those of his wife bulkeley of baron hill from this spot is seen great part of the buildings and the appurtenances to the old house one tacked to the other as the increase or the wants of the family made necessary  in the year      sir roger mostyn knight new house      gave to the house a very handsome addition a square mass consisting of six bedchambers a very large eatingroom and a dining room or drawing room above with a large bowwindow in the middle of each in that below are the arms of gwynne and darcy well emblazoned on glass these are complimentary to two great alliances the one of sir roger himself with mary daughter of the famous sir john win of gwydir the other out of respect to the alliance with bridget savage daughter of darcie savage esquire of leighton in cheshire by whom the family acquired the great estates they possess in that county from the principal gate of the park they have the pleasing view of those of beeston and those above parkgate  opposite to this window is a fireplace suitable to the room above are the arms of the numerous alliances of the house beautifully done in stucco dated      conjoined with them are the arms of mary win wife of sir roger those of gwydir quarterly with those of gryffydd ap conan in the first of the mostyn side are those of tudor trevor the stock of the house the next are those of llwdocca ap caradc  dly the arms of elidir ap rhys sais  thly those of jestyn ap gurgant  thly the bearing of brochwel yscythrog  thly the arms of edwyn  thly those of tudor ap gronw  thly of ithel vychan  thly are the arms of madoc gloddaeth  0thly are those of sir gryffydd lloyd the   th of goodman and   thly and lastly the arms of shalmesorow which seem an appurtenance only to those of goodman this is a mere focal ornament an abridgement of the thirtytwo coats which graced the pedigree of the house in the year      two termini support the entablature of this genealogical table the other ornaments are elegant but unfortunately as if to dash the mirth of the company the architect has added in full view the monumental crossbones and bared skull  at the upper end of the room are two fine portraits by mytens full lengths one is of sir roger mostyn knight mentioned at p    his face is an excellent representation of the viridis senectus his countenance florid his peaked beard of strong whiteness on his head is a black close cap turned up with flanders lace round his neck a flat large ruff his whole dress besides is black round the waistband of his great breeches is a girdle stuck with points this piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb applicable to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their station round his knees are similar girdles his boots are large and of white leather turned down at top and ornamented in the same finical manner as the cap such was the foppery of the times even in so manly a figure as was our knight of mostyn but then he was in full dress his spurs of fine gold with vast spurleathers his right hand rests on his stick his left on a table covered with a carpet most admirably painted on it his hat broadbrimmed and with a most immoderate crown the date on his portrait is      his age    he died on august   th      and was interred at whiteford on september the  st  his ladys neck in a picture of the same date is ornamented with a large ruff single and elevated her right hand has in it a fan and rests on an elbowchair on a finger of her left hand is a ring tied to her arm by several black strings  she is dressed in a handsome long gown with a sash up to her very arms exactly like the nowaisted fair of the present days her shape is contrived to have some degree of elegance notwithstanding she seems to have been a large woman i wish our modern embonpoints resembled this lady they seem to emulate in fashion the form of a sack of wool bulging out on every side undulating their plump graces here and there as motion gives occasion over the mouth of the sack seems to have been oftimes flung by accident a light horsemans cap or any other incongruity instead of the venerable coeffure of the lady mostyn at the sober age of fortynine  his son roger the first baronet created august  d    0 sir roger first baronet is the middle figure of a picture of the most ridiculous composition this distinguished character is represented a kitkat length in a strange long flaxen wig a breast plate buff skirts and antique roman sleeves a negro holding his helmet by him is his second lady mary eldest daughter of thomas lord bulkeley of baron hill she is reading with one hand on a skull and her little lapdog placed by her warlike husband his third wife is doubled up and concealed behind the frame this lady showed such a mercenary disposition and so mischievous to the children of her predecessor that one of the family affixed this stigma i have taken a peep at her and may pronounce her countenance to be truly symptomatic of her interior  sir roger was a zealous loyalist he raised a regiment in support of the crown consisting of fifteen hundred men in twelve hours time mostly colliers whitelock whose sister had been married to sir thomas mostyn of kilken in this county knight father to sir roger speaks of him in the following terms notwithstanding their principles and the parts they took were widely different then the parliament forces in      says the historian at p    took in mostynhouse belonging to colonel mostyn the governor of flint and in mostyn they took four pieces of ordnance and some arms  this colonel mostyn is my sisters son a gentleman of good parts and mettle of a very ancient family large possessions and great interest in that country so that in twelve hours he raised   00 men for the king and was well beloved there living very nobly  this gentlemans loyalty cost him and the family dear he spent about sixty thousand pounds in the service of his majesty his house of mostyn was plundered and stripped so that he was obliged to retire to a small house called plasycha about a mile distant from mostyn the first was built by his grandfather the old baronet before mentioned within in coarse stucco are his arms with those of gwydir and the date and initials of his and his ladys name    0  r m m m  sir roger had a great intimacy with pyers pennant his cotemporary neighbor at bychton both seem to have been boon companions as is evident from the p s to the following curious epistle mostyn      curious epistle dear pyers i hope you will excuse me for asking for the   l you owe me for the pair of oxen for i want the money to make up  0 l to send my son to oxford next week  i am dear pyers yours etc etc roger mostyn p s  how does your head do this morning  mine aches confoundedly       at this time money was so scarce that   l was a price for a pair of oxen and the baronet of mostyn was thought very liberal in sending his heir apparent to the university with  0 l in his pocket  the other portraits are a head of sir thomas mostyn the gentleman who married bridget savage heiress of the cheshire estates  one of the late sir thomas mostyn when a youth in him was united the fine gentleman the polite scholar and the good man my vision of a certain youth i do believe does not issue from the ivory gate   when i behold with ravished eyes our pride our darling our marcellus rise portraits of william vaughan esquire of corsygedol and his brother evan lloyd vaughan esquire of bodidris successor to his estates and to his seat in parliament for the county of merioneth  a small full length

when i mention on the same page our billy bangor the wit the jester buffoon and fool as he probably was misnamed of our country his sayings and his pranks are to this day much talked of his is a halflength with a pipe in his hand his look savors not of folly and is full of sly gravity the portrait is well painted i imagine in the beginning of the present century in which billy flourished  two very good portraits halflengths close the list they are said to have been two painters who sat for their pictures to each other their countenances are good their dresses similar  between them is a head of charles ii in his usual black wig he is well painted but without flattery his coarse features well vindicate the question he put to poor riley the painter on seeing the portrait done by that artist is this like me  then ods fish i am a very ugly fellow anecdotes of painters iii p       busts in the room are some busts collected by the late sir thomas mostyn when he was at rome among them

was one of the few pictures which that unprincipled painter as mr walpole says would not gladly have disowned the moment it was paid for the earl of nottingham was as dalrymple represents him to have been most vehement in his political principles both in church and state so that he could hereby not live in charity with those who differed from him he undertook the defense of the former against the attack made upon it by the famous whiston in a letter in      addressed to his lordship which the earl answered for which his lordship received from the university of oxford in full convocation its solemn thanks for his noble defense of the christian faith he died january        0 his zeal as mr walpole observes caused him during life to suffer many aspersions in all probability the following

which are foreign are several marbles brought from narbonne the narbo martius narbonne marbles it is one of the most ancient cities in gaul for it was a flourishing place two hundred and eighty years before the christian era a roman colony was established there in the time of marcius rex from whom it received its addition it is full of antiquities which have been used in the various modern buildings those in question came from the walls of the archbishops palace and were brought here by the late sir thomas mostyn the engraving with the inscriptions taken from the  d volume of my tour gives a full idea of these funebrial memorials  torques the golden torques that invaluable morsel in possession of this family was found by digging in a garden near to harlech castle in      it is well described by camden as a wreathed rod of gold about four feet long with three spiral furrows with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends which are plain truncated and turn back like pothooks whether this was purely roman or whether it might not have been common to both nations i will not dispute the use was that of a baldric to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank which hung behind by means of the hook and the golden wreath crossed the breast and passed over the shoulder virgil in his beautiful description of the exercises of the trojan youth expresses the manner in these frequently misconstrued lines cornea bina ferunt praeixo hastilia ferro pars leves umer pharetras ait pectore summo flexilis obtrti per collum circulus auri each brandishing aloft a cornel spear some on their backs their burnished quiver bore hanging from wreaths of gold which shone before   the torch or torques worn by the gauls and britons was a very different affair a collar of gold or other metal worn round the neck our heroine boadicea had a great one of that precious metal and virdomaerus wore round his neck another fastened behind with hooks which fell off when the conqueror cut off his head  an apophereta   illi virgatis jaculanti ex agmine braccis torquis ab incisa decidi unca gula manlius acquired the addition of torquatus from a torques which he won from a gaul whom he flew in single combat in sight of the army and publius cornelius after the slaughter of the boii took among other spoils not fewer than four thousand and seventy golden torques  they were also in use among the romans who bestowed them as military rewards and as pliny pretends the golden on the auxiliaries the silver on the citizens they probably were made in several ways i have seen a very beautiful one i think at present in possession of the rev mr prescot of stockport composed of several links of silver wire most elegantly twisted together it was long enough to go twice round the neck and had clasps which fastened it on  the custom of wearing the torques was continued from the more remote periods of britain to later times llewellyn a lord of yale was called llewelyn aur dorchog llewelyn with the golden torques on that account and the common proverb mi a dynnar dorch a chwi i will pluck the torques with you signifies to this day a hard struggle of a person before he

the name was changed to whiteford of derivation unknown in the doomsday book notice is also taken of some of the present townships such as tremostyn trebychton and mton under the names of mostone widford putecaine and mertone mstone was then a ploughland terra unius carucae it had on it four villeyns and eight boors bordarii a wood a league long and forty perches perticatae broad and was valued at twenty shillings  widford is joined with putecaine the first seems to have comprehended our present trelan or the place where the churchvillage now stands these had one plough land two villeyns and twelve others between men and maid servants fisheries and a wood half a mile long and forty perches broad the value was the same with that of mostone  with mereton is joined the third

of a nave with a good plain towersteeple it has besides a side aile built by a blithyn drow of the house of mostyn to whom that part belongs  divine service is performed every sunday alternately in welsh and in english at the first the congregation is very numerous and at all times truly serious and devout the dress of even the poorest neat and whole and very unlike the squalid ragged figures too frequently seen in the congregations of many a southern county  offerings at funerals are kept up here and i believe in all the welsh churches a disgusting and in cases in which the deceased may have died of an infectious distemper a dangerous custom often prevales of the corpse being brought into church during divine service and left there till the congregation is dismissed  that excellent memento to the living the passing bell is punctually sounded i mention this because idle niceties have in great towns often caused the disuse it originated before the reformation to give notice to the priest to be ready to do the last duty of extreme unction to the departing person in case he had no other admonition the canon    allows one short peal after death one other before the funeral and one other after the funeral the second is still in use and is a single bell s ed the third is a merry peal rung at the request of the s  if  like they reioiced at the escape of the departed out of thi

revenue in interest and land is    l yet the poors rates are alarmingly high in the beginning of the present century poor rates had not taken place collections were made in the church for the sick and the aged filial piety had at that time f possession of the breasts of the children or great affection the part of more distant relations and the pangs of pverty were as much as possible alleviated there was also a laudable p in them which made them above suffering their friends to be a burden to their fellow parishioners all this gradually ceased and the warmth of natural affection soon quite disappeared i cannot but mention an instance of the rapid increase of taxes in my days in the year      william lloyd smith was one of the overseers of the poor at that time the annual tax was only      c   d he was appointed again overseer in the year    when the tax was increased to  00 l william lloyd is now living but the books prove the exactness of the assertion  school in the village is the school it was founded by mary bradshaw widow of thomas williams of mostyn gate who bequeathed by will dated      the interest of     l to be paid to the master of the said school for instructing for ever annually fourteen children who are instructed in reading and writing english and accounts the present schoolhouse was built by pyers jones an opulent farmer of this parish who also bestowed a very handsome brass chandelier on the church  in this and a few other of the mineral parishes club is a cymdeithos or club instituted in      for the support of the members in case of illness or any accidents provided they are not contracted by intemperance fighting or any immoral act our club consists of   0 members each of whom contributes monthly   d which is put into a box locked with three keys two are kept by the stewards and the third by the person to whom the box is entrusted so that all three must be present at the taking out or putting in of any money the club has been of late years fortunate enough to have saved three hundred pounds which is put out on good security and kept in reserve against any calamitous times such as seasons of sickness or uncommon successions of accidents  in case of illness a certain allowance is made till the time of their recovery or till they are deemed incurable in the last case they are allowed two shillings and six pence for life in case of death forty shillings is paid for funeral expenses and a sum to the widow proportionable to the time the husband had been member of the club  whenever the business requires a meeting the steward must bring with him the tankard of ale and a very small cup in order that the members may not exceed the bounds of temperance  if any member comes to the club in liquor he forfeits twopence if he speaks ill of government or abuses any body or curses and swears or will not hold his tongue when required by the stewards he forfeits twopence for every offense in a word every caution is observed to preserve the rules of morality in this our parocal society finally there is a great annual meeting on new years day in which every member attends every one appears neatly dressed carrying a wand gally painted and make altogether a most respectable figure ranged in two lines from the porch door to that of the church  i step into the churchyard and sigh over the number of departed which fll the

aboriginal  the curious cross called maen achwynfan maen achwynfan or the stone of lamentation stands in a small field opposite to the gate which opens from the turnpikeroad into garreg it takes its name in all probability from the penances which were often finished before such sacred pillars attended with weeping and the usual marks of contrition for an example near stafford stood one called the weeping cross a name analogous to ours this is of an elegant form and sculpture is twelve feet high two feet four inches broad at the bottom and ten inches thick the base is let into another stone the top is round and includes in raised work the form of a greek cross beneath about the middle is another in the form of st andrews and under that a naked figure with a spear in his hand close to that on the side of the column is represented some animal the rest is covered with very beautiful fretwork like what may be seen on other pillars of ancient date in several parts of great britain i do not presume after the annotator on camden has given up the point to attempt a guess at the age only must observe that it must have been previous to the reign of gross superstition among the welsh otherwise the sculptor would have employed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone  those who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumull containing human bones and sculls often marked with mortal wounds but these earthy sepulchers are of more ancient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit this likewise from the crosses is evidently a christian monument the former were only in use in pagan days  gelli there is likewise near to it an ancient chapel now a farmhouse called gelli or the hazelgrove the name of an adjacent tract this might have relation to the cross as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of basingwerk who had a house at no great distance this tract misspelt by the english geteley with the wood at that time on it was granted by edward i to the abbot and convent on the tenth of november at westminster before the death of our last prince he also gave him power to grub up the wood which by the nakedness of the place appears to have been done most effectually  farther to the west is another enclosed mountain called glol my own property part is covered with hazels and large whitethorn trees perhaps a continuation of the gelli part is very cky part a fine sheepwalk in many places were several druidical circles which i believe are now injured by the removal of the stones for various uses in the rougher parts of this enclosure are often seen vipers which always prefer the dry and sunny parts of a country  on sarnhwlkin a little common to the east of glol sarnhwlkin was a very long but low tumulus supposed by the vulgar to have been a giants grave from a tradition that one of our sons of anak had been there interred it probably did cover the remains of some british heroes of the common size who there found their grave after some fierce action i have before supposed to have happened before the place  the township of trerabbot trerabbot one of the eight which compose our parish joins to this part of tremostyn in it stands the house of the same name originally the countryseat of the abbots of basingwerk but long since the property of the daviess lately sold to edward jones of wepre esquire from the proof that gentleman has given of his literary abilities in drawing up the resolutions of the holywell association in december      i must lament they are not oftener exerted the occasion alone excepted  this township was once exempted from the payment of tithes by a modus originally granted by the abbot of basingwerk but which by negligence has been totally lost  the house in mr miles davies miles davies produced a very extraordinary genius indeed the talents of this eccentric gentleman were poetical he lived about the year      and published three volumes of his athenae britannicae in his martii calendae sive lauds cambro britanniae is a latin poem on st davids day i never could get the sight of the books but was indebted to the rev william cole late of milton near cambridge for the following extract which will i dare say content the reader as it does me  roberto atque mansel buckley vaughan et trevor et hanmer eumque salesbury stradlinque corway kemys anwill morganius theliolque moston bennet beata

along the great heath mynydd tegen or tegenmountain which yet preserves the ancient name of tegengl which comprehended the three modern hundreds of coleshill prestatyn and rudland it had been the property of edwin descended from roderick the great and called prince of tegengl his llys or royal residence was in  0   near llaneurgan or northop this common for i cannot call it mountain stretches along the whole of the higher parts of our parish and is covered with the erica vulgaris or common heath it feeds numbers of sheep and is part of the mineral tract of flintshire  llyn helyg the manor of mostyn of which sir roger mostyn is lord includes the greater part of the mountain and reaches to the sea it was derived from the heiress of the house descended from her ancestor prince edwin  a large piece of water now well stocked with fish made by sir roger mostyn baronet grandfather to the present owner lies near that end of the heath in the winter it is the resort of ducks and teal  on the east side of mostyn pool in tegen mountain plas captain is a grave bounded at each end by a rude stone above four feet high it contains the remains of captain edward morgan of the adjacent house of plas captain and of the respectable family of the morgans of gwlgray in the adjoining parish of llan asaph some years ago a person of strange curiosity opened the grave and found the skeleton on the head was a red cap i think of velvet and round his neck a silk handkerchief by him lay his sword and his helmet and beneath the skeleton two bullets which had fallen out of the body on its dissolution all which verify the report of his having been slain in battle or in some skirmish during the civil wars and that he was interred according to his wish under the spot on which he fell in a collection of pedegrees lent to me by thomas gryffith esquire of rhual i find this short memorial of the captain in the pedigree of his family capt edward morgan slain at cheshire raise if he was slain in that county i cannot suppose that his body would have been carried so far nor can i account for this relation or for the body being found here unless that the above is a mistake and that he fell in some skirmish near to his own house  at a small distance from plas captain is plasmawr at present the property of sir edward price lloyd bart of pengwern in right of his worthy grandmother frances daughter and heiress to bell jones secretary in the civil board of ordnance in the tower he erected a handsome monument in whiteford church in memory of his father robert jones and others of

the flint road cresses the upper road from newmarket to holywell  it is the first turnpike known on the holyhead road the act was obtained in      and contained besides the district of flint those of emere chester and mold the part in question is called llwybrhir or the longpath for it extends along the mountain westward as far as brickkiln  ususes on the right hand as you pass toward that hamlet on a rocky elevated part called gelli is a multitude of loose stones lying on the surface they are of the limestone kind mere les assuming most singular forms some are excavated and often perforated this must have been done when they were in a soft state for since their formation nothing has fallen on them but the rain of heaven and that could not effect the phenomenon  entrenchment scattered over this part of the mountain are several rounded tumuli and to the let at some distance is a work probably coeval with them on the slope of the west part of the raceground is an entrenchment of a circular form about a hundred and sixtythree feet in diameter surrounded with a low bank and on the outside of that with a ditch in one part very shallow in the other more deep this circle could not have been designed as a post or place of retreat from an enemy its entrenchment is weak and it might easily be commanded from above by the risingground possibly it might have been for some religious purpose or for a place of council or for haranguing the people who might assemble round the outside and readily hear what was delivered to them  on returning along llwybrhir i rejoin the newmarket road llwybrhir at the plad had left it near a great enclosure belonging to sir roger m called tymaen within near to the road tymaen is a great mount now planted with firtrees the site of a castelet probably a seat of owen bendew ednowen bendew which my friend and fellowtraveller the late rev john lloyd supposed to have been one of the habitations of that chieftain owen was lord of tegengl in  0   and one of the fifteen tribes of north woles he was distinguished by the name of pendew or bendew i have consulted daviess and all our dictionaries and can find no other translation of the word than thickscull of him are descended as the ms of the rev lewis owen my authority say many worthy families among them ithel ap rotpert archdeacon of tegengl who was living in the years      and      and the bithels and a great many families besides i might venture to mention the living descendants of the great bendew for the unfortunate idea of character impressed by the cognomen is entirely worn out they are only to be known by their arms argent three boars heads couped a chevron sable  the extinct families were the wynnes of galedlom and caerwis piers of llanasaph and of merton ysglan and the williamss of merton both of the parish of whiteford the parrys of coleshill and basingwerk the ffachnalts of ffachnalts in the parish of mold and the griffiths of panty llownd in llanhasa parish and griffiths of caerwis hall all of whom are now extinct unless it may be in the female line  goseddau a little farther on the left on the common are two raised mounts of a conoid shape called gorseddau a name common to all of the same kind according to our learned rowlands see p    it is derived from the custom which the druids had of fitting aloft on them when they pronounced their sentences and made their solemn orations to the people  multa says caesar de decrum immortalium vi et potestate disputant et juventute tradunt the custom of promulging the laws in the isle of man from their tinwald a larger but similar mount has its origin in druidism a certain officer takes the place of the druid and makes known to the people who stand beneath the institution of the new law  penffordd y waen on the mountain opposite to the place called penffordd waen are other remains of the ancient britons one or two tumuli and near one of them an upright stone and a little farther is another its tumulus possibly destroyed these are the meini gwr meini hirion and lleche differently denominated in different places these were sometimes memorials of great events sometimes monumental as in the present case there are illustrations of both in the book of genesis chapter xxxvvv     0 on the pillar which jacob erected after he had the gracious favor of conversing with the deity face to face he made a libation of oil on that raised on the grave of his wife rachel he omitted that respect  i now advance toward my conclusion and shall attempt the more interesting topics of the rural economy of my native parish and its mineral and commercial advantages in respect to size and population it may rank among the most important in this division of our principality  it is bounded on the east by the chester channel boundaries of the parish the seteia aestuarium of ptolemy its inhabitants at that time were the ordovices but whether in so long a period any of the ancient blood at present runs in our veins is extremely uncertain the southern boundary of this parish is that of holywell the northern those of llan asaph newmarket and cwm and the western those of tremerchion and caerwis  the whole length of the parish from its eastern extremity length not far from holloway turnpikegate to the extremity of the township trerabbot is about four miles two furlongs its greatest breadth from the seaside near llanerchymor to foelda adjoining to yskiviog parish is near three miles four furlongs the northern part which is its length is in general a rapid descent of two miles three quarters and     yards reckoning from penyffordd waen to llanerchymor all beyond to the south and to the west is tegen mountain or the old tegenia a large extent of plain swelling into gentle risings covered chiefly with heath and mixed with grass unless where the limestone stratum appears above the surface  being on the spot minerals i shall give first some account of our minerals the source of wealth to the landowner and of wealth but oftener poverty to the adventurous miners who like adventurers in a lottery to which miners may truly be compared are tempted by the good fortune of others to risque and frequently lose their all if they are successful they never thk of a future day but enjoy their fortune in good living forgetful of the pains it cost them till all is gone and they are again compelled to take to hard labor after a life of dissipation they sink under the fatigue lose their health and early become a burden to the community by adding to the load of paupers under which it groans  worked by the romans the want of gunpowder in early times with the romans was a great impediment instead we find that great fires were used the rock intensely heated and cracks formed in it by the sudden infusion of water pliny says of vinegar the wedge or pickax was then insinuated into the apertures and the stone or ore forced out miners often discover the marks of fire in ancient mines i am in possession of a little wedge five inches and a quarter long presented to me by the late mr smedley of bagillt hall discovered in working the deep fissures of dalar goch rock in the parish of diserth in this county this little instrument affords a proof of its antiquity by being almost entirely incrusted with lead ore it had probably lain in the course of some subterraneous stream which had brought along with it the leaden particles and deposited them on the iron  their tools pickaxis of an uncommon bulk and very clumsy have been discovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches these seem to have been the same with the fractaria of the romans pickaxes of enormous size used by the miners in the gold mines of spain buckets of singular construction and other things of uses unknown at present have been found among the ancient mines  my good friend that thorough honest mineagent mr thomas edwards of says aclwyd lately brought to me a fractaria     ancient  wedges    a eaden     and a wedge found in a shaft in our parish at the depth of sixty yards the wedge had at the thicker end a square perforation through which a stick was to be thrust which was held by a man whilst another with repeated strokes of a mallet drove the instrument into a crack it was to force open  i am also indebted to mr edwards for a plate of lead of the shape of the sole of a shoe with an elevated rim round the sides and furnished also with a hooked handle to hang it in the fissures of the rocks of the mines evidently designed to have placed on it a lamp to give the miners light in their subterraneous operations this and another were found at the depth of sixty yards in a roman mine  our mineral tract is from penyrallt or bryndigri mineral tract in a line to the western borders of holywell parish its extent to north and south is very narrow the turnpike road by kelyn and penyffordd waen as far as creecas describes its course east and west this part goes under the name of the whiteford rake and is nearly the summit of the parish in this part the veins on the east side when they dip into the fields scarcely ever bear  the veins run either north or south or east or west the last are generally found most profitable it is singular that the ore got in the first scarcely ever produces silver worth the refiners labor  the ores differ in quality lead ores the lamellated or common kind usually named potters ore yields from fourteen hundred to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead from twenty hundred of the ore but the last produce is rare  the quantity of silver produced from our lead is also variable the upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver the bottom in lead our refiners will assay any lead that with yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards the usual produce is fourteen ounces sixteen have been gotten but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon  carckfer on the side of the whiteford rake are the ruins of a large buding called carrickfergus probably from being sounded by some adventurer from that town for the purpose of smelting the ore got in its neighborhood it is near a century old and erected when the furnaces were constructed in a manner very different from those of the present times for by the remains of the chimnies they seem to have been formed like those of the modern ironfurnaces  the depth of our leadmines are various rich veins have been discovered to the depth of ninety yards  the veins are found either in the limestone rock or that of chert these frequently go to unknown depths the ore is pursued extremely far indeed and when it ceases the unprofitable is usually found to consist of spar  gravel leadore gravel ore or lumps from forty tons weight to the size of a hazelnut are often discovered in what the miners call flats or loose ground full of gravel tumblers and the like it is rounded and smoothed on the surface as if it had been rolled in violent waters but within is pure lamellated and rich it is a potters ore reduced to this form by accident  there is no ascertaining the quantity of lead ore which is annually taken up in our parish nor yet that of lead exported it is included in the customhouse books at chester in the general account of the produce of the mineral parts of this county and that of denbigh the number of tons exported in      is as follows foreign coastways   0 tons of lead        0 ore      about fifty years ago about seventeen hundred weight of copper ore was discovered in a tenement of my fathers called catherine georges which on being assayed was found to be very rich copper ore but none has been discovered since notwithstanding the ground has been diligently searched  lapis calaminaris or calamine calamine is found in very great quantities almost the whole way i have mentioned but increases in plenty as we advance eastward it is found in veins like lead ore often by itself sometimes mixed with ore which renders the breaking and separating a work of labor and expense what is found in these parts is generally of the cavernous boney or cancellated kinds this mineral was the cadmia of pliny lib xxxiv c  0 and the stonecadmia of strabo lib iii     the romans knew its uses in making of brass therefore cannot be supposed to have overlooked so necessary an ingredient the remains of the brassfounderies discovered in our kingdom show that they were acquainted with it the knowledge of this mineral in afterages was long lost before the reign of elizabeth much was imported from sweden but at that period it was discovered again in the mendiphills and fortunately at the same time that the working of the coppermines in those of cumberland was renewed our county abounds with it but till within these sixty years we were so ignorant of the value as to mend our roads with it which have of late years been turned up in a hundred places most successfully to recover the lost wealth it was john barrow john barrow a miner from the mendiphills whom i well remember living in this parish who first made us acquainted with this valuable mineral having long worked in the calamine mines of his own country  it appears that this mineral tract which is called the pantvein has yielded ore from very early times in the last century there have been no very rich veins but then it is almost always yielding something and of later years has been particularly productive of calamine in the beginning of this century sir thomas grosvenour had a good mine of lead ore on the side of the road my grandfather had another the benevolent charitable mr edwards of brinford had another the mr jones of celyn had another the last is said to have put a trapdoor to the top of the shaft and to have locked it and made use of the treasure below as a bank which he had recourse to according to his wants all these mines are on the same vein which is an east and west sir thomas grosvenours mine was included in the vast mineral grant possessed by his ancestor see tour in wales i p    all the other freeholders work on their respective freeholds sir roger mostyn on his manor of mostyn and on his freehold  a mr francis leicester of vauxhall gives an account of this vein in a small pamphlet called the little mine adventure published in   0  he styles himself the present lessee and gives i believe a good plan of the vein in an annexed map  black jack zinc pseudogalena black jack is met with in large quantities near the eastern extremity of the parish it is found to answer the purposes of calamine it has hitherto been only exported to bristol and is sold there at the rate of   l  0 s per ton delivered we have it in a metallic form of a blueish gray color and again of the colors of the dark semipellucid ambers cronsted ii p     magellans ed calls the first zincum ferro sulphurato mineralisatum the other zincum calciforme cum ferro sulphuratum  this semimetal and its ore has been long known in india and imported from thence in a metallic state under the name of tutenag as early as the year      it had even been fused in the goslar mines as early as      yet the secret of its being an ingredient in making brass did not reach us till the year      when it was communicated to us by mr von swob i refer to the learned bishop watsons entertaining and instructive works for a full account of this useful mineral let me here inform the reader from the same authority iv p   that by the accident of the dutch taking a portuguese ship laden with calamine we learn the origin of the name it being derived from the arabic calaem the same mineral as our calamine which is plentifully found in the peninsula of malacca and probably in other parts of india  milldistemper a most excruciating and often fatal disorder frequently attacks the miners who work in the hard veins of lead ore or of black jack or of such as are solid and lodged between sides or immersed in the rock the disorder is called the felyn from felyn a mill it may be translated into milldistemper because it was at first most frequent in the smeltingmills but for a considerable time past has ceased in those buildings and that happiness may be dated from the period in which lime has been used as a flux for the lead ores  in the mines it arises from the workmen being obliged to use the pickaxe in the hard veins to get the ore out the minute particles fly about and are taken down into the stomach and into the lungs this occasions a most obstinate costiveness attended with most dreadful pains which have been known to last fourteen and even twentyone days and attended with a strong symptomatic fever  william spencer a miner worked in meilwr a mine near holywell in a close confined situation and where the ore was of a particular hard nature he was attacked annually during fifteen or sixteen years usually in the spring with an acute pain in the pit of his stomach extending itself downwards with a griping pain in the bowels and attended with a violent reaching vomiting costiveness and tenesmus his bowels and abdominal muscles were much contracted his pulse feeble and low he was subject to cold clammy sweats and an unusual coldness of his extremities in the efforts to vomit he sometimes parted with a quantity of bile and in each evacuation i observed a deposition of a number of particles of lead by parting with which he found great relief the costiveness continued sometimes eight nine or ten days notwithstanding the repeated use of purgatives chiefly castoroil in large doses which i found to be the most effectual remedy when this was got the better of and a stool procured i observed in each evacuation a quantity of lead by which from the relief he obtained his pulse became better the contraction of his bowels disappeared and likewise the cold clammy sweats in three or four days and in the two last attacks he felt a similar acute pain in the lower part of his belly attended with a scantiness pain and difficulty in voiding his urine i consequently suspected that some leaden particles might have found their way into the bladder and gave him some diuretic medicines as balsam of copaiba gumarabic and oil of juniper in the course of twentyfour hours his urine was voided much easier and in greater quantity and he parted with as much pure lead by urine as would lie on a shilling he in the latter part of his days became asthmatic and weak and died nov  0      in the   st year of his age  i am obliged to mr william denman of holywell surgeon for the above account of the sad disorder but more materially to his skill and my excellent constitution for a speedy recovery in the last spring  april  th   p m from the consequences of a kneepan snapped in two transversely by no other violence than by stepping down two steps instead of one after a strict recumbency of near seven weeks in possession of high spirits fullness of faculties and enjoyment of my favorite amusements i rose from my bed with the grateful prospect of png the remainder of my days with my prior activity little impaired thankful to providence for graciously adding this blessing to the numbers of others it has showered on me during my long and various life  chert chert which i have mentioned before as being often the lodgement of the mineral veins is the petrosilex and lapis corneus of cronstedt i     it is of a flinty nature and the only one of that class we have in our county nodular flints the attendant on chalks are quite unknown here this is in the neighborhood of limestone as flints are concomitant with chalk it is an opaque stone sometimes plain often varied with stripes i have spoken of it as a matrix of the ores i now consider it as useful in manufactures it is frequently cut out of its quarries in great masses and sent to the pottery countries of staffordshire first for the purposes of forming stones to grind and comminute the calcined flints which are the great ingredients in the stone ware and i think it is itself calcined and being homogeneous with the purer flints serves also for the same purposes much of it is found in the midst of our hills sinking as i have said to depths unknown in sir roger mostyns land near penyrallt where the upper part of the parish hangs abrupt over the lower it forms the broken precipitous front and has been of late quarried out for exportation bishop watson ii     says that it sells in derbyshire at eight shillings ton the duke of rutland contents himself with five shillings per ton as lord of the rock the workmen have three shillings for raising i leave the reader to consult the right reverend author for the process of calcining etc the knowledge may be of use to my countrymen whether it is any way related to the petunse of the chinese p     it may not be wrong to consult our late legatine voyagers to china for that purpose  our limestone is a genuine marble often pure limestone often filled with entrochi and shells composed entirely of homogeneous matter i have mentioned the immensity of the beds but it is often found mixed with calamine and ore its uses cannot be unknown to any whether in building whether for the purposes of agriculture i am sensible its application is not extended as far as it ought to be but more of that under the article rural economy here i may say that it is the common flux used by the smelters in the fusing the lead ores which has taken off much of the noxious effect it formerly had on the smelters who were engaged in the operation and on the cattle who fed on the grass within reach of the smoke  on the west side of celyn rake is a large stratum of a deep gray limestone which when calcined makes mixed with common lime an excellent cement or terras for works constructed in water it is nearly equal to the aberdour stone from south wales of which much has been imported for the uses of our great buildings on the holywell stream  of spars we have in abundance the white opaque kind spars but i think none of the fine refracting spars or the crystallum islandicum which is frequent in the neighboring parishes  petroleum rockoil petroleum or what the welsh call it y menin tylwith teg or fairies butter has been found in the limestone strata in our mineral country it is a greasy substance of an agreeable smell and i suppose ascribed to the benign part of those imaginary beings it is esteemed serviceable in rheumatic cases rubbed on the parts affected it retains a place in our dispensary  adventious  i shall just mention two or three adventitious bodies discovered at vast depths in our mines we have been often surprised with finding great rude logs of timber at the depth of twentyfive or fortyfive yards under ground they are quite rough and totally freed from any suspicion of having been used in the mines even had they not been met with in new or unworked ground in blue clay and amidst tumblers they are firm and strong when first taken up and of a black color as if they had been burnt  shells shells especially conchae anomiae are very common sometimes loose but more frequently immersed in the limestone  change of strata i now quit the heights and go down a steep descent about half a mile into the lower part of the parish the mouth of a level and a shallow shaft near it discovers the change of strata the chert and the limestone quite disappear and in their place appear first the beds of shale shale black shattery and soon dissoluble when exposed to the weather it is the symptom of approaching coal and the covering cronstedt i     calls it a pyritaceous schistus and gives it other epithets according to its contents it is often found in beds of immense thickness and often filled with inflammable air which frequently bursts out to the great inconveniency and danger of the workmen it is also impregnated with bitumen which adds to its powers in many parts of the kingdom it is found to contain quantities of alum alum and to be worked for the purpose of extracting from it that useful article the trial is worth making in our parts we have the same advantages of coal for the process and watercarriage for the exportation as whitby has coals begin to appear in their unprofitable beds at a small distance to the east half a mile further in great bodies and of an excellent quality  the collieries of mostyn and bychton have been worked for a very considerable space collieries and in the last century supplied dublin and the eastern side of ireland with coals they were discovered in the township of mostyn as early as the time of edward i as appears by an extent of that place in the twentythird year of that reign  i remember many fluctuations in their state they are now in the most flourishing which i ever remember inferior only to that in which they were in the latter end of the late and the beginning of the present century the rise of the collieries at whitehaven which interfered with our trade to dublin was one cause of their decline but another great cause was a natural one the loss of the channel of the river dee we still load a few small vessels for the neighboring coasts of north wales but our present prosperity arises from the great works of copper plates bolts and sheathings for ships and the works of brass established of late years near the town of holywell to them may be added the consumption occasioned by the increase of population by the accession of the cotton manufactures and finally the vast quantities used for burning of lime the effect of the happy inprovement in agriculture annually increasing for numbers of years i do not mention our obligations to the numerous smeltinghouses for lead as they have been established among us during time immemorial  quay i remember a quay beneath the mostyn collieries built by the grandfather of the present sir roger mostyn at which small vessels used to take in their lading engine and i also remember on the shore the walls which supported the wheels and other machinery of a waterengine for draining the colliery of this i have a drawing by mr dinely whom at p    i have related to have visited mostyn in the year       this engine seems to have been formed on the model of some of those used in the german mines in the time of george agricola see the representation of several from p     to p     in his treatise de

the south side of wiral in cheshire as if corresponding with some of the flintshire they remain as yet lost on the northern part of the same hundred but are found a third time in vast quantities in lancashire on the opposite side of the mersey their extent from west to east in this country may be reckoned from the parish of llanasa through those of whiteford holywell flint northop and hawarden our coal is of different qualities suited to the variety of demands of the several sorts of founderies in the neighborhood sometimes is also found the peacockcoal of dr plot remarkable for the beauty of its surface glossed over with the changeable brilliancy of the colors of that beautiful bird  canl cl the beds of canal are inferior indeed in elegance to those of lancashire but greatly coveted by the limeburners  coals were known to the britons before the arrival of the romans who had not even a name for them yet theophrastus describes them very accurately at lest three centuries before the time of caesar and even says that they were used by workers in brass it is highly probable that the britons made use of them it is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil that of glo and as a farther proof i may add that a flintax the instrument of the aborigines of our island was discovered stuck in certain veins of coal exposed to day in craig y parc in monmouthshire and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the unexperienced natives who in early times were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths the artless smelters of ancient times made use of

singular appearance looking like the semivitrified lava of a volcano the stratum is in front universally changed in its disposition and run into a horrible mass of red and black often porous in all parts very hard in it is a hollow a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire which continued burning by its own phlogiston see bishop watson i     to p  00 and caused the phenomenon its fury chiefly raged toward the front and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed which at some distance within land appears only discolored the stratum is a sandstone of the common sort  da costas fossils     i am informed that these appearances are not uncommon in derbyshire and that mr ferber an ingenious swede and mr whiteburst our ingenious countryman have taken notice of them in their writings  i shall here introduce the mention of damps found in collieries which are not unfrequent a firedamp and sometimes act with amazing fury and fatal consequences there are two species the suffocating and the fire the last is very rare in the leadmines unless in those parts where the shale or stone attendant on coal begins the first kills instantaneously by its mephitic vapor and is a disaster common to neglected vaults and drawwells the other is inflammable and burns and destroys in a dreadful manner as the colliers through negligence in not setting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head do often experience the most tremendous instance was on february  d      in a coalwork at mostyn which i shall relate from the philosophical transactions and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns  the damp had been perceived for some time before resembling fiery blades darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit the usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil after a cessation of work for three days the steward thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day and to bring wind by a secure way along with him that if it burst again it may be done without danger of mens lives went down and took two men along with him which served his turn for this purpose he was no sooner down but the rest of the workmen that had wrought there disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger hasted down after them and one of them more indiscreet than the rest went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp pit at which the damp immediately catched and flew up to and fro over all the hollows of the work with a great wind and a continual fire and as it went keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides  the men at first appearance of it had most of them fallen upon their faces and hid themselves as well as they could in the loose slack or small coal and under the shelter of posts yet nevertheless the damp returning out of the hollows and drawing toward the eye of the pit it came up with incredible force the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs and singed what was left burning their faces and hands the blasts falling so sharp on their skin as if they had been whipped with cords some that had less shelter were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station and beaten against the roof of the coal and sides of the posts and lay afterward a good while senseless so that it was long before they could hear or find one another as it drew up to the daypit it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye and up it comes with such a terrible crack not unlike but more shrill than a cannon that was heard fifteen miles off with the wind and such a pillar of smoke as darkened all the sky overhead for a good while the brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long yet the mans body and other things from the pit were seen above the tops of the highest trees at lest  00 yards on this pit stood a horseengine of substantial timber and strong ironwork on which lay a trunk or barrel for winding the rope up and down of above  000 pounds weight it was then in motion one bucket going down and the other coming up full of water this trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron yet it was thrown up and carried a good way from the pit and pieces of it though bound with iron hoops and strong nails blown into the woods about so likewise were the two buckets and the ends of the rope after the buckets were blown from them stood awhile upright in the air like pikes and then came leisurely drilling down the whole frame of the engine was stirred and moved out of its place and those mens clothes caps and hats that escaped were afterward found shattered to pieces and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit  another of these damps happened in the same lands within my memory in the year      another in      one man was beat to pieces in the bottom of the pit two others were taken up alive but died soon after and two others survived but were most dreadfully burnt and one who is now living remains a dreadful evidence of the effects of the damp all his fingers burnt off and his visage terribly disfigured  i shall here describe agitations of the earth derived from other causes which earthquakes dreadful as they have been in distant countries have here occasioned little more than a momentary alarm i have at this house felt four shocks of the earthquake i shall relate their effects from the philosophical transactions in which they are recorded on april  d    0 between the hours of ten and eleven at night i was greatly alarmed with a violent shock of an earthquake i who was in bed was frequently moved up and down and the bed having castors was removed some small space from its proper situation  during the shock a great noise was heard in the air and some nights before lights were seen in the sky such as were previous to the earthquake in town  i have summed up the remainder in a letter to sir joseph banks baronet k b which had the honor of being read before the royal society on january   th following and afterward printed in the transactions vol lxxi p      downing dec         dear sir it is very singular that in three days after my return home i should be reminded of my promise by a repetition of the very phenomenon on which i had engaged to write to you for on saturday last between four and five in the evening we were alarmed with two shocks of an earthquake a slight one immediately followed by another very violent it seemed to come from the northeast and was preceded by the usual noise at present i cannot trace it farther than holywell  the earthquake preceding this was on the   th of august    0 about a quarter before nine in the morning i was forewarned of it by a rumbling noise not unlike the coming of a great wagon into my courtyard two shocks immediately followed which were strong enough to terrify us they came from the northwest were felt in anglesea at caernarvon llanrwst in the vale of clwyd south of denbigh at this house and in holywell but i could not discover that their force extended any farther  the next in this retrograde way of enumerating these phenomena was on the  th september      about a quarter before ten at night the noise was such as preceded the former and the shock so violent as to shake the bottles and glasses on the table round which myself and some company were sitting this seemed to come from the east i see in the gentlemans magazine of that year that this shock extended to shropshire and quite to bath and to swansea in south wales  the earliest earthquake i remember here was on the  0th of april    0 it has the honor of being recorded in the philosophical transactions therefore i shall not trouble you with the repetition of what i have said  permit me to observe that i live near a mineral country in a situation between leadmines and coalmines in a sort of neutral tract about a mile distant from the first and half a mile from the last on the strictest inquiry i cannot discover that the miners or colliers were ever sensible of the shocks under ground nor have they ever perceived when the shocks in question have happened any falls of the loose and shattery strata in which the last especially work yet at the same time the earthquakes have had violence sufficient to terrify the inhabitants of the surface  to this observation i may add that no eruptions of water were ever observed to follow the shocks no water from the vast reservoirs of that element formed in the deserted pits which have often burst through the hollow which contained them and more than once drowned the unhappy colliers who have been working beneath  i have seen in prints an observation of some gentleman learned in earthquakes that the cause of those i have mentioned which leave the shattery strata of the coalmines unaffected to have been electricity which in these instances moved equally and gently so as not to cause any concussion or to go perhaps far below the surface so that they leave the worked depths totally untouched  none of these earthquakes were local for excepting the first all may be traced to very remote parts the weather was remarkable still at the time of every earthquake i have felt  i remain with true regard etc t p   quadrupeds the quadrupeds of this parish are common to many parts of england yet i shall give a catalogue of them in our ancient tongue and affix to them those in the english    in respect to the march ceffyl the horse the caseg or mare dispaiddfarch or gelding there

therefore spare them they animate the air as well as other birds do the woods both feed principally on mice the evolutions of the last and their beautiful suspension in the air are pleasing spectacles and contribute to grace the scenery  the owl tribe in my opinion do not render night hideous their hootings and their other notes break finely into the stillness of the evening and their frm and

nuts which it breaks with its bill also on fircones acorns berries and insects its bill is as strong as that of the woodpecker which enables it to pierce the bodies of trees and make great havoc among the timber  vast numbers of waterfowls frequent our shores in the winter time chiefly ducks and wigeons in very severe weather variety of others emigrate here but none excepting those which accidentally visit every other maritime part of great britain  i shall conclude this mention of the birds with an account of a singular accident discovered in a turkey which was killed for my table the cook in plucking it found herself much wounded in the fingers on examining the cause it was found that from the thigh bone of the bird issued a short upright process and to that grew a large and strong talon with a sharp and crooked claw exactly resembling that of a bird of prey every head was set to work to explain the cause of this wondrous phenomen the effects of fright of conceit on the minds of the female human and brute in the state of pregnancy was then considered and all the various instances of monstrous productions i have heard of a duckling which to the surprise of a gave family ad from its nst with a long serpentine tail instead of its natural rump this was readily resolved into a fright the motherduck took at finding when it went once to lay a snake coiled up in the nest as was a real fact i consulted the learned but found the doctrine of terror and fancy totally exploded i then consulted the memoirs of the royal academy of sciences at brobdingnag and to my inexpressible satisfaction found that the opinion of that illustrious body coincided with my own so i put down this uncommon accident as no more than a relpium scacath or in the modern phrase a lusus

oblige persons by bringing it to their houses on paying double price  sting ray that rare species of fish the sting ray br zool iii no    is sometimes taken in our channel it is greatly dreaded by our fishermen on account of the dangerous spine issuing from the tail with which it might give a mortal wound from the british zoology i shall add that the terror of its weapon supplied the ancients with many tremendous fables relating to it pliny aian and oppian have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate creation trees that are struck by it instantly lose their verdure and perish and rocks

abounds with little springs which accumulating in their course form streams of power sufficient to turn some cornmills of considerable size  ffynnon oswald the largest independent rivulet is that which gushes from ffynnon oswald or the well of oswald in the township of merton ychlan it takes its name from the saxon monarch martyr and faint oswald king of the northumbrians who was defeated and slain on october  th     near oswestry by the pagan penda king of the merians who hung his limbs on stakes dispersed over the field as trophies of his victory some of the tradition reached our parish

eminence named brynygroes or the hill of the cross stood one of those marks of piety of which still remains the shaft  whiteford stream the stream of most utility rises from a spring a little beyond the village of whiteford it runs by my house and is no small ornament to my ground it turns my two mills which with much patriotism and little wisdom i erected the first is near the gwibnant or wibnant and made in form of a chapel my great folly is about half a mile lower is an excellent mill and does much business for the lessee this stream is much augmented by another which rises at a place called says ffynnan or the seven wells and murmurs through the romantic nantybi and unites with it at the wibnant it concludes its course near llanerchymor smeltinghouse to which it is of great use by setting in motion some stampers for comminuting the slags before they are committed to the hearth for the extraction of the remaining lead  the last stream runs through felyn blwm or the leadmill felyn blwm a great romantic dingle which divides this parish from that of llanasaph near its fall into the sea is a considerable mill the property of sir roger mostyn this dingle probably takes its name from the number of ancient smeltinghearths for lead found in it in use in the primaeval artless times of smelting  all our dingles run parallel to each other nature of the dingles and begin at some distance from the first or steepest descent from the mountain the sides of all are clothed with oaks and each has its rill at the bottom these great ravines i may call them were

and are more or less chalybeate one which rises before my house is strongly so and proved very beneficial to the only person i know who made a fair use of it  in respect to the husbandry of this parish husbandry it may be divided into several parts i shall first pay attention to the higher or the mountanous that tract is very extensive mountain ground covered in general with heath mixed with coarse grass the climate very cold in comparison of the lower parts we often find during winter a severe frost reign there when the ground has been quite soft and the air mild in the lower parts  the soil in general a poor loam and in many parts very thin in others the limestone pervades the stratum and forms large tracts of rock there are certain parts fit for agriculture as has been found by the surreptitious enclosures made in a few parts which yield corn such as barley and oats in a kindly manner i wish experiments were made of planting part which if put under the care of a woodman might be a national benefit as well as a private one to the lord of the manor the neglect of appointing woodmen would render the planting of no effect by reason of the variety of trespasses as we freeholders of the lower parts who make our woods the glory of our estates do daily and cruelly experience  our mountains support some blackcattle the greater part of which are left out the whole year to take their chance still the high country is a nursery many are sent lean to market and drove to more genial soils most of our farmers fatten cattle and either sell them to the butchers for the holywell market or to those of chester and leverpool  sheep the sheep are numerous they likewise are left to themselves and become in hard weather great nusances by their trespasses on the cultivated lands of us lowlanders as may be imagined they produce little wool their fleeces are coarse yet of that a small quantity is sold into merionethshire and the rest manufactured at home and made either into cloth for the country people or into flannel for the women or knit into stockings all for home consumption in respect to mutton much is brought to market from the mountains but that is only during the vigorous part of the summer and after the frost or rainy season but the greatest part of the sheep bought by the gentry for the table is purchased at the distant country fairs  numbers of hogs are bred in our parish hogs and numbers are sold at the fairs and driven to distant parts  the soil of the lower part of the parish is in general a very stiff clay which continues quite to the edge of the cliff soils clay above the shore in many places are spots of gravel but of very small extent we have also beds of pure sand but that useful article is in most parts scarce  from the rhewl to avon marsh siambr is a thin vein of very rich marle saponaceous to the touch prettily veined with red gray and white it is got in too small quantities for use on the edge of the mountain especially on the tenement of plas captain is a larger vein of a coarser kind the tenant thomas blore a cheshire man conversant in this species of manure has made a judicious application of it on his farm and as long as it lasted reaped the reward of his industry  beyond the space between the boundary and the mountain is a tract of light soil which may be said to begin under kelyn lichter soil in the township of uchlan and continue in a direct line by tyddin ycha to plas ycha in the township of mostyn this is extremely well adapted for that useful root the turnep and it has been tried with success but the farmer is obliged to give up the cultivation by reason of the depredations the poor make on the crops they will steal the turnips before his face laugh at him when he fumes at them and ask him how he can be in such a rage about a few turnips as a magistrate i never had a complaint made before me against a turnepstealer our farmers and our coaladventurers have not yet plucked the old woman out of their hearts for the last suffer likewise in a great degree in their trade yet hardly complain incredible as it may appear numbers of them are in fear of being cursed at st aelians well see my tour in wales vol ii p     and suffer the due penalty of their superstition  at uncertain seasons clouds of ringdoves woodpigeons or queests wintermigrants from scandinavia have visited our turnepfields and done no small damage to the crops  potatoes every cottage has its garden and if that is not large enough any landlord or neighbor allots him a piece in one of his fields for the purpose of a potatoegarden and this spot is prepared and manured by the landlord and for which not more than    d per rood is demanded the last comfort is not of long date for i can remember the time in which it was almost unknown to the poorer people neither did the rich extend the culture beyond the garden how singular does appear to us the following quotation from old gerard p     who speaks of it as being also a meat for pleasure equal in goodness and wholesomenesse unto the same being either roasted in the embers or boiled and eaten with oil vinegar and pepper or dressed any other way by the hand of some cunning in cookerie  at present our gardeners and a few others of the parish raise sufficient to supply their neighbors and to carry for sale to the adjacent market the stiff soil of the parish is unfavorable to the culture if we want potatoes in any quantities we must import them from the vaie of conwy from cheshire and lancashire in the present time of scarcity  may      the cultivation has been unusually increased in whiteford parish before this season i never raised more than was necessary for the use of my family this year i increased my potatoeground manyfold even before i had read the speech made by sir john sinclair thousands have done the same in a similar state of ignorance some from benevolence some from view of gain and others on the principle of selfpreservation i may predict also from the former motives that wheat will be in the next season sown fourfold admonitions surely are unnecessary in the next year we may rejoice in plenty even in superfluity and have the happiness of seeing the poor man exult in our success  but the halcyon days are arriving fast let us comfort ourselves with the fair prospect before us and devoutly pray for the accomplishment of those hopes delivered to us in the following prophetic effusions let us cut off those legal bars which crush the culture of our fertile isle were they removed unbounded wealth would flow our wastes would then with varied produce smile and england soon a second eden prove   wheat grows remarkably well in our clayey land wheat it is the red kind that the farmer prefers for seed it is the hardiest and the surest of finding sale the white and the gray being in our country less in request we raise much more than the parish would consume the rest is exported to leverpool to supply the county of lancashire with bread that vast county not being productive of much wheat the demand therefore from the numerous populous towns is very considerable and at times occasions a great rise in the price and a consequential clamor at home the complaints are the draining of our county of grain and the imaginary evil of great farms grain is one of the articles of commerce of the parish and weaving the support of thousands and thousands of poor in the great county i have mentioned we feed them they supply us with various species of clothing as to food let me add that the farmers of that county even make us a return in that article for they supply us with potatoes as we do them with wheat we all depend upon one another so true is it that god never formed an independent man without such means of sale or we may call it exchange of commodities the great farmer would cease to plough would cease to form those magazines of corn on which at all times our markers depend and which are the great preservative from famine in these kingdoms at times bad seasons occasion bad crops and of course enhance the price an inordinate lust of gain may sometimes occasion criminal confederacies which criminal as they are have hitherto baffled every attempt of the legislature to prevent the poor are now left quite defenseless against the iniquitous race of forestallers etc etc by the repeal of the  th and  th edw vi it is much to be lamented that those humane laws are not revived modified in any manner adapted to the times a middle man in great contracts is often requisite it is not that description of men at whom i aim but those who in small bargains tempt the farmer by offers of exorbitant prices and contribute to the distresses of the poor and discontents of the country to a degree unspeakable at present a calamitous war assists that evil but surely we cannot grudge food to our brave countrymen who are fighting for all that is dear to us among them we may have neighbors sons of tenants our own sons or different relations to whom if we think a moment we should be ashamed to deny a share in the produce of the labor of their native country in which it is possible they themselves might have bore a share  supposing all farms are reduced to an equality and all made small ones the ground must be divided into little portions for the support of a miserable team or of a few cows or for raising small quantities of corn no magazines could be formed against evil days the produce of the dairy would be small and the provision for fodder serve for little more than to support the live stock a few hobbets a hobbet consists of    quarts a measure is half a hobbet a peck is half a measure these measures are used in all the flintshire markets they extend also to other welsh counties and even herefordshire of corn would be sent to market to pay the rent the rest might serve to maintain the family till the return of the harvest and if the stock should be consumed before that season how would they wish for the restoring of the great farms many of the little farmers are also daylaborers to whom could they apply for work the very support of them and their families never has there been a famine in england since the introduction of great farms unavoidable scarcities will happen from causes inevitable but there has not been an instance for numbers of centuries of the poor running into corners to die for want of food of their seeing their infants perish before their eyes and perhaps a plague might ensue the consequence of famine to thin the land of multitudes of the miserable survivors  i speak disinterestedly for i have not on my estate a single great farmer i find no merit in this assertion had it been otherwise i should have supported him in all that was right in common with my poorest tenant and my poorest tenant perhaps in preference to him  i would never grant a lease to a great corntenant i would preserve a power over his granary which legislature will not or cannot assume should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it in years of scarcity and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain should he attempt a monopoly should he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next market or should he refuse to sell to the poor who cannot attend the market corn in small quantities i would instantly assume the power of the landlord and expel him from my estate a just punishment for the tenant who through rapacity declines to comply with my desires excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public  the necessity of great farms is admitted but let it be remembered that their support rests upon the laborers who are equally requisite to the great farmer as beams are to a building let not the rapacity of the miscalled great man direct all his force to the support of the opulent farmer for the sake of increased rent he will as sad examples prove depopulate his country by removing the sturdy laborers to the ground of wiser landlords and leave his own weakened by their desertion while the fields of the former laugh and sing but round his own ingens it solitudo  i could wish was it in my power to add even to the cottages of my laborers two or three small fields that they might have the comfort of a cow to supply their families with milk they are too useful a class of men to be neglected to be left to the precarious possibility of getting any of that invigorating fluid so necessary for their infants and even for the support of their own strength to sustain them through their labor give them a dry stated cottage with an upper floor and a kind landlord and a british laborer need not envy caesar  before i take leave of the subject let me define the size of a great and a small farm in this parish our greatest farm is rented at l   0 per ann at the rate of about    s per acre our small farms have from  0 to  0 acres and the rent per acre from    s to   s there may be in every parish instances of the exorbitant raise of rent an evil most frequently originating in the luxury of the landlord our rents are moderate because our gentry would blush to add one dish to their table at the expense of the tenant mr wedge in his survey of cheshire p    speaks humanely and sensibly on the affected maxim of high rents being a spur to industry this for i must help mr wedge with a simile resembles the practice of the prudent planter who wishes to quicken the industry of his negroes by the invigorating application of the cartwhip to their velvet skin  in respect to leases the utility is not perfectly agreed on in our parts of north wales i have known leasetenants of very moderate rent continue on their farms their whole term without success and i know in this parish and within a small distance several rackrent tenants with large farms the most prosperous of any in the country they improve boldly and reap amply the fruits of their industry they have confidence in their landlords nor can they recollect more than one instance and that indeed disgraceful enough survey of north wales article denbighshire p     in which they found it misplaced they are masters of the knowledge of the soil and the nature of the climate of their own country the appearance of their tenements does them credit when they heard of a person sent among them to inculcate the principles of good farming they smiled at the design but spoke with gratitude of the kind intent of the board of agriculture denbighshire has long had its little board for north wales does not neglect its own interests an agricultural society has for a number of years been estabished in the vale of clwyd none who have visited that beautiful tract can deny the general excellency of its culture  in cheshire the ancient practice of leasing is growing fast out of use and agriculture will increase in that county in proportion  mr george kay of leith the missionary to whom was committed the inspection of every farm in the six counties of north wales favored me with a call some time in the last summer and delivered to me his credentials from sir john sinclair i was really at the time out of spirits at the same time a report was circulated that the object of the mission was to ascertain the reality of our land tax which was much credited by my countrymen i was certain that the report was entirely unfounded but i did not choose to trouble myself with militating against what i knew must speedily become selfconfuted i treated mr kay with all civility he left me and i believe through all his journey one place excepted had no reason to complain of the reception he met with sir john sinclair is a man of honor he had not the lest occasion to give himself the trouble of making to me so earnest an asseveration of the purity of his intentions as he did in his last favor he is above taking clandestine means of getting at any kind of information  we lament that mr kay did not see in any one of our six counties a single custom that could be useful to others hints for improvements in north wales p  0  from the state of numbers of our farms i suspect that we had previously adopted many methods of agriculture from english counties which must have occasioned his remark i would fain pay that compliment to his candor on the whole i fear that the mission has passed most unprofitably to both visitor and visit nothing seems to have been learned by the one and nothing taught by the other  we thatch our hayricks with admirable neatness and in that manner preserve the hay for years i do not know a better expedient even could the landlord afford to every little farm a haybarn or give them a moveable canopy which is liable perpetually to be out of order necessity in every country causes different modes of economy send shenkin ap morgan on a survey of cathness and he would at first stare at the bykes tour in scotland       d ed p  0   but would admire the ingenuity of the contrivances and acknowledge the wisdom of the farmer in the preservation of his grain where other means were wanting  there are certainly both beyond the tweed and beyond the dee many thousands of acres of which a tenant should be courted to attempt the cultivation and be bribed by leases to settle upon them in north britain the practice is common in north wales our mountain landlords rarely grant leases possibly from their not finding the necessity  in all the mineral part of flintshire are numbers of small farms tenanted by carriers who entirely support themselves by the carriage of the lead ore and calamine or coal these are reckoned the most slovenly farmers we have they apply themselves to carriage to such a degree as to neglect their tenements the minerals are the great natural staple of this and most of the parishes so that these species of farms are quite indispensable  let not the little farmer or the cottager repine at the wealth of the great farmers it is not many weeks since their empty stomachs have been filled from the hoards of the latter had they not been able to form a stock or to enable by sale others to do so what would have become of you the good the benevolent have been able to purchase from them the food that has contributed to preserve for many months you and yours from cruel want the instances of the recent charities have not been equalled i may speak of the universal charities but i will recall to your minds those of your several neighborhoods in public calamities little souls lie squat in their holes great souls arise and are called forth to action some from a generous sensibility others from selfish motives i cannot but confess myself to be among the latter i am selfish enough to wish to put out my money at lest on reversionary interest but that on security incontestible he that has pity on the poor lends to the lord and look what he lays out it shall be paid to him again with what animated benevolence of sentiment does sir thomas broune comment on this pious exhortation there is says the great physician of norwich more rhetoric in that one sentence than in a library of sermons and indeed if those sentences were understood by the reader with the same emphasis as they were delivered by the author we needed not those volumes of instructions but might be honest by epitome  the produce of the wheat of this parish is from seven and eight fold to twelve or thirteen produce of wheat according to the pains taken with the ground or the nature of it our general manure is lime burnt in sodkilns the limestone broken small sodkilns is placed within a thick circular wall of sods and the strata of stone broken small interlaid with beds of coal which is set on fire by wood placed in certain holes left at the sides these holes serve likewise to admit the air which promotes the fierceness of the fire within the limestones are piled in a conic form to a great height above the top of the sodwall and then covered thickly with sods i must mention that the holes are four in number placed opposite to each other and have a gutter cut from one to the other which is left hollow by means of flat stones over them to promote the current of air a circular gutter also runs close to the interior side of the sod wall a commonsized kiln will require about sixteen tons of stone but there are larger and those often of an oval form  sometimes the limestone is burnt in common kilns then taken and carried to form a compost with earth which had been deposited in some adjacent place and which usually had been dug out of old ditches the lime is intimately mixed with it and left a considerable time to mature after which it is applied to use  our best barley is raised in the light soil which we have mentioned at p     barley in general our farmers prepare the ground for barley by giving it a fallow in december or january and again harrow and plough it the latter end of april or beginning of may in the stiffer lands the crops are frequently very unfavorable the quantity raised is not equal to the consumption it is the principal grain used by our common people the produce from the hobbet is about equal to that of the wheat  oats oats are chiefly sown in the mountain enclosures or on the lands adjacent to the mountains the produce is by no means equal to our demand  grasses the artificial grasses are but two clover the red sort which we sow immediately after the barley clover when the clover is sown by itself or without any other grassseeds the quantity to each acre is eighteen or twenty pounds it is not a favorite grass but we do not know how to remedy ourselves it wears out in less than three years after which we renew the ground with a crop of wheat managed as before related the cloverseed is procured from the vale of clwyd and other places where the plant is cultivated for the sake of the seed  ryegrass ryegrass is sown in our poor land which if not harvested early is little better than a fodder of straw  i value myself on being the first in this parish who introduced on my estate the husbandry of draining and flooding which i did last autumn and throughout the winter on a great number of acres i did intend to desist from working after christmas had i not been induced to continue it throughout the season in consideration of the numbers of poor people who were in the deepest distress for want o employ the season was so rigorous that the laborers were obliged to break into the unfrozen ground with the pickax before they could use the spade this and the short days made the work very expensive but i was far overpaid by the consideration of having given food to multitudes who in themselves or their families must otherwise have labored under the greatest difficulties the undertaker was mr henry harrison who followed the most approved practice i flatter myself that in the ensuing year i shall experience the effects of his skill  to clear the freeholders of whiteford parish from any inattention to that important article of husbandry planting planting i bring the brief but irresistible defense of  the impossibility the dingles are filled with oaks i believe there is not one of us have any waste ground for the purpose all our tenements consist of arable or pasture land too valuable to be spared for any other purpose in this populous parish sir roger mostyn on his coming to his estate planted the little that had been cleared by his predecessor besides mostyn or whiteford wood see p    many of our very hedges are filled with oaks possibly they do not benefit our land by their shade but a few of us are true druids and should we apply the ax we should imagine that we heard the groans of the hamadryads at every stroke  i am in particular so very avaricious of my woods that at this instant of writing i with true reluctance sign to my son the deathwarrant of a few staghorned trees that have far outlived the best of their days they in all probability would have had a respite could i move from my couch to take a look at my ancient favorites but the void space shall be instantly enclosed and i may promise that in a short time it will be filled with the best of successors selfsown from some of their own descendants their eldest and most sturdy progeny  sir edward lloyd a great planter if we of whiteford parish are deprived of the possibility of planting within its limits yet we can boast of a flintshire gentleman who probably will be found to have contributed as a planter more to the benefit of his heir and of the state than any other in the principality in this age or any past i mean sir edward lloyd bart of pengwern in the parish of st asaph who finished his long and useful life on may the   th of the present year on his flintshire estates he has planted a hundred and sixtytwo thousand trees and on his estate at pantglas in the county of caernarvon more than three hundred and twenty thousand most of the trees are oaks which in future times may float on the ocean guardians of britain in distant wars excited either by the ambition of foreign states or by the incendiary machinations of domestic malcontents  even at present what have we to dread the maritime genius of our island at length begins to smile on her again and vigor and activity once more will fill every sail the great spirit of old sandwich has transmigrated leaving behind the frailties of its mortal state purified and congenialized to the breast it has taken possession of on its return to the wonted board to resume its wellknown powers  haud segnis strato surgit palimrus et omnes explorat ventos atque curibus era captat history of holywell parish     london    history of holywell parish at avonmarsh siambr see p    we quit the parish of whiteford and enter the township of greenfield in the parish of holywell along a most excellent road on the left is a continuation of the marsh above which is a low cliff of the same nature as those which front the shore of the parish of whiteford  let me preface this little history with saying that avon marsh siambr is six miles distant from the rill which divides holywell parish from that of flint that its greatest breadth is three miles from the turnpike road in greenfield to the borders of the parish of skyviog townships and that the parish consists of the townships of holywell greenfield bagillt vawr and vechan whelston coleshill vawr and vechan brynfordd and calcoed its boundaries on the east are flint and part of northop parishes on the east halkin on the southeast skyviog on the west whiteford and on the north the estuary of the river dee  s above avonmarsh siambr on the rising ground stands scky a small house which with the estate belonging to it has been of late years purchased by james potts publican in holywell and the house much improved it originally belonged to a mostyn a younger branch of the mostyns of trelacre t m signifying the name of thomas mostyn cut above the arms on the monument a daughter of this gentleman or one of his descendants and heiress of the place transferred the estate into the very ancient family of the blounts of orlton in the county of hereford and with them it remained till the purchase by the present possessor  river dee company the rights of the freeholders over the marsh extend a certain way to the east these were settled by commissioners in the year      and a plan made asserting the clames as well of the freeholders as of the river dee company these were founded on acts of parliament originating in the years      and the following from that of the   th and   th of william iii entitled an act to enable the mayor and citizens of chester to recover and preserve the navigation of the river dee it is possible that mr andrew yarrenton might be the primary cause of the improvements by a survey he had made in the year      of the river dee and its estuary  i refer my reader to the account i have given at p  00 of my welsh tour vol i for farther particulars  the other acts were passed in the years    0      and      and the works were begun with vigor the project was carried on by subscription and the adventurers were to be rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides from the white sands or the sea from chester and between the county of cheshire on the north side and the county of flint on the south side being sands soil and ground not bearing grass the tract as appears by the chart attending the award made in      and preserved among the records by the clerk of the peace for the county of flint terminate on our side at the point of air in the parish of llanasaph on the cheshire side at the little meels at the extremity of the hundred of wiral  the adventurers in the river dee company have gained a considerable quantity of land from the ravages of the sea beginning from the walls of the city of chester and extending above five miles even beyond the lower ferry  the report of the quantity of embanked land made from the beginning by the river dee company and others according as it is made to me by mr wedge agent to the company is as follows acres enclosed by the company   00 on blaconmarsh belonging to john crewe of crewe esquire about  00 on the south side of the river belonging to the freeholders of hawarden as mr wedge believes about   00 total statute acres  000 marshes uninclosed august   th      about  000  mr wedge informs me that the grass which is found to answer best in these sandy enclosures is medicago sativa lucerne lucerne grass it will not however grow to any perfection on land where there is not a depth of at lest two feet of dry sand or soil beneath the surface and succeeds like most other grass in proportion to the quality of the soil all kinds of stock are  of it it is of a very feeding nature and is both grazed  rvested close grazing will destroy it but if properly attended to and assisted with manure about every f yer the plants will continue strong for upwards of thirty years it may be grazed sparingly with safety in the spring until the first week in may and also in autumn in the months of october and november after the second crop is out the hay being of a dying nature seems to be much better adapted for feeding stock than either for horses or milking cows i know no kind of hay that stock will feed faster upon than lucerne if it is well harvested as grass it will answer best for soiling stock when housed  last ebankment no attempts to embank were made farther to the west till the summer of      when about forty statute acres were enclosed by the same company on the white sands bordering on greenfield marsh early in the next winter a fierce tide destroyed part of the embankment but it now seems to be restored in the most effectual manner while this confident paragraph was in the press on the morning of october   th a fiercer tide assisted by a fiercer wind has almost ruined the enclosure and made such breaches as may probably deter the company from any further attempts to restore it   projects near the extremity of this marsh the turnpike gates cross the roads leading to flint and holywell a grand and beneficial project was some years ago formed of making two canals the one to be carried over the marsh assisted by the holywell stream down to or near the perch or anchoringground with a lock capable of receiving vessels of a hundred tons burden  another canal was designed to have branched from this eastward as far as pentre rk near flintcastle for the purpose of carrying the coal which was or may be discovered on that tract either to the various mineral works or into the lock for exportation i trust if ever the plan is resumed that it may extend a little farther to the collieries belonging to sir roger mostyn and myself and others which may be discovered hereafter nor see we any reason for our exclusion by so impolitic a partiality the more choice of shops the cheaper the goods both of the plans were taken by the able engineer mr william jessop in the year      and declared to be practicable the expense indeed would have been very great but alas the aspect of the times forbids us to flatter ourselves with the resumption of the great design  the mark or place where the vessels lie to receive or discharge their lading is about two miles from the turnpike gate the mark the channel of the holywell river is to be seen at low water meandring to it and might prove a useful means of improving the commerce of the country at present the vessels must on the recess of the tide lie dry and in hard gales before they get afloat are subject to much danger the sands also shift and make the mark or anchoringground often precarious  the river dee company have power to enclose as far as the channel of the dee which in holywell parish is supposed to extend as far as three miles from the turnpike road in a late act of parliament for ascertaining the rights of the parish and those of the company in the spring of      the agents for the company after the act to confirm a line of boundary between the property of the company and the part of the marsh which was common had been twice read introduced clauses to render their property extraparochial and consequently to exempt the occupiers from contributing to the church and poor and other parochial rates of holywell whiteford or any parishes concerned and also to exempt future householders from being liable to execute any offices within those parishes and at the expense of others artfully attempting to exonerate their tenants from bearing any part of the burdens but the design was discovered and the offensive clause omitted  the company have obtained a grant of all their lands from the parish of hawarden to that of whiteford under the following circumstances lands derelict by the sea belong to his prerogative and being consequently extraparochial the tithes are due to the king and if he grants them his patentee shall have them such is the opinion of sir john comyns as conveyed to me by the favor of edward jones esquire of wepre hall  wats dike on passing the turnpike gate a small walk brings us to the site of the abbey and castle of basingwerk a place of importance in the wars between the english and welsh the land toward the sea is steeply sloped the west side was protected by a deep gully formed by the river the south east by the vast ditch which had hitherto been mistaken for that made by ossa king of the mercians i owe the detection of the error to mr john evans of llwyn y groes who proves it to b one termination of another stupendous work of the same kind called wats dike which appears by his manificent map of north wales published this year to have first become visible near maesbury mill in oswestry parish where it is lost in morassy ground from thence it takes a northern direction to hen ddinas and by pentrer clawdd to gobowen the site of a small

so often confounded with offas ditch which attends the former at unequal distances from five hundred yards to three miles till the latter is totally lost  it is observable that there are numbers of small artificial mounts the sites of small forts in many places along its course as well as that of offas these were garrisoned and seem intended for the same purposes as the towers in the famous chinese wall to watch the motions of neighbors and to repel any hostile incursions  it is remarkable that wats dike should have been overlooked or confounded with that of offa by all writers except by thomas churchyard the poet who assigns the object of the work that the space intervening between the two was free ground where the britons and saxons might meet with safety for all commercial purposes  bingwerk castle vestices of the fortress appear in the foundation of a wall on the edge of the ditch and on the road side near the turnpike gate opposite to the ruins of the abbey lord lytteiton hist henry ii  d edit ii quoted in     coll curious discourset i  0  says that the founder was an earl of chester i imagine that it must have been richard son of hugh lupus and second earl of chester and that the abbey was fortified by reason of a danger he had incurred near the abbey for even religious tutions had no exemption tempore necessitatis llli citum est hospitari et in castellari in ecclesia innocentius de mmuitate ecclesia   the first notice i find of it is in the life of st werburg by brasaw who informs us that richard on his return out of normandy where he had been educated began his reign with an act of piety he attempted in      a pilgrimage to the well of st wenerede but either in going or returning was attacked by the welsh and obliged to take shelter in basingwerk he applied to st wburg for relief who miraculously raised certain sands between flintshire and wiral and thus gave means to his constable to pass to his assistance which sands from that time were called the constables sands bradshaw styles the place of his retreat an abbey a proof that here had been a religious community before the time usually assigned for the foundation of this house i must also draw from lord lytteltons authority for i can find no other that this castle was demolished by the welsh in the reign of stephen hist henry ii   henry ii in      after his escape from the ambuscade of eulo left basingwerk restored well fortified and manned m pa      in order to secure a retreat on any future disaster he did the same by the castle of ruddlan in his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest after his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods but made his marches along the open shores  the same monarch left another species of garrison powl  0   for he established here a house of knights templars a military order introduced into england in the preceding reign they were first instituted in the holy land for the protection of pilgrims and possibly henry might have the same in view in fixing them here to secure the english devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint who seems about this time to have come into reputation it is singular that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two yet so greatly did they flourish that about the year    0 or a hundred and fifty years after their institution the order had acquired in different parts of christendom nineteen thousand manors  this castle was but of very short duration for in      the gallant prince owen gwynedd laid siege to it took powel     and levelled it to the ground after which the name occurs no more as a fortress i think at this period it belonged to hugh de bello campo or beauchamp on whom this and ruddlan castle had been bestowed by the english monarch annals waverienses       abbey the abbey called also by the welsh maesglas or greenfield  of which there are some considerable remains was founded in      according to the opinion of bishop tanner by randal the second earl of chester according to bishop fleetwood by henry ii for my part i believe it to be of greater antiquity but do not pretend to derive its origin no light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by sir william dugdale there are three of them either serving to confirm the ancient donations or confer new in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor but there is not the lest hint of his having been the founder i must attribute that honor to one of the princes of wales for both lhewelyn ap jorwerth and his son david in their respective charters recite that they give and confirm the several donations to god st mary the monastery of basingwerk and the monks which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls  randal was certainly a great benefactor for it appears that before his days the monks had only a chapel here from that period it became considerable and about that time part of the present buildings were erected for the convenience of its inhabitants who were of the cistercian order  giraldus calls it cellula de basingwerk iin camb lib ii c  0  he

fallen out of use and the last was coming into fashion in the days of the first great benefactor  the church lay on the east side but is now almost destroyed the refectory is pretty entire and on one side has a great recess with two round arches the pillars which support them are very curious formed of circular stones of the form of cheeses set close one upon the other  above were the cells for the lodgings of the monks with a small window to each  the chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building the windows are long narrow and pointed the pilasters between them on the inside

them for his history i shall only add here that the ruins of a noble oak still to be seen near the remains of the abbey is supposed to have been his cotemporary  i have spoken of his son and successor nicholas at pp       and shall again in the article bagillt resume the subject  the whole road from the abbey to st wenefredes well is most remarkably picturesque along a narrow but deep valley bounded on one side by hanging woods in former times the sacred stream hurried to the sea unconfined by the busy manufactures during the reign of pilgrimages nothing but the cornmills the property of the monks found employ for its waters  before i advance up the valley let me observe that notwithstanding it has the common causes of health a rapid stream and the greatest part of the year a brisk wind usually from west to east yet it is visited with the usual diseases of the country in a degree even greater than other parts nor has the angina maligna hereafter to be spoken of spared the children of this little tract  commerce found its way to the valley about fifty years ago white and red lead works i can remember the building of the works of white and of red lead under the conduct of messrs smedley but prior to these a little above was a tiltingmill and an ironwire mill ironwire mill the first lessees were heart and co from yorkshire they were succeeded by mr barker and sir james creed who erected a new one on the lower part of the stream on mr barkers death the remainder of the term was purchased by mr john norman and mr rouben chambers under a new leaf mr john chambers converted the old mill into a steelwiremill before which his mother used it for a warehouse for a coarsepapermill paper mills the paris mine company succeeded to both the premises and covered them with their important edifices  it must be observed that the ancient cornmills belonging to the abbey stood where the papermill was the molendina quae juxta portam abbatiae habent dugdale monast i       snuff mills on this stream had been three snuffmills the oldest was occupied by mr edward jones tobacconist now living it joined the old and uppermost cornmill it was taken down by the cotton company who on the site built part of the new cornmill near the holywell spring  peter parry tobacconist had two snuffmills one on the land of john pierce joiner deceased a little below the crescent cottonmill it was purchased by the brass batteringmill company for the sake of giving their pool a little greater depth of water which built another for peter parry below their brassworks  old smeltingwork an ancient smeltingwork stood in my memory on the site of the old cottonmill and part of the garden they were erected before the year      by lease from roger pennant esquire of bagillt i do not recollect the names of the lessees but the company was known by that of madam kaye and co the smoke did such injury to the fine woods belonging to sir george mostyn of trelacre bart as to occasion many lawsuits between sir george and the company so that there ensued a total cessation of the smeltingtrade in these works whether the suit came to a decision does not appear the suit must have commenced before march   th      from which day all proceedings which used before to be in latin were to be carried on in the english tongue just before that period poor sir george suffered a nonsuit for using the word prope instead of juxta and was foiled a second time by using in the proceeding the title of sir george mostyn instead of george mostyn esquire his elder brother being living and at that time an ecclesiastic in the church of rome and it is said that he suffered a third repulse by stating that the works were in the township of greenfield instead of holywell or vice versa  how the affair ended i cannot learn the building reverted into the hands of the heirs of the lessors edward pennant esquire granted a lease of it in      to mr champion partner and agent in the wormley company near bristol who there calcined blackjack he was the first who engaged in such a concern in this country and probably in great britain which he carried on under the protection of a patent  a pinmill was built in      for the use of james eden pinmill pinmaker who occupied it about two years and then failed the next occupier was mrs chambers who converted it into a coarsepaper mill and continued the use of it till      when it fell into the hands of the cottoncompany which turned it into a smithy and finally three cornmills three cornmills formed with the above the sum of the works upon the stream in my early days the lower of these two reckoning from the well was pulled down  in the year      began the memorable epoch in the annals of our famous stream when the late mr patten of warrington famous epoch of commerce and co built the first batteringmill for copper and brass in about ten years from that time mr john smalley now deceased introduced the first manufacture of cotton by his successors and by the great coppercompanies those behemoths of commerce our little jordan was soon drunk up by their skill and industry they succeeded to the benefit of the state and to their private emolument tho williams esquire member for marlow  that useful and active character with unparalleled speed covered the lower part of the stream or that next to the sea with buildings stupendous in expense extent and ingenuity of contrivance these great works are under the firm of the paris mine company paris mine company the buildings were completed in the year    0 and held under lease from sir pyers mostyn bart owner of the whole stream excepting a small part to mr samuel williamson chief agent of this part of the works i am indebted for the account of the works carried on here these are entirely confined to the manufacture of copper  in this department is a great forge for heating the cakes of copper previously to their being beat into pans or rolled into sheathings etc etc the wheels and machinery are set in motion by the water from a large pool parallel to the road which is filled from the stream and let out by another channel to effect its purposes  these may be called the great magazines for the supply of the royal navy with the various necessaries in copper such as sheathings bolts and nails some of the bolts are twenty feet long and so hardened by rolling and battering as to be capable of being driven almost to their heads in the entrance forward and run abaft of the ships where the beds of timber are the thickest which work is facilitated by boring with an anger twothirds of the length  some of the nails are a foot in length and from that size to that of a sadlers cack  rudder bands and braces are here made of an enormous size some designed for the largest firstrates weighed one ton fourteen hundred  the number of men employed in these works is ninetythree this is intended when they are in full employ the same must be understood of all the rest  the head of water to this mill is about twentyone feet and a half and the superficial surface of the pool about    0   feet  the trade of these works is not confined to the royal navy the merchant ships are from hence supplied with considerable quantities of sheathing bolts and nails as are many of the ships in the service of the east india company  from hence braziers are furnished with copper vessels of all kinds and the materials for all the copper branches of their business  the works on this river are supplied with their copper from the paris mine and mona mine companies the ore of which is smelted chiefly at ravenhead and stanley in lancashire  the cornish ores are smelted at swansey neath bristol and in cornwall  the duke of devonshires ores at whiston in derbyshire  the number of vessels immediately employed by the coppercompanies on this river to convey the several manufactures or the materials to and from leverpool and the other places connected with them amount to between thirty and forty from thirty to fifty tons burden  mr williams has besides the works on the holywell stream two near marlow in buckinghamshire upon as large a scale as those in greenfield there are also in this kingdom others belonging to different proprietors at congleton and macclesfield in cheshire at swansey and bris and in cornwel and a number in the vicinity of london  the companys coin i must not be silent on the subject of the most beautiful coin or token in use by this great company as it exceeds in elegance any which has been yet emitted on one side is the head of a druid emblematic of the isle of mona the ancient seat of the venerable order and which now produces the material of the coin on the reverse is the cipher of paris mountain with a promissory legend to pay one penny or one halfpenny as it happens to be in london anglesey or leverpool to bearer on demand  vast quantities of these coins are counterfeited at birmingham and may be had by public order in any number  brass meltinghouses above these works is a great cluster of vast square chimnies the discharge of the tremendous volumes of thick black smoke rising from the making of brass these are the brass meltinghouses belonging to the greenfield copper and brass company under the direction of mr donbavand where they have six large melting houses with twentyfour fires each fire contains nine pots with metal fluxes etc here they make platebrass for the purpose of being manufactured at their batterymills platebrass for wire for the pinmanufacturers and ingotbrass for the various founders etc at this place they have a mill places to calcine buddle and grind the lapis calaminaris etc for the purpose of making brass also a copper forge not used at present the head of water is about    feet superficial surface of the pool about       feet the number of the men employed in these works is about fifty the materials for the making of brass are all at hand the copper shot and clippings are from the adjacent works the calamine from our own mines and the charcoal from our woods the art of making brass in early times is mentioned before at pp         the first patent for the calamine stone and the use thereof was granted to william humsrey and christopher shutz dated the   th of september      at which time the long lost art in these kingdoms began to revive  in digging the foundation for the brass meltinghouses hypocaust mr donbavand discovered an ancient roman hypocaust furnished with various flues with the superincumbent tiles of a fine red color these artificial hot baths and sweatingrooms were the greatest luxuries of the romans this proves that they had a stationary settlement in this place probably of merchants concerned in the mineral works which they certainly had on the adjacent mountains of which i have given an account in p     of this book  not far from this work on the east side of the river wirework is the great manufactory of brass wire of every denomination also here are drawn the square materials for making copper nails which are formed by the common process of beating and heading this work has a head of twentythree feet which is capable by means of an extensive pool that may be formed above of having a very large work built on the now vacant spot  at a small distance to the south cottonwork a most magnificent cottonwork soars like the tower of babel above all the lower buildings i shall here only say that about ten weeks before its completion nothing but a void appeared before me at the expiration of that space in another ride i took i cannot express my astonishment at seeing the enormous mass risen as if by magic out of the ground it was erected in the summer of      is thirtysix yards long ten yards wide and six stories high and is worked with a waterwheel eighteen feet high and seven feet wide with a fall of water of sixteen feet  ne polling mill at some distance beyond this is the new rolling mill erected in      this is superintended by mr joseph thomas to whom i am indebted for the account  the largest and most commodious building for the purpose it is applied to of any in the kingdom its area within the walls measures eightysix feet in length by sixtynine in breadth floored with iron flags its height in the center is twentyeight feet and an half the roof is single and covered with copper supported in the center by two pillars eleven feet and a half distant from each other on their tops are transverse timbers supporting one end of each beam which more immediately sustains the roof the other end resting on the wall  the waterwheels are of castiron upon a curious construction they are three in number each of which receives its supply of water at a height of about fortyfive degrees from an ironpipe fixed in the bottom of the penstock and so fitted to the buckets of the wheel that scarce any water is wasted of which we are studiously careful wheels so receiving their water are called breastwheels of which kind i believe all the wheels on this stream are excepting that belonging to the cornmill and another at this companys brassworks which is used for grinding calamine the water by that mode of delivery communicating the most powerful impulse and the most steady motion the ironwheels here are twenty feet diameter and they will when unclogged with heavy weights perform twenty revolutions in a minute now if we suppose a wheel of that diameter moving upon a plane with the same rapidity with which it revolves on its axis it will in a year describe a line nearly equal in length to five circles of our globe at the equator the yard and reservoir of water pertaining to this noble manufactory are suitable to its magnitude and by much the most spacious on the holywell stream  the number of men employed here are about fortysix  remarks  st it is a certain fact that the people constantly employed in the coppermanufactories are as healthy and arrive to as great an age as the generality of people employed in other occupations not connected with fire or metal but they are scrupulous observers of the ancient law which forbade to eat with unwashen hands and they find it highly necessary to perform a careful ablution of the whole body at lest once a week to rub off the copper dust which adheres to their bodies and occasions violent eruptions of a green color evincing by the tinge their origin the pain and symptoms are easily removed by washing with clean water but if that is neglected the consequences become serious and even to require chirurgical assistance   d young dogs which have acquired a habit of licking copper sheets or bars have never been known to survive long the metallic virus by that means conveyed into the intestines soon destroys the animal by violent purging   d yet it may deserve notice that the writer of these hints having formerly kept a great number of poultry running about the yard he observed that the fowls preferred drinking the water from a shallow copper pan that lay out of doors and was generally full of rainwater tinged of a deep green color to fresh clear water of which there was abundance no ill effect was ever known to have happened to them from the green water though a succession of poultry resorted to it for years  the writer of this having been employed on the spot from the first opening of the ground for the foundations of the mill and other buildings found frequent proofs that the surface of the land had formerly been about fourteen or sixteen feet lower than at the time the buildings were erected his inducements to form that opinion were   st that though the soil contained many large pebbles throughout its whole depth yet at the depth of twelve to sixteeen or eighteen feet gray pebbles of large size were every where found in great abundance and mixed with sand or gravel just as they appear on the shelving shores of many rivers   d at the depth of fifteen feet under the wood where the warehouse now stands the head of a battleaxe was picked up the writer not chancing to be on the spot when it was taken up could gather no information whether any part of the handle remained but supposes not he was shown the spot where it lay and measured fifteen feet to the surface   d and the most decisive proof is that after cutting down an oaktree of pretty large girth and afterward clearing away the root in digging still deeper for the foundation of the present warehouse the workmen found a limekiln of very small dimension perhaps it would contain half a ton of limestone but perfect and having calcined lime in its basin it was constructed of the same kind of red sandstone as that now below wepre the bottom of that kiln now forms the lowest foundation of the northeast corner of the warehouse which is nealy level with the surface of the cottonmillpool below it  immediately above the last are the works under the superintendency of mr daniel donbavand greenfield copper and brass company who with great civility informed me of their origin and consequent improvements these are on the site of the brassbatterymills built in the year      and set to work  0th sept      the first brass made at greenfield was on the  0th august      then held by mess patten and co since january      they have been in the hands of thomas williams esquire and co under the firm of the greenfield copper and brass company who have very much improved them by various erections so as to enable them to finish goods for africa america and most other markets viz brass neptunes or large pans in which the negroes make salt pans for getting the gold out of their rivers and for various other purposes kettles brass and copper rods bright and black manillas  the first are rings for ornaments to the arms and legs the last for the current money of the country the last are not unlike the golden bracelets of the ancient britons the ends turned up and flatted and add to these various sorts of latten brass etc for mathematical instruments etc etc  the word latten is applied to works in brass with which for certain purposes is an admixture of any other metal sometimes it is made a synonym of brass itself watsons essays iv  0 and in the same page and stringer in his opera mineralia explicate p    gives us the qualities of the said latten as explained in the patent of  th elizabeth to humphrey and shutz abovementioned which was granted to shutz for his great cunning knowledge and experience as well in the finding the calamine stone called in latin lapis calaminaris and in the right and proper commodity thereof for the composition of mixed metal commonly called latten and in reducing it to be soft and malleable and also in apting manuring and working the same for and into all sorts of battery wares castwork and wire and also in the mollifying and manuring of iron and drawing and forging of the same into wire and plates for the making of armor and also for diverse other needful and profitable uses  the word latten is also used for a distinct metal as appears by two patents one of the  0th henry vi to his chaplain and controller of all his mines of gold etc in devon and cornwall see stringer p  0 the other in the patent of  0th elizabeth see watson iv  0 both which mention mines of latten but as the bishop observes whatever the name did mean it is now lost i can only say that calamine does appear in so many and so different forms that the application might have been to one of them since the qualities seem to have been the same  the head of water to these mills is about    feet and the superficial surface of the pool or reservoir about  0    feet   bra works    all the pools belonging to the several works are well stocked with trout brought from the river wheeler which flows beneath caerwis they grow to a vast size i have heard of one which had been taken in the brass millpool which weighed between eleven pounds and twelve pounds but those overgrown fish do not equal in flavor those of an inferior size the threespined stickleback  br zool iii no     a little fish seldom of the length of two inches abound in this stream but especially in the stiller parts where the water has been confined for the use of the works eels are the only fish besides these found in these waters  those beautiful birds the kingfishers are very frequent about these waters and almost dazzle the eye in their frequent transitions from place to place  this work was erected in the spring of     crescentmill is twentysix yards by ten wide and is six stories high it is worked by a waterwheel fifteen feet high and ten feet wide with a fall of water of thirteen feet and a half this work makes a noble figure on the stream is ornamented with a handsome cupola with a fine gilden crescent on the top from which it receives its name  a cornmill stood on part of the site of this mill cornmill on the stream had been within these few years a tiltingmill under the direction of mr william smalley which has since been removed to avon wen below caerwis and a wiremill on an extensive scale has been erected on the wheeler at a small distance from the tiltingmill in the beautiful vale of maes mynnan  old cottonmill a little beyond the crescentmill is the old cotton mill or that which was first known on the stream it was erected in the spring of the year      by mr john smalley of preston in lancashire he died january   th      aged    and was interred in whiteford churchyard on his tomb mention is made of his having at holywell established the cottonworks this mill is small and low is    yards long   yards wide and only three stories high and is worked by a waterwheel    feet high and   feet wide with a fall of water of    feet   inches  mr john smalley senior had long been engaged in a cottonwork at cromford near matck in derbyshire unhappily within the baleful influence of a tyrant rival which forced him to seek the protection of st wenefrede under which he prospered and his children still prosper blessing the benefit of the change made by their injured parent  greatest cottonmill a little way above this mill is the largest and most magnificent of any on the water it was erected in the autumn of the year      in the space of six weeks from laying the foundationstone it is  0 yards long  0 yards wide and   stories high and is lighted by a hundred and ninetyeight sash windows which nightly exhibit a most glorious illumination it is worked by a waterwheel  0 feet high and   feet wide with a fall of water of  0 feet  all the cottonmills on the river go under the name of the cotton twist company it is to mr christopher smalley one of the partners and eldest son to the founder of these great manufactories i am obliged for the account of what relates to them     the cottontwist company have between three and four hundred apprentices which they clothe and feed themselves management of the children in commodious houses built for that purpose the boys and girls in separate houses these houses are whitewashed twice every year are fumigated three times a week through every apartment with smoke of tobacco besides this the sleepingrooms are washed twice a week and the bedstocks are frequently sprinkled with rectified oil of tar all the windows in the sleepingrooms open at the tops by which a thorough draft of air is admitted during the whole time the children are at work to these and other precautions the good state of health of so many children may be justly attributed for though the number of apprentices have not been less than  0 for these seven years past they have only buried seven their food for dinner is beef or pork and potatoes three or four times a week the other days herrings and potatoes or soup and bread and cheese as much as they please to eat their breakfasts and suppers in summer is milk and bread in the winter when milk cannot be had they drink porridge or broth with bread and cheese a surgeon is appointed to superintend their health and a sunday school is regularly attended by a master at each house  our little children sleep three in a bed their bed the larger sizes only two and those who work in the night are so far from succeeding each other in the same beds that they do not even sleep in the same rooms  the number of men employed at greenfield are above  00 women and children above  00 at northop    at denhigh   0 at skyg    at newmarket above  00 apprentices above  00 total       cotton wool is produced in the east and west indies and also in many other places the isle of bowbon in the east indies furnishes the best the next to this in quality grows in the portuguese settlements in south america from whence it is exported to lisbon and imported from thence to england in british bottoms dutyfree if in foreign bottoms a penny per pound is paid about fifteen years ago not more than five hundred bags were cultivated in the brazils but of late years on an average fifty thousand the dutch settlements say berbice and surinam supply a considerable quantity of good cotton and comes to this country better cleaned than any other  the cottonplant grows naturally in china and india the cultivation traveled westward into arabia persia and the levant it is also cultivated in the province of valencia in spain with vast success on the plains of that rich province in good years about four hundred and fifty thousand arrobas of    lb each are harvested i suppose all this to be manufactured in spain at lest i do not hear of any being imported into our kingdoms  cotton twist is spun here of   0 hanks to the pound each hank is   0 yards long so that one pound of cotton thread thus fine will be    miles  0 yards long the new principle for it is not yet  0 years old by which cotton wool is made so perfect a thread is by the use of ironrollers moving horizontally their speed is governed by brass wheels of different sizes and numbers calculated to produce what fineness is wanted the twist required is given by the flier and spindle the cottontwist made here is sent chiefly into england and scotland to be woven into ginghams muslins muslinets dimities nankeens fine callicoes fustians etc etc which goods when finished are either admitted or smuggled into every part of the known world it is introduced into every part of the russian dominions and even into the distant kamtschatka  a number of machines called mules are also used here with success mules this machine is a compound of the waterengine and the spinningjenny and being of a mixed breed was i presume the reason of its being so named it is a machine particularly adapted to the spinning of fine yarns and far exceeds every other yet discovered for that purpose  the last mill on the river is a cornmill cornmill a large building erected by the cottontwist company instead of the old one and of another which stood a little lower down on the site of which stands part of the great cottonmill  the length of the stream from the fountain to the marsh length of the stream is one mile and two hundred and thirtyfour yards the following are the

remarking the vast population these companies have brought to the townships of holywell and greenfield in respect to the first there is no great increase of building but the latter has of late years received such an addition in works and in houses that almost the whole is a continued series of edifices of different kinds from the upper cornmill quite to the seaside among them are a hundred and seventyseven houses for workmen of different occupations of which few indeed have been erected beyond my memory  the origin of this useful stream is discovered at the foot of the steep hill beneath the town of holywell or treffynnon st wenefredes well to which it gave the name the spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock and is confined in a beautiful polygonal well covered with a rich

stone immediately over the fountain is the legend of st wenefrede on a pendent projection with the arms of england at the bottom numbers of fine ribs secure the arch whose intersections are coupled with a sculpture  some are mere works of fancy grotesque figures of animals but the rest allude chiefly to the stanley family this building and the chapel over it rose from the piety of that great house which left these memorials of its benefactions there are besides some marks of the illustrious donors for example the profile of margaret mother to henry vii and that of her husband the earl of derby cut on the same stone  the compliments to the stanleys are very frequent the wolfs head is the arms of the earls of chester it is enclosed in a garter in respect to sir william stanley knight of that order who had been chamberlain of that city and justiciary of north wales the tun with a plant issuing out of it is a rebus the arms of his wife elizabeth hopton allusive to her name this proves that the building was erected before      in which year sir william lost his head the other badges of the same house are the stags head the eagles leg and the three legs the arms of the isle of man  we also find that catherine of arragon widow to prince arthur and afterward the unfortunate wife of his brother henry viii was a benefactress to this building at left her arms appear here three pomegranates in a shield surmounted with a crown the badge of the house of granada in memory of the expulsion of the moors by her father ferdinand sandfords gencal      the eagle seems also to belong to her being one of the supporters of the arms of her family  over one of the lesser arches on each side of the well are the dragon and grehound the supporters of the arms of england during the reign of henry vii and part of that of henry viii the first was born by henry vii as a badge of the house of tudor which derived itself from cadwalader last king of britain who bore on his ensign a red dragon henry in imitation of him at the battle of bosworth carried on his standard a red dragon painted on white and green silk which afterward gave rise to the office of rougedragon among the heralds  on one side of a wall that supports the roof was painted the tale of the tutelar saint at present almost defaced over it is inscribed in honorem sanctae wenefredae v and m  in another wall is an elegant nich in which stood a statue of the virgin mary pulled down as i have been informed in the year       i have also heard that there had been another of st wenefrede to grace the image on high festivals it is probable that isabel countess of warwick widow to the great richard beauchamp left to st wenefrede in      her gown of russet velvet dugdales warwickshire i       over this spring is a chapel chapel of the same date with the other building a neat piece of gothic architecture but in a very ruinous state the east end is a pentagon and had five windows with elegant tracery the top arched and crossed with neat slender ribs it had been open to the body of the chapel but the fine arch which formed the division has been bricked up a great number of years ago on one side of the body is an oblong recess divided from it by three arches supported by pillars and within is a window impending over the well under the center window must have stood the altar the whole length of the chapel is fiftytwo feet the breadth is twenty the recess is twentysix feet long and eight broad the roof is neat woodwork this had been a free chapel in the gift of the bishop with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel in richard iiis time the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks yearly for the sustentacione and salarie of a priest at the chapelle of st wynefride harln mss no         the chapel is the property of daniel leo esquire in right of his wife laetitia sister to the late john davies esquire of llanerch  the following order for putting the chapel over the well into possession of a clergyman of the church of rome was addressed to sir roger mostyn baronet by the queen of james ii  sir roger mostyn it having pleased the king by his royal grant to bestow upon me y ancient chapel adjoining to st winifrides well these are to desire you to give present possession in my name of the said chapel to mr thomas roberts who will deliver this letter into y hands it being also my intention to have the place decently repaired and put to a good use i further desire that you will affoard him your favor and protection that he may not be disturbed in the performance thereof you may rest assured that what you do herein according to my desire shall be very kindly remembered by  may ye  th      whitehall

which as far as i recollect has been a clergyman excepting in one instance  sunday schools besides the sunday school where the cottoncompanys apprentices are instructed there is another parochial one kept in the chapel over the well this is supported by a general subscription through the parish and about seventy poor children are instructed by proper masters in reading writing and arithmetic the copper and brass companies are handsome subscribers but they send only a few adults to be instructed in matters their more advanced years make them capable of learning  this room has been used as the hall for holding both the great and the quarter sessions i remember matthew skinner esquire chief justice of chester holding the assizes there and i also recollect a quarter sessions the hall having been properly fitted up for the purpose but the distance from the center of the county was found so inconvenient that after these instances they were removed to flint and finally to mold where they still continue  the window in this chapel impends a vast height over the bathing well chapel window several persons not in their sober senses have leaped into the water without receiving any other damage than the smart caused by the dashing on the surface from their exalted station within my memory one john blackwall of llanasaph took a far more desperate leap into the same water from the churchyard wall almost adjoining to the chapel the leap would have been great had it been on level ground here had he not reached the water the consequence would have been that of being dashed to pieces on the flags  the bathingwell is an oblong    feet by    with steps for the descent of the fairsex or of invalids near the steps two feet beneath the water is a large stone called the wishingstone it receives many a kiss from the faithful who are supposed never to fail in experiencing the completion of their desires provided the wish is delivered with full devotion and confidence  on the outside of the great well close to the road little spring is a small spring once famed for the cure of weak eyes the patient made an offering to the nymph of the spring of a crooked pin and sent up at the same time a certain ejaculation by way of charm but the charm is forgotten and the efficacy of the waters lost  the well is common for i find by a decision of the court of chancery on a lawsuit respecting the lordship of holywell between sir john egerton knight and john eldred chancellor ellesmere decrees that on calling to mind that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of ancient and worthy memory he does not think fit that the petitioner or any other should have the property thereof notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor and therefore his lordship does order that notwithstanding the said grant that the well shallcontinue as now it is or heretofore has been saving to the petitioner and his heirs and assigns the benefit of the stream and watercourse with the appertainances  there are two different opinions about the origin of this stream one party makes it miraculous the other asserts it to be owing only to natural causes the advocates for the first deliver their tale thus  of saint wenefrede in the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of wenefrede of noble parents her fathers name was thewith a potent lord in the parts where holywell now stands her mothers wenlo descended from an ancient family in montgomeryshire and sister to st beuno beuno assumed the monastic habit retired to clynnog in caernarvonshire where he built a church and founded a convent after completing this work of piety he visited his relations in flintshire and obtaining from his brotherinlaw a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided erected on it a church and took under his care his niece wenefrede it is probable that the saint used occasionally to make some residence in this country for near the entrance of the dingle opposite to the great cottonwork are two small fields called to this day gerddi saint beuno or the gardens of st beuno  a neighboring prince of the name of cradocus son of king alen was struck with her beauty and at all events determined to gratify his desires he made known his passion to the lady who affected with horror attempted to escape the wretch enraged at the disappointment instantly pursued her drew out his sabre and cut off her head cradocus instantly received the reward of his crime he fell down dead and the earth opening swallowed his impious corpse higden in his

fifteen years she died at gwytherin in denbighshire where her bones rested till the reign of king stephen when after divine admonition they were surrendered to the abbey of st peter and st paul at shrewsbury the memory of the two great events that of her first death is celebrated on the   d of june that of her translation the  d of november  the first sunday after st jamess day is also kept in honor of certain saints dydd sul y saint probably st wenefrede and st beuno not with prayers or with holy masses but in every species of frolic and excess it originated in the romish church but i clear that congregation from being concerned in any part of the orgies which are i fear celebrated by persons of our own religion only who flock here on that day for most unsaintly ends the day is called dydd sul y saint or the sunday of the saints i wish i could trace the primaeval ceremonies and whether one might not have been the druidical custom the deiseal or deisol or turning from the east to the west according to the course of the sun in some of the western isles the custom is still preserved with great devotion deas signifies the right hand and sul the sun from the ceremony being performed with the right hand always next to the circle cairn or whatsoever they surround see more in the learned porlases antiquities of cornwall     to      it is possible that this custom might have been applied to our saint and the words deiseil or deisol corrupted for that purpose for dyddsol for giving particular sanction to the sunday in question  a fraternity and gild was established in honor of our saint at shrewsbury it had its common seal which an ancient seal through the kindness of my friend mr henry levingston is now in my possession it is of copper of the form expressed in

proved by numberless miracles the waters were almost as sanative as those of the pool of bethesda all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief the votive crutches the barrows and other proofs of cures to this moment remain as evidences pendent over the well the saint is equally propitious to protestants and catholics for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion  the holy father gave all encouragement to the piety of pilgrims to frequent this fountain pope martin v seldens notes on michael drayton     in the reign of henry v furnished the abbey of basingwerk with pardons and indulgences to sell to the devotees these were renewed again in the reign of queen mary by the interest of thomas goldwell bishop of st asaph powels notes on giald cambr     mr addison says he saw his picture at ravenna in the convent of theatins among the eminent men of that order  who fled into italy on the accession of elizabeth multitudes of offerings flowed in marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin  the resort of pilgrims of late years to these fontanalia has considerably decreased the greatest number are from lancashire in the summer still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours sending up their prayers or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times i am sorry to say that this excess of piety has cost several devotees their lives few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence a crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit the prince who lost three kingdoms for a mass paid his respects on august   th      to our saint and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his greatgrandmother mary stuart lost her head the late doctor cooper of chesters mss  this prince gave in the course of his progress as marks of his favor golden rings with his hair platted beneath a crystal i have seen one which he had bestowed on a roman catholic priest of a nighboring family the majority of devotees are of the fair sex attracted hither to commemorate the martyrdom of st wenefrede as those of the east did the death of the cyprian favorite whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to deplore his fate in woeful ditties all the summers day while smooth adas from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of tha yearly wounded   we whose ancestors between two and three centuries ago abridged our faith to the mere contents of the old and new testament and to the creed called the apostles do not think the belief in the above and other legends requisite i refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary doctor powel in his notes on the itinerary of giraldus cambrensis and to bishop fleetwoods annotations on the life of the saint for proofs against the truth of the tale but with protestants and temperate catholics it carries with it selfconfutation  the waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine providence in order to fulfill his will heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles which were delivered down to succeeding times as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission without them a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the supreme being has long since been established second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe subordinate to the first every element proves to us a medicine or a bane as suits his unerring dispensation we cannot want we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals the supposition would be bestowing on them the attributes of the deity omnipresence and omniscience  some eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss and the bloody stains to mere vegetable productions far from being peculiar to our fountain the first is that kind of moss called jungermannia asplenioides fl angl  0  tour in wales vol i tab   imperfectly described and figured by dillenius in his history of mosses which induced us to give a new engraving of it this species is also found in another holy well in caernarvonshire called ffynnon llanddeiniolen in a parish of the same name  the other is a byssus likewise odoriferous

stone to which it adheres easily betrays itself by the color being as if smeared with blood and if rubbed yields a smell like violets micheli in his genera of plants mentions the same genesis   0 tab    fig    and schwenckfelt discovered it among the vegetables of silesia he calls it a muscus subrubeus and informs us that the smell is grateful to the heart and that if put among clothes it gives them a good scent and serves to drive away moths c su and sae     linnaeus says as quoted by baron haller no  0 0  that it is of use in eruptive disorders the conferva gelatinosa syst pl iv     fl scot ii     is found in the same well   to the  w wheel a species of moss is apt to vegetate on the oaken wheels of several of the mills of this stream these give shelter to multitudes of animalae these it is probable eat into the timber and occasion the ill same our river has obtained of having a corrosive quality mr william chambers of holywell has assured me that he has seen the penstock and contiguous parts which lie always under water in some parts pierced with a few holes in others eaten quite thorough and that the planks appeared after the moss was separated as if consuming by the wet rot he adds that the moss first adheres to the oaken planks and then it is that the small grubs eat into them and in some parts quite penetrate so that the moss becomes seemingly the nursery or receptacle of the grubs the method used to preserve the wheels was by scraping the moss off annually  this account is corroborated by mr robert tart a very intelligent mastercarpenter who says that the wheels made of the best oak are destroyed remarkably soon by the holywell stream a wheel which ought to have lasted thirty years has here been known to become unfit for use in about twelve mr tart recommends wheels made of pine or red deal and that the surface of the wheels be paid with pitch tar and ruddle but even this has proved ineffectual for the water occasions the mixture soon to peel away mr donbavand was so sensible of the evil as to substitute instead of timber wheels of castiron in the works which he superintends  edward davies an experienced wheelwright aged seventyfive confirms the above and adds that red deal perishes in the same manner but in a much slower degree by reason of its resinous quality there have been formerly instances of oaken planks which had laid long under water being found as full of holes as if they had been eaten through by norway rats and were kept as curiosities by the late messrs barker of brynmadin or gadlys  on examination of the animalcula which occasion this damage we found them to be the erucae or caterpillars of a certain insect which deposite its eggs in the moss the hypum riparium flora cot ii   0 we found them in the state of erucae about a third of an inch long and of a whitish color  we found others arrived to the state of pupae or chrysalides of the same length as the caterpillar and of a deep brown color whether these destructive insects are ephemerae or phryganeae of the class of insects which by a wonderful direction of nature deposite their eggs in waters of different depths i cannot ascertain it is certain that these genera before they assume the insect form remain under the water they from the egg become caterpillars these caterpillars rest a certain time in shape of pupae then burst out into flies or insects after that instantly quit the watery element in a still day they may be observed to make their appearance preceded by a bubble the insect immediately follows and either takes to the air or runs along the surface of the water before it rises into its new habitation  church above the well stands the church dedicated to st wenefrede the parish wakes are celebrated in november

ungrateful as disingenuous should i convert your condescension herein to the disadvantage of your society by attempting hereafter to insinuate a right when i ought to commemorate a free obligation which induces me out of some congruity to my apprehension to send my eldest son to deliver this unto your hands and to gain him the honor of being known unto you which my illfortune has denied me

appendix and an acquisition of queen annes bounty of two hundred pounds this in the time of the rev ellis price vicar received the addition of two hundred more which lay at interest till the last year when on the donation of a hundred and fifty pounds from jesus college the whole was laid out in the purchase of a portion of the waste lands in the parish of kilken an act had been passed in the year      for the purpose of enclosing the common dividing it among the freeholders and selling certain portions to defray the expenses of the act etc etc etc one part was bought with the above sums and settled on the minister of holywell and his successors in addition to their income and say the activity of the present vicar the ground has already been enclosed drained ploughed and sown the other

kennets parochial antiquities glossary those of holywell parish amount communibus annis to eighty pounds  the vicarage house about the middle of this century became so ruinous as to be uninhabitable in a few years it was rebuilt by the piety of two brothers thomas and john barker of brynmadyn agents to the great smeltingcompany at gadlys who bequeathed to the vicar of holywell  00 l for the purpose of building a new glebe house at holywell for him and his successors on the same spot as that on which the old one stood it was finished in the year    0 and with the adjacent premises has been considerably improved by the present vicar the reverend john lloyd and made a most comfortable residence  not far distant at the very foot of the hill above the well church stands the parish church placed in that inconvenient situation out of respect to the guardian saint it has only one bell and that not to be heard at any distance so that the congregation is assembled by a walking steeple a man with a small bell who sounds the notice through every street  the present church was rebuilt in      on the site of the old and of the same length and breadth viz the length sixtyeight feet the breadth fiftysix it is difficult to ascertain the ancient architecture of this church near the entrance at the west end is a doorway with an obtuse gothic arch the pillars plain themselves and with plain capitals which support the gallery on each side of the nave are original and by the specimens given by dr ducarel in his norman antiquities tab xiii appear to have been in use among the saxons and the normans the arches which might have confirmed my suspicion that the church was built in the norman reign are taken away but the style continued till about the year   00 the church has a nave and two ailes over which are two handsome galleries and the whole is supposed to contain three thousand people it is plain neat and calculated for use  should it be ever thought necessary to commemorate the repair of the church by an inscription i would venture to recommend the energetic lines inscribed on a similar occasion on a church at bristol adapting the date and third line to the circumstances of that of holywell  haec compta dei domus modo collapsura jam quatur novis columnis suffulta et decorata stabilimen et ornamentum recepit a d      firmius stabiliatur precibus

of thomas ap david abbot of basingwerk whom i find in the bagillt pedigree to have been vicar of holywell  the steeple is plain and square very strongly built but without any mark to denote the time of its being built  the churchyard is the worst in the whole diocese churchyard a small part is a gentle slope but the greater almost precipitous so that after any continuance of wet weather a fall may happen productive of the most indecent and horrible spectacles  the number of inhabitants in this parish may be from   to  000 there are about  000 houses in the whole parish number of people of which upwards of  00 are in the town greenfield contains about   houses this is the township which has received the greatest increase by reason of the sudden and vast accession of inhabitants by reason of the manufactures which settled here nearly at the same time in these evil days about twenty of the houses are empty  increase the increase of inhabitants may be collected from the following abstract from the holywell registers let it be observed that the number allowed to each house is greater than common from the consideration that in manufacturing places the number of poor employed in them are crowded into far less space than in any other towns  year    0       0    0    0         0      baptisms                             burials           0                  in bishop tanners ms

fifteen hundred pounds  in this parish are three clubs or friendly societies clubs or friendly societies instituted on the same plan as those in whiteford parish see p  0  the first or the old club was formed on march  th      so that it is prior to ours by fifteen years it consists at present of     members  club the second consists of   0 members and was formed january   th       club the third is composed of   0 members and commenced on january   st      each of these clubs have their rules but so similar to those of whiteford parish that i shall not repeat them i shall only remark ne quid detrimenti ecclesia capiat that there is an article which excludes every one who is not of the true church of england by law established unless with the approbation of the majority  the union club was established in april      union club it is composed of fortytwo members in general the most respectable inhabitants of the parish untainted with despotic or jacobinical principles every christmas they show exemplary charity to their poor neighbors and under their influence above   0 l was raised the late season of scarcity and distributed among the objects most worthy of relief my son and i are proud of being members of this society as well as all the preceding  old c let me here mention from the principle haec olim menisse avais a society long extinct which consisted of the gentlemen of the neighborhood and the most respectable men of business tradesmen or mine adventurers who met during summer once a week to dine at the house of bryn celyn and after dinner descended to the bowlinggreen just beneath to amuse themselves with the innocent recreation adjoining in a room of retreat in the intervals of play the persons out took their pipe and ale or perhaps a small bowl of punch for in those plain days wine was seldom called for unless by the few with whom other liquors might disagree in these days alas our native liquor is banished from most tables ah redeant saturnia regna    in the town are three places of worship besides the church two for the roman catholics and one for dissenters the last was built on my ground by lease dated april         and is maintained by voluntary contributions of the former one supports a secular or parish priest the other a gentleman of the late order of jesuits both of their cures are endowed with lands vested in trustees each of their houses had been a species of hotel probably designed for the reception of pilgrims of better rank one was called the crosskeys the other the star i remember at one or other of them edward duke of norfolk and other visitants of distinction  bryn y castle above the church is a hill called bryn y castle narrow and very steep on the sides projecting at the end over the little valley on this might have stood the castle of treffynnon or st wenefrede built by randle iii earl of chester in the year    0 powel      there are not at present any vestiges left  it is singular that no mention is made in the doomsdaybook of either chapel church or well yet townships now of less note are named such as brunford caldecote and others notwithstanding bishop fleetwoods opinion i think the legend of st wenefrede was known previous to that survey for the very name of holywell is saxon probably bestowed on it before the conquest on account of the imputed sanctity of the well  the spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms and by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information is found to fling out about twentyone tons of water in a minute it never freezes in respect to the equality of the water in droughts or after the greatest rains i find i must place it among the vulgar errors from the authority of mr christopher smalley and other respectable manufacturers on the stream i discover that the variation is extremely great and that there is a decrease in summer of more than onethird and in great droughts of still more and after violent rains the increase is in like proportion some even say it is onehalf as long as i remember the fountain after heavy falls of wet became of a wheyey color this is increased to a great degree grows more turbid and even deposits a mud upon the stones  the town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century the houses few and those for the most part that the streets unpaved and the place destitute of a market the flourishing mines that for some time were discovered  made a great change in the appearance and introduced the effects of wealth the effects of the manufacto make less appearance in the town than in the valley beneath  from the well to the seaside is a continued succession of s   the monks of basingwerk obtained for it the grant of a  a market the first has been dropped beyond the memory of  the market was also lost till it was renewed by letter ent dated jan  0th   0  granted to sir john eger  et the patent also contains a grant of three fairs viz on the   d of april the tuesday in easter week and the  d of er the market has been the most flourishing in north wales but the fairs never could be established  the market is the best in the county for butchers meat that for corn is now much reduced by reason of the greater farmers or the badgers or purchasers for exportation lessening the great stock which used to supply the markets at reasonable rates every great farmer seems now to have taken the early part of his education in changealley and is as expert in prices of corn as any academy of that noted place is in those of stocks

assistance and comfortable accommodations may be found here and the mind entertained and the body exercised in a variety of beautiful rides and walks  roads there are seven roads out of holywell leading to different places the first or that from the lower part of the town to the seaside to the sea i have already mentioned  to rudland and st asaph the second passes through whiteford street and is that to rudland st asaph conwy and holyhead and also is the coachroad to denhigh its extent in this parish is only one mile ending at the late mr henry steeples wall where the parish of whiteford begins above the west end stands the grange which was called feilebrock and also fulibrock the grange still remains a farmhouse in a most ruinous condition it is the property of sir pyers mostyn but formerly belonged to the abbey of basingwerk having been granted to them by meredeth wawor of which dugdale i     gives the following account in the charter of david ap llewelyn prince of north wales terram etiam quam meredit wawor in villa de haliwell et extra villam habuit et terram quam huttredus frater ejus secum excambiavit in ipsa villa pro sua part terrae in quitfordia et grangiam illorum quae appellatur feilebroc cum omnibus pertinentiis et asiamentis suis et communitatem pasturae montium cum caeteris  the holywell level was begun in       under leases granted by sir pyers mostyn baronet myself peter parry esquire edward jones esquire and mrs mary williams of trelunniau i and my two sons made the voyage of this important venture on september   st      and took boat or rather punt at the entrance into the work in coed cae dentir a field belonging to sir pyers on the north side of a small dingle opening into the road opposite to the great cotton factory under the pilotage of the honest thomas edwards agent to the mine we entered the mouth lighted by candles stuck on each side of our vessel the first forty yards of our way was arched with stone and so low as to oblige us to stoop when the arch ceased the roof was the natural rock of that species called shale  the height begins now to be six feet the breadth four the depth of the water included in the height is two and a half after passing in the shaley stratum about two hundred and twentysix yards we find it is succeeded by that of chrt c at which spot the level enters my ground in the field called coed cae porfa there the height to the surface is eighteen yards several shafts have been sunk for air between this place and the mouth of the level in a field of mine called cdlas r was early discovered at the depth of thirtyone yards a strong string of ore which raised the hopes of the adventurers to the highest degree and the mineral stock rose in proportion but alas in a little time both spirits and stock fell for the promising prospect suddenly vanished an accident too frequent with miners to occasion surprise the chert continues to a little beyond the turnpikeroad when we again enter the land of sir pyers mostyn in a field called brocknallt where it stops hitherto the level has preserved a strait course lime stone but in this field where the limestone stratum begins and is continued to the end of the present working above five hundred yards it takes a bend parallel to the road and so continues as far as brocknalltpella and then makes another curvature and near a small but pretty cave crosses obliquely the turnpikeroad a cave the cave is furnished with a table and benches at which the visitants never fail experiencing the hospitality of their worthy conductor out of this cave is a passage or sump or short shaft sunk for the purpose both of searching for ore and also for conveying of air which began to be wanted into the level this sump communicates with several others till it reaches a shaft the action of the air is various sometimes it descends through the shaft vetilator at other times rushes up the mouth of the level but in each case passes into the mouth of a square wooden conductor which enters the lower part of the sump and is continued on one side of the level almost to the end of the present working  in proceeding farther we were alarmed with the awful sound of a cataract on arriving at the spot from whence it issued the noise seemed to have derived its greatest force from the confined arch of the level cascade for we discovered it to proceed from a small but elegant cascade which in our sight tumbled down a small hollow and served to augment the water of the level which was also increased by several strong springs rising from the sides and bottom with strong ebullitions other subterraneous waters similar noises are said to have been heard in coetiaur odyn it is possible that this subterraneous water may be one of the feeds of st wenefredes well as the field is nearly in a descending line with it i have also heard on good authority of another large stream of water running through a great subterraneous cavern in working portaway mine in pantasa in the parish of whiteford but its discharge has never been yet discovered  but to return after passing this fall we reached the end of our voyage at the length of      yards from the mouth and at the place where two miners were pursuing the working of the level and had got within ten yards of the shaft in which the miners are working in the rich vein beneath the field called coed cae plwm or the wood or field of lead the height from the sole of the level to the surface at this place is ninetythree yards and a half the depth of the shaft which is now so flattering to our hopes is fifty yards so that there are fortythree yards and a half from its sole to that of the level which all the way is found to be filled with ore  but we have more than one string to our bow other  coetiaur odyn vein runs entirely from coeiaumaur fields through my ground as does maes whiteford giving mr jones of wepre a small chance in our mineral lottery then comes true blue which is shared between sir yers mostyn and myself and the once rich vein of brocknallt is entirely his all these run north and south and have in general been very productive but especially those belonging to the house of treare  continuance of let me observe that in the depth of the level we saw the descending course of all these veins excepting coe dyn some of them which were tried at that depth proved bar how far lower the veins descended may probably ever remai cret unless some bold adventures should have the spirit to attempt a level from the marsh which we at p     proved to have from the we a fail of    feet  fertile trac the whole tract below the east side of this road is a most fertile and well cultivated bottom sloping on each side its rural economy may vie in excellene with the most boasted of our island the prospect is charming of the whole length of the chester channel bounded on the opposite by wiral and a distant view of part of lancashire  from the other side of the road the ground rises steeply on the summit is a tract of enclosed land backed by the mountain or common  penybal road i return into the town and at the end of whitefordstreet ascend the steep road called penybal of very laborious ascent i remember it the only coach approach on this side the present fine road then with great propriety called holloway was too narrow for any carriage beyond the then wretched carts of the country i well remember that whenever our family wanted to visit holywell it was obliged to be dragged up to penyforddwaen to cross the mountain and with locked wheel and with great peril go down the almost precipitous way  from the summit of pen ybal to the west calcold is a narrow tract of common a little beyond in a small wood stands calcot or calcoed in the township of the same name in the doomsdy book it is called caldecote and is there united with meretone and rtia part de wdford the founder of this house was henry moston doctor of civil law second son of pyers moston of trelacre he purchased calcot as it was then spelt of george and thomas manley of chester in the year      for the sum of     l after four generations the succession ended in the male line in samuel mostyn esquire who died may   th    0 aged    and was buried at northop on the   th who settled his estate on his nephew mr john ellis who assumed the surname of mostyn  on the mountain to the east of the common way to calcoed naidymarch are two stones about three feet high and about twentytwo feet distant from each other they are called naidymarch or the horses leap from a vulgar notion of the derivation of the name they are of the very ancient british origin and probably the place of interment of some hero whose body was deposited between stone and stone the distance might be intended to give an idea of his mighty size as alexander is supposed on his return out of india to have buried various suits of armor of gigantic dimensions to impose on future times an exalted notion of the troops he had led to this distant country  i descend again into holywell halkin and brynford roads and at the south end of the high street turn to the right up the road which leads to halkin and brynford the latter branches from that to halkin on the right above the road is the old house of brynford ford house at present the property of richard garnons esquire it had been that of the edwardss their descent is given at p     i remember it inhabited by thomas edwards esquire a most respectable old gentleman blind with age of great charity and benevolence and who most grateful to providence increased his charities in proportion to the increase of his abilities in obedience to the direction of heaven to observe its frequent injunctions to the performance of that virtue  penybryn mine opposite to the house on the other side of the road was formerly a profitable leadmine called pen y bryn belonging to lord kilmorey refracting spar it was remarkable for the quantity of refracting spar spatum islandicum of great purity and trasparency and often elegantly infected with marcasite finely disposed in lines  this road ends on the mountain on the borders of skyviog parish the boundary of holywell parish on this side  pistill i return to the turnpike road and continuing my way pass on the right by pistill a neat small house the property of peter parry esquire of twissog in the county of denbigh  in order to proceed toward the rich mineral country i am entering on i shall continue the enumeration of veins from cetiaur odyn see p      mei and other mines the next to that eastward is caleb bell a north and south vein which is traced from the east side of penybal descends from the mountain toward the late john denmans but as yet has not been traced to the road this has in old times been very rich in several places  the old vein or pant ithel is another rich vein which first appeared in pantasa and yielded great quantities of ore and calamine from thence crosses butlers fields and penybal and then to coetia fawr from thence to pant ithel where it descends near ynford house and crosses the road into highgate tenement the property of mr williams of trelunnian it then enters into my tenement called meilwr and was the first place in which ore was found in the level the lease of which was granted by my father on december the  0th       the next is the highgate vein which about pistill had branched into many strings as they advance from pistill eastward they enter highgate tenement and become very productive both in mrs williamss land and also my own which for many years poured on me in great abundance its mineral wealth i never considered this species of riches but of the most precarious nature liable instantly to fail i therefore secured them on the best of tenures and purchased with them the moiety of the bagillthall estate which has turned out to me uncommonly fortunate i also was enabled by another part to improve my house at downing to what it now is  every thing has its end the vein or veins at length grew poorer a great fireengine was erected a few years ago in hopes of clearing the water and getting at the ore which was supposed to have been left in the soles  the level begins at the bottom of the north side of nanthillbrwc and runs southwest how uncertain is mineral knowledge even among the most knowing the object of the lessees was the working up to a certain rich vein named the hard shaft in the lands belonging to brynfordd an object that never yet has been obtained but in pursuit of that object they most unexpectedly met with the veins which produced so much wealth to mr williams and myself perhaps i fall short in my estimate if i say that to lessors and lessees the total amount must have exceeded a hundred thousand pounds  the next vein to the highgate is a string within five yards of the high gate which his been very productive into the field called coetia yscubor the hard shaft vein is expected to enter and cross the whole breadth into the ground of pen y pylle and at the very corner of the same field another vein crosses into the same land and has been tolerably rich  i now quit my mineral territories in this part of the country and cross over the road to pen y pylle the seat of hugh humphreys esquire descended from edwyn prince of tegengl that gentleman has had large share of the mineral wealth the vein rest y cegin passes under his very house and garden the minehillocks fill the land but by his judicious walks and plantations which now cover them he has turned them into beauties the vein continues to his grounds below his house and may probably be a source of new wealth  the lucky venture is the last vein i can mention in this parish which ranges from the mountain and crosses the road into a corner of a field of mr humphreys and immediately from thence into the land belonging to edward jones esquire of wepre in which abundance of ore has been got much has also been got in the very road in a pit sunk by earl grosvenor a privilege clamed by his lordship in virtue of his great mineral grant  this township ends at about a mile distance from pen y pylle where it is separated by rhd  a little ll from the parish of halkin  i return again into the town gadlys road and after crossing the east end of the high street take the road leading toward gadlys on the right i see a trifling monument of my respect to a town which has for a long series of years shown every mark of esteem for the landlord of many and the friend of all in an adjacent field of mine called roft tb was a valuable spring which running to waste occasioned a great loss of time to rich and poor in procuring water i by the assistance of mr denbavand caused in the year      a pillar to be erected into which the water was collected and raised to a height convenient to be received into vessels placed there to supply with ease and expedition the wants of the inhabitants  at the bottom of the descent from holywell is a beautiful dingle named nanthilbrwe which winds on the right to meilwr tenement and on the left quite to the marsh the greater part of the way ornamented with hanging woods on crossing a bridge near a large mill the property of paul panton esquire bagillt township enter the township of bagillt and in less than half a mile pass by the house of that worthy friend of mine our intimacy began in early youth house the pan and has been ever since retained with joy i see his eldest son rising with progressive goodness and rare abilities i see with pleasure my eldest son with true judgment cultivating with him a friendship may it continue through a long life of human felicity pleasant to themselves and useful to their neighbors and country  to mr panton senior i hold myself greatly obliged for the account of his family maternal and paternal  the griffith o bagillt the house and estate of bagillt was conveyed into mr pantons family by the marriage of his father with mary daughter of edward griffiths esquire descended from the griffiths of caerwishall who derived themselves from ednowen bendew one of the fifteen tribes of north wales his ancestors had long been settled at this place and have as ancient deeds to show for their lands as any in wales as will appear by the following will  cuiou will in the name of god amen  the   th day of november in the year of our

in this will by the name of gwern onnen still retains the name and runs from roft tob toward the woods that lead to meilwr  the license for mr pantons greatgrandfathers marriage by his mothers side in cromwells time is a curiosity worthy of the readers perusal i think that the same form is introduced into france since the abolition of religion in that kingdom it probably was taken from the model left by our fanatical rulers in the last century i have another of a similar marriage in our family attested by  evans a justice in northop parish  know all men that upon the eleventh day of february cu  in the year of our lord god one thousand six hundred and fiftyfive richard griffith son and heir appnt of john cff late of bagilt in the county of lint esqr deceased and martha pennant the daughter of edward pennant esqr of bagillt aforesaid came before me ralf hughes esq one of the justices of the peace of the county of int and desired to be joined together in matrimony and being sufficiently satisfied that the said intended marriage was published on three several lords days at the time of morning exercise within the parish church of holywell within which parish the said parties reside and that noe  son gaynesayed or  tended any cause why the said parties might not be joined together in matrimony both of them being of full age and discretion and the parents of both parties consenting thereunto  and after both parties had pronounced before me in the presence of diverse credible witnesses the words of solemnization mentioned in an act of parliament entitled an act touching marriages and dated the xx day of august     i did pronounce and declare the said richard griffith and martha pennant to be lawful husband and wife in witness whereof i have hereunto put my hand and sale the day and year first above written       ra hughes l s witnesses hereunto thomas griffith roger jones john mostyn    the ancient smeltinghouse of gadlys stood a full mile distant from this house about a mile distant from the shore and on the land of robert hughes esquire of halkin the lease expired in      and the works were pulled entirely down after standing the term of the agreement which was fortyfour years  the respectable company long known by the name of the governor and company for smelting down lead with pit coal and sea coal by the royal charter granted in the  th of william and mary began business in this county about the year   00 they flourished with a most fair reputation for a great number of years till their decline either through want of ore or other inevitable causes induced them to remove their ancient furnaces to some works built by the late messrs smedley on the bank above bagillt those they purchased and continued smelting under the direction of their agent mr william smith to whom i am much indebted for information respecting the gadly company  till they sold them to messrs griffith and astet of london this company was often called the quakers company from the number of persons of that mild persuasion being of it  during the prosperity of the works which was very long they produced vast quantities of lead and bullion of the latter they extracted from the lead between the year   0  and      not less than   0 0  ounces queen anne and her successor commanded that all specie coined from the silver should be struck on the reverse with the plume of feathers as a mark of its having been the production of the principality leake on coin      james i gave the same directions respecting the coin made from the silver of the mines worked by sir hugh middleton in cardiganshire and in      charles i caused the same marks of welsh silver to be placed on the coins of the mint at aberystwith obtained from the mines of the same county leake on coins  0   other coins from the companys works were called quakers money from the cause above assigned in an ancient map of denbighshire and flintshire by w williams published in    0 is an engraving of a crown with the feathers the insignia of wales and also another of the seal of the corporation with its crest and arms the supporters are two miners and the motto the apt one spectatur in igne and above them is a view of the works faithfully given as they appeared before they were reduced to a single chimney  the company were for a long series of years the greatest mineadventurers in north wales and had very considerable mines in every part of flintshire the company disposed of their remaining property in the county and totally withdrew from it at michaelma      but still they carry on very extensive mines and smeltingworks in cumberland and northumberland under the commissioners of greenwich hospital on the forfeited estates of the earl of derwentwater  gadlys takes its name from the welsh cad an army and llys signifying the royal head quarter or palace near the works stood a large mount on which might have been a castelet the residence of some of our princes  between this place and pentre bagillt is another eminence of ancient celebrity bryn dychwelwch so named from bryn a hill and dychwelwch return being traditionally said to have been the place from which henry ii gave his order for retreat when he was engaged with the welsh in      with his whole army in coleshill in the same difficulties as he had just before experienced in the depth of coed eulo battle of coleshill in this action his forces were again defeated and eustace fitz john a baron first in rank wealth and abilities among the english and robert de courci another great baron with numbers of others were slain henry de essex hereditary standard bearer and a man of approved valor was seized with a panic and flinging down the standard cried out that the king was killed the route would have been general if the king had not valiantly rallied his forces and repulsed the welsh but in the end he thought it prudent to withdraw his army and encamp in a secure station he afterward attempted by decamping from the shore and endeavoring to get into the interior part of the country to cut off owens retreat into the mountains see powel p  0   but the wise prince penetrating into his views retired to a plain near st asaph still called cil owen or owens retreat and from thence to a strong post named brynypin defended by great ramparts and ditches this camp lies

have this subject in consideration much care and attention must be paid to it the poor may by various means be tempted to sell their new acquisitions there will always be harpies at hand to take advantage of distress by which means every ease to the parishes will be defeated those little possessions should if possible be entailed on the parish or allotted as alleviations of parochial taxes those growing evils in a manner the wisdom of the legislature may contrive  if the poor man is to lose his benefit of feeding a few geese or a few sheep ought he not to have recompense by the greniers dabondance granaries of plenty so useful to france before the miseries in which rich and poor have been involved by the chimeas of bramsick politicians if our wastes are to be generally enclosed ought not the produce to be safely lodged in proper houses of reception and from the boasted plenty which is to ensue be ready by the resource at hand to chase away the demon rapacity which has had too great a power over the dealers in the subsistence of the land all that human wit could invent should be practiced to prevent their eluding the attempt to reduce grain to a price which might afford an honest profit to the farmer and yet enable him to supply the poor laborer at a rate which might give him power not only to feed his family but to cloth them with decent raiment an article coessential to their comfort and to their health  as a house of industry is now in contemplation by the parish of holywell is there not a possibility of allotting certain portions of the waste lands for sale to raise a fund to carry on the work or to give in mortgage to such persons who may be willing to advance money for so salutary a purpose  the town of shrewsbury and i may say of every manufacturing county have succeeded to admiration in their attempts and should be examples to us this neighborhood is now filled with men of business capable of the conduct of such works besides the cotton and twist company have it in their power to expend annually above l   00 in the town in picking the cotton but from the dislike of the poor to that employ are obliged to send the materials to distant places see p     whereby the town and neighborhood lose the expenditure of that great sum among them we squires are less qualified for operations which require vigor and activity but we can contribute countenance and power equally essential to the support of the design i know the poor will be averse to it at first but when they recollect how long they had starved under the careless care of overseers and that they will be placed under the immediate attention of visitors consisting of their neighbors and that they will not be removed beyond the reach of their friends and relations whom they may see at proper times i trust they will be satisfied to banish the poor from the possibility of the occasional comfort of their dearest relatives would be unspeakable cruelty i therefore must ever condemn a county house of industry in which that essential consolation is made difficult or impossible to the inmates from distant parts  vitriolworks on gaining the summit of this road appears a vitriolwork the property of mr donbavand placed under the care of mr john jones of holywell an able chemist his operations are directed to three articles blue vitriol or vitriol of copper which is made by dissolving copper in oil of vitriol or acid of sulphur after the solution has taken place the produce is dissolved in boiling water evaporated down to a given weight and put in coolers to evaporate  the use of this species of vitriol is in dying cottons of a green or olive color and hats and woollen cloths black and also for making green verditer for painting in oil or watercolors verditer by precipitation with whiting  sugar of lead the last article is sugar of lead or saccharum saturni which is lead dissolved in distilled vinegar when the vinegar is saturated with the lead it is boiled down to a given weight and like the blue vitriol is put in coolers to crystallize for the purpose of making the wort for the vinegar twelve hundred hobbets of barley or malt had been employed in a single year but in the late season of scarcity the proprietor totally desisted from this branch of business  sugar of lead is used in the cotton printing business for fixing the colors in the stuff dyed or printed such i believe to be the sole application of it from these works but from others nearer to the capital i fear a most criminal one is frequently in practice for it is a most dangerous poison i mean that of using it in the refining of white wines or in restoring the sweetness to such which are grown sour for this drug is the sweetest of all sweet things it occasions to the drinkers of wines thus restored or rather thus endowed with the powers of poison numbers of maladies they cannot account for such as colics obstinate costiveness and paralytic affections of the limbs finally we may add death itself the fatal dinner at salt hill on march   th      which ended in the destruction of several gentlemen supposed to have been caused by wine impregnated with this fatal drug has been much talked of i believe that not to have been the case the gentlemen did not sicken till after several days one mr pote who had drank as the rest did never was infected it happened that he walked in the garden during the time a most miserable object a pauper had been examined from whom the pestilential miasmata of a fever probably of the nature of the jailfever had diffused themselves among the company present for all except mr pote sickened gent mag      p  0   in this instance the vintners may be cleared but since it is probable that numbers of people fall victims to their art i wish legislature would frame a law to condemn them not to the halter but to the more apt punishment of swallowing a competent draught of their own stygian liquor nec lex est justior ulla  bishop watson iii     says that in germany such adulteration is punished with death in henry viiis time a cook was boiled to death i hope in his own kettle for poisoning a number of poor at lambeth with the broth allotted by a pious prelate for their support  i must not forget that in october last mr hugh roberts ribbon weavers of little moorfields established on my ground opposite to the vitriolworks a colony of ribbonweavers sixteen looms are already employed and others continually expected   the  from the summit to the shore is a most steep descent about a quarter of a mile lower on the right stands the house of bagillthall erroneously so named it not being possessed of any mnerial rights nor does it stand even in the township of bagillt the whole road from the town of holywell being in the township of that name divided from the former by the bottom of the dingle which we crossed by mr pantons mill  the house was large had a great and handsome hall and a good parlor the last wainscotted with good oak much carved about the chimney the rest of the house consisted of a number of rooms irregularly disposed near it stood as usual with our old seats a summer house  this place is beautifully situated the grounds slope toward the sea and command a fine view of the chester channel and as far as beeston castle and its adjacent hills  a few years ago i was obliged to pull down great part of the building it was very old and going fast to ruin and the repairs would have been uselessly expensive for the thick smoke of a great smeltingmill for lead and of a great calcininghouse for calamine just beneath must have ever deterred my descendants from making it their residence  founder of the family the founder of the family was thomas abbot of basingwerk and second son to david ap tudor of bychton by anne daughter of john done of utkinton in the county of chester our abbot was living in the year    0 in the reign of edward iv and in those of edward v and richard iii the reader will excuse i hope the repetition of the few words in which i mentioned  hall that celebrated churchman who quitting his profession became what the lawyers call a monk deraigne and married angharad daughter of guillim ap gryffydd ap guillim of the great house of penrhyn in the county of caernarvon by this lady he had four sons edward the eldest succeeded to his fortunes in the parish of holywell thomas the second became vicar of holywell and nicholas the third succeeded to the abbotship of basingwerk fourth in descent from him was john who acquired the estate of merton in the parish of whiteford by his marriage with mary daughter and heir of thomas ap thomas ap edward of that house finally by the marriage of his only daughter catharine with david pennant of bychton we not only acquired the merton estate but all the possessions in holywell belonging to abbot nicholas  let me not forget that nicholas had also two sisters one named agnes wife of john griffith ap twna the other margaret wife of gruff lloyd ap john of griffith ap david  the house of bagillt was probably built by henry second in descent from the abbot for he is styled in the pedigree of holywell and bagillt whereas his father edward is designed of holywell only  from david fifth brother of henry pennants of hndrefigillt sprang the family of the pennants of hendre figillt in the parish of kilken he married deili daughter and heir of john ap deio ap jevan of halghton in kilken churchyard are several inscriptions of this branch of the family the oldest informs us that angharad pennant was buried on september   th      the last who is mentioned in the pedigree of the house is peter who married barbara daughter of john eyton of leefwood and was cotemporary with david pennant of bychton who was living in       c penygarth there were other branches of the house of hendrefigillt one settled at penygarth in the parish of mold but is now extinct part of the lands are now in possession of mr thomas williams of dolevechles a respectable freeholder in the parish of kilken in right of his greatgrandmother mary pennant a daughter of penygarth she was buried at kilken september  st      as to the house and estate of hendrefiglt it has long since passed into the family of kilken and is at present possessed by mostyn edwards esquire  lord penrhyn my respected but remote kinsman richard pennant baron penrhyn sprung from this branch of our family he is ninth in descent from the abbot and third from gifford pennant second son of edward pennant of bagillt by catherine daughter of edward kynaston of otely in the county of salop he went to jamaica in the time of oliver cromwell had a grant of lands there november  th      settled in the parish of clarendon and died in      his lordships property in that island is immense and his addition to it in the county of caernarvon in this his native island is very considerable by his marriage with anne susanna daughter and heiress of the late general warburton of winnington in cheshire with singular fortune by this match his lordship possesses penrhyn the seat and estate belonging to the family of angbarad his distant ancestress from whom lady penrhyn is by her grandmother also descended all these fortunes they enjoy with dignity and with utility to their numerous tenantry i particularly allude to those about penrhyn where he has made his vast slatequarries an object of admiration to travelers profitable to himself and the source of opulence to the surrounding country i had not at the publication of my welsh tour opportunity of informing myself about these important works i therefore give a brief sketch of their history  when his lordship came to possession of his fortunes in part of the island he found great appearance of neglect and poverty among the tenantry the slatequarries one great staple of the country in a very low state and the export of that valuable article did not annually exceed a thousand tons and there were not four carts on his estate and only three in all nantfrankon and the roads scarcely passable for a horse by his judicious management a happy reverse took place the carriages have increased to the present time to rather more than a hundred broadwheel carts and wagons  port penrhyn formerly abercegid is now highly improved by quays for the reception of vessels so that those of two hundred tons burden can lie close to them and take in their cargo vessels of above three hundred tons can enter the port but cannot get close to the quays  before the country experienced his lordships improving talents not above a thousand tons have been exported in the year in      the export amounted to fifteen thousand in      there was every reasonable hope that it would have increased to twenty thousand but the tax on the slates has given it a check though it is expected that the return of peace and a modification of the duty will restore the progress of the trade  the statequarries are a few miles from the port near the entrance into natfrankon from four to five hundred men are employed in them they live in very elegant cottages prettily disposed in groups here is a butcher and a shoemaker but no corrupting alehouse is permitted his lordship has built a market house so that the workmen need not wander for the necessary provisions let me not forget that he erected an elegant pavilion called ogwen bank with a kitchen stables etc which lord and lady penrhyn often visit either to examine into this creation of theirs or to amuse their guests  his lordship was elected member for petersfield in the first parliament of his present majesty and in      vacated his seat to be elected for leverpool he was returned in           and again in      in that arduous situation his lordship discharged his trust with zeal abilities and fidelity  edward pennant the last owner of bagillt and last of the male line lord penrhyn excepted died at marseilles on march  d    and was there interred in      he disposed of to me by sale all the estates in the township of holywell and soon after he retired into france he bequeathed the remainder of his fortunes to his cousin thomas cratchley who dying left them to roger barnston esquire of chester  m hs of  from bagillthall i descended into the township of bagillt through the turnpikegate at wallwen immediately on the left hand in holywell township is a small house and small patrimony the property of the reverend thomas hughes a curate of twelve years standing of good morals decent and modest his family and two other families not remote from him had long possessed respectable freeholds of fifty pounds a year each time and chance happens to all men our humble curate is far distanced by the other two he remains a drudge in his profession honesta pauperie resulting from fraternal affection in exerting every nerve to support two sisters who rest on him for the poor pittance he can afford to give  after passing the turnpikegate i find myself on the continuance of the turnpikeroad from greenfield to flint the distance from the greenfield gate to flint is only four miles let me add that within little more than one mile from the fountain of st wenefrede at holywell to the gate just mentioned britain may be challenged to show on an equal space a similar assemblage of commercial buildings or of capitals employed in erecting and in carrying on their several objects i refer the reader back to p  0  for an account of those upon the holywell stream i resume the chain of commerce from the copperforge the lowest link which reaches to the very road  a little to the right of the turnpikegate the little rill nanthilbrwe divides the small township of whelstone from that of holywell this tract of which i have the tithes is one of the portions of bagillt township which is very large and subdivided into two others bagilltsawr and bagilltfechan  on the side of the rill stand the works called the river bank established on my land by lease dated september         river bank works granted to messrs william roe and edward hawkins these buildings are employed for the double purposes of calcining calamine for the brassworks at cheadle and macclesfield and for the smelting leadore it has the advantage of a small stream which improves the operation of the latter  it turns two wheels one of which is twentyfour feet in diameter and from the size and breadth makes a noble appearance at each end of these wheels is a balancewheel one of them sets the great refining bellows in motion the other that of the slaghearth  here is also a curious contrivance for saving the calx of the leadore which would otherwise have gone away in smoke it besides lessens the bad effects on the grounds above for this purpose two brick flues have been constructed one from each furnace each of them is horizontal and is supported by three arches and over each is a channel to contain a small current of water for the purpose of turning the wheels and also to condense the smoke in its passage these flues converge and meet a little beyond the third arch and terminate in the condensing room to the walls of which the calx adheres this room is opened three times a year the calx is taken out and resmelted with some profit  the two flues in issuing out of the building are united in one and are continued forming a right angle for a very considerable way out of the end rises a vertical flue fortythree feet high out of which the smoke issues the length of the horizontal flues which pass over the arches is fiftyseven feet of the single one which passes from the room which catches the calx is two hundred and ten feet  bagillt upper works about three quarters of a mile farther on the bank above the road stands a large smeltingwork originally built by virtue of a lease granted in      by roger and edward pennant esquires of bagillt to francis stly and nicholas twig it was afterward rebuilt and passed through various hands the smedlies father and sons henry vigars of eaton whose widow sold it to the gadlys company that expiring corporation possessed it only from about michaelms      after descending from their ancient works at gadlys in      it again changed masters and was sold by the company to mr john griffith and mr robert aslett of london  below them on the roadside lower works were works of greater antiquity those were in possession of two lessees before the year      the first was mr thomas white the last was a gentleman well known by the name of major roberts he was of the ancient house of plashewydd near ruthin his lease was surrendered and a new one granted in      by roger pennant esquire to mr benjamin perrin father to our respectable countryman sir richard perrin baron of the exchequer i remember them standing but soon after they became a heap of ruins and at present their place is scarcely known  a mr warren came into this country in      and built de bank on the land of roger barnston esquire a smeltinghouse on a new construction but it was scarcely warmed when it was disposed of to a mr langworthy mineral agent to earl grosvenor  the collieries near these works have been very considerable collieries i remember about forty years ago there was between twenty and thirty thousand tons of coal upon bank the greatest quantity perhaps ever seen together the pits were then worked by the gadlys company the company had imprudently given their agent one lancester an unlimited order for raising the coal this he found so profitable to himself that he never desisted till the discovery was made of his selfish views to expedite the working he engaged numbers of colliers from newcastle and was the first in this country who made use of horses under ground the coal might have lain on the bank to this day if a dispute had not rose between the city of dublin and the coaladventurers at whitehaven this occasioned the citizens of dublin to purchase this great stock which was all carried away before the differences were settled  for a considerable time after this glut of coal the collieries declined greatly and became very low till they were revived of late years by the spirit and perseverance of mr roger ellis of cornish in the parish of flint who has erected a powerful fireengine on the roadside between greenfield turnpikegate and flint and raises great quantities of that important requisite  nantymoch quit the township of bagillt after crossing a little rill issuing out of nantymoch or the dingle of the hogs here we enter the township of coleshillfawr on the right on an eminence are the smeltingworks built by the grandfather of the present sir richard perrin whose father continued the works and lived at farm till he took up his residence at flint about the year      a new company was formed by paul panton esquire under the firm of himself the reverend thomas ince and charles pigot esquire  coleshill the doomsdaybook informs us that at the time of the compilation of that record coleselt was held by robert de roelent or ruddlan a valiant norman nephew to hugh lupus earl of chester edwyn held it of robert and as a freeman there was one taxable hide of land a land of one caruca or a ploughland on clsilt was one radman four villeyns and two boors the radman was the same with the rod or radknights who by the tenure of their land were bound to ride with or for their lord and to guard him  lady as often as they were required  this township took its name from the abundance of coal which is produced at present it gives name to one of the hundreds of the county in the doomsdaybook this township is placed in the hundred of atiscros a name which would have been lost was it not retained in a tract called croesati a certain space round a cross not remote from flint the pedestal of which i remember standing  beneath the smeltingwork is a neat building for the purpose of calcining calamine held by lease granted by mr panton a calciningwork june   th      to mr thomas davies of smethwick staffordshire and the company known by the name of the smethwick brass company  paul panton

london which by a letter of pyers pennants i find he did in person the manor has continued in the family from his time in      the present gentleman improved it greatly by an embankment from the sea

his wife was daughter and heir of bennet fourteenth in descent from marchudd another of the fifteen tribes their history and their several descendants are given in the appendix to this work  all the coast of whiteford and holywell parishes are more particularly subject than the drier parts to pleurisies diseases intermittents and fevers of the putrid kinds the last chiefly in the places where the poorer people are obliged to crowd into small apartments by which the air soon becomes soul and produces this species of fever  a cruel kind of quinzy has of late years infested these parishes and others adjacent in      it raged particularly in the township of greenfield and parish of halkin and made dreadful havoc among children from the age of three to that of five the average loss was four or five in seven in this visitation the disease did not attack adults not that instances are wanting in other places of its attacking grownup persons in september      a mr poole his wife and mother were buried in one vault in bunhillfields his daughter fell a victim also and made the sum of the family who died at the same time and by the same malignant disorder  the name given by the learned to this fatal disease is angina maligna and cynanche maligna cynanche because the patients are often observed to protrude their tongue far out of their mouth like an overheated dog  the symptoms are too terrible for description they may uselessly affect parents who may safely trust to the medical people for the knowledge of them for they are by no means equivocal but if any ones curiosity is excited it may be satisfied by the perusal of the works of the late dr fothergill p     and dr huxhams essays p     it seems to have been one of the nova cohors febrium it was first observed in spain in    0 from whence it spread into malta sicily otrnto apulia calabria and finally in      it broke out at naples it also appeared in the archipelago when tournefort see his travels i p     was in milo in the year   0 in spain it got the name of garrotillo from the horrible noise made by the patients like that of persons strangled by a rope  this fatal disorder reached england in      its first victims were two sons of mr pelham on the   th of november of that year after this it seemed to disappear but began again in      and with great fatality in      when several of the inhabitants of bromy near bow lost most of their children from dr huxham we learn that in      it visited cwall and from the latter part of that year to may      carried off numbers of children and some adults  in the year      it appeared in north wales from march  th to march  0th our late worthy vicar the reverend griffith griffith buried three children it was too much for his paternal feelings and ever after greatly hurt his mind and in the year       that calamity visited the county of caernarvon and from january   th to february  th the late sir thomas mostyn baronet at gloddaeth in caernarvonshire lost four these were observed to have been the only instances of the disease in their respective neighborhoods  i cannot trace the progress of this disease any farther northward than my own country if it has not made any advances toward the colder climates it may be deemed a malady of the warm and temperate parts of europe  that it has found its way to the new world appears from the following instances in      it visited many parts of north america from philadelphia to new york and new england and with a rage unknown in great britain for in new england it depopulated whole villages and that it either continues on the continent or has revisited it is evident from its having appeared in new york in the year       the cynanche trachialis or croup has appeared here too frequently a few years ago it destroyed not fewer than six children in the family of a respectable farmer in a neighboring parish  the smeltingworks at flint are at a very small distance from the eastern boundary of holywell flint smellingworks the division of the parish of flint from that of the latter is by a rill not far from the town of flint the works are of great antiquity they are here mentioned as the last link of the chain of metallic operations along the shore there is no limiting the antiquity of the smeltingworks for we have proofs of very considerable ones having been near the town of flint at a place called croes ati which is evident from the quantity of scoria of lead bits of leadore and fragments of melted lead discovered in several places i refer the reader for a full account of them and of the various antiquities met with on the spot to p    vol i of my welsh tour which evince that they had been roman works so that it is probable there had been a succession of smeltinghearths in one part or other of this county even to the present day  to return to the works in question they are frequently known by the name of the saltworks which possibly implies that the site had been occupied by works of that nature prior to the existence of the smeltingworks they have been occupied by several companies at present by mr richard ingleby of halkin  may success be his reward for the seasonable and useful importation of barley in the late time of scarcity a critical relief to the numerous miners on the adjacent mountains in which he had no more interest than in the rest of the human race

  after paragraph  d  we retain in whiteford church the decent service of praying for the sick instead of lazily sinking it into the xxixth supplicatlon of the litany the prayers on that occasion are so pathetic so admonitory to the congregation that i am amazed that any minister should remain insensible of the impropriety of the omission  i now cannot but most earnestly exhort the squires of every parish to attendance on divine service if it was only to hear the sad catalogue of the miserable objects which compose the largest part of those for whom the devotions i allude to are intended it will direct their benevolence to their relief they may find among them objects of their charity whom they may never otherwise have heard of they may find tenants to whom they ought to be fathers they certainly will find congenerous beings to whom every duty of humanity is enjoined by the savior of the world this i should hope is thus irresistibly enforced  come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  for i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me  then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink  when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee  or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee  and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me  to these benedictory verses let me add one in which the penalty as well as the reward is united i cannot resist the impulse as it is so admirably adapted to the times it shall be followed by an extract from p     of this work which i communicated to the public through the channel of the chester paper followed by some declarations to prevent the mistaking of any part i fervently wish to promote a friendly agreement between landlord and tenant between tenant and every poor laborer the benevolent duke of beaufort and i believe others of the benevolent great have made the attempt and to the glory of landlord and tenant are to this moment dispensing their generous plan to a grateful people such an agreement was entered into by the farmers of part of this and a neighboring county but to their infamy many of them withdrew from their words and their signatures may the landlords become the instruments of compelling them to accept the blessing offered in the last part of the line and to shun the curse denounced in the first there is one description of men on whom it should fall in a most exemplary manner the badger or factor employed to exhaust the stock of corn and other provisions not by fair agreement but by openly raising the price by offering more than the farmer would have asked and even telling them in open market ask what you will and we will give it the poor since the repeal of the  th and  th of edward iv by the   th of george iii are left defenseless the means of inflicting the punishment by the statute is taken away and they are to seek justice through the tedious expensive labyrinths of the common law  he that withholdeth corn the people shall curse him but blessing shall be upon the head of him that sells it proverbs chap xi ver    to the editor of the chester courant sir permit me to convey through the channel of your paper a paragraph from a book which is still in the press  i would never grant a lease to a great corntenant i would preserve a power over his granary which legislature will not or cannot assume should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it in years of scarcity and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain  should he attempt a monopoly  should he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next market  or should he refuse to sell to the poor who cannot attend the market corn in small quantities i would instantly assume the power of the landlord and expel him from my estate a just punishment for the tenant who through rapacity declines to comply with my desires excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public  the end which we wish by the above radically to correct may soon be past cure i therefore commit the extract to your hands the evil is entirely local other parts of great britain are possibly unaffected by it and have no occasion to take alarm we do not wish the farmers solely to feed the poor we only request them to reserve in the country corn enough of every kind to enable others to exert their benevolence to their poorer neighbors not by gratutous donations but by selling it at reasonable prices to those who are in want we do not ask it from the farmers at the prices of good times god forbid that we should deny them fair profits such as every other dealer has a right to i wish to inculcate universal justice but let us remember that charity begins at home we shall gladly impart our superfluity to our most distant neighbors even should we be obliged to pay more for the bare competency we may reserve  t p downing february       contents of the account of holywell parish townships page     stokyn page     river dee company ib lucerne grass
