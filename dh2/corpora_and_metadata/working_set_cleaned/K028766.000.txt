the late trial and conviction of count tariff  london printed for a baldwin near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxiii price three pence  the late trial and conviction of count tariff the whole nation is at present very inquisitive after the proceedings in the cause of goodman fact plaintiff and count tariff defendant as it was tried on the   th of june in the thirteenth year of her majestys reign and in the year of the lord      i shall therefore give my countrymen a short and faithful account of that whole matter and in order to it must in the first place premise some particulars relating to the person and character of the said plaintiff goodman fact  goodman fact is allowed by every body to be a plainspoken person and a man of very few words tropes and figures are his aversion he affirms every thing roundly without any art rhetoric or circumlocution he is a declared enemy to all kinds of ceremony and complaisance he flatters no body yet so great is his natural eloquence that he cuts down the finest orator and destroys the bestcontrived argument as soon as ever he gets himself to be heard he never applies to the passions or prejudices of his audience when they listen with attention and honest minds he never fails of carrying his point he appeared in a suit of english broadcloath very plain but rich every thing he wore was substantial honest homespun ware his cane indeed came from the east indies and two or three little superfluities from turkey and other parts it is said that he encouraged himself with a bottle of neat port before he appeared at the trial he was huzzad into the court by several thousands of weavers clothiers fullers dyers packers calenders setters silkmen spinners dressers whitsters winders mercers throwsters sugarbakers distillers drapers hosiers planters merchants and fishermen who all unanimously declared that they could not live above two months longer if their friend fact did not gain his cause  every body was overjoyed to hear that the good man was come to town he no sooner made his appearance in court but several of his friends fell a weeping at the sight of him for indeed he had not been seen there some years before  the charge he exhibited against count tariff was drawn up in the following articles    that the said count had given in false and fraudulent reports in the name of the plaintiff    that the said count had tampered with the said plaintiff and made use of many indirect methods to bring him over to his party    that the said count had wilfully and knowingly traduced the said plaintiff having misrepresented him in many cunninglydevised speeches as a person in the french interest    that the said count had averred in the presence of above five hundred persons that he had heard the plaintiff speak in derogation of the portuguese spaniards italians hollanders and others who were the persons whom the said plaintiff had always favored in his discourse and whom he should always continue to favor    that the said count had given a very disadvantageous relation of three great farms which had long flourished under the care and superintendency of the plaintiff    that he would have obliged the owners of the said farms to buy up many commodities which grew upon their own lands that he would have taken away the labor from the tenants and put it into the hands of strangers that he would have lessened and destroyed the produce of the said farms  that by these and many other wicked devices he would have starved many honest daylabourers have impoverished the owner and have filled his farms with beggars etc    that the said count had either sunk or mislaid several books papers and receipts by which the plaintiff might sooner have found means to vindicate himself from such calumnies aspersions and misrepresentations  in all these particulars goodman fact was very short but pithy for as i said before he was a plain homespun man his yea was yea and his nay nay he had further so much of the quaker in him that he never swore but his affirmation was as valid as anothers oath  it was observed that count tariff endeavored to browbeat the plaintiff all the while he was speaking but though he was not so impudent as the count he was every whit as sturdy and when it came to the counts turn to speak old fact so stared him in the face after his plain downright way that the count was very often struck dumb and forced to hold his tongue in the middle of his discourse  more witnesses appeared on this occasion to attest goodman facts veracity than ever were seen in a court of justice his cause was pleaded by the ablest men in the kingdom among whom was a gentleman of suffolk who did him signal service  count tariff appeared just the reverse of goodman fact he was dressed in a fine brocade wastcoat curiously embroidered with flowerdeluces he wore also a broadbrimmd hat a shoulderknot and a pair of silverclockd stockins his speeches were accompanied with much gesture and grimace he abounded in empty phrases superficial flourishes violent assertions and feeble proofs to be brief he had all the french assurance cunning and volubility of tongue and would most certainly have carried his cause had he dealt with any one antagonist in the world besides goodman fact  the count being called upon to answer to the charge which had been made against him did it after a manner peculiar to the family of the tariffs viz by railing and calling names  he in the first place accused his adversary of scandalum magnatum and of speaking against his superiors with sauciness and contempt as the plain good man was not of a make to have any friends at court he was a little startled at this accusation till at length he made it appear that it was impossible for any of his family to be either saucy or cringing for that their character was above all others in the world to do what was required of them by the court that is to speak the truth and nothing but the truth  the count in the next place assured the court that his antagonist has taken upon him a wrong name having curtailed it of two or three letters for that in reality his name was not fact but faction the count was so pleased with this conceit that for an hour together he repeated it in every sentence calling his antagonists assertions the reports of faction his friends the sons of faction the testimonies of his witnesses the dictates of faction nay with such a degree of impudence did he push this matter that when he heard the cries of above a million of people begging for their bread he termed the prayers and importunities of such a starving multitude the clamours of faction  as soon as the count was driven out of this device he affirmed roundly in the court that fact was not an englishman by birth but that he was of dutch extraction and born in holland in consequence of this assertion he began to rally the poor plaintiff under the title of mine here van fact which took pretty well with the simpletons of his party but the men of sense did not think the jest worth all their lands and tenements  when the count had finished his speech he desired leave to call in his witnesses which was granted when immediately there came to the bar a man with a hat drawn over his eyes in such a manner that it was impossible to see his face he spoke in the spirit nay in the very language of the count repeated his arguments and confirmed his assertions being asked his name he said the world called him mercator but as for his true name his age his lineage his religion his place of abode they were particulars which for certain reasons he was obliged to conceal the court found him such a false shuffling prevaricating rascal that they set him aside as a person unqualifyd to give his testimony in a court of justice advising him at the same time as he tendered his ears to forbear uttering such notorious falsehoods as he had then published the witness however persisted in his contumacy telling them he was very sorry to find that notwithstanding what he had said they were resolved to be as arrant fools as all their forefathers had been for a hundred years before them  there came up another witness who spoke much to the reputation of count tariff this was a tall black blustering person dressed in a spanish habit with a plume of feathers on his head a golillio about his neck and a long toledo sticking out by his side his garments were so covered with tinsel and spangles that at a distance he seemed to be made up of silver and gold he called himself don assiento and mentioned several nations that had sought his friendship but declared that he had been gained over by the count and that he was come into these parts to enrich every one that heard him the court was at first very well pleased with his figure and the promises he made them but upon examination found him a true spaniard nothing but show and beggary for it was fully proved that notwithstanding the boasts and appearance which he made he was not worth a groat nay that upon casting up his annual expenses with the debts and encumbrances which lay upon his estate he was worse than nothing  there appeared another witness in favor of the count who spoke with so much violence and warmth that the court begun to listen to him very attentively till upon hearing his name they found he was a notorious knight of the post being kept in pay to give his testimony on all occasions where it was wanted this was the examiner a person who had abused almost every man in england that deserved well of his country he called goodman fact a liar a seditious person a traitor and a rebel and indeed so much incensed the honest man that he would certainly have knocked him down if he could have come at him it was allowed by every body that so foulmouthed a witness never appeared in any cause seeing several persons of great eminence who had maintained the cause of goodman fact he called them idiots blockheads villains knaves infidels atheists apostates fiends and devils never did man show so much eloquence in ribaldry the court was at length so justly provoked with this fellows behavior who spared no age nor sex nor profession which had shown any friendship or inclination for the plaintiff that several began to whisper to one another it was high time to bring him to punishment but the witness overhearing the word pillory repeated twice or thrice slunk away privately and hid himself among the people  after a full hearing on both sides count tariff was cast and goodman fact got his cause but the court sitting late did not think it fit at that time to give him costs or indeed to enter into that matter the honest man immediately retired after having assured his friends that at any time when the count should appear on the like occasion he would undertake their defense and come to their assistance if they would be at the pains to find him out  it is incredible how general a joy goodman facts success created in the city of london there was nothing to be seen or heard the next day but shaking of hands congratulations reflections on the danger they had escaped and gratitude to those who had delivered them from it  the night concluded with balls bonfires ringing of bells and the like public demonstrations of joy  finis
