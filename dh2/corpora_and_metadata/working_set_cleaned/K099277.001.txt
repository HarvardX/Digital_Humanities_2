the pupil of pleasure  vol i  the pupil of pleasure or the new system illustrated inscribed to mrs eugenia stanhope editor of lord chesterfields letters by courtney melmoth versatile ingenium vol i  london printed for g robinson and j bew in paternoster row       preface since the first publication of the late earl of chesterfields letters to the present time the arrows of censure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate from every quarter the wit has had his joke the versifier his parody the moralist his opposing sentiment and the divine his grave dissertation very ingenious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his lordship his graces have been smartly ridiculed his etiquette humorously exposed and mr hunter with an elegance and profundity far beyond the rest of his remarkers has penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims traversed him through every double and examined his whole system with an analytical acuteness  it is matter of real amazement that amongst all those who have expressed themselves loudly and diametrically against the doctrine of lord chesterfields correspondence none should have yet thought of the only method that was most likely to manifest their tendency the general stigma upon these letters has been that they are calculated to recommend deceit and to conceal the most destructive hypocrisy under the smiling aspect plausible exterior fairseeming sentiments and a complacent flexibility  in an age of voluptuousness it is most obvious to apprehension that maxims like these would have most weight with the young and dissipated the man of fashion would find them so consistent with his plan of security that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them and the man of expedient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which without either danger of his neck or character might repair his purse promote his pleasures and save him from a thousand shocks that poverty is heir to  the essence of my lord chesterfields system seems to be neither more nor less than this secure yourself from being blasted as he terms it and do whatever you think proper whatever fancy passion whim or wickedness suggest only command your countenance check your temper and throw before your heart and bosom the shield of dissimulation and snatch it  seize it  enjoy it  in regard to women  never surely issued from the press a collection of hints so capable of being turned to their destruction and the sex ought to be more alarmed at this publication which however one of their own sex has ushered into the world than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind or purity of character  how then has it happened that no person has yet put the volumes of the earl of chesterfield into the hand of a hero who with a natural aptitude to enjoy every thing within his observation might increase his felicity very considerably by the assistance of sentiments so admirably suited to multiply mischief and to ensure his victory over that simplicity that beauty and that softness which would thence be so much the more easily thrown off their guard  as nothing of this kind however has appeared i have ventured to present to the public the adventures of a man of birth rank figure and character ardent in the pursuit of pleasures and much delighted with and attracted by the theory of lord chesterfield he purchases the books finds them agreeable to his palate studies them paragraph by paragraph thrives under his application piques himself upon his progress and in the end a master of his science invokes the genius of his noble preceptor puts money in his purse the inestimable volumes in his portmanteau and sallies into the gay world armed at all points the pupil of pleasure  every ingenious precept laid down by the noble lord this highbred young gentleman reduces to practice who taking the summer before him makes his attacks at a place of fashionable resort where fixing with commendable and preinstructed acuteness upon proper objects he begins to exemplify and is as successful as the politest casuist could possibly wish  in the course of this historical illustration  this biographical commentary on the text of chesterfield  ample scope has been allowed for the display of various characters and particularly such as more immediately promoted the main design of the work which is to show the aggravated evils in society arising from the practice of such perniciouslypleasing precepts  to this end i have made great use of the noble lords maxims rules and admonitions upon various subjects the incidents it is conceived arise naturally out of the principles that produce them the contrast in the characters especially of homespun sedley thornton lieutenant vernon and sir henry delmore i have endeavored to render eminent and conspicuous and although some may think the catastrophe and a few of the circumstances carried too far into the pathetic yet i am persuaded those who weigh deeply the precepts of lord chesterfield will agree with me in thinking that if pushed into practice by an adventurer like that which his lordship would have formed out of mr stanhope similar or even greater sorrows and vices would invade the community in short this history is calculated strongly to prove the truth of lord chesterfields own observation namely that the adoption of vice is likely to ruin ten times more young men than natural inclination  i am apt to think mr stanhopes reputed want of ability made him die an honest though an undistinguished man perhaps if he had had ton enough to follow the advice of his father and entered into all the elevated connexions recommended to him he had fallen like the hero of this history equally celebrated dazzling and diabolical  the pupil of pleasure etc letter i sedley to thornton buxton the whirl of wheels a fine flow of spirits the elysium of expectation and the vigor of fresh horses at every stage brought me in less than twenty hours from cavendishsquare to the place of date having no unnecessary luggage to retard me no trifling petit maitre who at two miles distance from the shiftingplace drives back for his gloves his cane his snuff box or his white handkerchief i rolled thornton on the springs of expedition and i sit down unsubdued by fatigue to tell thee of my safety  richardsons a child his grandison is a monster his lovelace a bungler  since the days of adam nature has produced but one man of pleasure and that wonder was reserved to adorn the age before us  oh chesterfield chesterfield thou only thou knew the science of joy thou only had the skill to cover the ruggednesses of life with roses that bloom from being pressed deign then immortal shade to look with a gentle eye upon thy pupil teach me to emulate thy genius to practice thy precepts to hit with a felicity like thine the true spirit of dissimulation  soften my features to the blandishments of delight  attune my tongue to the thrillings of persuasion  enrich my sentiments with so versatile a ductility that i may obey the occasions of the minute  endue me with perseverance of soul and condescend to guide me with all thy attendant graces assiduities and elegant attentions into the bosom of voluptuousness my friend my mentor my genius and my god  thornton i am inspired the rhapsody of my invocation is throbbing already at my heart  it is working its way to the very marrow in the bones the divine letters of our earl are this instant brought in by the postilion who is unconscious of the treasure with which he is freighted and i dare not proceed till i have unlocked my hoard and with a more than persian prostration paid to the maxims by which i am to be conducted the incense of my idolatry  adieu adieu philip sedley  letter ii mr thornton to mr sedley take care it is easier to advise than to act i wish you joy of your system which i approve let it not however appear to be imitation and the deities of bliss throw objects in your way  farewell james thornton p s be explicit in your letters    letter iii sedley to thornton dull thornton  circumspect citizen at what art thou alarmed and why is thy spirit troubled within thee how can thou entertain so contemptible a notion of thy sedley imitation curse thee for the thought have thou in the course of seven enterprizing years ever known me stoop from the originality of self to the slavery of another it is true i admire the lord of chesterfield his epistles are in the reading hour always in my hand at night they repose behind my pillow and they at present constitute all my traveling library but i scorn to be fettered either in body or soul the liberty of the understanding is as dear to me as the liberty of the person and i have too much pride too much dignity to become a plagiary no thornton the earl is as it were my tutor his sentiments are such as i have long felt but such as till now i was cautious of avowing hitherto i have been restrained in my actions and lost half the joy of voluptuousness because forsooth nobody had either reputation or ingenuity enough to keep me in countenance i swam the stream of pleasure but was always afraid of going out of my depth for the herd of men are contented to be libertines in the ordinary shallow way and before the appearance of these enchanting letters we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity to give credit to the efforts of an enterprizing spirit but now the impediment is removed  the avenue is opened and the prospect of pleasure is palpable the repository of stanhope the cabinet of chesterfield the earls arcanum are all disclosed  eugenia  bear bear the name ye rosywinged deities of joy in gratitude to heaven  eugenia has given to mankind the invaluable remains of her father and in that present  oh thornton echo eugenia  has discovered to every elegant character fresh roads to the temple of felicity and virgin untasted resources of personal extacy  my design then is to indulge my principles by improving upon those maxims which his elegant pen has made fashionable let others content themselves with the vulgar happiness of yielding beauty entrapt simplicity and the mere defloration of female youth  i cannot be circumscribed by such common animal sensations  give me delicacy give me difficulty give me refinement  give me innovation  or take from me existence  to beat the beaten track  to taste the tasted  oh shocking  insupportable i am above it i scorn it  in a word then thornton what our garrick is to shakespeare i am resolved to be to chesterfield  the living comment upon the dead text the youth to whom the earls letters were originally addressed thou know is dead and it should seem that he wanted soul to relish them had he continued amongst us peace to his uncongenial manes i claim the inheritance thornton and desire you will consider me as his son by the adoption of his sentiment nay had these veins been filled with the rich stream that fed the heart of stanhope i could not have been more like himself  god forgive me but were it not said that my mother was the diana of her day i should suspect she played my father the alderman false and that she threw herself into the conquering and accomplished arms of chesterfield  earth and skies mr thornton can thou think i was the product of a plethoric alderman and that alderman a dealer in hops  bastardize me dear friend in pity to my feelings and rather than suppose me the offspring of such a conjunction make me the byblow of some deity in disguise and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy  so much for the introduction to our correspondence of preface no more  prepare for immediate action  a face passes my window that throws attractions worth pursuing i press the wafer with my seal that i may rise to reconnoitre  adieu philip sedley  letter iv from the same to the same the earls absent man has already exhibited himself he is of the name of homespun and is the butt of the bath his soul is contemplative and his body pedantic never saw i so perpendicular or thoughtful a figure a very walking soliloquy and his wife or at least the beautiful she who hangs upon his arm  o thornton thornton  i have an object before me already young elegant graceful and i warmly hope a wife  if she should prove indeed the property of this pedant  if the stars should have thrown a hoop of gold in my way my fortune is made  soft a little  my landlord enters  his eye looks communication  there is intelligence in every feature i am positive he will prove the daily advertiser of the bath  pray mr  i forget your name  mr  wyngood is my name sir  pray mr wyngood what fine young lady is that now walking with the straight wellmade gentleman in ravengrey  she is wife to the gentleman sir and his name is mr horace homespun a minister come to bathe for the dissenters disorder there is a vast deal of company sir in town and i think you are very lucky in taking my lodgings i have got the best lodgings in all buxton and some of the best people in them at this moment why now sir you would not think it but i can show you such things as will surprise you  here he set off and i followed him into a bedchamber where without any ceremony opening the drawers of his lodgers he took out a ridinghat with a blue feather and a spangled button lookee sir did you ever see the like then here is silks upon sattins and sattins upon silks and they are the kindest people in the world they live as cheap as possible why i dont suppose one day with another they spend a guinea they pay only eightpence apiece for breakfast a shilling apiece for dinner eightpence for tea in the afternoon a shilling each for supper and fourteen shillings for lodging besides washing coals candles and wines  a mere nothing as i may say for a wateringplace i presume sir you would choose to join them and live in the same manner i see you are a very worthy gentleman and i will go mention you under the name of  pray what name must i say sir  but no matter i will tell mr homespun that a new lodger wishes to do as he does sir your servant i will be with you again presently  the fellow had it all his own way thornton i interrupted him not and am this very night to sup with master minister homespun i have walked down to the well and drank a glass at this helicon of health i was in this ramble the man of fashion just stepped out of the chaise and elegantly disordered in my dress  my hair was tied with negligence my curls loose and in the ton of confusion and my frock discovered a genteel shape and the cut of a good tailor a miscellaneous group were passing away the intermediate hours betwixt teatime and supper the lame and the lazy the merry and the mortified were all upon the saunter homespun was fondly ruminating with his angelic consort in the shade and something that had the appearance of a fop  i mean of the common kind  was saying smart things to a pretty wellwoman  nothing however could induce me to stay a moment at this dull place but the practice of precepts which will convert all places into a paradise and make even a wateringplace delicious  i am summoned by the supperbell  mrs homespun  oh what a name for such a creature  is tripping it toward the sound and homespun himself seems to forget his primitive uprightness of back and steps briskly forward  farewell philip sedley  letter v from the same to the same chesterfield is right attention annihilates learning and carries away all before it i am in the road to rapture i have time only to give you the hint another opportunity of being assiduous offers itself the moment must not be lost  adieu philip sedley  letter vi from the same to the same i improve every hour  oh why did not the earl sanctify the paths of dissimulation that i might have lived to pleasure many years ago it is now only that i begin to live i have had my dear thornton in the course of a few hours a conquest superior to alexanders i have made an ordinary coxcomb pleased with himself and yet discarded by his mistress i have seen a learned husband detestible in the eyes of his wife for the first time and i find him enraptured with the very man by whom he is made ridiculous and all this from the practice of a single precept  study to please  i will go through every sentiment in the earls correspondence before i quit buxton all the books in all the languages are barren and deserve to be burnt but the epistles of my stanhope but  stop  i heard mrs homespun express her aversion to cheese and though i like it myself i must hasten to order it may never appear again to offend her nothing is immaterial that pleases  adieu philip sedley  letter vii thornton to sedley thou might as well send folded to me a sheet of white paper thou writest much without saying any thing thy heart is engaged in the ardour of some pursuit and thy pen denotes agitation bustle and contrivance but thou speak only generally i prithee sedley reduce thy extravagant genius into order and let me understand by the post the meaning of sentiments i perceive not at present the drift of if anything starts that demands assistance or if thou meetest more adventure than thou can thyself manage tell me so and i will order my horse to the door and go snacks in your enterprises farewell  james thornton  letter viii from the reverend horace homespun to doctor diggory dear sir you remember i presume the jaunt i took in the last year to southampton the particulars of which at the request of some friends i suffered to be printed in the westminster magazine in two several letters addressed to the publisher mr thomas wright of essexstreet in the strand london i there told you that i was not quite so highly interested in or entertained by the scenes in a hurry before me as my then patron the baronet would flatter my imagination with upon the road and as i find those letters from the westminster magazine were reprinted into various other monthly publications i have reason to suppose my excursion afforded some amusement to a certain set of readers  but having since then been yoked to a damsel who has a passion for these wateringplaces and who bringing along with her a decent fortune has a right to indulge herself in such amusements as seem best unto her i have a second opportunity to survey the customs and manners of waterdrinkers and duckers and can now give you many curious particulars by way of supplement to the accounts i have already published  as my present cure is situated about thirtyseven post miles and a quarter from the waters of buxton amidst the wonders of the peake mrs homespun chose to pass a week at that place for the benefit of a pain in the ancle which became grievous about six minutes before she suggested to me the necessity of such an excursion  that the cure of her ancle might be perfectly completed i contrived it so as to persuade the curate of a neighboring parish to do duty at home in my absence and resolved to stay a fortnight of this fortnight only four days are yet expired and though i never underwent the same degree of parade of fatigue and of impertinence in any former fourteen years of my life  not even when i preached thrice in the sunday and footed it to two of the cures  yet harriet seems so happy in doing as others do and finds such real felicity in the dullest spot i ever beheld that i am in doubt whether even the long residue of the fortnight will satisfy her so as to return home to peace privacy and the parsonagehouse without murmurings and repinings  oh doctor see the outlines of my situation and pity me i am amongst a number of both sexes whose pleasures are my aversions and whose amusements i cannot relish i love quietness and the shade of life and yet the house where i now lodge is as public as an inn at a fair i admire rural ornaments and scenes of summer verdure beyond imagination and yet the mountains of arabia deserta exhibit not a prospect so barren as that by which buxton is bounded i love to stroll into the shop of an intelligent bookseller and to converse with him upon the topic of recent publications  alas the bookseller of buxton has nothing in his shop but the trash that circulates at a wateringplace amongst the women i ran my eye over his catalogue and never did i see such a collection clelia pamela the adventures of cleopatra amusements at the german spa and the history of an actress were the best in this bad bundle  i mentioned the reviews  no body called for them i talked of the magazines  none were ordered i rummaged every row for philosophy  nobody reads philosophy at a wateringplace i criticized the shelves for morals but found them not i ventured to ask but with some little hesitation for seckers lectures  the bookseller never heard of them i took a turn round the shop and having forgot to bring any books with me would have taken up with almost anything approaching to the rational but in my progress i had wellnigh overset a glasscase of toothpicks gold hussives embroidered pincushions and embossed snuffboxes  and now it appeared that this harlequin trader was rather a haberdasher than a bookseller  on casting my eyes toward a person at the other end of the shop i saw her bending wire to form what is facetiously called a cap over this persons head was a goodly show of bandboxes and across the window at which she sat were ribbons variously twisted and several specimens of her skill in decorating that part of the body which is now more ridiculous than any other seeing such preparations for the outside of the head i gave up the idea of finding any internal furniture and walking out of the shop asked pardon for having so grossly mistaken a milliners and toymans for a vender of matters in the literary way  just as i got to the door a party of mighty pretty women and my wife amongst the rest for she already knew every body came rustling into the shop and in a lisping tone attuned to the articulation of a wateringplace desired the haberdasherymillinery bookseller to look for julia mandeville  julia mandeville was not to be had then let us have sidney biddulph said the ladies  sidney biddulph was out i am for the mistakes of the heart cried a very gravelooking woman i wish my dear said my wife to me with a very wellbred civility taking less notice of me than usual you had brought joseph andrews along with you  oh la maam replied another how can you possibly read such low stuff  the adventures of a footman a kitchen wench and a strolling parson  nay madam said harriet dont say anything against the parsons pray remember i am a clergymans wife and there he stands  an abraham adams every inch of him  ant you my dear  this was too much i attempted to go but harriet caught me by the coat the poor ladies were in great anxiety to find the mistakes of the heart had been carried off last season by a person who took the road to gretna green with her footman in her way to london though some said the haberdasher archly may think that was going a roundabout way too if we cannot get the mistakes suppose rejoined the ladies we make shift till we can have something better with tom jones  aye tom jones is tolerable enough said a pale lady if he would but say more about sophia and give us less nonsense about the old vulgar father the fusty aunt and those unentertaining horrid creatures thwackum and square as to his introductory chapters as he calls them i always skip em and yet if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were to expect at the top of his chapters i really think it would be a goodish prettyish sort of a novel  tom jones it seems was now in reading by lady sallows coachman  the haberdasher recommended filial piety  the ladies were satisfied that it was a dull serious sermonizing thing from the title filial piety indeed  send it to miss dorothy desolate who is come to dip for the dismals or lady bab bluebutter who wants to drink away her frogfreckled complexion  ha ha ha he he he   the laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was occasioned and my dear harriet joined in it most cordially  they were about to depart without any books at all when the haberdasher mentioned some odd volumes of the spectator they asked what he meant by talking about such old things which they had been obliged to read over and over again when they were at their boardingschools lord cried one of the damsels here is delicate embarrassments  oh the very thing  worth all the spectators that ever were wrote aye take it and let us go read it directly  it dont end well i think objected another i had rather read each sex in their humor  here is something new ladies said the haberdasher  as old as the poles said the fairones  what say you to eloisa  oh by all means  have you got eloisa  reach it this moment  oh the dear book  there are three letters in the first volume worth all the world  come it is a nasty evening and not fit for walking let us hurry away and so send them mr trashley to the hall this instant come mr homespun turning to me you shall squire us  they fluttered out caught me by the arm and carried me off in high triumph ten times faster than i should have walked had i been permitted to do as i thought proper but that is a matter by no means allowable at a wateringplace even now i am summoned by a messenger who says the party are waiting for me to go into the walks i dare not stay to finish my letter lest i should become ridiculous so you must wait till i can next steal a moment from folly for friendship  i am dear doctor your most humble servant horace homespun  letter ix sedley to thornton oh for the genius of old horatius flaccus that i might compress a volume of facts within the foldings of a single sheet of paper hear see be convinced congratulate me and sing a te deum to thy friend and a requiem to the immortal memory of stanhope  the party of which i was made one consisted of master minister homespun his lady an animal who burlesqued the coxcomb and a fourth who departed before the entrance of supper so that of him i shall say nothing at present  homespun and his wife are opposites and therefore the better suited to the trial of skill at first i said no more than just to show my breeding and inclination to be happy in their society i let them show off themselves as much as possible that i might accurately learn their tempers before i ventured to attack them homespun soon discovered himself to be a grubber in books and his lady a lover of the fashions gay giddy goodnatured unsuspicious and uninformed the coxcomb was of the neutral kind but wished to be flattered for his taste in personal ornaments never was there a more curious trio the conversation turned at first upon weather then upon books then upon dress and last upon the virtue of the buxton waters and i accommodated myself to the several changes with tolerable facility  and first to touch the tender part of our bookworm i observed that the public sustained a great loss in the death of several ornaments of the age i spoke critically as to the satiric powers of charles churchill and poetically as to the pindaric flights of gray i entered into the intricacies of the epic and drew the line betwixt the original homer and the imitator virgil i spoke of ease in the style of tillotson and of the pathetic in the periods of yorick i affected even to discountenance the innuendo of tristram shandy and i compared his licentious spirit with the voluptuous ovid i pretended to discover an ostentatious display of talents in the orations and epistles of cicero and i took care to suit every opinion to the taste of the person i addressed who had his share in the conversation too and who as i have since heard mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning  i must not forget to tell thee that when i was talking upon books and mentioned the elements of criticism mrs homespun though no simpleton asked me with great simplicity if that was a novel to which the fop answered yes it came out last year and was written by an intimate friend of his but that though he pushed it with all his interest it did not take and was now totally buried in oblivion  i contradicted this with all possible politeness  i imagined he might be mistaken that work i believed was attributed to lord kames  a writer with whom i did not doubt but he was acquainted possibly he might confound the title a little with others similar to it which might very easily be done i had caught myself in such errors a thousand times mr homespun chuckled at my candor mrs homespun i know by her eyes said something to her husband in a low voice in my favor and the fop himself with a smile of complacence but without any confusion at detected ignorance   such thornton is the force of manner  said it was very likely he might be misled by the title that there were three or four elements and he was most superlatively obliged to me for setting him right  upon the topic of dress i took care to agree with mrs homespun in every particular except that now and then i affected in a gentle tone of voice and submissive smile of countenance to differ from her on purpose to throw the triumph on her side make her happy in an ideal superiority the better to impress her with a proper notion of my good manners in yielding to conviction  the fop hopped out about twelve oclock and took me by the hand in token of satisfaction honest horace that is his christian name considers me as his comforter and declares that he hopes for some happiness now even in a wateringplace and mrs homespun or as i shall call her hereafter to use as little as possible that vulgar name harriet makes no scruple of saying i am the most chatty agreeable man at the bath  i caught her thornton twice measuring me from top to bottom and then she gave horace a survey  by the soft halfsuppressed sigh she gave at the end of it it is easy to see  whose dimensions she likes best  oh thornton if i can once bring her to be discontented with her situation  if she once begins to repent of her bargain the day is my own i never saw a pair of eyes more likely to fall in love than hers the eyes of horace are gray and without luster she has the right lips of invitation the vulgar horace smackt them at something she said but methinks the impression was only skindeep she is in full health and in the heyday of female youth  oh thornton thornton pray earnestly that she may be miserable and that the despair of her heart may be removed only by thy friend  philip sedley  letter x thornton to sedley horace homespun will i perceive have in due time a horn upon his head and yet i feel a pang for the poor pedant  hang it sedley why should thou pluck the rose from the matrimonial pillow why plant a thorn in its stead  but  but  i beg pardon twas a tug of conscience i am ashamed of the sensation i half blush at the impoliteness go on and prosper i am all expectation till i hear of the downfall of the bewitching harriet  farewell james thornton  letter xi sedley to thornton the horrors of the gout and the tremblings of the palsy seize thee for throwing a thought across me that has well nigh torn a leaf of chesterfield from my heart  the matrimonial rose  oh thou barbarian would thou ruin my principles and have me act in repugnance to my preceptor already  infidel avaunt my creed is established dare not  on thy life thornton dare not again attempt to make me an apostate to pleasure halfbred man be silent and attentive i have a scene to paint to thee might thaw the frigid feelings of an anchorite  about one oclock in the morning the eyes of horace began to twinkle  what was before dull became duller till at last the four eyelashes met together and covered the balls of sight harriet continued loquacious and lively and resolved not to go to bed till it was a more modish hour insisting that i should keep her company i humoured her vivacity till horace began to snore and then shifted the conversation to something less spirited  sentiment thornton when enforced at a proper crisis is a better weapon for a man of pleasure than downright licentiousness i began to sing forth the happiness of mr homespun said many things in praise of his learning honesty and hospitable turn of thinking  told a tale of disappointed passion  descanted on the difficulties often attending reciprocal attractions  placed two young people in several affecting situations i altered the tone of my voice and suited it to the stillness of the night  sighed in whisper  corrected myself  called a tear into my eye  assumed a softened flexibility of feature  and now and then took my eye from viewing her as if sensibly struck with my danger  part of the flowers with which she had been some time playing fell on the floor  i took them up with a trembling hand and put them into hers with a pressure scarcely perceptible there was a sudden blush over her face in a moment i took no notice of it but catching up a myrtlesprig kept it sportingly as if to conceal a new sigh  presented it to her as the feshest on the table and rose to take my leave  it was the exact moment of departure she was visibly agitated and i would not see it she took the sprig and i saw the leaves shake i went softly to the door left with her the compliments of the night in a gentleness of the tones perfectly pathetic  lingered at the door a moment  complained that i could not open it hastily for fear of disturbing her husband  at last i almost shut it  half opened it again  stood the third of a minute in a finelydissembled state of embarrassment  once more bade her farewell and indeed departed  adieu philip sedley  letter xii from the same to the same a postchaise and four this instant stopped at the door of mine host in which were three new visitants the foreglass was let down by

journey has already had a good effect my dear lucy upon poor fanny we traveled by easy stages and i hope much from the alteration of air even if the waters should want virtue to restore her the poor thing has been to all the baths in the kingdom you know except those of buxton alas i fear her disorder has got too near her heart for medicine and the god that afflicts can only i believe remove the affliction never was known so gradual a decline and yet no application could stop its progress  what a pity lucy that such a form should be daily decaying before the eyes of the most tender relations company conversation the simplicity of her diet the wholesomeness of the situation are all that can be expected from a short residence here as the waters of buxton are not strongly recommended in consumptive complaints she is always best in society and i am happy to tell you the place is tolerably full her poor fond husband hangs over her fading form with more tenderness than when it was in its bloom pray heaven these assiduities may prove successful i with write again soon  delia delmore  letter xvi miss delia delmore in continuation softness to the sick is better than a cordial fanny ventured yesterday to breakfast in public her delicate form beautiful in distress instantly attracted and claimed what it received  the attention of the whole company she was dressed with her usual simplicity and suited her ornaments to her situation in my life i never saw any body in the luxuriancy of health half so interesting after the first dish of tea the flush which was formerly a constant resident revisited her cheek  the disorder has not in any degree tinged her complexion  her forehead is as it ever was alabaster white and the veins that meander round the temples are so transparently blue and the circulation seems to be performed so pacifically one might almost envy the delicacy which a cruel disorder has bestowed upon her in the eyes of several young ladies who by their florid appearance came hither merely for amusement i saw the glistening drop of sympathy  and the men who were laughing at our entrance soon softened their voices and spoke almost in a whisper in compliment to the lovely invalid who appeared to want such attention  fanny was sensible to their indulgence and smiled acknowledgment at last in came a stranger elegant and easy beyond description  how my lucy

fanny mortimer  letter xviii the reverend horace homespun to doctor diggory dear friend i really begin to think i shall find some satisfaction at buxton bath amidst a cluster of insignificant characters one gentleman has distinguished himself so much above the rest that i have at once gratified my pride and curiosity in his acquaintance  he is intimately acquainted with polite and elegant learning perfectly well mannered and not above conversing upon subjects of divinity and ethics even at a wateringplace my wife says he understands to a nicety what some of the waterers call the etiquette of dress and with the arts of a scholar he has it seems the invention and taste of a courtier without anything of courtly insincerity  in truth i am apt to think very favorably of him especially as his exterior does not seem more frank and open than his interior is ingenuous and undisguised one such character will atone for the stupidity of the rest as i am fond of now and then what i call a woodwalk or a ramble by myself i can now take this without a breach of good manners for i can leave this accomplished gentleman with harriet who is fond enough of his company to accept of him in my absence  i am half inclined to forgive wateringplaces which have in the end after much prior disappointment produced so agreeable a companion whose sentiments of life and maxims of moral conduct do credit to himself and honor to the species  i am dear doctor your faithful servant horace homespun  letter xix mrs homespun to mrs la mott oh that i could live at buxton for ever we have since i last wrote to you got acquainted with the handsomest man in the world and though he is as good a scholar as horace yet he understands as well as i do all the prettinesses of dress which you know horace is entirely ignorant of then he is so polite so unaffected he contradicts with such gentleness  he is so open to conviction  you know my aversion to filthy cheese i happened only to hint this and he ordered it never to be brought again to the table while i was at the bath though mr homespun said i ought to suffer what was offensive to myself out of goodmanners to the company  it is hardly worth attending to and perhaps you will laugh at my taking notice of such a trifle but he sits in a chair eats his victuals cuts it into slices and holds his knife and fork as different from horace as possible who you know sometimes seems so over head and ears in thought that he forgets the dinner is before him picks his teeth and sits silent till the cloth is ready to be taken away then again as to carving horace can no more do the honors of the table than a baby he misses the joint and sometimes scatters the sauce in ones face  whereas this gentleman hits the mark as dexterously as a surgeon helps the ladies to the greatest delicacies with such a gentle manner and with a countenance so smiling that it is impossible to refuse what he offers  at supper last night horace was in one of his thoughtful moods and disgusted me horridly  there was a roasted fowl and horace perceiving my plate empty must needs fill it with one of the wings which he made shift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating though another for the purpose was lying on the other side the dish then he must needs make my wing swim with the gravy and in awkwardly tilting the dish several drops flew upon the gentlemans waistcoat mr sedley  that is his name  said it was no matter it was not easy to help such accidents and begged he would consider it as of no sort of consequence  sweet fellow  oh that horace would imitate him he is now walking toward our lodgings and horace slouching by the side of him horace is upright enough but then he looks as stiff and uncomfortable as an overstarched shirt  sedley moves as if he was quite happy mr homespun struts as if he was in misery they are both at the door  adieu adieu harriet homespun  letter xx sedley to thornton the proverb is verified it cannot rain but it pours the cherubim i mentioned to thee in my last is a cherub of an inferior order when compared with the seraph who came with her she was at that time muffled up and close hooded but when on the next day the veil was withdrawn judge of my surprise when i beheld the very she the charming she whom last season i met with her father sir henry delmore at scarborough at the very period that the letters of my divine earl became popular and i had brought a copy of them we lodged in the same house and i became agreeable to sir henry the very first trial i made to reduce my favorite precepts to practice was upon the heart of this very girl then glowing with all the graces of health and endowed with all the enchantments of a pathetic temper i soon pretended to lose my vivacity and became the softest son of sentiment that ever was born the net of silk which i had diligently woven became successful and i had certainly caught in it the fairest prize in the creation had not a cruel necessity called me from the bath  several transient teteatetes i had with her there gave me the opportunities i wished her passion was imaginary but pleasing  she fixed high the standard of domestic felicity and unreasonably loved to refine  to accommodate myself to this was at first not easy but before i quitted scarborough i was so distinguished for the pensenoso that even sir henry himself began to think i was falling into a hypochondriac disorder and used every effort to divert me  though i was then but a novice in the theory of joy i had read enough of chesterfield to know the potency of dissimulation and had it been in my power to have staid another week should have even then added an illustrious example to corroborate that glorious precept which advises to adapt the character and conversation to the company  since these transactions she is altered thornton  altered in every part of her situation the is married and in a consumption and yet like certain fruits she is delicious in decay i was pleased to see her disordered at the first interview the little blood that painted her cheek disappeared her knees shook and her hands trembled at the recollection and this too was in a public breakfastingroom judge how her agitation must alarm the company and operate amongst the women in my favor who knows thonrton but the beautiful invalid may have brought herself to this state upon my account if so ought not i to pity her  and ought not she to thank the gods that i again am come to comfort her at all events you ought to congratulate me and once again sing io paean to the canonized bones of chesterfield  adieu philip sedley  letter xxi from the same to the same the homespuns are secured i have them by the heart and enjoy in an equal degree the confidence of the wife and husband  horace has many oddities of which hid wife is lately become sensible and it has been my business to excuse them to her he is addicted to catch hold of the button and in the ardour of philosophical and systematic conversation tugs at it most immoderately last night in supporting a favorite opinion which was opposed stoutly by the fopling he seized the wrought button and tore his fingers against the raisedwork on the surface till the blood fairly gushed out in a stream and spotted his sables the fop swore  i checked him with temper the parson cooled in his argument  and i applied an handkerchief to the wound and thus saved them both from looking silly  horaces nails are not quite so accurately clean as they might be and as i observed mrs homespun comparing them with mine i suddenly closed my hand as if out of tenderness lest the comparison should turn to horaces disadvantage yet this very tenderness so managed answered the design completely and i can see plainly harriet thinks hardly of horace for neglecting to pick the dirt from under his nails while on the other hand when he and i are together we laugh at the fopperies of the times and seem mutually to despise all its delicatesse  adieu philip sedley  letter xxi thorton to sedley cormorant in pleasure insatiate conqueror what is not one object sufficient at a time must thy bow have seven strings to it and can thou not be satisfied with the victory thou will soon gain over the buxom harriet but thou must plot captivity for the cherubim and hope to carry all before thee this is illustrating thy favorite lords maxims with a witness and will thou not bestow a single beauty to thy friend be this as it may spare  i conjure thee spare the delicate distressed  harm not the gentle fanny but suffer her to live the short remainder of her days in the purity of conjugal caresses  spot not the ermine at expiring chastity but let her spirit ascend immaculate to heaven  do this if thou art a man the high in health may admit and return thy revels but pity the sick sister and let not the maxims of thy preceptor be made subservient to sanctify barbarity if thou triest to ensnare the sinking soul of fanny mortimer thou art a fiend and unworthy the friendship of thy  j thornton p s is it not said in the volume of thine oracle a man is fit neither for business or pleasure who either does not or cannot command and direct his attention to the present object and in some degree banish for that time all other objects from his thoughts  how is this admonition consistent with thy scheme of three at a time study to be consistent or all is over    letter xxii sedley to thornton the very worst reasoner in the dominions of george is james thornton esquire  and so because i have an eye upon three thou supposest i must needs be inconsistent and irregular do thou not know that the same oracle advises a quickness of attention an unobserved observation the art of seeing all the people in the room without appearing to look critically is there not according to that oracle pretty nearly the same degree of deception in every character and are we not to turn all this hypocrisy to our advantage even while we seem to think every body honest  the great nicety in my present situation thou do not see nor will i be at the pains to develope it to so awkward an arguer  what a conclusion have thou drawn indeed from my having three objects in view not considering that i am as cool and collected as if i had but one and that i have a capacity equal to the conquest of thirty times three  learn to know me better  i am too well disciplined in my system to be precipitate or to hazard the mortification of being disappointed by rashly seizing that which i perceive can only be attained gradually by the successful efforts of resistless insinuation  the master of my art says very truly  little minds are in a hurry when the object proves too big for them they run they puzzle confound and perplex themselves they want to do every thing at once and never do it at all but a man of sense takes the time for doing the thing he is about well and his haste to dispatch a business only appears by the continuity of his application to it he pursues it with a cool steadiness and finishes it before he begins any other  this last sentence thornton thou may think clashes with my present attack upon the three beauties of buxton  thou art again mistaken  i am not in a hurry to be happy as to the ultimatum of female favors like a man of resolution i can watch the progress of a favorite pursuit and see it prosper under my eye without seizing the final recompense of my labor till it is the proper crisis of fruition  to bring these arguments home to the points in question thou must understand that had only harriet homespun been at the bath i should have been contented till her finishing but as the fates have thrown two sisters in my way of which one happens to be an old acquaintance but whom accident permitted to slip through my fingers unconquered or at least without bestowing upon her victor the rewards of conquest i must suit myself to the triple tie that chance has laid upon me with as much adroitness as i am able and this is the delicacy in my situation to which in the beginning of this letter i alluded  one great part of my system is to make people who are to give me happiness happy in themselves i must to this end take care to avoid making any of these dear creatures rivals to each other  to boast of amors thou know is utterly repugnant to the stanhopean principle press for the favor read the eyes fix the heart and revel over the yielded person ad eternitatem but keep the joy to thyself nor ever with rascal loquacity betray the infirmity of her whose indulgence has give thee the first of felicities  to one friend i have ventured to disclose myself in the very confidence of my soul if thou betrayest me though but in the hour of ebriety  it does not admit of an if  thou art a guarded honorable character  no more i prithee as to plurality of objects  the chesterfield system admits not the fearful and filthy intercourse of venal women he could not allow the horrid and vulgar hazards of c  s and p  s avoid says he in his celestial chapter on pleasures the fate of the promiscuous fornicator what a wretch is a rake with half a nose crippled by coarse and infamous debauches  hence thornton it is evident that a man is justified provided he keeps the secret to search the circle of the earth for those favors and elevated connexions that bring along with them the honey without the sting it is beneath a gentleman to beat round the bagnios or criticize the brothel leave such to the appetites of apprentices whose vulgar palates can digest anything be it the business of those who are governed by the laws of goodbreeding to enlist themselves under the white banner of apparent modesty and invite embraces unallayed by terrors and suspicions  the constitution of a man of fashion demands in these cases the utmost circumspection the wife the virgin and the friend only promise this blissful security to them then let us direct ourselves in selfdefence and thus procure the personal paradise in which the roses of beauty bloom without a thorn  i have said thus much to silence thee once for all as to the nature of my favorite principle which thou now perceivest to be not more pleasing than rational no more then of thy whining passages about pity and virtue and all the etcaetera of parsonly cant  the man of taste and fashion moves above it  adieu philip sedley  letter xxiii the reverend horace homespun to doctor diggory dear doctor we are all wrong again  the head of poor harriet is certainly turned and instead of a cure being performed she is certainly distracted by these same waters of buxton this day we drank tea in private and never heard i such a train of conversation as she fell into why doctor she is gone  her intellects i mean  past redemption  for the first time in her life she found fault with everything i did she insisted upon it i drank my tea too hot which was not only she said injurious to the coat of the stomach but shockingly indelicate  the teaspoon was not managed to her satisfaction i sipped too loud from the saucer when it would i find have been genteeler to apply a silent lip to the cup nay what is worse than all this i had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter ineligantly and it would have been better there too if i had put the ends rather than die side of it to my mouth first  but that which most astonished me was her objection to the good old custom of turning down my cup which she said was out of the ton and that it would give her great pleasure if in future i would lay the spoon across the cup  i was perfectly petrified and yet held my tongue and spoke nothing  she proposed walking and as i really thought the air might do the poor creatures head good i drew on my gloves and attended her toward the wellwalk  alas doctor nothing i fear can bring her about for she grew ten times worse than ever and if i was astonished before i was now almost struck dead with the hugeness of my amazement  i had not the happiness to hit her fancy even in my walk which she very fairly told me was ridiculous and that i held up my head too high turned in my toes too much and wanted the graces in my arms  she actually made an objection to the manner in which my wig was powdered said it was all in patches and had not the regular sprinkling of a man of fashion  upon this i ventured gently to tell her that i was but a country curate that i had no pretensions to fashion  that i had for my own part nothing to do at wateringplace but to oblige her  that i was very sorry for the loftiness of my head which for the time to come should be carried with more humility  that if it would give her any pleasure i would take care to stoop till i bent neck and shoulders together  that as to inversion of the toes i would learn to dance late in the day as it was for me and inconsistent as such a part might be thought to the clerical character  in regard to my arms that i had hitherto only used them in the ordinary offices of life and found they performed very well for a plain man but that if she had any favorite attitudes or wished me to exhibit in any postures to which she was particularly partial i would practice vigilantly at the lookingglass and rather than want the graces she spoke of would absolutely learn the exercise and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs arms head and hands like a young recruit at the same time i begged her to consider that as we had since the day of our union lived harmoniously i warmly hoped we should not be put out of tune by trifles which are in themselves insignificant even if we admitted them to be essential to the etiquette of a wateringplace i moreover told her to remember that i was at least a faithful husband and made her happiness the study practice and contrivance of my whole life and that surely where the cardinal duties were observed it mattered little whether the toes were the breadth of a barleycorn too much in or out or the head half an inch too lofty or half an inch too low i would have proceeded in my defense but that my good friend mr sedley at that instant came to my relief told us as he advanced with warmth vivacity and a cheerful countenance that if we did justice to his attachment to us we might judge of the joy be felt in seeing us so frequently choose a private path which was to him a certain indication of matrimonial felicity  there was something so pretty in his speech that it made an impression on my memory and i have copied it verbatim in less than half an hour mrs homespun recovered her reason her late lunacy was never hinted at and hoping to continue her goodnature i invited this most agreeable gentleman to take another bit of supper with us  the manner in which he accepted the invitation trebled the sense of the favor he did me by his company what a gratification it is to have so sensible and entertaining a friend at a wateringplace  dear doctor i am yours truly horace homespun  letter xxiv sedley to thornton a man thorton who is true to the relish of pleasure can extract extacy even from disappointment the bliss of blisses alone could have made me happier than i was an hour ago  hear the story  since the first moment i cast my eye upon the bewitching harriet i marked her for my own and she has since been the grand point of all my insinuation and ingenuity not a single article has been neglected that could touch her imagination move her heart and catch her favorite weaknesses i paid court to her fancy to her feelings to her foibles constant attention has done the business i expected it would and i have but one effort more to be master of all that the sinest woman in the world has to bestow  last night my thornton was the conscious period that yielded up every transport but the one horace was requested to perform the funeralservice over the corpse of a fellow who died by a dropsy as the parson of the parish was indisposed and it seems he was to be buried at a town a mile distant from our lodgings  he went  the opportunity was not to be omitted i exerted myself i sparkled in the luster of stanhopean sentiments  i became eloquent and soon communicated a part of my ardour to the troubled bosom of harriet i hit her soft upon the heart our eyes met  they confirmed our sentiments  our voices grew soft as the summerbreezes  there was no intruder  i laid my cheek close to hers  they were both upon the glow  for the first time in my life i kissed her lips  i repeated the pressure  she repulsed me  i dropped upon my knee and in that attitude repeated the offense  nature was stirred to the uttermost  i continued to suck the delicious poison and unawares she returned the salutation the dalliance was no longer to be borne she begged me for gods sake to desist the flush of desire and modesty were at war in her cheek  her bosom palpitated  i plied her with my precious maxims in a whisper that gave them additional graces  i laid my hand upon her heart the throb was violent and as i caught her eagerly in my arms her head sunk in unresisting softness on my shoulder and worked to the extreme betwixt sentiment and sensation she burst into tears  i composed her cheek  drew her handkerchief gently over her eye fixed her again without offering to distress her in her chair and to this moment she thinks i sacrificed to love respect delicacy and friendship a passion that is tearing me to pieces  in a few minutes homespun returned he is no reader of looks and i took my leave for the night with that easy intrepid assurance which belongs to the great character i have adopted  and now thornton am i not a tolerable proficient in the science of dissimulation does anything come amiss to me can i not assume with ease and wear with cheerfulness every shape are not heat cold luxury abstinence gravity gaiety ceremony easiness learning trifling business and pleasure modes which according to my preceptors advice i am able to take lay aside or change occasionally with as much ease as i would take and lay aside my hat  but you may expect nobler illustrations of this hereafter i am yet in the outset of my adventures  sporting by way of trial with jejune experiments the next time i can send thee out of the way horace homespun beware thou have just escaped a sore evil a little while ago thou were within an inch of cuckoldom  thornton adieu philip sedley  letter xxv the reverend horace homespun to doctor diggory dear doctor such a night as the last i never passed my poor wife has had a relapse doctor it returned at midnight upon her and raged with the most frightful violence for above two hours she is absolutely delirious and i am the most wretched of men  about an hour after we were in bed she complained that there was no bearing the heat though in truth this is one of the coldest places in england and it had rained all the preceding evening i felt her pulse and it was immoderately full tumultuous and rapid i kissed her with all the tenderness of a sympathizing husband  she asked me how i could possibly be so cruel i offered to lay her dear head upon my bosom as upon the pillow of affection judging that she would be pleased with my assiduities her eyes were streaming in tears  her face was on fire  the sighs came from her palpably against her consent i pressed to know the cause of this at least to what she attributed it and offered to throw on my clothes and procure a doctor her cure she told me was out of the reach of a doctor but that if i would not suffer her to be quiet without fretting her by my officiousness she should be under the necessity of getting out of the bed and sit till the morning in a chair a little time after this she changed her manner and with a kinder tone of the voice asked me if i would consent to return home as soon as it was light she caught my hand begged my pardon wetted it with her tears and begged i would excuse her infirmity i drew her fond and close to my heart and i felt hers at that moment leap with agony in the next moment she requested me to leave her covered herself hastily head over ears with the bedcloaths and saying that she wished i was wrapping her in the shroud sunk sobbing upon her pillow oh doctor what shall i do what can be the matter i am really unconscious of offense she is now in bed  perhaps sleep may alleviate her disorder the worst of it is she will not allow me to speak to any third person and as i myself know nothing of either maladies or their proper medicines i am dreadfully alarmed and tremble for the consequence  dear doctor i am your unhappy friend horace homespun  letter xxvi from the same to the same dear doctor certainly mr sedley is the best young man in england when he came to pay me the compliments of the morning he found me in a very dejected situation and though he was far from inquisitive yet i could not conceal from his asking eye the nature of my calamity poor young gentleman it was evident that he felt for me his countenance lost in a moment all that fine glow that is natural to it and if my fancy does not deceive me he had some difficulty to prevent a tear from starting he assured me that words were never made to do justice to the feelings of wounded friendship that he was more interested in everything that concerned me and my wife than he could express and that if i would suggest some little pretense either of business or of invitation to leave him with mrs homespun in the evening he would certainly either comfort her by every ministration of the sincerest friendship or at worst he would find out the reasons for her anxiety and the nature of her complaint after which he very well observed the remedy would be easy at this generous proposal in which his worthy disposition was manifest i was ready to weep and as we embraced each other at parting our voices became of no use to us and we could only show by our sympathising enfoldings that we had a sincere and christian regard for each other  i am dear doctor your most faithful servant horace homespun  letter xxvii mrs homespun to mrs la motte oh charlotte charlotte what a perplexity am i thrown into by this scheme of pleasure accursed be the hour in which i set my foot upon the confines of buxton unconscious of any violent partialities i was contented while i was ignorant in the dreary village where our parsonage is a palace i was sufficiently happy because i saw nobody superior to mr homespun i was the ministers lady and the wives and daughters of the neighborhood paid me the compliment of their best curtsey my horace really looked handsome in his sunday canonicals and i viewed him in the pulpit with pleasure  but alas my charlotte the scene is changed i have been several days in a place of politeness where horace is the most awkward of the circle my eyes are now opened to his imperfections  i see them i feel them i detest them he is a lump of learning without ductility without softness without  what mr sedley calls the graces i am sometimes obliged to ask several times before i can obtain an answer to the most ordinary question and then at last he bursts from his reverie and pretends not to have heard me speak to him can anything be so disgusting his conversation is unlike that of the rest of the company and instead of bearing a part in little social and endearing chitchat he talks eternally about lock and livy and cicero the elements of criticism the problems of euclid and such fellows  and many a time when i have wanted him to put a pin in my handkerchief or such little offices of endearment he has been wrapped up in meditation and then stared me full in the face without knowing i was in the room  then he actually has a strange shy method of treating me as a wife there is no delicacy in his air when he takes my hand he shakes it indeed heartily but then he has the fat fist of a grasier even though in other respects he is disagreeably thin he kisses with a ceremony perfectly classical as mr sedley calls it there is a pretty method methinks even in the management of the lips by accident mr sedley stole a kiss the other day and he placed it so directly so gently and so pathetically in the center that i never felt such a sensation i protest charlotte it ran thrilling through every vein of me warmed my very heart and almost took away my breath  we were i remember playing at questions and commands the day being showery so that we could not stir out the forfeit came round at last to horace and he smackt me as usual in his roundabout manner heaven pardon me charlotte but i was obliged to draw my pockethandkerchief across my mouth and had some difficulty to avoid making a wry face if you was once in the company of mr sedley  he is called the handsome sedley here  you would never forget  gentle graceful elegant soft genteel and eloquent  heigho  why charlotte why did i marry before i had seen something of the world or rather why after i was married why did i ever stray from carts and cottages to the delightful dangers of a wateringplace  but i must hide my letter mr homespun is coming toward the house as erect as a walkingstick  adieu harriet homespun  letter xxviii miss delia delmore to lady lucy saxby fanny is much disordered my dear lucy the fainting with which she was seized at the breakfastrooms has preyed on her ever since her spirits are greatly agitated her husband attends her with the diligence of a nurse and cannot be persuaded to leave her chamber the poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude but speaks less than usual as she says talking exhausts her she has twice hinted her wishes to be removed from hence either to my fathers or to scarborough as we thought proper and begs her removal may be pretty late at night for company she says rather disturbs her since her last accident poor mortimer her husband sees her dying by inches before his face and his unavailing officiousness appears now and then to go too near the heart of the sinking fanny she is too indisposed to remove at present for my part i have not been able to set my foot yet in the street i love my sister too tenderly to leave her with a strange woman in a strange place especially with one who is merely paid for her attention and who consequently can have none of those charming thoughts that enter into the heart of a tender relation sometimes my dear the changing a posture sometimes the shifting a pillow or fixing a chair does more by the method of doing it than all the elaborate efforts of an avowed nurse a mr sedley  who is said to be the beauty of the bath and was the person that handed fanny down stairs and was very obliging during her illness  sends every day very respectfully to know how the sick lady improves in her health as many of both sexes were witness to poor fannys distress and as people should have a fellowfeeling in places of general resort for cures as well as fashions i wonder others have not paid this sweet girl the same compliment  the manner in which this gentleman makes the enquiry is pretty he does not presume upon the privilege of a public place and send a blundering footboy with a message nor does he come intruding himself but he usually writes a little billet every day varied and containing a new turn in which his expressions discover at once accomplishment and highbreeding and what puts it out of any bodys power to misconstrue it into design he always addresses his cards to mr mortimer as my brother was reading one of these this morning to his wife she desired to look at the hand but had scarce held it to her eye before she dropped the paper and letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow said very softly that she could not manage it and was weaker than she imagined  she is now in a gentle dose and i took the opportunity it gave to inform my dear lucy of our present melancholy situation sir harry and my mother are expected hourly if fanny really dies my mother will certainly go distracted heaven bless you and yours  delia delmore  letter xxix mrs la motte to mrs homespun in the name of heaven harriet what are you about your letters alarm me beyond imagination you are in the road to ruin i see you upon the very verge of perpetual infamy you can now mark the little imperfections of a husband you are blind to his many virtues you have cast your eye on a man whose person and manners you like better with this man you have been already left alone you may be left alone again the next step is too apparent to be mentioned you are very gay very young very inexperienced there is but one way left to prevent your destruction and that is to return home directly and make any excuse to horace for the abruptness of your departure i know nothing of the sedley you speak nor do i wish to know him better had it been on all hands if you were as ignorant of him as i am it is plain he has pleased you too well since the pleasure is bought at the dear price of hatred to the best of husbands yes harriet your horace is the best of husbands he is an honest man if he is not a brilliant man and if he does not shine in society he has an excellent heart and a simplicity of manners truly amiable the little points of objection you have made are when weighed against his various virtues light and of no account while on the other hand sedley has very probably nothing but an elegance in trifling to set him of  waving however these points my dear let us come to others more startling you are a wife you are pregnant you are advanced far in that pregnancy you have a clear character you have the love of an innocent neighborhood  away  away order your chaise this instant to the door the matter does not admit of a moments debate i hasten to seal up my letter and i beg for gods sake for your own sake and for that of all that love you or that you love that you will deliver your answer by word of mouth  i shall catch you to my breast as a dear friend just escaped from a precipice  as a treasure i have luckily rescued in the minute of despair from the surrounding flames adieu adieu i enjoin you to be expeditious  charlotte la motte  letter xxx mrs homespun to mrs la motte before the receipt of the above your harriet is something happier than when she last sat down to address you mr sedley has pleaded the cause of poor horace so persuasively and that behind his back there is a generous man for you that i have been induced to ask his pardon and i am resolved to treat him with more politeness which i find is indispensible in the conduct of a married woman to her husband even though he were indifferent to her  we have past together a very happy afternoon and though i do not find any greater degree of tenderness for horace yet as i know how to make him happy by merely suppressing those sentiments in his disfavour which can do me no service to discover i feel the sweets of disguiseing the truth upon some occasions i have restored horace to perfect serenity and i as sincerely thank mr sedley for taking me to task adieu  i am dear charlotte your affectionate harriet homespun  letter xxxi sedley to thornton the first blow is not yet finally given opportunity has not favored temptation sufficiently my system not only demands that i should preserve the fact private but the reputation of both the man and the woman unsuspected i am not to be a harumscarum rake who brutishly and boyishly boasts of his successes but a man of pleasure who is to bathe his senses in bliss and revel in the richest luxuries of enjoyment privately with consenting elegance while in public i am to sustain a fair character and pass upon men who only look upon the surface as a pattern of purity and a model for morals  harriet is a bewitching illiterate sweet piece of unpractised nature her complexion is ardent and i have sufficiently set her passions afloat but i must take care to guard against working up my own all the power of allconquering dissimulation is over when desire seizes the helm from the hand of cool and deliberate reason vigor and spirit are mere madnesses without versatility and complacence upon this principle i must walk without deviation like a faithful pupil in the path that is chalkt out for me it is my business to lead right reason in the triumphant fetters and shackles of the heart and the passions in order to accomplish this thornton i must keep myself collected and never strike till i have fully thrown every body about me off their guard and till i can then gratify conquer triumph and enjoy in full security my blood thornton is as cool as a turtles harriets i see is upon the boil yet she has beauty enough to stir me and when the secure moment offers itself fear not her disappointment her wishes  shall not be vain  adieu philip sedley  letter xxxii sedley to thornton i have appeared in public i dined this day at the ordinary ordinary indeed such a room full of emptiness i never beheld citizens apeing the men of mode women of sallow countenances and fops who would be thought witty and elegant when they are merely saucy and affected and dull alas thornton what a pity what a mortification i have not a single competitor  i mean not in point of gallantry for that militates against my system of pleasure  but there is no one of my sex from whom i can gain any real honor in the comparison however as even blockheads are worth gaining and their hearts worth misleading as they have all foibles to flatter and weaknesses that may be for our interest to work upon i began to show off and brought the whole company over as my admirers i practiced all the charming conversationrules of dormer with as much facility as if i had been the author of them and indeed they are so suited to my own natural sentiments that i only consider him as having written what i long ago thought and what i will henceforward invariably practice till i am incapable of farther enjoyment i had the happiness to sit parallel to the very fop already recorded in my correspondence and he was overdressed to all the extravagancy of the ton while i had the advantage of not in any sort invading the modesty of nature the fool looked as if he piqued himself upon his gaudiness he stroaked his ruffles displayed the baubles of his watch perkt up his head to gaze in the pierglasses pulled his watch in and out of his fob several times eyed himself ascance and figitted up and down in his chair with all the insignificant whiffling agility of the monkey in the fable who had seen the world  close to the side of this popinjay sat an unweildy animal who to the manners of a bear united the uncouthness of an elephant without half its sagacity and who in feeding scattered his offals around to the utter dismay of the coxcomb who fearful of complaining and alarmed at the size of the antagonist took shelter at a small table or rather sideboard and fluttered himself clean while the monster enjoyed his embarrassment i am happy to tell you that though this piece of pleasantry set the unpolished table in a roar i commanded my features and did not give way to ridicule hitherto i have never laughed out since i came to buxton and i solemnly hope i shall never be boorish of boisterous enough to laugh out again while i have being  i eat elegantly drank discreetly i smiled at a thousand dull stories and only told one myself and that inconceivably apropos i heard long talkers without appearing to be tired and i looked every person whom i addressed full in the face i dressed my countenance in softness and gave the douceur to all my motions i interrupted no man contradicted cautiously palliated tenderly decided a dispute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a goodhumoured pleasantry caught the habits of the company swore not at all and adapted my conversation to every speaker the consequence was thornton that i was immediately known to be somebody nay i was the admiration of every body my company was cherished my absence regretted and at my going out of the room a buz of universal approbation followed me down stairs in a word thornton the fops were annihilated the prattlers were silenced and i went off in the compleatest triumph of uncontested excellence  and thus having settled my reputation and established myself publicly it only remains that i enjoy my popularity by appearing to deserve it and then i may bid defiance to censure and then  welcome voluptuousness  adieu philip sedley  letter xxxiii thomas at the bath to timothy in town buxton receive timothy the greeting of thomas  i and my master arrived on the day we set out at this execrable place where i have as yet done little more than stick a pin in sedleys hair and peruse a page of his chesterfield after dinner  these books we are both excessively fond of and as he always leaves them in the chamberwindow i take them up when he lays them down to walk out by which means we make pretty nearly the same progress if any thing i believe i am half a volume beforehand with him and in the opinion of the judicious am the finer gentleman of the two  not that my master like your common coxcombs ever mentions his amors or his studies to his servant any more than i discover mine to him we are both better bred but i have heard too much of chesterfield at table at tea and every where else not to have had long ago a relish for his writings and i scruple not to tell thee timothy that i have formed myself what you know me to be entirely on his lordships model  he had beyond comparison the prettiest pen at an epistle in europe and is at once so neat and plain that it is impossible to misunderstand him i once was as vulgar a dog in my choice of books as any in the kingdom  i had no more taste timothy than a teacher of the table of multiplication i thought the luscious lovescenes of rochester delicious and had a mighty hankering after the memoirs of cleland but heaven defend me from such barefaced trash the bawdry brutes  they show too much to raise desire no tim stanhope has brought me round he teaches that the very shoe has power to wound and i am by gods grace and his lordships graces as gracefully graceless a rascal and as pretty a fellow as any in britain  i expect by the earls assistance to do an infinite deal of mischief at this wateringplace  my eye though no settler has pointed at a bathmaid who attracted me in the handing a tumbler of spawater nauseous as all minerals are i took it and tossed it off because i find to refuse is ungenteel i shall subdue this damsel at my leisure having for my more serious simulations as his lordship calls them a noble object in view of whom you will hear more explicitly in my next  sedley is upon some project but i scorn to be guilty of impertinent curiosity and he is as much above making either a confident or a pimp of his servant i should with more propriety have said his gentleman as his gentleman is of wearing a livery of worsted lace god and the graces speed him say i in all his undertakings every man has a right in this world to follow the bent of his fancy to strew the way over with flowers as the song says and to be as happy both up and abed as he possibly can  vale  as i see your scholars conclude vale  adio  adieu   thomas  letter xxxiv mrs homespun to mrs la motte after receiving mrs la

am and have continued a widow five years upon principle the man i have lost was even less splendid than mr homespun nor had his person any peculiar attractions what of that he was good he was great and he was tender as heaven i wanted not temptation while he was living to indulge indelicacies but i valued both his honor and my own and though i pretend to no gifts of preternatural continency i

countenance the poor woman indeed made but a bungling piece of work of it blushed stammered and stopped short while i took care to preserve every muscle and lineament steady and unmoved i see the efficacy of this most materially for had i not practiced this presence of mind i do verily believe even the unsagacious homespun would have suspected what had happened i took him by the hand with the usual cordiality and we walked to fairfield a neighboring village whither by the by he was walking while the deed was doing like inseparable friends so that there is as thou perceivest fresh reason

marrow of the dear earls epistle upon dress when this indiscreet master of mine absolutely forgetting his goodbreeding kicked me on the breech took the book out of my hand and led me down stairs by the nose for which if i forgive him may the shame i mean to brand his name with stick on mine no matter i know my cue smile at present and strike hereafter  since this affair the cruel youth keeps the

homespun to doctor diggory dear doctor things are so pleasingly altered that i have been overruled as to my design of going away even at the end of the fortnight and i have contrived to procure another weeks recess in order to extend my harriets happiness and enjoy myself the spirited yet moral and engaging conduct of mr sedley who every day becomes more agreeable and who i do truly believe has been not a little instrumental in bringing about my poor wife to a proper sense of her duty and right reason if anything she is more cordial to me than before my departure from the curacy and is at once lively and obliging  i take it for granted the strange conduct i transmitted you an account of in my late letters was only a transient giddiness not very infrequent as i have observed doctor to the fair sex about harriets age which is very well called in one of shakespeares tragedies that i read formerly the heyday of youthful blood we grave folks you know my dear diggory ought to allow for all this poor thing i pity her and am half angry with myself that i should have treated the overflowing effervescent emanations as i may style them of a juvenile mind as a serious delirium  but thank god it is not gone abroad to any person who is capable of circulating the whisper of the day to the detriment of a fellow creature mr sedley who i can easily see is to be trusted with every thing and my old friend and brothercollegian doctor diggory are the only persons informed of the matter and so all is well but do not i charge you think too hardly of her for what has been said it was all a misrepresentation and you should admire your heavenly harriet as you used to call her the more for having been injured i can assure you i am at present more satisfied with her than i am with myself and indeed she has the advantage of me for she appears in the light of a person calumniated and i am only one in a state of conscious error and probation  however a short time will i do not doubt set us all as happy again as our hearts can wish  but why my worthy diggory do you not write how is it that so scrupulous a man in point of equity is so unexact a correspondent you are deep in my debt and though i am now rich in the inestimable treasures of reconciliation yet a line from you would add materially to my fortune and i should have to thank heaven for as full a measure of felicity as it is perhaps either proper or possible to taste on this side of it  i am dear doctor your most happy and faithful horace homespun  letter xliv mrs homespun to mrs la motte madam the

your just reproaches instead of resenting i beg of you to compassionate me my penitence is sincere and you must  you will unite your prayers to mine that it may be at the same time perfect and efficient  adieu harriet homespun  letter xlvi sedley to thornton ha ha ha there is no law against laughing in a letter as there is neither a vulgar noise nor a ghastly grin attending it take then the silent mirth of my soul and let me pour out upon paper some part of the exultation that at this moment swells my heart  what a superficial animal is man as easily led by the nose as asses are the dupe of the senses the idiots of mere exterior and the very fools of a wellmanaged set of features  it is usual with women when the affair is over to whimper lament the loss of reputation the destruction of their eternal peace of mind and grow stubbornly refractory or else sullenly repineing this was formerly a vile piece of business and was a sore drawback upon the felicity of fruition but the converts of chesterfield have no trouble of this sort to apprehend as the confessor can make the consent of a goodnatured nun a point of piety and religion so a man of manner dress address and dissimulation may manifestly prove to either maid wife or widow that the shortest as well as the softest conveyance to heaven is upon a featherbed  without any sort of hum haugh stammer or hesitation i have convinced horace that he has been notoriously in the wrong in consequence of which he is to kneel oftener than his professional bendings require  i have firmly persuaded harriet that all our future pleasure depends on behaving ten times better than ever to horace  and lastly i have prevailed on the curate to indulge his wife a few days longer as a first instance of his repentance in the rashness of her heart she has told all to a mrs la motte who has written a chiding epistle in the old scolding way and to this i find she harriet has replied in justification of herself here i was obliged to set her right and have taken care to see her dispatch a penitential piece of policy which will bring all round again this same mrs la motte is in a state of widowhood and much in love with her weeds  a great beauty  and i see by one of her letters which i dissimulated out of harriet a great boaster i furthermore understand that she is a constant churchgoer has a deliciously demure set of muscles an elevated pair of eyes  folds the fair palm and holds long conversations betwixt god and her conscience  now thornton if by setting all my mastermaxims in motion  if by either the aids of genius stratagem and every exerted omnipotency of the head heart hand and voice i could but lower the loftiness of this proudhearted cottager my soul would be satisfied and i should sacrifice to the shade of the invincible dormer such a victim as might soothe his spirit and elevate his extacy in elysium  at present this is in embrio only  uningendered  in all events i am determined as king lear

ever produced  that nobody might perceive my agitation of mind by my countenance and its treacherous changings i have rambled amongst the rocks and over the heathy hills of this execrable country to meditate upon the means of bringing la motte within the reach of my machinations  it is not to be done and in the perfect stupidity and shame of my soul i am compelled to suspend the pursuit  adieu

preserve pure  i have been at church thornton where homespun officiated as teacher he has a snuffle in his nose his voice is destitute of that harmonious variety essential to all sorts of eloquence and his organs of articulation appear considerably obstructed  however i took him by the hand upon his descending from the pulpit returned him my sincere thanks in a wellinvented compliment for the elegance of his discourse applauded his delivery lamented that i had not often been made so happy and almost brought the tears of virtue and vanity into the good mans eyes at the pathos of my conclusion  there is no living in the world you know thornton without a complaisant indulgence for peoples weaknesses in a short time i expect to reach the summit for after only an hours practice i found myself able to call out a palpable tear only by placing a chair before my face and by the force of imagination representing it as a certain person in distress which i had an interest in relieving  and now i am talking upon the subject of sympathy i must tell thee thornton that i have made myself still more popular than ever in this little place by several acts of unostentatious ostentation  by giving occasional small sums to people who make it utterly unnecessary for me to be my own trumpeter there are a set of characters that will raise a benefactors reputation without any drudgery on his side these people have tongue enough however poor they may be in other respects and all the good you do though silent and secret as the noon of night shall shine like the light that shines unto the perfect day by means of those same grateful gossips  adieu philip sedley  letter li from the same to the same once more receive an account of a tender transaction which i cannot conceal from thee relating upon paper to the friend of ones heart for such thou art to me any business or event that has afforded transport is an office of a pleasing kind  harriet is as richly formed by nature for rapture as ever was woman and will i am in hopes soon be an adept in the science of pleasing her person is voluptuous beyond painting and the joys it yields are only to be felt and yet i am almost reduced again to childishness and am almost ready to fall again into my leadingstring notions by a very puerile accident  even thornton by the lovetale of a green uninformed girl whose whole history i purchased for a single sixpence she has been ruined and undone as she terms it by the basest of men  and who do thou think that man is thornton  neither more nor less than my fellow thomas who is i will assure thee a wouldbe stanhopean but trusting merely to pickedup precepts  the very crumbs that have fallen from his masters table  he stumbles in the effort and discovers his livery his dependency and his education even in his amors all this i enjoy thou know  the forsaken nymph came to complain of my mr thomas she is very pretty and very loquacious but hear the story in her own words  the story of the pretty bathmaid ant please your honor i am but a servant and live by handing my water to gentryfolks i have tended the wellside since buxton bath became famush and nobodys tumbler was oftener filled than mine till the week before last i was the happiest waterwench that ever dipped her glass in the well all the qallety knew me all the ladies loved me and all the gentlemen quarrelled which should drink first but matters are now altered and i am asheamed to take my stand at the place because of the baseness of your honors unhonest mr thomas  the arts he has used to tangle me and take away my wartue are monstrous and such as would make the stoutest she in the country stumble i am sure for my part i stood it till i could stand it no longer if your honor will hear me out and do me justis seeing as my character is gone and therewithal my water and with that my bread so that i have now neither bread nor water i will unfold everything and let your goodness see the affair from top to bottom  poor girl sit down sit down i am sorry for the loss of your water with all my heart and shall very cheerfully see as much of the affair as you drink proper to show me  sit down therefore child and show away  you must know sir as how when bathing and drinking the waters is over and your honor and suchlike fine folk are all busy adancing we servantpeople sometimes get together to a lesserrer room and have a little hop of our own this happened the very first night i saw mr thomas who i observed soon after he came into town walk round the well and then backwards and forwards and to be sure there was something in his putting his foot to the ground taking it off again swinging his arm flourishing his switch and saluting the fellow servants that made him look a king to the rest  well sir he chusd me for his partner and though i say it i can shake a foot with my betters nay at a countrydance i will turn my back neither to gentle nor simple  if your honor had heard the highfliers he crammed my poor head with all the while we were at it  the soft things he said while we led out  the wows he made as we handed up the middle  and the tender oaths and rodermuntadoes he swore while we right and left handed it or cast off and joined hands again  while at the same time the music struck up enough to melt ones heart  with candles lighted and in the summerseason  your honor would not blame me so much for giving away my soul and body to the most artfullest of his sect  in short sir he talked me over so finely about this and that that before i left the room and we broke up i did not know whether i stood upon my head or my heels  after dancing was over and mr thomas and i had made ourselves all of a heat or as i remembers he called it all of an ardor we took a walk in the grove by the hall to cool ourselves and there he began to flourish it again  overpowered me with such an ocean of lovesayings and in short talked so different from my old sweetheart roger dousit who is all dull and downright as i may say that i declares to your honor he at last made me think it would be a sin to refuse him and so  god forgive me  and so   and so  you did not refuse hey is that it   here the poor girl drew out her handkerchief and had sincerely a very great occasion for it  she told me in a tone thornton that touched me that if notwithstanding what thomas said she had been wicked she was a ruined woman that was all  that it might do very well for gentlefolks to play false with one another because they had got wherewithal to wash all white again but that a black spot in a poor woman who pended on her water  was never to be rubbed out  that moreover the news had somehow got air and she was pointed at by all the illnatured fingers in the place she said with astonishing simplicity that the man fairly overset her with his newfangled gibberish  but that she found twas all over with her she added that for her own part she did not so much mind it as she could turn her hand to anything and would leave the town in a twinkle but that she had an old mother that had been bedridden these eight months who lived at fairfield and who must now want bread as well as herself nay for that matter said the girl she will soon be provided for if she hears of my slip without troubling the parish for i shall soon break her heart i shall soon send my poor old mother out of the world for she is a good woman sir and would sooner bury me than see me what i am now dousit will turn up his nose at me now and without your honor makes mr thomas do me justis so as that i may become honest again and do it in the lawful way  god only knows what course i must take  she now dropped her tears thornton as fast to use the language of shakespeare as the arabian tree its medicinal gum at this very moment thomas came in with a message on which he had been dispatched  what is it thornton what cursed troublesome thing is it at once invisible and audacious that lodges in our bosoms beyond reach of our revenge to make the stoutest of us children and cowards  never did garrick exhibit or shakespeare describe such a look and attitude as that of poor tom at his entrance on observing so unexpected an object  he stammered he staggered he turned white and attempted to retreat  i commanded him to stay and taking my sword from the hook gave him his choice and one that might have puzzled a much wiser man  either to die or marry fear operated even so strong as to make him choose the latter  he fell on his knees and would have entered into explanations i would not hear them  the ceremony that hamlet uses with his quondam friends now passed between us and i made them both swear upon my sword  i promised them a dower  the woman was in extacy and paid me by such a look of gratitude that had reynolds been there he would have made the waterwench immortal by drawing it  i am above altercation of this thomas is aware nay i believe he likes the girl  they shall be united as soon as possible and what the devil can be the reason that i am more happy in putting these two people together than all the joys i ever tasted with the exquisite and yielding harriet i cannot tell  were it not that i have contrived as usual to get horace out of the way and that i never break an assignation i should certainly avoid seeing her or any body else this evening  is not this unaccountable but so it is  adieu philip sedley  letter lii thornton to sedley the story of thy bathmaid interested me strangely and i have felt the more pleasure in giving it a tear because i perceive it has penetrated even the almost invulnerable philip sedley  but how thou art able to stand the shock of so many radient eyes and yielded charms  wrapped round and round as thou art in the elysium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces  a young fellow of spirit too  is to me most unaccountably mysterious  in defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine dormer  in defiance of all empiricism  i should certainly break out and even at the risque of overturning the whole wellwoven web of gallantry dwindle into a downright inamerato and quite lose the subtle distinction betwixt simulation and laudible insincerity  and so thou had the supreme of transport in uniting thy faithless footman to the beautiful bathmaid  i will tell thee what sedley  thou art  if thou will allow me for once the coinage of a new word  thou art but half chesterfielded  the impression made upon thee by the pale face of the conscious thomas  the pleasure thou had at wiping away the drops of penitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of simplicity  and thy wishing to soliloquise and be excused even from the arms of the tempting and married harriet  are all symptoms totally unstanhopean there is another word for thee  take care sedley thou art upon the eve of a relapse  a relapse in favor not of dormer but of downright dousits singledealing  and yet my friend shall i once again confess to you my infirmity  my unestablishment in the maxims of thy preceptor  i cannot blame thy weaknesses nor can i  however destructive they may be to thy system  avoid wishing thou may continue thy present tendencies especially as by thy own honest confession thou have found more gratification in them than in supporting the toilsome task of eternal disingenuity  nor ought i indeed to call this a weakness in me if to be happy is the ultimatum of all earthly pursuits  if it is equally the effort of every different order of men it assuredly follows that that conduct is the most rational by which the greatest share of felicity is procured the closest application of human wit and wisdom can do no more than point out to thee the most solid degree of joy and it matters not whether that joy is obtained by the practice of one system or another  the last action thou have recorded i allude to the promised nuptials of thy bathmaid was evidently agreeable to the sentiments of seneca socrates and all the wise and good men both of the east and west and since the precepts of stanhope have been unable to give thee a superior or even an equal felicity how proper and consistent with right reason is it in me to advise thee to walk in that path wherein thou have found the most pleasure laugh not  ridicule not i beseech thee thou art not i hope so much a tool to the taste of the times  so much a dupe to prejudiced opinions  as to dislike even the balance of bliss which is now in thy favor merely because the scale has been turned by a worthy action  that would be insanity  to love duplicity and certain sophistical distinctions merely for the sake of doubledealing and when plain clear clean uncrooked honesty will answer thy purpose much better is at once ridiculous and diabolical  on the whole therefore i advise thee in the deliberation of my heart to substitute the aforesaid seneca or some other systematical moralist instead of stanhope and to lay him quickly aside in a corner of thy trunk as unqualified to confer the comfort he professes to administer  and indeed sedley to open my whole soul to thee i must own thee that i very much suspect his lordships sentiments even in my occasional dealings here in town since thy departure i have not been able to make them bear the test quite to my satisfaction such especially as relate to the suduction of the tender sex i made a slight experiment no longer ago than last night of his most favorite maxim namely to taste the joys of security mingled in embraces and yet though i do not think i conducted myself unadroitly it did not altogether answer the satisfaction he predicted to result from it  thou art not a stranger to the elegancies of sophia vernon the newmarried wife of the man whose promotion from ensign to lieutenant it was our joint endeavor some time ago to effect his gratitude is still  tremblingly alive all over and by a natural consequence he is without the least tincture of suspicion and esteems every instance of particular enquiry after his wife or friend as a mark of generosity in his benefactor  this leaves the way to an intimacy with his sophia fair and unobstructed and she has already caught so much of the lieutenants enthusiasm that she pays me the tribute of a rosyred blush of acknowledgment as often as i approach her they have lately purchased a pretty cottage amidst the vernal beauties of surry it is surrounded by gardens not cittish but genteel there are no nudities no monstrous urns no fantastical fountains no chubby cherubims no tiptoed mercurys smirking venusses nor spruce hollyhedges it is all true nature to advantage dressed the verdure is voluptuous the flowerbeds well weeded the shrubbery gratefully shaded and the alcove smiles upon the thames  within this alcove i yesterday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of sophia whose husband had invited me pressingly to make the solitude of his lady more social by my company as he was himself under the necessity of taking a journey into sussex  as you love brooks and books hills and rills my dear mr thornton said he smilingly you and sophy will be able to pass away your time to your mutual satisfaction till the return of your friend  poor unsuspicious pair  they united their entreaties and prevailed lieutenant vernon set out and left to thy friend in trust the most beautiful property upon the banks of the thames in a word he began his journey in the fragrant coolness of yesterdays evening and i was left at full liberty to abuse the confidence he placed in my integrity and in return for his hospitality do my utmost to destroy the chastity of her whom he doats upon with the sincerest tenderness  the tear which she dropped upon his hand as she kissed it at parting drew from him another accompanied by such a look as defies either tongue pen or pencil and went at the time so close to my heart that i could not but imagine the passion betwixt two was more exquisite than if it were divided betwixt twoandtwenty one man and one woman thought i may certainly be happier than a sultan and i had rather possess the real undissimulated love of a sophia vernon than command the keys of the seraglio  sophia remained pensive and sighed after the traveling lieutenant  i examined the little library for a book to entertain her chesterfield was there but i did not think it a proper book to read as i would wish to keep the maxims as far out of the sight of a female as possible for when a woman is told the secret of her seduction she will naturally be upon her guard against the seducer and really stanhope unfolds the art with such perspicuity that she who runs may read nay even thy footman comprehends the whole system and has according to thy account ruined his woman with a very tolerable address  by the by sedley i have to accuse thee of two weak pieces of conduct the first is thy rashness in trusting the epistles of thy preceptor to the flighty harriet who might have heedlessly shown them to horace by which means as thou art a very striking commentary upon the chapters of chesterfield he would have had a clue to the original sources of thy present conduct and a detection of this kind would have been totally insupportable thy other fault is thy carelessness and i might say want of policy in exposing the volumes which thou so pretendest to venerate to the plebeian eyes of thy valet lock them up i pray thee for the time to come and if thou art resolved to proceed in reducing them to practice do it privately  in regard to sophia my endeavors to divert her thoughts from the beloved subject of their contemplation were in vain the lieutenant mingled in every idea and she had passions sighs sentiments and sensations only for mr vernon i recited to her an elegy from hammond and she wept in the sincerity of her heart over images so amiable and so similar to those now suggested by her own situation i wished to divert her by reading to her the oddities of corporal trim and uncle toby but she was in no disposition to be delighted with the whimsical strokes of a fine but irregular wit i even adverted to the irresistible sallies of harry fielding and displayed to her the masterpiece of narrative in the laughable scene of parson adams pursued by the hounds and hunters she was proof even against this and afforded it only a faint smile she then tried what a walk in the garden would do she criticized the colors of the tulips and descanted with moral delicacy on the pleasing progress of vegetable nature but alas even here a sigh would break in upon her remark and very evidently convince me that pope was not so romantic in the pastoral sentiment which observes absence is surely death to those who love in short sedley whatever might be the temptation before me and however assiduous i was to gratify it it was not now the moment to begin the attack and everything i said only served to show me more plainly that if i would wish to please her it must be by talking warmly of a man whom it was my interest to wean from her affections perceiving this i gave way to sympathy and most cordially united my tears to hers and joined in the most animated encomiums on her happy lieutenant these tears however sedley and those praises gave me a soothing softness not to be described and made me feel a thousand times more agreeable than while i repressed them in the hope of turning my thoughts to the husbands dishonor and the wifes destruction is not this sedley a parallel case to that of thine if thou were more happy at doing a just action to thy bathmaid than at an unjust one by undoing the lively harriet i am more happy at having conquered an inclination which would have tormented my own fancy tortured a generous trusting friend and agonized the bosom of a woman whose reputation is at present unsuspected and unpolluted  hence then my dear sedley it appears that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a similar sensation  a sensation created by the social virtues and derived purely from the felicity of others upon this subject i have but one point to observe it is to continue the triumph let us even cherish a transport which is superior to any that dissimulation can give let us throw away the perplexing mask of the casuistical chesterfield let us walk in the right way and since it has already rewarded us so well let us prefer truth to falsehood and honesty to hypocrisy for believe me my dear dear sedley under whatever name we may distinguish vice and virtue they remain eternally the same and neither sophistry nor subtlety nor fashion nor the sanctified follies of the mode can possibly palliate the atrociousness of the one or detract from the native excellence of the other penmen may puzzle philosophers may refine poets may color and visionaries may suggest as they please but while the traces of nature remain virtue will be fair and vice deformed and in my opinion that mans maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible who in the same volume nay sometimes in the same epistle inculcates a delicate regard to moral character and an attack upon those human weaknesses from the humouring of which assisted by a proper mixture of wellapplied flattery we are to prey upon each other to prepare ourselves for deceit and if the system were general introduce by these means even while we sanctify them the most dangerous delusions for my part sedley i tell thee again and again that i find a flaw in thy stanhope and shall read him for the future with the eye of a severe critic and not an idolater  not a philip sedley  farewell j thornton  letter lii sedley to thornton prior to his receipt of the last letter the ceremony has been performed i insisted on its being done in the face of the congregation i gave thomas a purse for his weddingdinner and so the poor wench is again made an honest woman  never heard i panegyrics more warm or better circulated than those reverberated from lip to lip upon this occasion and i could almost bless the fellow for a debauchery that has added such luster to my character i am the very ballad of the bath and the negligence which i seem to pay to the praises only serves to increase and make me appear more deserving of them but what a simpleton i was in yielding to the baby sensation which seized me unawares in my last to do good is indeed pleasing and i will on that principle continue to do it as occasion invites but is there not an higher motive thou will say than this  is there not religion pshaw   yes pious thornton there is a higher motive it flatters the senses it gratifies vanity it procures eclat it promotes conquest it extends our triumph over a sex that was born for our amusement  the trifling action just recorded backed by a few more that i have not patience to recite has made me so popular amongst all ranks of people in this village from my lady in her bathingshift to her attendants of the towel that i defy anything but my own folly to mark me as an object of suspicion  i have established my reputation thornton upon the solid basis of virtuous actions i have decorated the superstructure with the graces of conduct and now no man will dare to imagine this goodly edifice is but a whitened sepulcher possibly thou may imagine that i have earned my pleasures by difficult adoption of the stanhopean system no thornton i have a taste for them i do not inflict excesses upon myself because i think them genteel but i find these pursuits guard me against frivolousness and prevent me from throwing away upon trifles that time which only important things deserve in a word i tell thee once more i view the lord of my idolatry only as a man more skilled than myself in the arts of being truly happy and in this light he deserves my everlasting gratitude for he has taught me to make every place i go to the scene of quick and lively transports to let every company i frequent gratify my passions to know the true value of time and to snatch seize and enjoy every moment of it  of this enough the remainder of my letter shall be dedicated to the delicious purpose of recording several events which have fallen out by the joint effort of destiny and contrivance since my last  i have had a second glance at the delicate but decaying features of fanny tempted by the cheerfulness of the morning she ventured under the supporting arms of a husband and sister to walk from her lodgings to the bathinghouse she saw me but drew away her eye and never directed it toward me again her husband bowed to me as to the polite stranger who had interested himself so much in the welfare of his beloved the sister inclined her head and curtesyd more than civilly  it was the bend rather of attention than ceremony  at this moment many a lankhaired swain yet humid with the bath and a cluster of women still glowing from the immersion appeared in view they were instantly attracted by the meteor gazed envied and passed on well indeed might they gaze  well might they envy thornton the rose again emulates the lilly in her cheek the blue is like the blue of the elements her arm is animated alabaster and the hand to which it belongs is shaped to inspire by its appearance and enfever by its touch  after this as she was preparing to return a servant came hastily to inform mr mortimer that sir henry delmore was arrived they quickened their pace a little even fanny attempted to step briskly but failed in the effort the good baronet was impatient and eager to behold his children came forward in his boots to meet them  oh thornton what a figure  how noble how venerable how fashionable  but alas all surprises even those of the most pleasing kind are too much for the feeble situation of fanny her father soon saw her confusion softened it by a paternal kiss and assisted in conducing her home to her lodgings in something less than an hour i received the enclosed which is the luckiest incident in the world to me and which by the time this reaches you i hope to improve to some purpose  harriet homespun is fonder of me and better bred to horace than ever she has a wonderful aptitude to learn and will in time be no doubt a female stanhope what a lucky thing it is for us that horace has so great an appetite for a long walk by himself after dinner and how infinitely is he and indeed ought he to be obliged to me for administering so much consolation to his wife in his absence  surely thornton there is nothing so grateful as serving a friend  adieu philip sedley  letter live sir henry delmore to philip sedley esquire enclosed in the above sir i am made truly happy at least as much so as the present situation of my family will admit to hear that i am again likely to be honored by the company of a gentleman to whose society i am already indebted for so much pleasure it is no small addition sir to this pleasing expectation to find that the many friendly enquiries that have from time to time been made concerning the health of my poor fanny proceeded from the very man to whom the father of that beautiful invalid owed so many agreeable hours at scarborough  but how ceremonious was it mr sedley that you should all this while have estranged yourself and appeared only in the light of a person interested in the fate of the sick but not allied to the parent of that dear unfortunate by any closer or warmer reciprocations of a former friendship  i know for my part of but one way to excuse this punctilious behavior and that is your embracing the first hour of your leisure to join your hand with that of sir  your most obedient and most humble servant h delmore  letter lv the reverend horace homespun to doctor diggory dear doctor what can possibly be the reason of your so long silence i now want your advice on a momentous subject  the time of my sojourning at this wateringplace is expired my curacy can no longer be deserted and i must return to it at all events on saturday or the duty of the sabbath must be neglected  notwithstanding this mrs homespun again complains of her ancle and says the anguish of it is now got higher than her knee and she is therefore resolved to undergo the operation of pumping upon the part affected by which means i shall be obliged to leave her behind or else bring her away much against her own choice which notwithstanding my want of faith as to the knee and ancle i do not think myself entitled to do seeing that she has demeaned herself most cordially the fact is she is quite in love with the frivolous pleasures of this puerile place in which were it not for the instructive and entertaining conversations of my friend sedley i should not be able to support its customs as my wife however seems resolved i have thought of an expedient to supply my absence for a few days longer harriet has a friend in our neighborhood  a mrs la motte  who is a very discreet sensible and judicious widowwoman and who i am persuaded will not only do me the service of passing a few days at the bath but likewise urge all the arguments of which she is mistress to wean the affections of her friend from this circle of vanity and reduce her once more to the standard of commonsense and the serene pleasures of a countryvillage  i want your council my dear doctor on the following subject mr sedley has applied in my favor to the bishop of  respecting the living of  which is worth near  00l per annum mr sedley is in hourly expectation of a reply to this and i am already so overwhelmed with the kindnesses of this worthy gentleman who has done them in a manner peculiar to his character that i am in doubt whether i ought to increase a debt it will be ever beyond my ability to discharge harriets little fortunes united to the profits of my curacy are sufficient to the purposes of a contented mind my parsonage you know doctor is in the very bosom of a beautiful wood through which i have been accustomed to ramble with a social classic in my hand my parishioners love me the little garden is of my own cultivation i turned the arch and twisted the woodbines around my bower with my own fingers the birds are protected and nest with me in perfect security and if i could but once make harriet in love with it again i believe i should not quit it without a sigh but one circumstance weighs with me i have the dear prospect of a successor to it i owe an interest i should not feel for myself harriet is very far advanced in her pregnancy a child my dear friend enlarges the wishes of a father a tear is ready to fall on my letter as i think upon the increase of my family to his offspring a man owes every thing tell me then dear diggory what i must do  farewell i am yours horace homespun  letter lvi sedley to thornton the plot begins to thicken and the catastrophe only demands good contrivance to be made delightful horace homespun goes away from the bath today in order to mount the rostrum and preach up the good old cause tomorrow harriet will be all this evening with me alone left wholly to my kindness and to crown the whole the scheme is at last laid to bring the haughtyhearted la motte within the reach of my machinations if there needs any further addition to these felicities know thornton that i am hand and glove with sir henry delmore and hand and heart i shall soon be with fanny mortimer the enchanting delia looks not with eye inverted and mortimer himself has made advances to intimacy under these circumstances thou will not expect that i can attend to thy long epistolary sermon which i herewith reinclose thee for a present to the parson of thy parish against the death of mrs arabella thy grandam when it will afford many admirable hints for the funeral oration of that pious and puritanical old lady  whenever thou sendest such a string of commonplace proverbs depend upon receiving them again and always with the charge of double postage so take the hint and thank me for the warning  adieu philip sedley  letter lvii miss delia delmore to lady lucy saxby what an additional degree of happiness do i feel since i last wrote to my beloved lady lucy my father is arrived my sister is recovering and we are become acquainted with a man whose company is at once pleasing instructive and various the very gentleman my dear lucy who has so frequently sent his polite cards of enquiry concerning fanny proves to be a man of birth rank and character and wellknown both to sir henry and mr mortimer when they were last season at the bath of scarborough he is the most wellbred and complaisant character in the world and has at the first interview all the ease firmness and unembarrassed air of an old acquaintance the assured yet modest manner with which he presents himself to a company shows plainly that he has been long accustomed to fashionable societies and would charm you if fanny continues to recover we shall be once more a joyful family  my mother is also down with us  we have taken part of a very elegant house only a short ride from the company about three miles distant from buxton and it stands upon a spot infinitely less bleak and barren than the uncomfortablelooking mountains that surround the bath i received the welcome epistle dear lucy in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of absence in a correspondence of wisdom wit sentiment and affection but does not my fair friend forget that the requisites to form and to continue such an intercourse are not at the command of every scribbler though the partiality of nature and the polish of highbreeding may confer them on herself however since you are so earnest with me i will pour out my soul imperfectly upon paper and though i may be wanting in point of elegance or accuracy the deficiencies will be compensated by a frankness of mind and an undisguise of sentiment that will pay a better compliment to my lucys candor than all that could possibly be bestowed by the flowers of rhetoric or colorings of the imagination  i the more readily yield to your urgencies my lucy as my pen at this period can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtuous and endearing  it is said indeed that mankind have always some fantastical and visionary scheme in view i declare to you lady saxby that the perfect restoration of fannys health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our domestic joy judge yourself for the visible alteration of mrs mortimer for the better has put me into such spirits that i cannot restrain my gratitude to the dear personages by which those spirits are inspired take then my beloved lucy the sketch of a familypicture drawn and yet not partially by the pencil of a relation  the first and principal figure in this group is a father whose mind is the repository of every virtue  a repository in which he has been from hour to hour in the career of almost threescore years laying up something valuable till he has at length stored it with every excellence with all lucy that can give worth to the husband softness to the parent solidity to the friend benevolence to the neighbor and humanity to the man to which is added a universal attention to the wants and complaints the fortunes and morals of that prodigious body of men to which he is related only by sameness of species and the conscious ties of the christian and fellow creature  the second leading object in the piece is a mother the model of her husband and differing only by adapting the manly virtues to a delicacy more consistent with the refinement and gentleness of the female character and nature  the third figure to which i would direct your observation is the still lovely fanny mortimer  a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering months passed in the languors of sickness have not rendered unattracting to a spirit at once wise and worthy she superadds the finest politeness gentleness uncommon and meekness peculiar to her and to these again are joined a taste elegant and simple  an understanding enlarged and cultivated  and a face in defiance of distemper in which heaven seems to have painted an attribute in every feature her eye sparkles benignity her lips are the temples of truth her cheeks are the emblems of modesty veiled in roses and her hands were formed by the graces to the best of purposes  to charm by their liberality the wretched into peace and to be consistently with their color the pure and beautiful stewards of a heart tender as a turtles yet solid as a sages  the husband of this enchanting creature is the brother of lady saxby the very counterpart of his sister and the very youth whom sir henry delmore adopted as the child of his affection undertook for several years the direction of his education supplied the loss of a father trained him up for his own and at last gave him allaccomplished to the only woman that could deserve him  his daughter his character is recorded in most of the european courts and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for me to say that he has been every where distinguished for bravery without rashness honor without ancestral pride elegance without vanity affection without interestedness and generosity without ostentation  such lucy are the outlines of a picture now under the eye of your friend your absence however and fannys uncertain state of health are the two dark clouds that overcast my otherwise radiant horizon  in some measure however to atone for these indispensible drawbacks i can now promise an oftenrepeated intercourse in which through the kind medium of the post our pleasures with those of our families shall be reciprocated  but  in the the name of extravagance where am i rambling  and what a metaphorical rhapsody am i going to send let me hasten then to assure you that in all dispositions of mind i am with a tenderness peculiar to the truth of my attachment  your affectionate delia delmore  letter lviii sedley to thornton the fates surely are busied in contriving matters precisely as i would have them  the delmores are removed to a villa at some distance from buxton by which means i shall be able to prevent opposite interests from clashing with each other  i prithee thornton mark my policy to which i have even at the age of thirty sacrificed my passion knowing the little scandals and fugitive whispers of a wateringplace i practiced upon myself the stanhopean selfdenial and have not been a single minute alone with harriet since the departure of horace i contrive to call in either the loquacious landlord or chattering landlady and only conversed in their own way upon topics too trivial to send thee one hundred and sixty miles but which answered very well my purpose for strange as it may seem to thee i hold it not good policy or right reason to have a teteatete with a wife when her husband is known to have left the town nor am i very well pleased with the incautious harriet for suffering herself to be deserted and exposed to the report and murder of the moment for in these places where detraction is a necessary fillerup of the vacuum at every word a reputation dies and i would not be thought a libertine either in thought word or deed for the universe it is expressly and flagrantly against my system which thou know places the very perfection of human nature and the height of human abilities in being upon our own guard and yet by a seeming natural openness to put people off theirs  now in cases of amor it is in conformity to this principle absolutely necessary that a husband should be upon the premises though not upon the spot otherwise there is no possibility of avoiding mystery and mystery occasions suspicion and suspicion opens a door to detection and detection ruins me for ever the ordinary rake thou know piques himself upon this nay circulates it at the expense of his truth he talks of transports that he never knew and fancies raptures that he never felt but the pupils of chesterfield are not such rude vainglorious boasters they are to preserve their moral sanctity even in the midst of what gownsmen call violation not only of good report but like the purity of caesars wife unsuspected  oh may this ingenuity and wellacted dissimulation ever keep me from being blown upon and to this end may i never withdraw the dear veil that keeps me apparently pure one moment from my heart may i ever possess the ingenuous exterior with the reserved interior may i never reject as troublesome or useless the mastery of my temper and above all other things may i always possess myself enough to hear and see every thing without any visible change of countenance may no man living ever be able to decypher the secret of my heart and yet may i keep the key of every other heart in the universe and to conclude my prayer let hypocrisy place before me her shield under which i may fight my foolish antagonist for ever guarded and for ever victorious  and indeed thornton i perceive the adroitest practice of these several points suggested by the matchless dormer will be shortly necessary for never did i enter so sagacious or so uniformly amiable a family as that of the delmores  the principal of it sir henry is so acute so adorned so read so experienced that he must i perceive be deceived with a delicacy even beyond the deceptions of belial and i wonder i did not lay myself open to discovery when at scarborough at a time that i was a novice in the ways of stanhope and could not be supposed to copy him liberally but my good genius preserved me and i engaged the hand of the father and struck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter  then there is a formidable husband in my way  no horace homespun  but a man of travel experience taste  a second sister too  the lively delia  a wit a corresponder a perfect penwoman and to close the list a venerable matron  wise  virtuous  penetrating  the lady president of this bewitching association  what of that if they are not versed as i believe they are not in my maxims i may be a match for all of them pass like a meteor through this difficult hemisphere  kindle as i go  and dread no radiant competitor  as to harriet  the affair is over nothing is left even for the exercise of my talents the precept by which i obtained her has been successful in practice all that remains is iteration her fondness grows luxuriant and she may betray me to confess the truth thornton  i am indifferent to her and i wish horace had her locked in his arms to eternity with all my soul  at all events she must not entertain such ardent expectations  for  i am summoned elsewhere  a scene of greater difficulty greater delicacy and greater delight expands itself before me  the halfconquered  halfexpiring fanny mortimer who must not descend unenjoyed by sedley to the earth  the worm thornton must not be suffered to riot on her beauties twould be a pity  a profanation the exquisite and vivacious delia also attracts my notice i am called to the combat and i must exert every nerve to triumph in the combat of which the laurels will be trebly precious since i perceive they must be earned with all the artillery of manner address and assurance  in pursuance of these objects i shall probably be often animated into the wish of enjoyments that it may be impolitic to push too far till every thing is ripe for the coup de grace  in such exigences it is difficult to keep the rein in my hand the warmth of imagination and an acquaintance with objects and situations calculated to fire it seem inconsistent with the necessary coolness and command of my temper to provide therefore against these moments of ardour i shall if la motte comes down retain the enamoured harriet in my train as the agreeable resource from the agitations in which it is likely i shall be thrown by the charms delays or impediments of the delmores possibly too something may fall out to reduce la motte which be her personal endowments what they may is desirable because she is prepared to suspect my principles and therefore will engage my more serious attention till she shall have little reason to ridicule or laugh at her friend  but on the other hand if this la motte does not move at the injunction of horace nor at the pretended penitence of the letterloving harriet and by these means harriet should be left to herself she must absolutely return to the bosom of the poor pedant and i will assuredly sacrifice the possession of her person to the unblemished security of my character which i am aware must inevitably suffer by being avowedly the cicisbeo of a wife little distinguished amongst the bathers and waterbibbers of fashion  if indeed she had been blessed with a sallow damsel for a sister or a prudent gentlewoman for her aunt it might have been another matter but i again repeat it to you that in a place like this in this sneaking inquisitive country of britain it is to all intents and purposes requisite for the security of my system that there should be some third person in a family by way of screen and rather than have our mistresses alone that is unprotected by some ostensible he or she that is answerable for them in the parish where they visit or where they reside it is better for our plan of action that we are sheltered under the withered wing of a maiden cousin of a centurys standing or even of the greatgrandmother herself  and now thornton for a word or two on thy own affairs if thou have not by this time surmounted the ticklings of thy conscience and taken possession of that tender tenement which thy friend the lieutenant left to thee thou deservest to be for ever discarded  what have thou an angel in earths mould is she in a wilderness of sweets art thou invited by a bed of roses art thou neither in fear of being blasted by detection nor of incurring the prattle of a single gossip of either sex seeing that thou art in a retirement perfectly shaded by a shrubbery of perfumes and apart from a second house and is the good man of the house gone a long journey into a far country  is all this in the way of propitiating thy advances masked as i presume they would be in the fine veil of modesty manner and firmness each like copartners whose interest it is to promote commonright in the same business assisting the other and do thou after all boggle at a shadow  a maukin  at conscience  admitting even all thy wishes crowned with success  where is the mischief thou do not despoil her the lieutenant is ignorant of what is granted as of what was never attempted the stanhope scheme of fruition suffers us not to do any real injury to individuals singly or to the community collectively we are neither to betray the wife nor to call the husband the cuckold we have had the honor to make him nor to breathe an accent that may lead to the remotest suspicion in some cases thornton this system is of the utmost service under the stanhopean restrictions i mean both to our king and country  how many puny striplings are there who cannot do the common rights of nuptial justice to the unhappy creatures that either interest or folly has chained them to for life in that instance it is ours to bestow as a favor what the husbands cannot discharge as a duty  on the other hand how many miserable pairs are there sighing for an heir to an unweildy estate which must in default of issue devolve to the next fool or driveller in descent there again we are patriots of the first order do we not provide a successor and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life  nay even supposing the husband enabled to provide for himself while our system dictates so inviolable a secrecy while the joys of it are not invaded by distemper and they can never be granted without the prior consent of the wife  and such consent implies that such variety is necessary to her happiness  no injury can in effect be incurred his own offspring we cannot destroy and ours will be considered as legitimate and not be exposed like the byblows of the rake to the scorn desertion and illfortunes of bastardy so that view the system of chesterfield on which side soever you will it is a system of policy prudence pleasure goodfellowship and right reason  great length of paper and much time have i stolen from more agreeable pursuits to illustrate this to thee and if it move thee not thou art altogether impenetrable and not deserving so sublime a friend as the immaculate  philip sedley  end of the first volume
