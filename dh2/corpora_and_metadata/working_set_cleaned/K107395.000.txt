the monument a poem sacred to the immortal memory of the best and greatest of kings william the third king of great britain etc  quo nihil majus meliusve terris fata donavere bonique divi nec dabunt quamvis redeant in aurum tempora priscum horat carm lib   by mr dennis  london printed for d brown at the blackswan and bible without temple bar and a bell at the crosskeys and bible in cornhil mdccii  to the most noble and mighty prince william duke of devonshire lord steward of her majestys household and knight of the most noble order of the garter etc my lord if the following poem had been written by a person who had a genius equal to the subject it would in a peculiar manner have belonged to your grace for to whom should a poet sooner address the praises of a king who will be eternally glorious for the restoring and maintaining our liberties and the common liberties of europe than to your grace who has always appeared so great a defender of them and has ventured and done and suffered for them more than any subject in england the ardent love of liberty and of your country are some of the many heroic qualities which you have inherited from your noble ancestors and some of the many which your grace has the happiness to see derived from your noble self by the other hope of your august family the wisdom foresight resolution and greatness of soul that the brave lord candish so constantly showed in the last parliaments of k charles the second will never be forgotten as long as an englishman remains alive even then when it was esteemed by some an unpardonable crime to be thought one even then your grace and that illustrious friend whose memory shall always be dear to all the faithful lovers of their country both of you heroically dared to appear at the head of englishmen resolved to assert their privileges he gloriously sealed the love of his country with his blood but even after the loss of the best of friends your grace perseverd with an undaunted spirit in the noble cause of liberty nor could the just grief which you paid to his memory hinder you from paying that duty which you owed to your country which has always deservedly been your first affection if some other persons at that time would have entered into the wisdom of both your counsels you your selves had saved us without the help of the king your noble friend as your graces self had been one of the living ornaments of your delivered country and there had been no need of the revolution nor perhaps of the long war that succeeded it it was neither his nor your graces fault that you were not then sufficiently seconded and consequently that you did not save these nations all that blood and treasure which the war has cost them but when afterward things were brought to that extremity that a revolution was absolutely necessary no man did more than your grace toward the bringing it about and working our deliverance that way your grace was then the most glorious instrument of establishing the best of kings upon the throne of england and defending her present majesty at so dangerous a juncture as that of the revolution she wisely thought that she could have no where recourse to a better place for her safety than where your grace was known to direct by your counsels and to animate by your courage the brave assertors of liberty  i have a long time designed to lay something of mine at your graces feet that it might live and grow and flourish under so illustrious a patronage but the awe that i stood in of the force of your judgment and the fineness of your discernment made me wait for this opportunity for i know very well that i either ought never to approach you this way at all or to do it when i can be most secure of my self and tho what i offer you now is far from meriting so high a protection yet i have less mistrust of it than of any thing i have done in poetry besides the design and the immortal subject may supply in some measure the weakness of my performance for i am confident that your grace will not refuse to grant that protection to the vindication of the kings memory which the king at your graces request granted to the rights and privileges of every englishman i am  my lord your graces most humble most dutiful and most obedient servant john dennis  the preface the following poem was writ without any manner of design of obliging or offending a party for in all my lifetime i never designed either to please or offend any and was always of opinion that he who makes his court to any is sure to do it to the wrong for if all men were for the public good there never could be any party because a patriot designs the good of his country but one of a party intends his own  the following poem was writ with an intention to do what service i could to my country at this conjuncture which as mr waller has truly observed is a duty incumbent upon the muses friend  the muses friend unto himself severe with silent pity looks on all that err but if a great a public action shines that he rewards with his immortal lines whether it be in council or in fight his countries honor is his chief delight praise of great acts he scatters as a seed which may the like in coming ages breed this is certain that the late king delivered us from a deplorable state now we who were once in a condition to want deliverer may hereafter be in such a condition again for who has happened may happen but since as mr waller observes most heroes are incited to the noble acts they perform by a desire of praise who will be at the trouble to save or defend people so ungrateful as to refuse them that  i desire that the reader would take two cautions along with him the one that he would not interpret that love of libety which will be found in the following poem for an aversion monarchy for liberty is as consistent with the government of one as with that of a thousand the other is that he would by no means mistake the reflections upon the army which he dutch had in      for a satyr upon the nation in general for i have a long time known the dutch to be a vaiant a wise and a great people and their country to be one of the strongest bulwarks of the liberties of europe  if any one happens to wonder that i have employed so many verses in describing the battle of seneffe without dwelling afterward upon any other of the glorious actions of the king as the battle of mons or that of the boyn or the siege of namur i desire him to consider that in descriptions of all fights there is something resembling and by consequence that one such description for so short a work is enough and that from among all the actions of the king i chose the battle of seneffe because of the brave army opposed to him and the great prince of conde who headed them and because it is the greatest of all the actions in which the king or perhaps any other captain ever has been engaged and above all because the success of the allies was undeniably due to the kings valor and conduct  the following poem was writ with a design of showing the king and not my self and written in the language not of the head but the heart it is written in blank verse and not in ryme not only because i thought that the former would give me the more liberty but for several other reasons which will offer themselves immediately to all who are judges of poetry and which signify nothing to the rest i will only put the reader in mind that mr milton looked upon ryme as a bondage and my lord roscommon and mr dryden as a barbarity mr milton tells us in his preface to paradise lost that ryme is trivial to judicious ears and of no true musical delight and mr dryden in his verses before the essay upon translated verse that poetry flourished in greece and rome till barbarous nations and more barbarous times debased the majesty of verse to rymes mr dryden threw it off in dramatick poetry as mr milton had done in heroic and as my lord roscommon would have done if he had lived to write any more of which the following lines in the essay upon translated verse may be sufficient to satisfy us  of many faults ryme is perhaps the cause too true to ryme we slight more useful laws for that in greece or rome was never known till by barbarian deluges oerflown subdued undone they did at last obey and change their own for their invaders way i grant that from some mossy idol oak in double rymes our thor and woden spoke and by succession of unlearned times as bards began so monks rung on the chimes but now that phoebus and the sacred nine with all their beams on our blessed island shine why should not we their ancient rites restore and be what rome or athens were before o may i live to hail the glorious day and sing loud peans through the crowded way when in triumphant state the british muse true to herself shall barbarous aid refuse and in the roman majesty appear which none no better and none come so near from what has been said it is plain that three of our poets who have been deservedly celebrated for the fineness of their ears have condemned and exploded ryme not only as an enemy to art and a clog to genius and a debaser of the majesty of verse but as a thing of barbarous sound and contrary to true musical delight and i am confident that those three gentlemen if they had been alive would have been pleased to have seen in the following poem an attempt to second that generous design which the first of them began and which the two others approved of a design to shake off a barbarous custom and to show the harmony of our mother tongue contrary to vulgar received opinion above that of our neighbors the french which is utterly incapable of producing any thing like poetical music without the assistance of ryme  the monument a poem sacred to the immortal memory of william the third what sudden damp has seized upon my soul why are my spirits chilled my nerves unbent why am i sad as is the mournful grave as if i never should know comfort more sure conscious nature gives presage that death the tyrant whom she most abhors draws near ah woe it is now too plain for a worse death has happened than alas thou fondly thought a death in which the ruined worlds concerned a death attended with the fate of nations too plain alas i hear the doleful sound the good the great the godlike williams dead gone is his mighty mind for ever flown and naught but his immortal name remains gone is great providences watchful viceroy gone the great soul that watched the christian world as the good faithful shepherd does his sheep against the prowlings of the nightly wolf who shall now guard us from the bloody foe mourn then my soul the irreparable loss and with thee summon human kind to mourn with them too summon even the immortal powers thou first and chief forlorn britannia mourn and with thee let thy faithful sons keep time for thou and they and all have lost in him a champion benefactor father friend thou next batavia fallen batavia mourn o let thy eyes dissolve into a stream for thou have lost  o what have thou not lost thy bulwark thy defense thy lofty mound that kept out lawless arbitrary power which like the ocean now surrounds thy towers with dreadful inundation threatnng all evrop a beautiful in sadness mourn thy father thy defenders from thee torn and now the lustful bestial god once more has loudly threatened thee with shameful rape with thee let all thy royal sons lament those martial sons that were with william joined in the great cause of godlike liberty who shall your several interests now unite and thou celestial charmer liberty daughter of wisdom and of supreme jove sister of reason and of sovereign law now goddess beat thy beauteous breasts and rend the flowing ringlets of thy golden hair to mourn thy mighty benefactors fate for williams fate o liberty was thine thou and religion here have room no more and thou the darling daughter of the skies divine religion thou whose melting eyes have always like perpetual fountains streamed to mourn the offenses of a sinful world o let them pour a deluge now of tears to wail the dismal consequence of sin to mourn great williams and thy flight to heaven he was thy lover and thy best beloved he was thy champion and thy sole defense against the tyrants both of earth and hell his flaming zeal o goddess roused thy friends his charming accents gained thy very foes to fight o goddess and to die for thee and ye o angels and archangels all guardians of mighty kingdoms and of kings who could your cares on williams breast repose who could your several charges all to him resign while happily aloft ye towerd and cut with golden wings your blissful heaven now mourn his flight to the pure realms of day and mourn your own return to a bad world for he is to your upper regions flown who equal to your selves your cares below supplied then mourn o earth and mourn ye heavens your spheres to melting airs y intelligences tune his godlike souls for ever from us flown whose zeal could the divided earth unite whose wondrous zeal united earth and heaven but let there be such lamentation here as never was known for any fate before and let the grief be general as the loss for human kind has lost by williams death his people most his first and chiefest care he was the tender father to his people a friend and brother to the rest of kings alas few kings are friends or meet with friends a benefactor to the race of men sure twas some angel who forsook the skies and out of wondrous love to wretched men vouchsaf d to dwell in human shape below for all his lifetime he from place to place removed dispensing benefits to all and from their gates the grand destroyer drove for that alone he moved he spoke he thought as if the important business of his life had been to sacrifice his own felicity to that of wretched men his great design extended to his most inveterate foes he blessed even them and would have done them good because his foes were still his fellow creatures from one divine original derived his foes his justice and his mercy knew and his inviolable faith as firm as are the unchangeable decrees of fate for tho the wondrous goodness of his soul made him still sympathize in all our joys and mourn and suffer in the woes we feel tho he found something in his godlike mind that answered to the cries of the distressed and gave him anguish till they found relief which was the source of all his wondrous deeds and which distinguished his heroic life and set him far above all vulgar heroes yet was his word so sacred and so sure he would not break it to preserve a world but when your vulgar heroes we survey we find them the abhorred reverse of this they by the fever of ambition fired run frantickly about the frighted world and think to grow by mighty mischiefs great while horror marches in their dreadful van and death and slaughter in their bloody rear whole towns they plunder lay whole countries waste with grinding want they make vast kingdoms pine but their own kingdoms into deserts turn where famine lords it in its wild domain for their own kingdoms loudest cry to heaven and loudest under their oppression groan if they make doubtful peace or hollow truce it is but for time to wage more dangerous war to weaken and divide their thoughtless foes and lull them by security to fate to friends deceitful faithless to allies perfidious perjured to their inborn slaves revengeful cruel bloody to mankind a sea of guiltless blood they spill a sea of helpless widows and of orphans tears destroy their enemies their subjects more their subjects chiefly feel their barbarous hands for mad with rage their enemies they tear but their poor subjects coolly they destroy o fruitless labor of fantastic pride for while they thus would more than men appear their breach of faith the wrongs they do each hour their hateful violences make them less only by fools and impious men admired abhorred by god by all good men despised too faithful copies of their proud original the great destroyer and the foe of men the first and grand artificer of fraud the powerful prince of all the infernal powers mighty to act sagacious to contrive who with capacious comprehensive thought sits brooding over his dark and damned design of captivating all the race of men and fixing universal monarchy which he sometimes with violence and rage sometimes with lies and hellborn arts pursues his foes sometimes with open force invades but most with secret practice undermines and sows dissensions to divide their strength a dreadful and a dangerous foe to all but sure perdition to his fastest friends and his allies are lost as are his slaves who in infernal pains for ever howl thus earthly heroes copy him of hell those tyrants whom the thoughtless world calls heroes such was not happy william but a friend to men and servant of the most supreme the chief and godlike purpose of his soul was the restoring quiet order peace and universal happiness to men and like a faithful servant to advance his masters universal great design his master would have all his creatures blessed he loves the miserable sons of men and with a love so ardent and so high as never can be thought be finite man next his was williams love to all his kind for fiends and tyrants only were his foes and tyrants he esteemed no longer men as cursed fiends are angels now no more fallen from their natures and their names by pride he hated both to both a mortal foe because they dared to impeach his godlike purpose for they make wretched all whom they make slaves for what can be so dismal as to see our lives our fortunes nay our every action nay even our virtue and divine religion all in a feverish frantic tyrants power and to his boundless passions all exposed he looked with indignation and disdain upon the aspiring vain presumptuous wretch who thought it great tenslave his fellow creatures dogs were not made to be controlled by dogs nor horses over horses to insult they rule not one another nor ought man to control man but god is to command who governs still by reason and by law he loves the sons of men and leaves them free as free as is his own almighty power for he himself makes reason still his guide and swerves not from his own eternal laws since our great maker then has left us free on whom we so immediately depend in whom we live and move and even exist kings who are gods vicegerents too must leave those who are under their subjection free and govern them by reason and by law for tho like gods they are honored they are men and they must die like men so william ruled and looked with anger and with just disdain upon the vain the mortal dying wretch who dares to make them slaves whom god makes free who by his lawless boundless passions sways and sacrifices to his lust of power a thousand greater worthier than himself for such are all the good and truly wise which is renouncing reasons sacred rule subverting the awful government of god deposing even the worlds perpetual king as far as lies within a mortals power to assert the direful government of hell for if good kings are gods vicegerents sure a tyrant is hells viceroy and as such a christians bound by his baptismal vow against him to denounce perpetual war so william did and seemed designed by fate to assert the awful government of god and liberty of man and never did heaven nor fate do more for mortal man than him in giving him the will to undertake and power to execute the vast design and never was it known that mortal man more noble more heroic deeds performed than william in the cause of god and liberty the glaring actions which the world calls great from passion chiefly not from virtue flow and of all passions from ambition most pride which such dangerous ravage wrought in heaven among the immortal spirits of the blessed may well destroy our frail felicity may well cause dreadful revolutions here to pride the illustrious romans owed their fame their quarrels still were specious seldom just yet not the greatest first of romans caesar darling of story paramour of fame of whom she doting talks and never is tired to satisfy ambition ere performed deeds which displayed such greatness in the man as what great william did for liberty methinks ye friends to arbitrary sway at this great paradox i see you smile but hear ye wretched slaves to opinion hear and then determine this important cause caesar acquired his greatest share of fame against the gauls who were our williams foes but caesar fought with them divided weak doubtful in counsel and in action slow false to each other traitors to themselves and the great cause of dying liberty no captain at their head like mighty coesar versed in the noble science of the field the dexterous art of fortifying camps or ranging numerous armies in array no brave experienced officers to form their troops undisciplined and rude to war their soldiers and commanders all grown faint dejected spiritless with frequent routs all dead and senseless to that noble fire that to illustrious acts inflames the brave under these disadvantages lay france in what condition was great caesar then mature in years by long experience wise awful for eloquence and martial deeds leading the flower of romes victorious legions backed and supported by the conquered world valiant his soldiers skilful disciplined experienced their commanders wise and brave and soldiers and commanders romans all inured to dangers made by custom bold exalted spirited with long success all eager in the burning chase of fame all faithful and united under caesar and he supreme and absolute over all yet with all these advantages great caesar ten tedious years consumed in conquering france and now the glory of his conquest shares if the distributors of fame are just with his wise valiant his victorious friends nay and with fortune with his very foes for false and traitors to the common cause their country basely they betrayed and sold we ve shown what caesar did for pride behold what william for fair liberty performed and the actions in an equal balance lay twas in the fatal and recorded year in which batavia the defense and mound of faith of right of sinking liberty batavia like the native land of jove proud of a hundred formidable towns whose lofty bulwarks and whose stately towers are to the storms of arbitrary power what its digues are to the tempestuous main for the wild roaring torrent they restrain which else would deluge all the christian world and leave the earth depopulate and bare twas in the year in which forlorn batavia invaded was defenseless and surpised and by two potent enemies attacked britannia thundering on them from the main and faithless gallia lightning on the shore while at the horror of the noise and sight the belgic lion trembling and aghast faint in his roar and with unsinewd paws flew for protection to the stormy main whose unrelenting rage he most abhors twas in that fatal year in which the states their country lost to the insulting french their strongest bulwarks forced or else betrayed were turned irresolute distracted wild the crowd desponding all divided faint astonished and amazed and stupid grown in dreadful expectation of their fate twas at this fatal juncture that the prince like the offspring of the gods a hero born without the advantage of a long experience without the influence of an awful fame without courageous or instructed troops with naught on which he could depend but heaven his vast capacity and dauntless soul magnanimously undertook to save his sinking country and expiring liberty here i am in rapture and amazement lost what shall i first admire his dauntless soul in that amazing hurricane of fate ever scarce the bloom of youth proclaimed him man when all the heavens looked black and all the main looked dismal when the frantic billows raged the tempest roared the forky thunder rolled and loudly bellowed over the dreadful deep the skilfulst mariners confounded foiled the boldest trembling dying with the fright the sinking vessel motionless and dead those at the helm desponding desperate abandoning to winds and waves their care he who had never ploughd the deep before alone unterrifyd and undismayed and dauntless in that dangerous extreme as is a god by destiny secured as is the god of the tempestuous deep when in some storm that threatens general wrack he lifts above the waves his sacred head to calm his troubled empire of the main and give the laboring universe repose or his great conduct shall i first admire without the advantage of experience wise exact profound unfathomably deep designed him by foreknowledg given by fate to countermine the dark designs of hell can ye behold him ye ungenerous foes to his great memory his deathless name without extolling to the stars his fame when ye discern him in that dreadful hour appearing at the head of shameful troops a wretched handful antiquated most rusty with peace and listless with disuse the rest a vile tumultuous crowd in haste by sad necessity not choice enrolled rude and untaught and barbarous to war unfit by nature and untraind by art by numerous ill successes abject made dejected drooping infamously base the mere reverse of all that is great and brave their leaders the base scum of all the rest and for that only reason uppermost raised by the boiling ferment of the state only for factious discontent advanced and inbred hatred to their great defender can you behold him at the head of these informing moving animating all changing their very natures like a god his bravery kindling thousands with its fire his spirit working like the worlds great soul and spreading beauteous order through them where trouble confusion chaos reigned before can you see this and not be wrapped with wonder can you behold the conquering gauls at bay already on his first appearance stopped in their precipitated wild career already meditating their retreat can even his most inveterate foes see this and not exalt such wondrous worth to heaven what a man is to hearten fainting hounds to rouse their vigor on the lifeless chase and guide them through the mazes of the field that to his drooping countrymen was he something between divinity and them a more exalted a superior being their guardian genius and their god of war his vast capacity supplied their heads his martial bravery inflamed their hearts and raised their abject and their groveling souls to noble thoughts and to immortal deeds above the fear of death or foul retreat so pallas to the fainting greeks appeared shook her invincible her dreadful shield and spread celestial vigor through the field behold him by a conduct which surpised the most illustrious and the oldest chiefs the most experienced in the art of war like the young roman hero so renowned forsaking his poor country to preserve it and save the sinking freedom of the world behold upon fair bonas lofty towers the guardian angels of a hundred forts a hundred towns sit gazing to receive and with loud welcomes hail their great defender for bona taken set batavia free and rent in twain the opprobrious bonds prepared to bind the christian world yet under heaven that favored him with such peculiar grace he ows the immortal glory to himself not to the valor of his fainting troops nor to the skill of their unwarlike leaders their bravery was his for he inspired it and his their conduct which from him they drew nor ows his fame to weakness of his foes or their divisions or their want of skill but the profoundness of his vast designs and his high courage raised above compare the gauls had all the advantage over nassau that caesar manifestly had over gaul behold them strong united numberless their warlike chiefs experienced and renowned their wellprovided squadrons skilful brave all flushed and spirited with long success all eager in the burning chase of glory yet william at the head of wretched troops wretched at least till raised and fired by him in little more than one revolving year forced his dread foes to leave his country free when caesar with the flower of roman legions in the large compass of ten rolling years scarce conquered barbarous divided gaul even fortune claims no share in his renown fortune that bears so visible a part in human actions ruling all below which providence has wisely ordered lest frail dust should grow intolerably vain and cry upon success it is due to me but he so highly favored was of heaven that still he brought about his vast designs while she was known to assist his mortal foes the great discerner of all human hearts knew that his noble soul was truly great as far above presumptuous pride as fear so conscious of its origin divine it never could ought but its great maker fear never own a man superior to it self but then so mindful of its frail condition and its creators high omnipotence that its dependence it could never forget that him it would with trembling still approach and with profound humility adore and by that lowliness and aweful fear confirm its greatness and its dauntless courage thus fortune and the gauls were williams foes both he resisted and he conquered both and brought about his great and just designs but cruel was the conflict first and long and often the goddess seemingly prevailed and often at once collecting her whole might took all advantages of time and place prepared to crush him at a blow when he with wondrous art eludes that dreadful blow and with fresh force disputes the doubtful day while heaven serene looked down with all its eyes charmed with the greatest noblest sight that earth can offer to the skies and that is a man a mortal man a match for fortunes power her power great arbitress of all below till his invincible unshaken soul with wisdom patience resignation armed and with a thousand virtues that have force to conquer gods compelled her to submit and own her glorious conqueror at the last nor were her smiles more powerful over his soul for upon him the faithless goddess smiled even in the worst of times that dreadful hour when raving as a bacchanal and wild she to new slaughter lashed on limping fate and led the gauls to extirpate lost batavia she offered him a kingdom for a bribe a kingdom with a hundred powerful towns in wealth exhaustless numberless in men which he rejected with a brave disdain and chose to perish with his country free rather than found an empire on its bonds o greatness to be found on earth no more exalted far above all royalty and far above the rule of fortunes power for when long after he embraced a crown justly conferred by free consent of those over whom he was to reign the acceptance them was necessary for the world not him and for the world h embraced it not himself to him twas all increase of toil and care he wanted not a crown to make him great his soul possessed a greatness of its own not like the shortlived pomp of fortunes power but durable immortal as it self placed like it self above the force of fate his towering soul it self was greatness all all vast intelligence and solid virtue the things which make even god and angels great a false and borrowed luster he despised derived from scepters and imperial crowns his soul with native luster native flame shone out as glorious as the eternal fire which rolls his sovereign globe along the sphere rapid yet firm in the refulgent course that the great mover taught him at the first and whose excess of glory darkens all the rest of gods vicegerents in the skies thus while vain pomp and tinsel glory serve to amuse the gazing and inconstant crowd he charmed the bravest wisest men on earth angels looked wondering on his virtue down and the great maker pleased his masterpiece surveyed thus he despising royalty acquired a more extended and a nobler power imperial crowns who saw to what a height above all human greatness he was raised how far above all little selfish thoughts acting as if he thought he had been born for all the world except himself alone anxious about the safety of the world but utterly regardless of his own and hazarding his own for that of all imperial crowns convinced of this confessed an excellence superior to their own and kings themselves grew subject to his sway him with esteem and wonder they beheld champion of god and his most sacred truth defender of the liberties of men and great protector of the rights of kings and they who gave to mighty nations laws received them first from him and justly thought that only he who of mankind took care by nature was designed the lord of all what but the head takes care of every part what but the soul what but the informing soul what runs through all that animates them all and in continuous union all maintains union their cause of spirit health and force and which dissolved to all brings fate or woe now he the councils of those kings collects and all their different interests reconciles of all their thwarting selfish low designs one common noble vast design he makes that seemed impossible to all but him but his rare genius sure expedients finds to calm their jealousies and sooth their pride and all at least are satisfied in him the tie and bond of union to them all and now behold him marching at the head of all their squadrons german spanish dutch now see them filing through thy narrow ways till then inglorious and obscure seneffe now shining in the bright records of fame among the glories of the eternal roll and lo the germans and the dutch have passed and the proud spaniard now prepares to pass when lo great conde with his headlong troops comes pouring on them like a sounding flood that by destruction makes its noisy way upon the wings of fear the spaniards fly and many a furlong leave their pride behind for condes image haunts them in their flight his awful form still urging on their speed more dreadful to them than his numerous host his awful form presented to their view to their remembrance calls his glorious acts their friends defeated and themselves overthrown when ere great condes image they behold the bloody plains of lens are in their view and thou o friburg with thy dismal cliffs and the dire fields of norlingue and rocroy a thousand victories and high exploits encompass him with dreadful glory round about him like a guard of terrors march and arm him with eternal majesty these fantoms goad the spaniards in their flight and now the fury of that shameful flight proves fatal to the forces of their friends and the battalions breaks and overwhelms that william swiftly sends to their relief the french drive on and no resistance find or else triumphant force their way through all outrageous as a flame that is driven by winds and fiercer stronger by obstruction grown but now heroic william thundering comes to turn the fortune of the bloody day behold with what a noblerage h attempts to arrest his squadrons in their headlong flight for his own squadrons first he is sorcd to attack with what a matchless bravery he meets routed battalions panting over the plain then with his flaming sword in their career he stands his person to them all exposed his thundering arm opposing to them all now by the torrent overborn overwhelmed now stemming with a dauntless breast the tide and now with desperate vehemence turning all the base with blows corrects with words the brave and some the sparkling glories of his eye and some his looks and some his voice inflames o whither run ye o return return o ye who had the looks of soldiers once i see ye always had the hearts of slaves the worst of slaves from slaves themselves ye run you cowards in defending liberty they in augmenting their own thraldom brave for me my own right hand or else my foes my freedom and my glory shall secure for death or victory bring both alike ye few great souls who liberty and fame prefer to wretched shameful slavish life come on be death or victory the word this said he breathing an heroic air as great as if eternal fame appeared and to high actions called her darling sons and now their shame prevails upon their fear and now he leads them furious to the charge firmly resolved to die a thousand deaths and to forsake the world ever such a leader now at their head with a resistless rage he through the firmest french battalions breaks and charging through and through their squadrons mows their squadrons now concealed in smoaky clouds and now revealed in blazing sheets of fire and now the french grow fiercer by despair and with redoubled voice bellona raves with shriller notes the cornets vex the air deaths bugles in the dismal chase of blood the trumpets kindle mars with fiercer sounds and the tempestuous drums with thicker strokes alarm the foe of nature all the heavens and all the air appears conflicting fire and now the joining squadrons rend the skies and riding at full stretch upon the plain with hideous outcries on each other rush and make one ghastful charnel of the field the rattling plain with murdring vollies rings and to the thundering cannons mortal roar the hills rebellow with a dreadful sound that the dire consort seems to deaf the world william the glorious spirit of the war is every where where danger most prevails correcting fortune and confronting fate like mars himself fierce valiant raging young among the thickest foes his thundering steed he spurs then brandishes his fatal sword terror severely sparkling in his eyes death like a faulcon perched upon his arm watching the certain signal of his blow and then like lightning darting at his prey william the desperatst champion of the field in feats of arms and mortal rage excels surpassing in amazing actions all whom glory urges or whom dire despair the meanest sentry less exposed than he frequent amidst the hottest of the fire and often surrounded covered over with flames and yet in conduct oldest chiefs excels to best advantage every motion makes always exactly present to himself spite of his furious executing arm spite of the smoke the tumult and the noise the raging trumpet and the storming drum the muskets din and thundering cannons roar nay spite of death whom all his dreadful guard of purple terrors through the field attends who painting hideously his ghastful face with dust and blood and leaping his pale steed over slaughtered heaps rides dismal through the plain thus all the day the god of battle raged and the sun sat in horror and in blood and then the laboring moon beheld a sight that troubled her above thessalian charms and made old night look hideous to her view now in their turns the mangled french recoil and doubt the fortune of the dreadful day and well they may recoil and well may doubt when their great chief the heroic conde doubts now rage disdain and grief to madness wrought and the tormenting conscience of his worth disturb his generous breast and wrack his soul he raves he cannot bear the stabbing thought of yielding to a beardless chief the field but this is what torments and stings him most that he who now for thirty glorious years has with successive victories been crowned been used to all the wonders of the field himself the noblest wonder of them all should see this godlike youth perform such things as force even him to admire o mortal shame he cries aloud o death to my renown twas he it is manifest twas none but he that turned the fortune of the wondrous day thou my divinity eternal fame and victory thou darling of my soul my mistress that for thirty glorious years have still been constant to my noble fire will ye desert me for a boy at last is not my deathless passion still the same is not my great aspiring soul the same the same my conduct and my nervous arm have i for nassau courted you thus long for him were all the desperate fields i fought for him my accumulated triumphs all which with my loss of quiet and of blood with restless days and sleepless nights i won o never never let it be pronounced first let me perish let me perish all the very name of conde be forgot be the cursed syllables never mentioned more and ye vain monuments of my renown lens norlingue friburg st antoine rocroy o let seneffe complete the illustrious list or may ye all neglected be by fame and never shine in her eternal roll this said he leads the french to certain fate for now the allies invincible are grown dauntless their minds impregnable their posts such is their heros conduct and his fire and now they pour a storm of iron hail whose fury makes whole squadrons fall while they covered with dust and horrid all with blood the slaughtered french in ghastful heaps behold and take new spirit from that dismal sight conde resolves his men shall perish all resolves himself to perish at their head and all had fallen a victim to despair if the descending goddess of the night had not just then withdrawn her sickly beams and night her blackest mantle over them thrown and now the rage and din of battle cease nor noise nor silence in the field prevails but a low hoarse and undistinguished sound a sullen hollow grumbling strikes their ears the dreadful murmurs of declining rage and the last doleful accents of despair and now the freneh concealed in night retire and to victorious william leave the field and in the height of anguish and despair praise his great conduct and his matchless fire here meanly his ungenerous foes enquire were all his battles thus with conquest crowned what if they were not they deserved it all and that was more than victory to him he nobly chose to merit victory rather than have it poorly undeserved and from the height of his exalted soul descend to triumph by inglorious ways greater and more exalted in distress than the great monarch in his happier hours looking with scorn on fortune and his foes and all who prosperd by ignoble arts his conquests all were glorious all were just all fairly gained in the broad eye of heaven and gained while heaven and earth looked wondering on conquests indeed not robberies nor fraud nor purchases nor thefts a conqueror he no trafficker for countries and for towns nor double dealer in the trade of war nor sordid turner of his gold for gain he conquered at seneffe had ere his foes a braver army or a nobler chief a chief with such experience such renown and so much conduct joined with so much fire so wondrous when the god of battle raged he who against great conde found success could never have missed it against meaner chiefs had he not by their numbers been oppressed or by the falseness of his own betrayed for to himself he always owed success to his high conduct and his great example his losses to the falsehood or the sloth or impotence or factions of his friends but yet whenere he lost the uncertain day he lost but what was fortunes not his own the towering greatness of his soul was his and that he never lost that was himself his very self his troops have been subdued but never he he gained by their defeat since adverse fortune showed him more himself of deeper conduct and more towering mind more watchful care and more unwearied toil of resolution never to be broke of constancy that triumphed over fate and kept proud fortune in severest awe twas this that terrified his happier foes made lewis in the fields of valenciennes poorly the glorious proffered fight refuse afraid to trust his far more numerous troops more skilful more victorious more renowned doubting if they with fortunes stronger power could guard him all from williams great revenge this made the proud and haughty monarch stoop and after all the advantages he gained with prudence doubt the last event of war and in our heros country sue for peace and now the world in faithless peace lies luld which more than war advances boundless sway fair liberty sleeps on and never dreams that to her heart her murderers hands so near till it is too late to fear too late to dream for now they seize and bind her strongest friend that they may surely give the fatal blow now the crowns totter on a hundred heads and europes nodding powers expect to fall for lo where bound forlorn britannia lies pinioned her arms that once the balance held and in due poise sustained the ponderous world bound to her rocks like andromede she lies fair liberty shreeks out aloud for aid when william on the wings of all the winds like perseus nobly to their rescue flies while the admiring world attentive stands trembling in expectation of the event for williams fate the general fate decides when with success above what caesar found but caesar came to enslave and he to free the happy hero came and conquered ere he saw o conquest worthy men and angels praise how poors the triumph for extended sway compared to this this conquest over hearts this triumph over souls which leaves them free and makes the vanquished happier than the victors the britons who were wretched slaves before who ad lost even hope and who expected naught but life in miseries or death in flames when he approached grew happy free secure so happy that their raptures knew no bounds for hark how their tumultuous joy grows loud hark how their stormy shouts ascend the skies to unknown worlds transporting vvilliams fame still still the sounds are in my ravished ears and still methinks i hear the nations cry hail thou defender of unspotted faith renowned restorer of lost freedom hail great patron of the christian world all hail at thy approach fierce arbitrary power and bloody superstition disappear at thy approach fair liberty returns and smiling darts a lovely glance so sweet as charms at once the hearts of gods and men while piety looks modestly assured and lifts its moving melting eyes to heaven o happy happy above millions thou who have made millions blessed thee times to come thee nations yet unborn shall happy call for the diffusive good which flows from thee to every age and nation must extend but we the ungratefulst and the worst of men should we ever cease to celebrate thy praise should we forget the boundless debt we owe then raise thy voice o happy island raise let thy tempestuous raptures tower to heaven till angels catch our great deliverers praise tune it ye angels to your deathless lyres and let all heaven attend the enchanting song for ye have voices for the lofty theme ye angels an immortal glorious crown to recompense the immortal act prepare but may he wear it late and long be ours may ye impatiently expect him long long may he deign to wear this earthly crown which now we place upon his sacred head a poor and mean return for what we owe this was the assembled nations general sense in these warm sounds they xpressd their gratitude and pleased the godlike hero with their joy yet scarce the inconstant moon renewed her orb o may it never mentioned be by fame or never be believed by times to come before they changed their more inconstant minds and murmured at their great deliverer some envied even the crown they had bestowed and some regretting their old thraldom cried for egypt and its vegetable gods others would be preserved but not by him alas unfortunate mistaken men who could preserve you possibly but he hark how hibernia rends with shreeks the air and to britannia cries aloud for help in vain great schomberg marches to her aid with his brave officers his dauntless troops with his own wondrous skill in feats of arms for superstition and wild lawless power stood both insulting by and saw those troops consumed insensibly without a blow but vvilliams presence on the wondering boyn made his foes tremble cheered his fainting friends revived them like their universal soul and quickly changed that hapless islands fate as when the sun above the horizon mounts and with his blaze of glory fills the world goblins and ghosts obscene and spirits damned that reveld by the stars uncertain light or the pale glimpses of the silver moon revere the effulgence of the lord of day and disappearing take their flight to hell so when the light of all the christian world mounted in glory over the banks of boyn unbounded power soon took its headlong flight and frighted superstition quickly shrunk its hated head within its gloomy cell hibernia rescued by her martial king made thee britannia more securely free why do thou murmur then ungrateful isle what do thou envy to the best of kings that happiness which waits upon a crown that thou thy self so freely have bestowed so justly fixed upon his sacred head is that thy cause of envious discontent alas the happiness is all for thee and all the toil and misery for him for thee and not himself he wears that crown the very best of fathers and of kings contentedly supports a wretched life that he may make his muchloved children blessed for william in his kingdoms is himself the only man whom his auspicious reign constrains to bear intolerable care not all the rolls of fame can show a king who labored under such a weight before abroad behold a formidable foe surpassing in his numbers and his strength the whole alliance which our hero formed then that alliance difficult to form and wondrous difficult to be maintained some weak some slow some jealous factious all and thwarting in their contrary designs he was the only man upon the globe who could at once resist the common foe and could enforce the weakness of his friends quicken their sloth enrich their poverty cool their mistrusts their factions reconcile at the same time at home amongst his own lurked his most mortal and most dangerous foes those sons of darkness who concealed in night sat brooding over their damnable design to take away the very life of liberty in the mean while his faithfulst friends at home his loyalst subjects too divided were too factious grown to take just care of him more eager most each other to destroy than him their common safety to defend how few alas he found entirely true how few in whom he could entirely trust upon whose faithful breasts he could discharge some part of his intolerable load for some had groundless jealousies conceived and others of themselves had too much care to be sollicitous about their king never had prince such hardships to surpass for in eternal toil he past his hours wasted with action or consumed with thought and twenty times he past the stormy main while we in peace securely slept at home past it against his health against his life past it for us against his very self it is what his tender body never could bear in every passage he almost expired profuse of his inestimable life to save and to defend ungrateful men and when the wearying toils of hard campagns were overcome alas he came not home like other conqurors to indulge himself in soft repose or to enjoy the fame or the fair conscience of his noble acts for always he returned to endure new toils and bear almost insufferable pains contending with the envious rage of some the causeless groundless jealousies of more and with the fierce divisions of us all and when with godlike patience he had born beyond what nature suffered him to bear the weary marches and the hard fatigues of a laborious and a long campagn at his return he always something found more difficult and grievous to be born unjust reproaches undeserved affronts from those whom with the hazard of his life whom with the loss of rest and health he served and yet with patience he supported all because he knew his just resentment shown would have confounded all his great designs therefore that just resentment pent within like a devouring flame that wants a vent consumed and preyed upon his noble heart exhausting the best spirits of his blood and richest purple of the royal flood behold him and then murmur if thou can o thou repining and ungrateful tribe laboring beneath this weight this world of care which his frail body could endure no more he knew it yet undauntedly went on devoting his inestimable life and offering his heartsblood a sacrifice for the felicity of wretched men firmly resolved as far as fleeting life would give him leave in spite of even our selves and all our foolish and our factious rage to finish the great work he had begun in this the roman decii he surpassed they for their country too themselves devovd but what they did was probably the effect of wild enthusiasm and of frantic rage and sudden the resolve and short the pain but williams action was the effect of thought of a deliberate and long design for sensibly his life consumed away and sunk beneath the pressure of affairs yet he with indefatigable soul and with almost divine resolve went on and knowing he or liberty must die by his eternal care eternal toil to support that exhausted his best blood and saved it at the expense of even his life and if success o fond mistaken men that judge of human actions by success was sometimes wanting to his great designs yet he deserved it still and that is enough and greatest when he missed it still was found for then his firm and comprehensive soul in all the luster of its virtue shone yet he is unjustly said to want success who by his matchless conduct in despite of fortunes favor ruined his great foe and near perfection brought his own designs in spite of losses made his kingdom thrive while france with all its fortune was undone for by himself and not by fortune great great william found us wretched left us blessed in spite of all her malice all her rage but ill that king deserves the name of great who found his subjects wealthy easy blessed and will be sure to leave them poor starved cursed in spite of false success and false renown and thus to bless mankind our hero lived twas the sole business of his godlike life and great employment of his dying hours he knew he never could better die employed than he had lived he knew the very best the greatest holiest of mankind were they who of their maker most resemblance bear and that they best resemble the most high who to mankind do most diffusive good and who for future ages best provide nor could the king of terrors awful face turn his attention from his grand design the grizly king no terrors had for him calmly they met and kindly they embraced as friendly monarchs on their frontiers meet his mighty soul was so remote from fear that he showed nothing like what is falsely brave and nothing like what is falsely good he showed no earnest vehement devotion paid the effect of terror and astonishment but calm resigned and charitably meek briefly and mildly offered up that soul to the great judge of kings who knew his heart and the main spring of all his actions saw that done again he of the world took care for his religion in his actions lay and not in fruitless words and empty sounds he looked upon himself as sent by god to advance the happiness of human kind and as he past his whole heroic life he died performing his great masters will and as he knew no fear so pain it self could not divert him from his great design if we give credit to the sons of art his latest hours in sharpest pains were spent and yet he showed no smallest sign of pain uttered no loud complaint nor piercing groan no mark of torment on his face appeared only a more compassionating look for his loved people whom he left behind the best of fathers for his children felt but for himself appeared insensible yet his no fruitless vain compassion was but made him eager to complete those acts that dire impending mischiefs might prevent and might our future happiness secure o greatness never known to man before too great to be conceived by human thought behold a man who dies in sharpest pain in his own height of misery intent upon providing happiness for all which makes the sole employment of a god in perfect ease and full felicity as much concerned for the worlds liberty as if his business ceased not with his life as if our guardian angel had assumed that royal shape and would not leave his charge but only disappear to mortal eyes not the least trouble or concern he showed that his great maker called him at a time when the expecting world had all its eyes intent on him the darling theme of fame when all his vast designs were just reduced within a certain prospect of success when humbled gaul and the delivered world had all advanced his fame to such a height as never human glory rose before not in the least concerned at being snatched from the transporting joy the vast applause of all the nations happy made by him the hero meekly bore it tho he knew that the world judges by the last event but the worlds praise was what he could contemn he like a faithful servant had performed what his great master destined him to do and so died pleased with this heroic thought that had that masters absolute decree allotted him a thousand times as much he would with cheerfulness have done it all of all about him in that dreadful hour he was alone serene the mournful rest felt all the fiercest pangs of grief and fear of ghastful horror and of wild despair their bloodshot eyes and their distracted looks declared the inward torments of their souls they all like wretches on the rack appeared like the compassionate spectator he at last one hearty sigh he gives for all a sigh that ended his heroic toils and brought that rest which virtue could not bring and now in loud and lamentable wails they vent their lawless grief that knows no bounds some for their royal patron wring their hands their benefactor some aloud deplore some their wise brave undaunted general their great deliverer and defender some their father like poor helpless orphans all but turn thy view my soul from that vast grief whose mortal prospect is enough to blast thy strongest and thy noblest faculties yet whither must i fly to avoid that grief all europe catches the contagious woe the greatest men on earth his fate deplore those dauntless souls who always scorned their own kings for that loss not only grieve but die but cease your lamentations o ye kings your loud laments y afflicted nations cease it is for your selves this vast excess of woe and not for him for he is surely blessed never a greater subject was of woe but still excessive grief some weakness shows but lofty praise declares a noble mind the best return for mighty benefits and worthy to be offered up to gods and to good kings who most resemble gods then change your voices all with one accord y afflicted nations change your mournful notes and praise your mighty benefactors name lift up your voices all with one accord for the great theme requires your noblest flights william the great the good the just is gone yet never never shall he die entire but his immortal memory shall last as long as gratitude remains in men as long as lovely liberty remains for william was the greatest best of kings that ever was sent from heaven to rule the earth or will be sent when golden times return who persecuted and oppressed by fate outpowerd outnumberd by the common foe deserted by some friends betrayed by some ill seconded by more almost alone did by a conduct matchless and divine deliver lost batavia belgia save new impd the roman eagles soaring wings to take a stronger and a nobler flight britannia he restored hibernia he reduced he superstitions bloody progress stopped and checked the rage of arbitrary sway religion reestablished right maintained supported freedom property secured and made oppression tremble when he frowned was born and lived for the worlds happiness in every part of his unequaled life a hero still confessed to all the world and died at last as greatly as he lived whose dying arm for liberty did more than if the noblest conquest he had gained and who to sum all praises up in one maintains even dead the freedom of the world both by his conduct which confederate powers by him combined in mutual league pursue and by the wisdom of that mighty queen who now adds luster to the imperial crown her wisdom and her virtues are the gifts which he upon these happy realms bestowed had it not been for his heroic toils the golden scepter she so mildly sways had been in bloody hands an iron rod and can we owe this happiness to him and yet refuse our benefactors praise where is our honor where our gratitude and where our boasted loyalty to her can we be foes to his immortal name who gave us her who all his wondrous steps persues and seconds all his vast designs and may she second all till she attains the happy glorious end which he proposed finis
