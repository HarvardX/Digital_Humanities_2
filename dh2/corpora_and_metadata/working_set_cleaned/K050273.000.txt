the case of the war in italy stated being a serious enquiry how far great britain is engaged to concern it self in the quarrel between the emperor and the king of spain  pax quaeritur bello london printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  the case of the war in italy stated etc the eyes of europe seem at this time to be turned wholly upon the king of spains new undertaking against the emperor the reasons of his making this attempt his catholic majesty has published by his ministers and the memorials or letters which they have given in to the several courts of the princes where they reside fully express the pretension of the king of spain and the reasons why he takes this occasion to break with the emperor  these memorials or letters are first the letter of seignior grimaldi secretary of state to the king of spain directed to the spanish ambassadors or residents at foreign courts secondly the memorial of the marquis beretti landi minister for the king of spain to the states general and the memorial of the prince de cellamere at paris to the regent of france all on the same subject and all tending to justify the conduct of the king of spain in this affair besides the declaration by word of mouth from the marquis de monteleone the ambassador of spain to his britannick majesty  the sum of all these memorials for they are too long to repeat here may be drawn up and abridgd in the following heads viz   st that the emperor does not acknowledge king philip to be king of spain but gives him only the title of duke of anjou assuming to himself the style and dignity of king of spain spanish majesty likewise all the titles attending the possession of the spanish monarchy that he the emperor whom the king of spain therefore calls only arch duke has erected a council at vienna which he calls the council of spain that he confers titles and honors such as grandee of spain as if he was really king of spain in possession and the like   dly that these things are evedences of his resolving to attack king philip and chase him out of spain it self if he was able or when he shall be so and in the mean time takes all occasions to show himself a mortal enemy   dly that the emperor broke the terms of peace and neutrality even as soon as they were made viz that when his imperial majesty consented by treaty to quit catalonia where in a few days more he must have been overcome and been reduced to the necessity of having fallen into the king of spains hands yet he did not quit the towns and strengths as he ought to have done by consigning them into the king of spains hands to whom they were to be surrendered but gave them over to the rebels the catalans encouraging them to hold out against his spanish majesty by promising to return and assist them which occasioned the shedding of much blood and the expense of an infinite mass of treasure to reduce those places to obedience   thly that he not only encouraged the rebel majorkins in their rebellion against his spanish majesty but actually sent them ships men money arms provisions ammunition etc to support them in their rebellion against the king of spain exhorting them also to maintain their rebellion in hopes of farther assistance   thly that the imperial governor of the milanese has by order from the emperor arrested and put in prison the abbot molinez a person sacred by his character of grand inquisitor reverend by his age and who ought to have been so by the pasports which were given him at rome from the pope with approbation of count gallas the imperial minister there and lastly who having given no offense in person to the emperor is visibly arrested as an affront to his spanish majesty and an insult upon his government   thly that his imperial majesty has himself broken the neutrality of italy by extorting immense sums of money from the princes of italy on pretense of its being their just due to pay toward the carrying on his war against the turks and lastly that this being a particular conjuncture for the king of spains purpose favorable for his designs and the like his spanish majesty thinks he cannot let slip so fair an occasion as well respecting the troubles in hungary as the general discontent of the people of italy and their readiness to enter into measures for the effectual delivering themselves out of the hands of the house of austria   these are the general heads of the charge as may be seen by the said memorials or manifestoes of the spanish ministers to which i refer they having all been made public in the common printed papers of the town as to the pretense of the emperor using artifices to secure to himself the succession to the estates of the grand duke of tuscany that i look upon as trifling and without foundation and therefore not worth naming among the rest  it is not our business to enquire here whether these objections are just and whether what is alleged can be made good in fact viz that the emperor has done so and so as above nor is it the present question whether if these allegations are just they are a sufficient argument for the king of spain to take up arms and begin a war in italy  but the design of this tract is to enquire how these things respect the other powers of christendom and what part it is probable they may take in the quarrel and by other powers here i am to be understood to mean in particular the dutch the kings of france and britain the king of sicily and the cantons of swisserland what share they are like to have in the quarrel and whether they are bound by the treaty of neutrality to concern themselves in a war for the keeping the possession of italy to the house of austria yea or no  i begin with the king of sicily to make short with his story i shall look on him as one of the princes of italy for such he is we see his majesty acting a very subtle part as indeed it stands him in stead at this time to do it is true the imperialists threaten him and notwithstanding all his protestations of being resolved to pursue the neutrality they mistrust him and seem as resolved to fall on him in their way nay some say they resolve to begin with him no man will be so weak as to ask what is his sicilian majestys business if he is attacked but the question with him seems to be whether his majesty having now a very great army on foot in a readiness for action and apprehending the imperialists will certainly attack him ought not by way of prevention to begin first having so clear an advantage and an opportunity which it is very probable may not be offered again i mean as that of joining with spain  this is the question which the politicians who consider not what is right or what is wrong but what is fittest to be done respecting the interest of the party i shall in brief state what i think will be the case here and as therein i give only one opinion let others judge as they see cause and let the event determine in a word i say i think it seems unavoidable and the king of sicily cannot be unconcerned in a war if it follows and that his majesty will not fail to oyn his arms with the k of spain only that this cannot be expected till the spaniards have landed a considerable body of men on the coast of italy either in the kingdom of naples or perhaps higher up toward the king of sicilys own country which is more than probable by the spanish generals demanding passage of the state of genoa for an army into the parmesan  this therefore being so near a decision and at present representing it self to our view as unavoidable i lay it down as a thing most certain either voluntarily of himself or forced by the imperialists themselves will certainly join with spain in this new enterprise and i must tell the imperial ministers who talk so loudly of the certainty of the king of sicilys ruin in such a case and let the event be what it will there is great reason to believe many if not all the princes of italy seem to resolve to run the venture of it if the spaniards give them but a little more encouragement what their dependence and encouragement are time will not fail to discover  i will not say but these princes may have their several grievances and may have just reasons to complain of the violences and oppressions of the house of austria i am willing in compliment to their integrity to suppose though not to grant the imperial governors have perhaps exceeded their commissions or that even their commissions have been in some things invasive of the right of the several powers complaining contrary to justice and to a treaty of neutrality and i will give these complaints their full weight when i come to examine the grand question viz whether for this they ought to take up arms and destroy the neutrality in which the preserving their rights is not the only question but by which the balance of power in europe is preserved in which balance of power most if not all the other powers of europe are concerned at least those powers are of whom i am more particularly to speak  in this circumstance then i lay down the state of things in italy at this time viz that the princes of italy are in a present disposition to revolt and that the king of sicily is in the same case and that they only want a powerful protection of some other potentate to support them and that therefore we may expect if the king of spain appears thus able to protect them they will certainly join with him whenever a powerful army appears  the king of spains pretensions then and the princes of italy being thus stated the plot among them seems to be discovered viz that the king of spain on the foundation of his own grievances only shall begin the war and according to the success his spanish majesty meets with the other princes shall declare themselves so that if the king of spain should not be able to carry on the design they may all retreat to their solemn protestations of not being concerned in the quarrel of spain and may make smooth water with the emperor when they find themselves unable to raise a storm but on the contrary if the king of spain can force his way into italy and dispossess the imperialists so as to protect them then they will declare themselves  upon this foot i shall treat the affair in general if i do any wrong to the princes of italy it will be time to acknowledge it when the wrong appears  but to proceed to the history of fact the king of spain according to this scheme has begun the war and serving himself of the emperors being perfectly destitute of any marine power and of the unhappy conjuncture of a furious war with the turks he invades the dominions of his imperial majesty in particular the island of sardignia which the spaniards having a powerful fleet and the imperial government not three men of war could no ways be relieved  here we stop a while and make a transition at once to the courts of great britain and the hague the spaniards were not so ignorant as not to know or so dull as not to think of it that the powers or courts above mentioned who had all severally so great a share in making the capitulation or treaty for the neutrality of italy would interest themselves in this affair as having charged themselves with the guarantee of that neutrality and therefore his spanish majesty caused not only the letters and memorials mentioned above to be presented in the nature of manifestos to the said courts but made often a repeated proposal of stopping their proceedings till time might be given to the pacifick princes and powers who he thus appplyd to by such methods as they thought most proper to bring his imperial majesty to listen to reason and to do justice to his spanish majestys pretensions  these proposals being taken ad referendum did indeed entitle the said princes and powers to make the needful representations to the emperor and to make use of all the good offices they found for their purpose to induce the emperor to refer likewise the matters in dispute to their mediation as the king of spain likewise offered to do  by the way i must here observe as i go in order to make every thing clear to the reader of this enquiry   that these powers were more or less all of them engaged before as guarantees of the treaty of neutrality in italy   that though their being so guarantees qualified them the better to be mediators yet this mediation if they had accepted it does not by any means tie up their hands from or lessen the right they have to act as guarantees of the neutrality of italy   that we do not find in the proposal any conditions made with them that this offer should subsist only in case they declared themselves accepting the said mediation   we do not find that the king of great britain their high mightinesses the states general and the regent of france did actually engage in any such mediation but   that being willing to do all good offices for the preserving the peace and tranquillity of europe they have concerned themselves in the most earnest manner to his imperial majesty in what the king of spain demands and to induce him to accept of the proposals of his spanish majesty in order to a treaty  but while this is depending and before they have been able to obtain any answer or enter into any negotiation on the proposal we find spain entirely regardless of the offered suspension of her conquests and taking no notice of the engagements she had entered into with his britanncik majesty and other powers as above i say we find spain vigorously pushing on her advantages making preparations for new enterprises and even by her ambassador the prince de cellamare at the court of france declaring publicly that she intends to do so this last declaration being indeed so inconsistent with those mentioned above deserves to be remarked as follows sir the loose rumors and the surprising news which have been current some time since at this court as well as in the other courts of europe that the king my master designed for some secret enterprise the ships and troops which he had assembled at barcelona together with the instances continual representations and extraordinary applicacations made at paris and london by the german ministers and their friends who were alarmed upon the first advice of such an enterprise out of a remorse of their own conscience have kept me to this time under an uneasiness which your excellency who knows sufficiently my zeal for the glory of the king my master and how devoted i am to his service may easily imagine as well as the extreme agitation those rumors have produced in me but that trouble was thoroughly calmed by a letter which i received from monsieur the marquis grimaldo whereof i have annexed a copy to this memorial which i have the honor to deliver to your excellency  i have the satisfaction to see therein the reasons that have induced the king my master to undertake to recover sardignia by force of arms set forth in such a manner as ought to persuade all the world of the justice of this expedition my penetration though not very extensive had already afforded me a glymspe of the solidity of those reasons which are grounded on the infractions made by the court of vienna of the solemn treaties for the evacuation of catalonia and majorca and the nonperformance of the conditions on which the suspension of the arms in italy had been concluded such contraventions can never be forgotten  i put therefore into the hands of your excellency a copy of the letter of m the marquis grimaldo that you may be entirely and fully porswaded of the justice of the arms of his catholic majesty and be able more exactly to acquaint the regency therewith i cannot add any thing to that letter but a reflection viz that as the king my master has forbore hitherto to attack the archduke in the dominions he has usurped from him upon two motives equally wise and important so he does not do it at present but at the utmost extremity and after the archduke has violated all the regards due to crowned heads and after he has put upon him the affront of seizing with violence the great inquisitor of spain  the first motive is that the king my master whose courage and greatness of soul are worthy of his birth and his throne resents much more what wounds his dignity than the enterprises that are made chiefly against his interest of which i am an unexceptionable witness having seen to what a degree his generous courage was provoked when he heard the unjust violence and odious usage suffered since the loss of the kingdom of naples in the prisons of milan on the part of the germans by the viceroy the marquis de villena and the other general officers who served under him amongst whom i have the inestimable glory to have been distinguished by a particular attention of the enemies of the king my master to abuse me  your excellency will immediately perceive the scond motive the last affront offered by the archduke to the king my master at a time that he did not expect to receive a new one has had the effect of a new weight put into a pair of scales already full and has immediately turned the balance his majesty would have nevertheless made a sacrifice of his resentment to the holy maxims which are the rule of his conduct and would have given it up as a new victim to the good of christendom if he had not seen that the naval forces of the venetians and the princes their allies were masters of the sea in the levant and lastly if he had not been fully convinced that he was under a necessity to make an enterprise of great moment in order to prevent new outrages and confound the pride of his enemies who to satisfy the pride of their hatred and terrify people by their wickedness have seized a clergyman whom old age and infirmities rendered an object of compassion trampling under foot by their cruel usage against his person the laws of nations and the treaties which ought to have protected him against all imprisonments and the rather because with the consent of the minister of the archduke at rome he took his way through the milanese with a pass given him by the pope the archduke in violating that pass has shown little respect to the supreme head of that church against whose enemies he boasts so much to fight at this time  i pray god to preserve your excellency as long as i wish it signed  the prince de cellamare     before i enter then upon the main question of a war i think here occurs a particular or previous question to be considered viz is this proceeding of spain an affront to the king of great britain and to all the powers to whom those pacifick proposals were made and who so willingly began their good offices with his imperial majesty or is it not is it using his majesty well or is it oftering the highest contempt to his person and to the interposition of his interest as is possible to be offered is it not a breach of faith and honor in a word is it not dealing deceitfully and dishonourably with his majesty making use of his good offices to amuse and deceive the prince who they were proposed to serve and in a word making a property of the three most potent powers of europe in order to advantage himself of their civilities and as before he had deceived europe in the matter of his armament by sea on petences and indeed promises of fitting out a fleet for the assistance of the venetians against the turks so now deceiving the emperor by the fraud of a specious proposal which no prince could have such mean thoughts of the king of spain as to believe he was not sincere in it cannot be suggested that in this the king of great britain is used well or used really as one crowned head ought to use another nor can it be suggested but that when occasion presents and circumstances concurs his majesty knows very well how to resent it and is not without the means of making his spanish majesty sensible of it  but our question at home is it seems of another nature and indeed something of a new fashion viz whether we shall be willing the honor of the british throne shall be so far asserted as that his majesty shall upon the single point of being affronted engage in this matter or whether we shall leave the british powers to be so far depreciated as to take no notice of such usage and consequently to be affronted on all occasions by all the kings of the earth  however for once and to gratify the opposers far beyond their expectations and to leave room for all their specious soft ways of covering these things over i shall give way to their harangues upon the circumstances of the nation viz that we have lately been involved in a heavy war which has brought an insupportable burden of debt upon the whole kingdom that we are but just entering upon methods for working out of those things and have scarce tasted the sweet part of any one article worth naming that all the savings of the last year have not eased the people of one tax neither can they in some years yet to come and that it will be a great many years before we can possibly give such ease to the poor people as to bring their living and keeping their families to be as cheap to them as before and yet their provisions are even dearer than in time of war that all neighboring countries are reducing their expense and lessening their debts and in a fair way to be out of debt before us even though no new war should be commenced but that every year brings with it some new load upon britain to keep her low as for example the rebellion for one year the swedish affair for another and if now we engage in a war with spain we are in a fair way to continue the charge of all the taxes and funds that are upon us besides what new demands may be necessary and so the nation will for ever sink under a weight already owned to be insupportable  to all these things they add the supposition of a war with spain the consequences of it to our commerce which after a long decay and suffering infinite convulsions in the last war began to revive again in all parts of the world but will immediately be overwhelmed in the most sensible parts of it such as the trade to spain it self the assiento contract the trade to italy and the like and perhaps the effects of our merchants and south sea company etc be seized by the spaniards  this is a long detail of plausibles which indeed our people begin to fill their mouths with in this case and in some of the particular cases they are not without weight it is true our debts are many and great and the nation wants a recess of taxes it is true our spanish trade is considerable and the effects of our merchants are great abroad and may be liable to be confiscated by the spaniards  i will add to this that we have reason to believe from the wisdom and the pacifick disposition of his majesty himself from the prudence and moderation of his councils from the just desire the king must necessarily have to restore the tranquillity of his subjects and from a willingness once to enjoy his new dominions in peace and see his people flourishing in arts and trade by which they are now in a fair prospect of making themselves more than ever the greatest and most opulent nation in the world  but against all these things doubtless there are other matters that weigh something in the scale of this question and which merit to be considered by themselves i shall fetch nothing remote to make good the deficiency for the subject is but too fruitful of argument and the necessity will appear even at first sight if we go back historically but a little way into things past and compare them with the visible prospects of things to come  the great and indeed the true reason which was always alleged for the pushing on the late war at so vast an expense and the continuing it through so many difficulties as at first for many years obstructed the success of it was the fixing the balance of power in europe  it was for this that so many powers of europe confederated to reduce the exorbitant power of france by whose conquests and ambitious designs that balance was destroyed and the nations of europe in danger of submitting at last to an universal tyranny in the conqueror  it was for this that the glorious king william fixed the pyrenean treaty as the boundary of his demands from france and declared if spain went beyond those limits he would be then as much a frenchman as he was then a spaniard  it was for this that such long struggles were made to prevent the spanish monarchy falling into the hands of the house of bourbon  it was for this we complained so warmly of the measures in the last reign and of the conditions of the late peace as betraying the confederacy and destroying the great end of the war by giving up spain to king philip who at that time was entirely in the interest of france  it was for this all the renunciations of the treaty of vtrecht were entered into and the weight of the argument acknowledged even in those very things which were said eventually to betray it and by those very people who have been so openly charged with leaving it unprovided for or not sufficiently secured  it was on the pretense of this being sufficiently secured that the people who made the peace of vtrecht justify themselves and tell us that it was a good peace and that it fully answered the end of the war  it must then follow that even those very people ought to be the first to declare that what ever prince breaks in upon that balance destroys the efficacy of the peace and brings us into the same necessity of renewing a war that there was at that time for beginning and carrying it on  as the balance of power was the reason of the war so it is the only basis of the peace whatever prince makes an attempt upon that balance declares war against all the rest as they are naturally guarantees of the whole or else they tacitly declare that there was no just reason at first from the interruption of that balance to begin the former war much less to carry it on as they did which would arraign all the princes of the confederacy and charge them with ambition unjust invasion and blood  these points carry their own evidence with them and admit so little dispute that it would seem a mere spinning out our discourse to go about proving or farther explaining any part of them all the public transactions declarations of war memorials and treaties which were severally dispersed through europe in the time when these things were done are full of it and may be all called up as evidences to this one great principle of the policies of europe viz that preserving the balance of power in europe was the reason of the war and the grand preliminary of the peace  this then being laid down as a fundamental to argue from it follows to enquire in few words is the dispossessing the house of austria of their dominions in italy and reuniting those dominions to the spanish monarchy a breach of this balance of power or is it not  i need go no further for arguments to set forth the importance of those italian dominions than those made use of by the gentlemen who magnified them as most mighty additions to the austrian greatness when they would have persuaded us that giving those parts to the emperor would make him too great for the rest of the world and overthrow that balance they were given to preserve  if then those dominions whose dependencies and influencies are indeed equal to their power were scarce thought safe to be given to the emperor and were not thought safe to remain to the king of spain because of the balance which would thereby be in danger how then can it consist with the balance to have them snatched out of the emperors hands again and return back to the same hand from whence they were taken  this consideration alone obliges not great britain only but even the whole confederacy as one man to declare against this invasion of the king of spain and to oblige him to put a stop to his attempts or make war upon him otherwise the end of the late war is defeated and the effect of the late peace is destroyed  nor is it sufficient to say the emperor had those dominions conquered for him and put into his hands and he ought to take care to maintain his possession for if the emperor is by any incident of war as the present war with the turks for example exposed to the possibility of a surprise it would show a very ill concern for the general good of europe to let his dominions which we thought our selves so much concerned to get for him be lost again because he the emperor may not be able to prevent it  it was for our own sakes and for the public safety of europe in which the whole confederacy were concerned that the war was carried on it was not to aggrandize the house of austria that these dominions were conquered but to weaken the opposing enemies whose power was too great and they were allotted to the emperor not because his arms had conquered them for without the help of the confederates he neither did conquer them nor could have conquered them but because it was meet in order to preserve this great article of the balance i say it was meet for the good of all europe that the emperor should have them  likewise speaking of the present conjuncture it is not merely in compliment to the emperor whose immediate interest or family we have no concern in that we are interested in this affair but it is the common interest of europe the same which so many years war was carried on for and the same which the peace was or ought to have been made for for this common interest it is meet that these places these dominions in italy should remain to the house of austria and they must remain to that house or that balance be so far destroyed and the ends of the confederates are not answered  it remains then to judge whether great britain can quietly and unconcernedly look on and see the great ends for which they laid out their blood and treasure with so much cheerfulness and for so many years destroyed at once and a foundation laid for the same necessity of blood and treasure to be laid out again can we sit still and see measures taken which have in themselves a direct tendency to renew the war those pacifick gentlemen who plead so earnestly in behalf of peace should tell us the meaning of the ancient well known maxim pax quaeretur bello and whether a timely exerting the strength which is now in our hands may not be the only way to establish peace and prevent war  it is much easier to keep things in the posture they are in than to restore them again after the blow is given italy is a large country a conjuncture offers to the ambitious views of the king of spain which perhaps may be in it self tempting enough the delicious morsel seems as it were dropping into his mouth the discontents of the people there are represented as very great and perhaps they are so it may be the germans have not treated them very kindly they have oppressed them with heavy taxes preferred foreigners to the places and preferments which the natives have claimed a right to carried away their native troops to serve the emperor in his wars in hungary extorted great sums of money and the like what can we say to this had they applied to any foreign princes to have interceeded for them to his imperial majesty none of the confederates would have refused their good offices as far as the custom of nations would admit one prince to concern himself in the government of another but that these grievances should entitle them to revolt and to go back to a prince from whom the whole interest of europe was concerned to separate them this quite alters the case and to say we must sit still and permit and suffer it as we have acted in the same kind our selves and from the principles of liberty we insist upon for our selves this is saying nothing to the purpose for our views are in this the liberties of europe and not the liberties of italy the first we are nationally concerned in not the last nay if they were together in one bottom we should no otherwise be concerned in the liberties of italy than as they were on one bottom with those of europe but when they are opposite to one another the case is quite altered the particular rights of the italian princes or people are quite out of the question the thing before the confederates is the preserving that balance which is the foundation of the liberties of all europe  nor can we say in this case that the confederacy is dissolved and the affair is now no more a common concern the common interest is the same and the princes as i said even natural guarrantees for the preserving it  much might be said here for the nature of this war the injustice of the manner as well as that of the pretenses for it but it is true these regard the emperor rather than us however i shall collect the particulars that we may view them and that the world may judge of what honor what equity is to be expected from those powers who can satisfy themselves to give europe cause for such complaints as these some of them are to be found in the popes letter to the king of spain where his holiness expostulates warmly and even almost calls it perfidious treatment viz   that his spanish majesty promises and engages his royal word to him the pope that he would not offer any disturbance to his imperial majestys dominions in italy during his being thus engaged in a war with the turks   that his spanish majesty engaged to his holiness to send a powerful fleet into the levant in aid of the christian princes against the turks which fleet was to join the venetians and act in conjunction with the other auxiliaries whereas on the contrary this fleet was not only not sent to the levant against the turks but has been employed against the christian emperor at the same time when his imperial majesty had employed his whole force to resist the enemy of the christian name and not only has been thus employed but the venetians have been thereby abandoned and left to struggle with the superior force of their enemies to their great and unspeakable loss and disappointment and to the great hazard of christendom and the turks being hereby left masters of the seas after two bloody engagements which had the spanish fleet been joined would either not have been fought or if they had the christans might have obtained a most glorious victory or at least the triumphs of the infidels had been prevented and the effusion of the christian blood been saved   that in order to this equipment for the service of christendom his spanish majesty demanded of his holiness a brief for the raising a great sum of money from the clergy of spain which his holiness granted likewise a hat was insisted for the abbot now cardinal alberoni upon the granting which and the king of spains promises of sending the said squadron with all speed against the turks was renewed yet all these engagements were laid aside and the power raised to fight with the enemies of christ turned against the christian emperor in a manner so surprising as to the faith and honor of his spanish majesty as is not to be expressed in better terms than in the popes letter abovesaid to which i particularly refer  it is true as i have observed that these breaches of faith and honor do not in particular affect us or relate to britain but the reader may consider them and compare them with the memomorials and declarations of the marquis de beretti landi in holland and some the like here wherein his spanish majesty offers or promises to stop his preparations and proceed no farther than the conquest of sardignia but leave the matters in dispute with the emperor to the mediation of his britannick majesty and their high mightinesses the states general etc and yet as all advices now say and even the king of spains minister in france acknowledges his spanish majesty resolves to push his advantages to the utmost in pursuit of his quarrel with the emperor  i am loath to make indecent reflections upon persons exalted to the dignity of sovereign princes and always retain a reverence to the majesty of crowned heads and therefore forbear all those reflections which some people make upon his spanish majesty as a branch of the house of bourbon suggesting that such things as these seem to be copying after the pattern of france i wish his spanish majesty would adhere to the maxims of honor so strictly adhered to and so nobly practiced by some of his glorious ancestors on the throne of the spanish monarchy rather than send us back to his particular progenitors or to a court where such things have formerly been too much practiced and which i mention with the more caution as the world seems to acknowledge the court of france it self is acted now by other principles and may be expected in a few years to establish other maxims as well of policy as of honor differing from those which brought it so eminently to the gate of destruction  i see nothing can be said then why the king of spain should be suffered unopposed to push on his present designs which are founded on such trifling pretenses and on such dishonorable measures unless we can say that we have no concern in the general god of europe and that we are not as much oncernd to keep any new power from growing too formidable and exorbitant in europe as we shall be afterward to pull it down and if it will be our concern as most certainly it must to reduce every exorbitance of power in europe and preserve the balance on which the tranquillity of europe depends it must be our rudence to prevent the first rise of such exorbitance  as to the disadvantages to our commerce abroad our inability to engage in the expense at home our being in debt and oppressed with taxes and the like they are all granted and i make no doubt that as it is natural to infer from thence that we should by no means engage in any new expense if it be possible to avoid it so i believe as is said above that his majesty will not be prevailed on to use force in this case if all possible good offices between the parties can prevent it and if reason will take place in a word that his majesty will not bring us into a war without an absolute and apparent necessity  but let us not depreciate our country so much or lay our selves so low neither as to suggest that we cannot do what we cannot in honor and justice avoid that would be to say we are so weakened by the late war that we are not able even to resist an enemy if we are attacked  if our power is contemned if the honor of the british crown is slighted if princes come to think so meanly of britain as not to think it worth while to keep their words with us it is indeed attacking us they that will break their promises with great britain how long do we think they would be before they would break the peace with his majesty if they found it for their advantage to do it  to be treated thus is to be attacked in the worst manner and great princes have always resented the breach of faith with them as the worst affront that could be put upon them and i hope none will suggest in this case that a breach of faith with the king is not a breach of faith with the kingdom and that in a manner more particularly provoking  as to our trade perhaps it may be true that the king of spain may take some advantages against our merchants but let such people who are frighted at those appearances remember what infinite advantages our superiority at sea gives our subjects in war with spain let them remember queen elizabeths reign when the whole nation was visibly enriched by a war with spain and to this let me add should we now heartily set about a war with spain spain giving the occasion it is no hard matter to show how infinite advantages may be made of it in the spanish west indies capable to make full reparation for all the damages our trade can suffer but of that hereafter  laslty let it be observed that this discourse does not tend to an immediate declaring war against the king of spain it takes it for granted that necessity obliges some princes of europe to join to preserve the neutrality of italy and as has been hinted to the spaniards to act against those that would break that neutrality if this leads us to act against the king of spain it is not britain but the king of spain that leads us to it and if in doing this the king of spain takes if for a breach of the peace it is his spanish majesty that begins the war and not the king of britain and the consequences must lie at their door and not at ours  finis
