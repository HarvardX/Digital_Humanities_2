portrait of edward gibbon edward gibbon esqr born the  th may      engraved by jo hall from an original picture painted by sir joshua reynolds    the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire by edward gibbon esquire volume the first a new edition  london printed for w strahan and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxiii  preface it is not my intention to detain the reader by expatiating on the variety or the importance of the subject which i have undertaken to treat since the merit of the choice would serve to render the weakness of the execution still more apparent and still less excusable but as i have presumed to lay before the public a first volume only the first volume of the quarto is now contained in the two first volumes of this octavo edition of the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire it will perhaps be expected that i should explain in a few words the nature and limits of my general plan  the memorable series of revolutions which in the course of about thirteen centuries gradually undermined and at length destroyed the solid fabric of roman greatness may with some propriety be divided into the three following periods    the first of these periods may be traced from the age of trajan and the antonines when the roman monarchy having attained its full strength and maturity began to verge toward its decline and will extend to the subversion of the western empire by the barbarians of germany and scythia the rude ancestors of the most polished nations of modern europe this extraordinary revolution which subjected rome to the power of a gothic conqueror was completed about the beginning of the sixth century  ii the second period of the decline and fall of rome may be supposed to commence with the reign of justinian who by his laws as well as by his victories restored a transient splendor to the eastern empire it will comprehend the invasion of italy by the lombards the conquest of the asiatic and african provinces by the arabs who embraced the religion of mahomet the revolt of the roman people against the feeble princes of constantinople and the elevation of charlemagne who in the year eight hundred established the second or german empire of the west  iii the last and longest of these periods includes about six centuries and a half from the revival of the western empire till the taking of constantinople by the turks and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes who continued to assume the titles of caesar and augustus after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a single city in which the language as well as manners of the ancient romans had been long since forgotten the writer who should undertake to relate the events of this period would find himself obliged to enter into the general history of the crusades as far as they contributed to the ruin of the greek empire and he would scarcely be able to restrain his curiosity from making some inquiry into the state of the city of rome during the darkness and confusion of the middle ages  as i have ventured perhaps too hastily to commit to the press a work which in every sense of the word deserves the epithet of imperfect i consider myself as contracting an engagement to finish most probably in a second volume the author as it frequently happens took an inadequate measure of his growing work the remainder of the first period has filled two volumes in quarto the four last volumes of this octavo edition  the first of these memorable periods and to deliver to the public the complete history of the decline and fall of rome from the age of the antonines to the subversion of the western empire with regard to the subsequent periods though i may entertain some hopes i dare not presume to give any assurances the execution of the extensive plan which i have described would connect the ancient and modern history of the world but it would require many years of health of leisure and of perseverance  bentinckstreet february        p s the entire history which is now published of the decline and fall of the roman empire in the west abundantly discharges my engagements with the public perhaps their favorable opinion may encourage me to prosecute a work which however laborious it may seem is the most agreeable occupation of my leisure hours  bentinckstreet march        an author easily persuades himself that the public opinion is still favorable to his labors and i have now embraced the serious resolution of proceeding to the last period of my original design and of the roman empire the taking of constantinople by the turks in the year one thousand four hundred and fiftythree the most patient reader who computes that three ponderous volumes the six volumes of this octavo edition have been already employed on the events of four centuries may perhaps be alarmed at the long prospect of nine hundred years but it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the byzantine history at our entrance into this period the reign of justinian and the conquests of the mahometans will deserve and detain our attention and the last age of constantinople the crusades and the turks is connected with the revolutions of modern europe from the seventh to the eleventh century the obscure interval will be supplied by a concise narrative of such facts as may still appear either interesting or important  bentinckstreet march        the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire is now delivered to the public in a more convenient form some alterations and improvements had presented themselves to my mind but i was unwilling to injure or offend the purchasers of the preceding editions the accuracy of the corrector of the press has been already tried and approved and perhaps i may stand excused if amidst the avocations of a busy winter i have preferred the pleasures of composition and study to the minute diligence of revising a former publication  bentinckstreet april  0      advertisement diligence and accuracy are the only merits which an historical writer may ascribe to himself if any merit indeed can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty i may therefore be allowed to say that i have carefully examined all the original materials that could illustrate the subject which i had undertaken to treat should i ever complete the extensive design which has been sketched out in the preface i might perhaps conclude it with a critical account of the authors consulted during the progress of the whole work and however such an attempt might incur the censure of ostentation i am persuaded that it would be susceptible of entertainment as well as information  at present i shall content myself with a single observation the biographers who under the reigns of diocletian and constantine composed or rather compiled the lives of the emperors from hadrian to the sons of carus are usually mentioned under the names of aelius spartianus julius capitolinus aelius lampridius vulcatius gallicanus trebellius pollio and flavius vopiscus but there is so much perplexity in the titles of the mss and so many disputes have arisen among the critics

of the decline and fall of the roman empire chap   the extent and military force of the empire in the age of the antonines in the second century of the christian era the empire of rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth and the most civilized introduction portion of mankind the frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor the gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury the image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence the roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government during a happy period of more than a d       0 fourscore years the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of nerva trajan hadrian and the two antonines it is the design of this and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous condition of their empire and afterward from the death of marcus antoninus to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of the earth  the principal conquests of the romans were moderation of augustus achieved under the republic and the emperors for the most part were satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the policy of the senate the active emulation of the consuls and the martial enthusiasm of the people the seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs but it was reserved for augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth and to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils inclined to peace by his temper and situation it was easy for him to discover that rome in her present exalted situation had much lss to hope than to fear from the chance of arms and that in the prosecution of remote wars the undertaking became every day more difficult the event more doubtful and the possession more precarious and less beneficial the experience of augustus added weight to these salutary reflections and effectually convinced him that by the prudent vigor of his counsels it would be easy to secure every concession which the safety or the dignity of rome might require from the most formidable barbarians instead of exposing his person and his legions to the arrows of the parthians he obtained by an honorable treaty the restitution of the standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of crassus dion cassius l live p     with the annotations of reymar who has collected all that roman vanity has left upon the subject the marble of ancyra on which augustus recorded his own exploits asserts that he compelled the parthians to restore the ensigns of crassus   his generals in the early part of his reign attempted the reduction of aethiopia and arabia felix they marched near a thousand miles to the south of the tropic but the heat of the climate soon repelled the invaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions strabo l xvi p   0 pliny the elder hist nature l vi c       and dion cassius l liii p     and l live p     have left us very curious details concerning these wars the romans made themselves masters of mariaba or merab a city of arabia felix well known to the orientals see abulfeda and the nubian geography p    they were arrived within three days journey of the spice country the rich object of their invasion  the northern countries of europe scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest the forests and morasses of germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians who despised life when it was separated from freedom and though on the first attack they seemed to yield to the weight of the roman power they soon by a signal act of despair regained their independence and reminded augustus of the vicissitude of fortune by the slaughter of varus and his three legions see the first book of the annals of tacitus sueton in august c    and velleius paterculus l ii c     etc augustus did not receive the melancholy news with all the temper and firmness that might have been expected from his character  on the death of that emperor his testament was publicly read in the senate he bequeathed as a valuable legacy to his successors the advice of confining the empire within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries on the west the atlantic ocean the rhine and danube on the north the euphrates on the east and toward the south the sandy deserts of arabia and africa tacit annal l ii dion cassius l lvi p     and the speech of augustus himself in julians caesars it receives great light from the learned notes of his french translator m spanheim   happily for the repose of mankind the moderate imitated by his successors system recommended by the wisdom of augustus was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors engaged in the pursuit of pleasure or in the exercise of tyranny the first caesars seldom showed themselves to the armies or to the provinces nor were they disposed to suffer that those triumphs which their indolence neglected should be usurped by the conduct and valor of their lieutenants the military fame of a subject was considered as an insolent invasion of the imperial prerogative and it became the duty as well as interest of every roman general to guard the frontiers entrusted to his care without aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished barbarians germanicus suetonius paulinus and agricola were checked and recalled in the course of their victories corbulo was put to death military merit as it is admirably expressed by tacitus was in the strictest sense of the word imperatoria virtus   the only accession which the roman empire conquest of britain was the first exception to it received during the first century of the christian era was the province of britain in this single instance the successors of caesar and augustus were persuaded to follow the example of the former rather than the precept of the latter the proximity of its situation to the coast of gaul seemed to invite their arms the pleasing though doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice caesar himself conceals that ignoble motive but it is mentioned by suetonius c    the british pearls proved however of little value on account of their dark and livid color tacitus observes with reason in agricola c    that it was an inherent defect ego facilius crediderim naturam margaritis deesse quam nobis avaritiam  and as britain was viewed in the light of a distinct and insulated world the conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system of continental measures after a war of about forty years undertaken by the most stupid claudius nero and domitian a hope is expressed by pomponius mela l iii c   he wrote under claudius that by the success of the roman arms the island and its savage inhabitants would soon be better known it is amusing enough to peruse such passages in the midst of london  maintained by the most dissolute and terminated by the most timid of all the emperors the far greater part of the island submitted to the roman yoke see the admirable abridgment given by tacitus in the life of agricola and copiously though perhaps not completely illustrated by our own antiquarians camden and horsley  the various tribes of britons possessed valor without conduct and the love of freedom without the spirit of union they took up arms with savage fierceness they laid them down or turned them against each other with wild inconstancy and while they fought singly they were successively subdued neither the fortitude of caractacus nor the despair of boadicea nor the fanaticism of the druids could avert the slavery of their country or resist the steady progress of the imperial generals who maintained the national glory when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or the most vicious of mankind at the very time when domitian confined to his palace felt the terrors which he inspired his legions under the command of the virtuous agricola defeated the collected force of the caledonians at the foot of the grampian hills and his fleets venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation displayed the roman arms round every part of the island the conquest of britain was considered as already achieved and it was the design of agricola to complete and ensure his success by the easy reduction of ireland for which in his opinion one legion and a few auxiliaries were sufficient the irish writers jealous of their national honor are extremely provoked on this occasion both with tacitus and with agricola  the western isle might be improved into a valuable possession and the britons would wear their chains with the less reluctance if the prospect and example of freedom was on every side removed from before their eyes  but the superior merit of agricola soon occasioned his removal from the government of britain and for ever disappointed this rational though extensive scheme of conquest before his departure the prudent general had provided for security as well as for dominion he had observed that the island is almost divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs or as they are now called the friths of scotland across the narrow interval of about forty miles he had drawn a line of military stations which was afterward fortified in the reign of antoninus pius by a turf rampart erected on foundations of stone see horsleys britannia romana l i c  0  this wall of antoninus at a small distance beyond the modern cities of edinburgh and glasgow was fixed as the limit of the roman province the native caledonians preserved in the northern extremity of the island their wild independence for which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valor their incursions were frequently repelled and chastised but their country was never subdued the poet buchanan celebrates with elegance and spirit see his sylvae v the unviolated independence of his native country but if the single testimony of richard of

des inscriptions tom xxviii p            trajan was ambitious of fame and as long as conquests of trajan in the east mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of the most exalted characters the praises of alexander transmitted by a succession of poets and historians had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of trajan like him the roman emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east but he lamented with a sigh that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of philip trajans sentiments are represented in a very just and lively manner in the caesars of julian  yet the success of trajan however transient was rapid and specious the degenerate parthians broken by intestine discord fled before his arms he descended the river tigris in triumph from the mountains of armenia to the persian gulf he enjoyed the honor of being the first as he was the last of the roman generals who ever navigated that remote sea his fleets ravaged the coasts of arabia and trajan vainly flattered himself that he was approaching toward the confines of india eutropius and sextus rufus have endeavored to perpetuate the illusion see a very sensible dissertation of m freret in the academie des inscriptions tom xxi p     every day the astonished senate received the intelligence of new names and new nations that acknowledged his sway they were informed that the kings of bosphorus colchos iberia albania osrhoene and even the parthian

armenia mesopotamia and assyria were reduced into the state of provinces dion cassius l lxviii and the abbreviators  but the death of trajan soon clouded the splendid prospect and it was justly to be dreaded that so many distant nations would throw off the unaccustomed yoke when they were no longer restrained by the powerful hand which had imposed it  it was an ancient tradition that when the capitol resigned by his successor adrian was founded by one of the roman kings the god terminus who presided over boundaries and was represented according to the fashion of that age by a large stone alone among all the inferior deities refused to yield his place to jupiter himself a favorable inference was drawn from his obstinacy which was interpreted by the augurs as a sure presage that the boundaries of the roman power would never recede ovid fast l ii ver     see livy and dionysius of halicarnassus under the reign of tarquin  during many ages the prediction as it is usual contributed to its own accomplishment but though terminus had resisted the majesty of jupiter he submitted to the authority of the emperor hadrian st augustine is highly delighted with the proof of the weakness of terminus and the vanity of the augurs see de civitate dei iv     the resignation of all the eastern conquests of trajan was the first measure of his reign he restored to the parthians the election of an independent sovereign withdrew the roman garrisons from the provinces of armenia mesopotamia and assyria and in compliance with the precept of augustus once more established the euphrates as the frontier of the empire see the augustan history p   jeromes chronicle and all the epitomisers it is somewhat surprising that this memorable event should be omitted by dion or rather by xiphilin  censure which arraigns the public actions and the private motives of princes has ascribed to envy a conduct which might be attributed to the prudence and moderation of hadrian the various character of that emperor capable by turns of the meanest and the most generous sentiments may afford some color to the suspicion it was however scarcely in his power to place the superiority of his predecessor in a more conspicuous light than by thus confessing himself unequal to the task of defending the conquests of trajan  the martial and ambitious spirit of trajan contrast of hadrian and antoninus pius formed a very singular contrast with the moderation of his successor the restless activity of hadrian was not less remarkable when compared with the gentle repose of antoninus pius the life of the former was almost a perpetual journey and as he possessed the various talents of the soldier the statesman and the scholar he gratified his curiosity in the discharge of his duty careless of the difference of seasons and of climates he marched on foot and bareheaded over the snows of caledonia and the sultry plains of the upper egypt nor was there a province of the empire which in the course of his reign was not honored with the presence of the monarch dion l lxix p      hist august p     if all our historians were lost medals inscriptions and other monuments would be sufficient to record the travels of hadrian  but the tranquil life of antoninus pius was spent in the bosom of italy and during the twentythree years that he directed the public administration the longest journies of that amiable prince extended no farther than from his palace in rome to the retirement of his lanuvian villa see the augustan history and the epitomes   notwithstanding this difference in their personal pacific system of hadrian and the two antonines conduct the general system of augustus was equally adopted and uniformly pursued by hadrian and by the two antonines they persisted in the design of maintaining the dignity of the empire without attempting to enlarge its limits by every honorable expedient they invited the friendship of the barbarians and endeavored to convince mankind that the roman power raised above the temptation of conquest was actuated only by the love of order and justice during a long period of fortythree years their virtuous labors were crowned with success and if we except a few slight hostilities that served to exercise the legions of the frontier the reigns of hadrian and antoninus pius offer the fair prospect of universal peace we must however remember that in the time of hadrian a rebellion of the jews raged with religious fury though only in a single province pausanias l viii c    mentions two necessary and successful wars conducted by the generals of pius  st against the wandering moors who were driven into the solitudes of atlas  d against the brigantes of britain who had invaded the roman province both these wars with several other hostilities are mentioned in the augustan history p     the roman name was revered among the most remote nations of the earth the fiercest barbarians frequently submitted their differences to the arbitration of the emperor and we are informed by a cotemporary historian that he had seen ambassadors who were refused the honor which they came to solicit of being admitted into the rank of subjects appian of alexandria in the preface to his history of the roman wars   the terror of the roman arms added weight defensive wars of marcus antoninus and dignity to the moderation of the emperors they preserved peace by a constant preparation for war and while justice regulated their conduct they announced to the nations on their confines that they were as little disposed to endure as to offer an injury the military strength which it had been sufficient for hadrian and the elder antoninus to display was exerted against the parthians and the germans by the emperor marcus the hostilities of the barbarians provoked the resentment of that philosophic monarch and in the prosecution of a just defense marcus and his generals obtained many signal victories both on the euphrates and on the danube dion l lxxi hist august in marco the parthian victories gave birth to a crowd of contemptible historians whose memory has been rescued from oblivion and exposed to ridicule in a very lively piece of criticism of lucian  the military establishment of the roman empire which thus assured either its tranquillity or success will now become the proper and important object of our attention  in the purer ages of the commonwealth the military establishment of the roman emperors use of arms was reserved for those ranks of citizens who had a country to love a property to defend and some share in enacting those laws which it was their interest as well as duty to maintain but in proportion as the public freedom was lost in extent of conquest war was gradually improved into an art and degraded into a trade the poorest rank of soldiers possessed above forty pounds sterling dionys halicarn iv    a very high qualification at a time when money was so scarce that an ounce of silver was equivalent to seventy pound weight of brass the populace excluded by the ancient constitution were indiscriminately admitted by marius see sallust de bell jugurth c     the legions themselves even at the time when they were recruited in the most distant provinces were supposed to consist of roman citizens that distinction was generally considered either as a legal qualification or as a proper recompense for the soldier but a more serious regard was paid to the essential merit of age strength and military stature caesar formed his legion alauda of gauls and strangers but it was during the license of civil war and after the victory he gave them the freedom of the city for their reward  in all levies a just preference was given to the climates of the north over those of the south the race of men born to the exercise of arms was sought for in the country rather than in cities and it was very reasonably presumed that the hardy occupations of smiths carpenters and huntsmen would supply more vigor and resolution than the sedentary trades which are employed in the service of luxury see vegetius de re militari l i c       after every qualification of property had been laid aside the armies of the roman emperors were still commanded for the most part by officers of a liberal birth and education but the common soldiers like the mercenary troops of modern europe were drawn from the meanest and very frequently from the most profligate of mankind  that public virtue which among the ancients discipline was denominated patriotism is derived from a strong sense of our own interest in the preservation and prosperity of the free government of which we are members such a sentiment which had rendered the legions of the republic almost invincible could make but a very feeble impression on the mercenary servants of a despotic prince and it became necessary to supply that defect by other motives of a different but not less forcible nature honor and religion the peasant or mechanic imbibed the useful prejudice that he was advanced to the more dignified profession of arms in which his rank and reputation would depend on his own valor and that although the prowess of a private soldier must often escape the notice of fame his own behavior might sometimes confer glory or disgrace on the company the legion or even the army to whose honors he was associated on his first entrance into the service an oath was administered to him with every circumstance of solemnity he promised never to desert his standard to submit his own will to the commands of his leaders and to sacrifice his life for the safety of the emperor and the empire the oath of service and fidelity to the emperor was annually renewed by the troops on the first of january  the attachment of the roman troops to their standards was inspired by the united influence of religion and of honor the golden eagle which glittered in the front of the legion was the object of their fondest devotion nor was it esteemed less impious than it was ignominious to abandon that sacred ensign in the hour of danger tacitus calls the roman eagles bellorum deos they were placed in a chapel in the camp and with the other deities received the religious worship of the troops  these motives which derived their strength from the imagination were enforced by fears and hopes of a more substantial kind regular pay occasional donatives and a stated recompense after the appointed time of service alleviated the hardships of the military life see gronovius de pecunia vetere l iii p   0 etc the emperor domitian raised the annual stipend of the legionaries to twelve pieces of gold which in his time was equivalent to about ten of our guineas this pay somewhat higher than our own had been and was afterward gradually increased according to the progress of wealth and military government after twenty years service the veteran received three thousand denarii about one hundred pounds sterling or a proportionable allowance of land the pay and advantages of the guards were in general about double those of the legions  whilst on the other hand it was impossible for cowardice or disobedience to escape the severest punishment the centurions were authorized to chastise with blows the generals had a right to punish with death and it was an inflexible maxim of roman discipline that a good soldier should dread his officers far more than the enemy from such laudable arts did the valor of the imperial troops receive a degree of firmness and docility unattainable by the impetuous and irregular passions of barbarians  and yet so sensible were the romans of the exercises imperfection of valor without skill and practice that in their language the name of an army was borrowed from the word which signified exercise exercitus ab exercitando varro de lingua latina l iv cicero in tusculan l ii    there is room for a very interesting work which should lay open the connection between the languages and manners of nations  military exercises were the important and unremitted object of their discipline the recruits and young soldiers were constantly trained both in the morning and in the evening nor was age or knowledge allowed to excuse the veterans from the daily repetition of what they had completely learnt large sheds were erected in the winter quarters of the troops that their useful labors might not receive any interruption from the most tempestuous weather and it was carefully observed that the arms destined to this imitation of war should be of double the weight which was required in real action vegetius l ii and the rest of his first book  it is not the purpose of this work to enter into any minute description of the roman exercises we shall only remark that they comprehended whatever could add strength to the body activity to the limbs or grace to the motions the soldiers were diligently instructed to march to run to leap to swim to carry heavy burdens to handle every species of arms that was used either for offense or for defense either in distant engagement or in a closer onset to form a variety of evolutions and to move to the sound of flutes in the pyrrhic or martial dance the pyrrhic dance is extremely well illustrated by m le beau in the academic des inscriptions tom xxxv p     etc that learned academician in a series of memoirs has collected all the passages of the ancients that relate to the roman legion  in the midst of peace the roman troops familiarised themselves with the practice of war and it is prettily remarked by an ancient historian who had fought against them that the effusion of blood was the only circumstance which distinguished a field of battle from a field of exercise joseph de bell judaico l iii c   we are indebted to this jew for some very curious details of roman discipline  it was the policy of the ablest generals and even of the emperors themselves to encourage these military studies by their presence and example and we are informed that hadrian as well as trajan frequently condescended to instruct the unexperienced soldiers to reward the diligent and sometimes to dispute with them the prize of superior strength or dexterity plin panegyr c    life of hadrian in the augustan history  under the reigns of those princes the science of tactics was cultivated with success and as long as the empire retained any vigor their military instructions were respected as the most perfect model of roman discipline  nine centuries of war had gradually introduced the legions under the emperors into the service many alterations and improvements the legions as they are described by polybius see an admirable digression on the roman discipline in the sixth book of his history  in the time of the punic wars differed very materially from those which achieved the victories of caesar or defended the monarchy of hadrian and the antonines the constitution of the imperial legion may be described in a few words vegetius de re militari l ii c   etc considerable part of his very perplexed abridgment was taken from the regulations of trajan and hadrian and the legion as he describes it cannot suit any other age of the roman empire  the heavyarmed infantry which composed its principal strength vegetius de re militari l ii c   in the purer age of caesar and cicero the word miles was almost confined to the infantry under the lower empire and in the times of chivalry it was appropriated almost as exclusively to the men at arms who fought on horseback  was divided into ten cohorts and fiftyfive companies under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions the first cohort which always claimed the post of honor and the custody of the eagle was formed of eleven hundred and five soldiers the most approved for valor and fidelity the remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five hundred and fiftyfive and the whole body of legionary infantry amounted to six thousand one hundred men their arms were uniform and admirably arms adapted to the nature of their service an open helmet with a lofty crest a breast plate or coat of mail greaves on their legs and an ample buckler on their left arm the buckler was of an oblong and concave figure four feet in length and two and an half in breadth framed of a light wood covered with a bulls hide and strongly guarded with plates of brass besides a lighter spear the legionary soldier grasped in his right hand the formidable pilum a ponderous javelin whose utmost length was about six feet and which was terminated by a massy triangular point of steel of eighteen inches in the time of polybius and dionysius of halicarnassus l v c    the steel point of the pilum seems to have been much longer in the time of vegetius it was reduced to a foot or even nine inches i have chosen a medium  this instrument was indeed much inferior to our modern firearms since it was exhausted by a single discharge at the distance of only ten or twelve paces yet when it was launched by a firm and skilful hand there was not any cavalry that durst venture within its reach nor any shield or corslet that could sustain the impetuosity of its weight as soon as the roman had darted his pilum he drew his sword and rushed forwards to close with the enemy his sword was a short welltempered spanish blade that carried a double edge and was alike suited to the purpose of striking or of pushing but the soldier was always instructed to prefer the latter use of his weapon as his own body remained less exposed whilst he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his adversary for the legionary arms see lipsius de militia romana l iii c       the legion was usually drawn up eight deep and the regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well as ranks see the beautiful comparison of virgil georgic ii v      a body of troops habituated to preserve this open order in a long front and a rapid charge found themselves prepared to execute every disposition which the circumstances of war or the skill of their leader might suggest the soldier possessed a free space for his arms and motions and sufficient intervals were allowed

subject like a scholar and an officer  the tactics of the greeks and macedonians were formed on very different principles the strength of the phalanx depended on sixteen ranks of long pikes wedged together in the closest array see arrians tactics with the true partiality of a greek arrian rather chose to describe the phalanx of which he had read than the legions which he had commanded  but it was soon discovered by reflection as well as by the event that the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend with the activity of the legion polyb l xvii   the cavalry without which the force of the cavalry legion would have remained imperfect was divided into ten troops or squadrons the first as the companion of the first cohort consisted of an hundred and thirtytwo men whilst each of the other nine amounted only to sixtysix the entire establishment formed a regiment if we may use the modern expression of seven hundred and twentysix horse naturally connected with its respective legion but occasionally separated to act in the line and to compose a part of the wings of the army veget de re militari l ii c   his positive testimony which might be supported by circumstantial evidence ought surely to silence those critics who refuse the imperial legion its proper body of cavalry  the cavalry of the emperors was no longer composed like that of the ancient republic of the noblest youths of rome and italy who by performing their military service on horseback prepared themselves for the offices of senator and consul and solicited by deeds of valor the future suffrages of their countrymen see livy almost throughout particularly xlii     since the alteration of manners and government the most wealthy of the equestrian order were engaged in the administration of justice and of the revenue plin hist nature xxxiii   the true sense of that very curious passage was first discovered and illustrated by m de beaufort republique roman l ii c    and whenever they embraced the profession of arms they were immediately entrusted with a troop of horse or a cohort of foot as in the instance of horace and agricola this appears to have been a defect in the roman discipline which hadrian endeavored to remedy by ascertaining the legal age of a tribune  trajan and hadrian formed their cavalry from the same provinces and the same class of their subjects which recruited the ranks of the legion the horses were bred for the most part in spain or cappadocia the roman troopers despised the complete armor with which the cavalry of the east was encumbered their more useful arms consisted in a helmet an oblong shield light boots and a coat of mail a javelin and a long broad sword were their principal weapons of offense the use of lances and of iron maces they seem to have borrowed from the barbarians see arrians tactics   the safety and honor of the empire was principally auxiliaries entrusted to the legions but the policy of rome condescended to adopt every useful instrument of war considerable levies were regularly made among the provincials who had not yet deserved the honorable distinction of romans many dependant princes and communities dispersed round the frontiers were permitted for a while to hold their freedom and security by the tenure of military service such in particular was the state of the batavians tacit germania c     even select troops of hostile barbarians were frequently compelled or persuaded to consume their dangerous valor in remote climates and for the benefit of the state marcus antoninus obliged the vanquished quadi and marcomanni to supply him with a large body of troops which he immediately sent into britain dion cassius l lxxi  all these were included under the general name of auxiliaries and howsoever they might vary according to the difference of times and circumstances their numbers were seldom much inferior to those of the legions themselves tacit annal iv   those who fix a regular proportion of as many foot and twice as many horse confound the auxiliaries of the emperors with the italian allies of the republic  among the auxiliaries the bravest and most faithful bands were placed under the command of praefects and centurions and severely trained in the arts of roman discipline but the far greater part retained those arms to which the nature of their country or their early habits of life more peculiarly adapted them by this institution each legion to whom a certain proportion of auxiliaries was allotted contained within itself every species of lighter troops and of missile weapons and was capable of encountering every nation with the advantages of its respective arms and discipline vegetius ii   arrian in his order of march and battle against the alani  nor was the legion artillery destitute of what in modern language would be styled a train of artillery it consisted in ten military engines of the largest and fiftyfive of a smaller size but all of which either in an oblique or horizontal manner discharged stones and darts with irresistible violence the subject of the ancient machines is treated with great knowledge and ingenuity by the chevalier folard polybe tom ii p        0 he prefers them in many respects to our modern cannon and mortars we may observe that the use of them in the field gradually became more prevalent in proportion as personal valor and military skill declined with the roman empire when men were no longer found their place was supplied by machines see vegetius ii    arrian   the camp of a roman legion presented the encampment appearance of a fortified city vegetius finishes his second book and the description of the legion with the following emphatic words universa quae in quoque belli genere necessaria esse creduntur secum legio debet ubique portare ut in quovis loco fixerit castra armatam faciat civitatem  as soon as the space was marked out the pioneers carefully levelled the ground and removed every impediment that might interrupt its perfect regularity its form was an exact quadrangle and we may calculate that a square of about seven hundred yards was sufficient for the encampment of twenty thousand romans though a similar number of our own troops would expose to the enemy a front of more than treble that extent in the midst of the camp the praetorium or generals quarters rose above the others the cavalry the infantry and the auxiliaries occupied their respective stations the streets were broad and perfectly straight and a vacant space of two hundred feet was left on all sides between the tents and the rampart the rampart itself was usually twelve feet high armed with a line of strong and intricate palisades and defended by a ditch of twelve feet in depth as well as in breadth this important labor was performed by the hands of the legionaries themselves to whom the use of the spade and the pickaxe was no less familiar than that of the sword or pilum active valor may often be the present of

auxiliaries formed the first line and were seconded or sustained by the strength of the legions the cavalry covered the flanks and the military engines were placed in the rear  such were the arts of war by which the roman number and disposition of the legions emperors defended their extensive conquests and preserved a military spirit at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and despotism if in the consideration of their armies we pass from their discipline to their numbers we shall not find it easy to define them with any tolerable accuracy we may compute however that the legion which was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and thirtyone romans might with its attendant auxiliaries amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men the peace establishment of hadrian and his successors was composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades and most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and seventyfive thousand men instead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities which the romans considered as the refuge of weakness or pusillanimity the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers and along the frontiers of the barbarians as their stations for the most part remained fixed and permanent we may venture to describe the distribution of the troops three legions were sufficient for britain the principal strength lay upon the rhine and danube and consisted of sixteen legions in the following proportions two in the lower and three in the upper germany one in rhaetia one in noricum four in pannonia three in maesia and two in dacia the defense of the euphrates was entrusted to eight legions six of whom were planted in syria and the other two in cappadocia with regard to egypt africa and spain as they were far removed from any important scene of war a single legion maintained the domestic tranquillity of each of those great provinces even italy was not left destitute of a military force above twenty thousand chosen soldiers distinguished by the titles of city cohorts and praetorian guards watched over the safety of the monarch and the capital as the authors of almost every revolution that distracted the empire the praetorians will very soon and very loudly demand our attention but in their arms and institutions we cannot find any circumstance which discriminated them from the legions unless it were a more splendid appearance and a less rigid discipline tacitus annal iv   has given us a state of the legions under tiberius and dion cassius l lv p     under alexander severus i have endeavored to fix on the proper medium between these two periods see likewise lipsius de magnitudine romana l i c       the navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to their greatness but it was navy fully sufficient for every useful purpose of government the ambition of the romans was confined to the land nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the enterprising spirit which had prompted the navigators of tire of carthage and even of marseilles to enlarge the bounds of the world and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean to the romans the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of curiosity the romans tried to disguise by the pretense of religious awe their ignorance and terror see tacit germania c     the whole extent of the mediterranean after the destruction of carthage and the extirpation of the pirates was included within their provinces the policy of the emperors was directed only to preserve the peaceful dominion of that sea and to protect the commerce of their subjects with these moderate views augustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most convenient ports of italy the one at ravenna on the adriatic the other at misenum in the bay of naples experience seems at length to have convinced the ancients that as soon as their galleys exceeded two or at the most three ranks of oars they were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service augustus himself in the victory of actium had seen the superiority of his own light frigates they were called liburnians over the lofty but unwieldy castles of his rival plutarch in marc anton and yet if we may credit orosius these monstrous castles were no more than ten feet above the water vi     of these liburnians he composed the two fleets of ravenna and misenum destined to command the one the eastern the other the western division of the mediterranean and to each of the squadrons he attached a body of several thousand marines besides these two ports which may be considered as the principal seats of the roman navy a very considerable force was stationed at frejus on the coast of provence and the euxine was guarded by forty ships and three thousand soldiers to all these we add the fleet which preserved the communication between gaul and britain and a great number of vessels constantly maintained on the rhine and danube to harass the country or to intercept the passage of the barbarians see lipsius de magnitud romans l i c   the sixteen last chapters of vegetius relate to naval affairs  if we review this general state of the imperial forces of the cavalry as well as infantry of the legions the auxiliaries the guards and the navy the most liberal computation will not allow us to fix the entire establishment by sea and by land at more than four hundred and fifty thousand amount of the whole establishment men a military power which however formidable it may seem was equalled by a monarch of the last century whose kingdom was confined within a single province of the roman empire voltaire siecle de louis xiv c    it must however be remembered that france still feels that extraordinary effort   we have attempted to explain the spirit which view of the provinces of the roman empire moderated and the strength which supported the power of hadrian and the antonines we shall now endeavor with clearness and precision to describe the provinces

invariably preserved the same natural limits the pyrenaean mountains the mediterranean and the atlantic ocean that great peninsula at present so unequally divided between two sovereigns was distributed by augustus into three provinces lusitania baetica and tarraconensis the kingdom of portugal now fills the place of the warlike country of the lusitanians and the loss sustained by the former on the side of the east is compensated by an accession of territory toward the north the confines of grenada and andalusia correspond with those of ancient baetica the remainder of spain

asia minor emperors the provinces of asia without excepting the transient conquests of trajan are all comprehended within the limits of the turkish power but instead of following the arbitrary divisions of despotism and ignorance it will be safer for us as well as more agreeable to observe the indelible characters of nature the name of asia minor is attributed with some propriety to the peninsula which confined between the euxine and the mediterranean advances from the euphrates toward europe the most extensive and flourishing district westward of mount taurus and the river halys was dignified by the romans with the exclusive title of asia the jurisdiction of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of troy lydia and phrygia the maritime countries of the pamphylians

their ancestors whilst in civil honors and advantages they were exalted by just degrees to an equality with their conquerors  i the policy of the emperors and the senate as far as it concerned religion was happily seconded by the reflections of the enlightened and universal spirit of toleration by the habits of the superstitious part of their subjects the various modes of worship which prevailed in the roman world were all considered by the people as equally true by the philosopher as equally false and by the magistrate as equally useful and thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence but even religious concord  the superstition of the people was not embittered of the people by any mixture of theological rancour nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative system

  the philosophers of greece deduced their morals of philosophers from the nature of man rather than from that of god they meditated however on the divine nature as a very curious and important speculation and in the profound inquiry they displayed the strength and weakness of the human understanding the admirable work of cicero de natura deorum is she best clue we have to guide us through the dark and profound abyss he represents with candor and confutes with subtlety the opinions of the philosophers  of the four most celebrated schools the stoics and the platonists endeavored to reconcile the jarring interests of reason and piety they have left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections of the first cause but as it was impossible for them to conceive the creation of matter the workman in the stoic philosophy was not sufficiently distinguished from the work whilst on the contrary the spiritual god of plato and his disciples resembled an idea rather than a substance the opinions of the academics and epicureans were of a less religious cast but whilst the modest science of the former induced them to doubt the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny the providence of a supreme ruler the spirit of inquiry prompted by emulation and supported by freedom had divided the public teachers of philosophy into a variety of contending sects but the ingenuous youth who from every part resorted to athens and the other seats of learning in the roman empire were alike instructed in every school to reject and to despise the religion of the multitude how indeed was it possible that a philosopher should accept as divine truths the idle tales of the poets and the incoherent traditions of antiquity or that he should adore as gods those imperfect beings whom he must have despised as men against such unworthy adversaries cicero condescended to employ the arms of reason and eloquence but the satire of lucian was a much more adequate as well as more efficacious weapon we may be well assured that a writer conversant with the world would never have ventured to expose the gods of his country to public ridicule had they not already been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and enlightened orders of society i do not pretend to assert that in this irreligious age the natural terrors of superstition dreams omens apparitions etc had lost their efficacy   notwithstanding the fashionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of the antonines both the interests of the priests and the credulity of the people were sufficiently respected in their writings and conversation the philosophers of antiquity asserted the independent dignity of reason but they resigned their actions to the commands of law and of custom viewing with a smile of pity and indulgence the various errors of the vulgar they diligently practiced the ceremonies of their fathers devoutly frequented the temples of the gods and sometimes condescending to act a part on the theater of superstition they concealed the sentiments of an atheist under the sacerdotal robes reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about their respective modes of faith or of worship it was indifferent to them what shape the folly of the multitude might choose to assume and they approached with the same inward contempt and the same external reverence the altars of the lybian the olympian or the capitoline jupiter socrates epicurus cicero and plutarch always inculcated a decent reverence for the religion of their own country and of mankind the devotion of epicurus was assiduous and exemplary diogen laert x  0   it is not easy to conceive from what motives a of the magistrate spirit of persecution could introduce itself into the roman councils the magistrates could not be actuated by a blind though honest bigotry since the magistrates were themselves philosophers and the schools of athens had given laws to the senate they could not be impelled

had honorably spent their youth throughout the empire but more particularly in the western parts the most fertile districts and the most convenient situations were reserved for the establishment of colonies some of which were of a civil and others of a military nature in their manners and internal policy the colonies formed a perfect representation of their great parent and they were soon

taste to relinquish their language and too much vanity to adopt any foreign institutions still preserving the prejudices after they had lost the virtues of their ancestors they affected to despise the unpolished manners of the roman conquerors whilst they were compelled to respect their superior wisdom and power there is not i believe from dionysius to libanius a single greek critic who mentions virgil or horace they seem ignorant that the romans had any good writers  nor was the influence of the grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow limits of that once celebrated country their empire by the progress of colonies and conquest had been diffused from the hadriatic to the euphrates and the nile asia was covered with greek cities and the long reign of the macedonian kings had introduced a silent revolution into syria and egypt in their pompous courts those princes united the elegance of athens with the luxury of the east and the example of the court was imitated at an humble distance by the higher ranks of their subjects such was the general division of the roman empire into the latin and greek languages to these we may add a third distinction for the body of the natives in syria and especially in egypt the use of their ancient dialects by secluding them from the commerce of mankind checked the improvements of those barbarians the curious reader may see in

amusements of the romans were not suffered to interfere with their sound maxims of policy whilst they acknowledged the charms of the greek they asserted the dignity of the latin tongue and the exclusive use of the latter was inflexibly maintained in the administration of civil as well as military government see valerius maximus l ii c   n   the emperor claudius disfranchised an eminent

of the master the humanity of the latter instead of being restrained by fear was encouraged by the sense of his own interest the progress of manners was accelerated by the virtue or policy of the emperors and by the edicts of hadrian and the antonines the protection of the laws was extended to the most abject part of mankind the jurisdiction of life and death over the slaves a power long exercised and often abused was taken out of private hands and reserved to the magistrates alone the subterraneous prisons were abolished and upon a just complaint of intolerable treatment the injured

expect that the diligence and fidelity of a few years would be rewarded with the inestimable gift of freedom the benevolence of the master was so frequently prompted by the meaner suggestions of vanity and avarice that the laws found it more necessary to restrain than to encourage a profuse and undistinguishing liberality which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuse see another dissertation of m de burigny in the xxxviith volume on the roman freedmen  it was a maxim of ancient jurisprudence that a slave had not any country of his own he acquired with his liberty an admission into the political society of which his patron was a member the consequences of this maxim would have prostituted the privileges of the roman city to a mean and promiscuous multitude some seasonable exceptions were therefore provided and the honorable distinction was confined to such slaves only as for just causes and with the approbation of the magistrate should receive a solemn and legal manumission even these chosen freedmen obtained no more than the private rights of citizens and were rigorously excluded from civil or military honors whatever might be the merit or fortune of their

citizens of provincials and of slaves cannot now be fixed with such a degree of accuracy as the importance of the object would deserve we are informed that when the emperor claudius exercised the office of censor he took an account of six millions nine hundred and fortyfive thousand roman citizens who with the proportion of women and children must have amounted to about twenty millions of souls the multitude of subjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating but after weighing with attention every circumstance which could influence the balance it seems probable that there existed in the time of claudius about twice as many provincials as there were citizens of either sex and of every age and that the slaves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of the roman world the total amount of this imperfect calculation would rise to about one hundred and twenty millions of persons a degree of population which possibly exceeds that of modern europe compute twenty millions in france twentytwo in germany four in hungary ten in italy with its islands eight in great britain and ireland eight in spain and portugal ten or twelve in the european russia six in poland six in greece and turkey four in sweden three in denmark and norway four in the low countries the whole would amount to one hundred and five or one hundred and seven millions see voltaire de

architecture roman monuments constructed by the romans how many have escaped the notice of history how few have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism and yet even the majestic ruins that are still scattered over italy and the provinces would be sufficient to prove that those countries were once the seat of a polite and powerful empire their greatness alone or their beauty might deserve our attention but they are rendered more interesting by two important circumstances which connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful history of human manners many of those works were erected at private expense and almost all were intended for public benefit  it is natural to suppose that the greatest number many of them erected at private expense as well as the most considerable of the roman edifices were raised by the emperors who possessed so unbounded a command both of men and money augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found his capital of brick and that he had left it of marble sueton in august c    augustus built in rome the temple and forum of mars the avenger the temple of jupiter tonans in the capitol that of apollo palatine with public libraries the portico and basilica of caius and lucius the porticoes of livia and octavia and the theater of marcellus the example of the sovereign was imitated by his ministers and generals and his friend agrippa left behind him the immortal monument of the pantheon  the strict economy of vespasian was the source of his magnificence the works of trajan bear the stamp of his genius the public monuments with which hadrian adorned every province of the empire were executed not only by his orders but under his immediate inspection he was himself an artist and he loved the arts as they conduced to the glory of the monarch they were encouraged by the antonines as they contributed to the happiness of the people but if the emperors were the first they were not the only architects of their dominions their example was universally imitated by their principal subjects who were not afraid of declaring to the world that they had spirit to conceive and wealth to accomplish the noblest undertakings scarcely had the proud structure of the coliseum been dedicated at rome before the edifices of a smaller scale indeed but of the same design and materials were erected for the use and at

an old house the last remains of his patrimony according to the rigor of law the emperor might have asserted his claim and the prudent atticus prevented by a frank confession the officiousness of informers but the equitable nerva who then filled the throne refused to accept any part of it and commanded him to use without scruple the present of fortune the cautious athenian still insisted that the treasure was too considerable for a subject and that he knew not how to use it abuse it then replied the monarch with a goodnatured peevishness for it is your own hadrian afterward made a very equitable regulation which divided all treasuretrove between the right of property and that of discovery hist august p    many will be of opinion that atticus literally obeyed the emperors last

world was unequally divided the east was in the immemorial possession of arts and luxury whilst the west was inhabited by rude and warlike barbarians who either disdained agriculture or to whom it was totally unknown under the protection of an established government the productions of happier climates and the industry of more civilized nations were gradually introduced into the western countries of europe and the natives were encouraged by an open and profitable commerce to multiply the former as well as to improve the latter it would be almost impossible to enumerate all the articles either of the animal or the vegetable reign which were successively imported into europe from asia and egypt it is not improbable that the greeks and phoenicians introduced some new arts and productions into the neighborhood of marseilles and gades  but it will not be unworthy of the dignity and much less of the utility of an historical work slightly to touch on a few of the principal heads   almost all the flowers the introduction of fruits etc herbs and the fruits that grow in our european gardens are of foreign extraction which in many cases is betrayed even by their names the apple was a native of italy and when the romans had tasted the richer flavor of the apricot the peach the pomegranate the citron and the orange they contented themselves with applying to all these new fruits the common denomination of apple discriminating them from each other by the additional epithet of their country   in the vine the time of homer the vine grew wild in the island of sicily and most probably in the

subsistence of the poor the elegant treatise of columella general plenty describes the advanced state of the spanish husbandry under the reign of tiberius and it may be observed that those famines which so frequently afflicted the infant republic were seldom or never experienced by the extensive empire of rome the accidental scarcity in any single province was immediately relieved by the plenty of its more fortunate neighbors  agriculture is the foundation of manufactures since the productions of nature are the materials of art under the roman empire the labor of arts of luxury an industrious and ingenious people was variously but incessantly employed in the service of the rich in their dress their table their houses and their furniture the favorites of fortune united every refinement of convenience of elegance and of splendor whatever could sooth their pride or gratify their sensuality such refinements under the odious name of luxury have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue as well as happiness of mankind if all possessed the necessaries and none the superfluities of life but in the present imperfect condition of society luxury though it may proceed from vice or folly seems to be the only means that can correct the unequal distribution of property the diligent mechanic and the skilful artist who have obtained no share in the division of the earth receive a voluntary tax from the possessors of land and the latter are prompted by a sense of interest to improve those estates with whose produce they may purchase additional pleasures this operation the particular effects of which are felt in every society acted with much more diffusive energy in the roman world the provinces would soon have been exhausted of their wealth if the manufactures and commerce of luxury had not insensibly restored to the industrious subjects the sums which were exacted from them by the arms and authority of rome as long as the circulation was confined within the bounds of the empire it impressed the political machine with a new degree of activity and its consequences sometimes beneficial could never become pernicious  but it is no easy task to confine luxury within foreign trade the limits of an empire the most remote countries of the ancient world were ransacked to supply the pomp

the most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried on with arabia and india every year about the time of the summer solstice a fleet of an hundred and twenty vessels sailed from myoshormos a port of egypt on the red sea by the periodical assistance of the monsoons they traversed the ocean in about forty days the coast of malabar or the island of ceylon called taprobana by the romans and screndib by the arabs it was discovered under the reign of claudius and gradually became the principal mart of the east  was the usual term of their navigation and it was in those markets that the merchants from the more remote countries of asia expected their arrival the return of the fleet of egypt was fixed to the months of december or january and as soon as their rich cargo had

roman subjects and a few individuals were enriched at the expense of the public as the natives of arabia and india were gold and silver contented with the productions and manufactures of their own country silver on the side of the romans was the principal if not the only instrument of commerce it was a complaint worthy of the gravity of the senate that in the purchase of female ornaments the wealth of the state was irrecoverably given away to foreign and hostile nations tacit annal iii    in a speech of tiberius  the annual loss is computed by a writer of an inquisitive but censorious

discontent brooding over the dark prospect of approaching poverty and yet if we compare the proportion between gold and silver as it stood in the time of pliny and as it was fixed in the reign of constantine we shall discover within that period a very considerable increase the proportion which was   to  0 and    rose to    the legal regulation of constantine see arbuthnots tables of ancient coins c v  there is not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce it is therefore evident that silver was grown more common that whatever might be the amount of the indian and arabian exports they were far from exhausting the wealth of the roman world and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the demands of commerce  notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to exalt the past and to depreciate the present the tranquil and prosperous state of the empire was warmly felt and honestly confessed by the provincials as well as romans they acknowledged general felicity that the true principles of social life laws agriculture and science which had been first invented by the wisdom of athens were now firmly established by the power of rome under whose auspicious influence the fiercest barbarians were united by an equal government and common language they affirm that with the improvement of arts the human species was visibly multiplied they

whatever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and declamation which seems to prevail in these passages the substance of them is perfectly agreeable to historic truth  it was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries decline of courage should discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and corruption this long peace and the uniform government of the romans introduced a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire the minds of men were gradually reduced to the same level the fire of genius was extinguished and even the military spirit evaporated the natives of europe were brave and robust spain gaul britain and illyricum supplied the legions with excellent soldiers and constituted the real strength of the monarchy their personal valor remained but they no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence the sense of national honor the presence of danger and the habit of command they received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign and trusted for their defense to a mercenary army the posterity of their boldest leaders was contented with the rank of citizens and subjects the most aspiring spirits resorted to the court or standard of the emperors and the deserted provinces deprived of political strength or union insensibly sunk into the languid indifference of private life  the love of letters almost inseparable from of genius peace and refinement was fashionable among the subjects of hadrian and the antonines who were themselves men of learning and curiosity it was diffused

ptolemy and the writings of galen are studied by those who have improved their discoveries and corrected their errors but if we except the inimitable lucian this age of indolence passed away without having produced a single writer of original genius or who excelled in the arts of elegant composition the authority of plato and aristotle of zerno and epicurus still reigned in the schools and their systems transmitted with blind deference from one generation of disciples to another precluded every generous attempt to exercise the powers or enlarge the limits of the human mind the beauties of the poets and orators instead of kindling a fire like their own inspired only cold and servile imitations or if any ventured to deviate from those models they deviated at the same time from good sense and propriety on the revival of letters the youthful vigor of the imagination after a long repose national emulation a new religion new languages and a new world called forth the genius of europe but the provincials of rome trained by a uniform artificial foreign education were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients who by expressing their genuine feelings in their native tongue had already occupied every place of honor the name of poet was almost forgotten that of orator was usurped by the sophists a cloud of critics of compilers of commentators darkened the face of learning and the decline of genius was soon followed by the corruption of taste  the sublime longinus who in somewhat a later period and in the court of a syrian queen preserved the spirit of ancient athens observes degeneracy and laments this degeneracy of his contemporaries which debased their sentiments enervated their courage and depressed their talents in the same manner says he as some children always remain pigmies whose infant limbs have been too closely confined thus our tender minds fettered by the prejudices and habits of a just servitude are unable to expand themselves or to attain that wellproportioned greatness which we admire in the ancients who living under a popular government wrote with the same freedom as they acted longin de sublim c    p     edit toll here too we may say of longinus his own example strengthens all his laws instead of proposing his sentiments with a manly boldness he insinuates them with the most guarded caution puts them into the mouth of a friend and as far as we can collect from a corrupted text makes a show of refuting them himself  this diminutive stature of mankind if we pursue the metaphor was daily sinking below the old standard and the roman world was indeed peopled by a race of pygmies when the fierce giants of the north broke in and mended the puny breed they restored a manly spirit of freedom and after the revolution of ten centuries freedom became the happy parent of taste and science  chap iii of the constitution of the roman empire in the age of the antonines the obvious definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a state in which a single person by whatsoever name he may be distinguished idea of a monarchy is entrusted with the execution of the laws the management of the revenue and the command of the army but unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon degenerate into despotism the influence of the clergy in an age of superstition might be usefully employed to assert the rights of mankind but so intimate is the connection between the throne and the altar that the banner of the church has very seldom been seen on the side of the people a martial nobility and stubborn commons possessed of arms tenacious of property and collected into constitutional assemblies form the only balance capable of preserving a free constitution against enterprises of an aspiring prince  every barrier of the roman constitution had situation of augustus been levelled by the vast ambition of the dictator every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the triumvir after the victory of actium the fate of the roman world depended on the will of octavianus surnamed caesar by his uncles adoption and afterward augustus by the flattery of the senate the conqueror was at the head of fortyfour veteran legions orosius vi     conscious of their own strength and of the weakness of the constitution habituated during twenty years civil war to every act of blood and violence and passionately devoted to the house of caesar from whence alone they had received and expected the most lavish rewards the provinces long oppressed by the ministers of the republic sighed for the government of a single person who would be the master not the accomplice of those petty tyrants the people of rome viewing with a secret pleasure the humiliation of the aristocracy demanded only bread and public shows and were supplied with both by the liberal hand of augustus the rich and polite italians who had almost universally embraced the philosophy of epicurus enjoyed the present blessings of ease and tranquillity and suffered not the pleasing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom with its power the senate had lost its dignity many of the most noble families were extinct the republicans of spirit and ability had perished in the field of battle or in the proscription the door of the assembly had been designedly left open for a mixed multitude of more than a thousand persons who reflected disgrace upon their rank instead of deriving honor from it julius caesar introduced soldiers strangers and halfbarbarians into the senate sueton in caesar c     0 the abuse became still more scandalous after his death   the reformation of the senate was one of the first steps in which augustus laid aside the tyrant and professed himself the father of his he reforms the senate country he was elected censor and in concert with his faithful agrippa he examined the list of the senators expelled a few members whose vices or whose obstinacy required a public example persuaded near two hundred to prevent the shame of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat raised the qualification of a senator to about ten thousand pounds created a sufficient number of patrician families and accepted for himself the honorable title of prince of the senate which had always been bestowed by the censors on the citizen the most eminent for his honors and services dion cassius l iii p     suetonius in august c     but whilst he thus restored the dignity he destroyed the independence of the senate the principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost when the legislative power is nominated by the executive  before an assembly thus modelled and prepared resigns his usurped power augustus pronounced a studied oration which displayed his patriotism and disguised his ambition he lamented yet excused his past conduct filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of his fathers murder the humanity of his own nature had sometimes given way to the stern laws of necessity and to a forced connection with two unworthy colleagues as long as antony lived the republic forbad him to abandon her to a degenerate roman and a barbarian queen he was now at liberty to satisfy his duty and his inclination he solemnly restored the senate and people to all their ancient rights and wished only to mingle with the crowd of his fellowcitizens and to share the blessings which he had obtained for his country dion l liii p     gives us a prolix and bombast speech on this great occasion i have borrowed from suetonius and tacitus the general language of augustus   it would require the pen of tacitus if tacitus is prevailed upon to resume it under the title of emperor or general had assisted at this assembly to describe the various emotions of the senate those that were suppressed and those that were affected it was dangerous to trust the sincerity of augustus to seem to distrust it was still more dangerous the respective advantages of monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers the present greatness of the roman state the corruption of manners and the license of the soldiers supplied new arguments to the advocates of monarchy and these general views of government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each individual amidst this confusion of sentiments the answer of the senate was unanimous and decisive they refused to accept the resignation of augustus they conjured him not to desert the republic which he had saved after a decent resistance the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate and consented to receive the government of the provinces and the general command of the roman armies under the wellknown names of proconsul and imperator imperator from which we have derived emperor signified under the republic no more than general and was emphatically bestowed by the soldiers when on the field of battle they proclaimed their victorious leader worthy of that title when the roman emperors assumed it in that sense they placed it after their name and marked how often they had taken it  but he would receive them only for ten years even before the expiration of that period he hoped that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed and that the republic restored to its pristine health and vigor would no longer require the dangerous interposition of so extraordinary a magistrate the memory of this comedy repeated several times during the life of augustus was preserved to the last ages of the empire by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of rome always solemnized the tenth years of their reign dion l liii p  0  etc   without any violation of the principles of the power of the roman generals constitution the general of the roman armies might receive and exercise an authority almost despotic over the soldiers the enemies and the subjects of the republic with regard to the soldiers the jealousy of freedom had even from the earliest ages of rome given way to the hopes of conquest and a just sense of military discipline the dictator or consul had a right to command the service of the roman youth and to punish an obstinate or cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious penalties by striking the offender out of the list of citizens by confiscating his property and by selling his person into slavery livy epitom l xiv valor maxim vi    the most sacred rights of freedom confirmed by the porcian and sempronian laws were suspended by the military engagement in his camp the general exercised an absolute power of life and death his jurisdiction was not confined by any forms of trial or rules of proceeding and the execution of the sentence was immediate and without appeal see in the viiith book of livy the conduct of manlius torquatus and papirius cursor they violated the laws of nature and humanity but they asserted those of military discipline and the people who abhorred the action was obliged to respect the principle  the choice of the enemies of rome was regularly decided by the legislative authority the most important resolutions of peace and war were seriously debated in the senate and solemnly ratified by the people but when the arms of the legions were carried to a great distance from italy the generals assumed the liberty of directing them against whatever people and in whatever manner they judged most advantageous for the public service it was from the success not from the justice of their enterprises that they expected the honors of a triumph in the use of victory especially after they were no longer controlled by the commissioners of the senate they exercised the most unbounded despotism when pompey commanded in the east he rewarded his soldiers and allies dethroned princes divided kingdoms founded colonies and distributed the treasures of mithridates on his return to rome he obtained by a single act of the senate and people the universal ratification of all his proceedings by the lavish but unconstrained suffrages of the people pompey had obtained a military command scarcely inferior to that of augustus among the extraordinary acts of power executed by the former we may remark the foundation of twentynine cities and the distribution of three or four millions sterling to his troops the ratification of his acts met with some opposition and delays in the senate see plutarch appian dion cassius and the first book of the epistles to atticus  such was the power over the soldiers and over the enemies of rome which was either granted to or assumed by the generals of the republic they were at the same time the governors or rather monarchs of the conquered provinces united the civil with the military character administered justice as well as the finances and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the state  from what has been already observed in the lieutenants of the emperor first chapter of this work some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus entrusted to the ruling hand of augustus but as it was impossible that he could personally command the legions of so many distant frontiers he was indulged by the senate as pompey had already been in the permission of devolving the execution of his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants in rank and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient proconsuls but their station was dependent and precarious they received and held their commissions at the will of a superior to whose auspicious influence the merit of their action was legally attributed under the commonwealth a triumph could only be claimed by the general who was authorized to take the auspices in the name of the people by an exact consequence drawn from this principle of policy and religion the triumph was reserved to the emperor and his most successful lieutenants were satisfied with some marks of distinction which under the name of triumphal honors were invented in their favor  they were the representatives of the emperor the emperor alone was the general of the republic and his jurisdiction civil as well as military extended over all the conquests of rome it was some satisfaction however to the senate that he always delegated his power to the members of their body the imperial lieutenants were of consular or praetorian dignity the legions were commanded by senators and the praefecture of egypt was the only important trust committed to a roman knight  within six days after augustus had been compelled division of the provinces between the emperor and the senate to accept so very liberal a grant he resolved to gratify the pride of the senate by an easy sacrifice he represented to them that they had enlarged his powers even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy condition of the times they had not permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and the frontiers but he must insist on being allowed to restore the more peaceful and secure provinces to the mild administration of the civil magistrate in the division of the provinces augustus provided for his own power and for the dignity of the republic the proconsuls of the senate particularly those of asia greece and africa enjoyed a more honorable character than the lieutenants of the emperor who commanded in gaul or syria the former were attended by lictors the latter by soldiers a law was passed that wherever the emperor was present his extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary jurisdiction of the governor a custom was introduced that the new conquests belonged to the imperial portion and it was soon discovered that the authority of the prince the favorite epithet of augustus was the same in every part of the empire  in return for this imaginary concession augustus the former preserves his military command and guards in rome itself obtained an important privilege which rendered him master of rome and italy by a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims he was authorized to preserve his military command supported by a numerous body of guards even in time of peace and in the heart of the capital his command indeed was confined to those citizens who were engaged in the service by the military oath but such was the propensity of the romans to servitude that the oath was voluntarily taken by the magistrates the senators and the equestrian order till the homage of flattery was insensibly converted into an annual and solemn protestation of fidelity  although augustus considered a military force consular and tribunitian powers as the firmest foundation he wisely rejected it as a very odious instrument of government it was more agreeable to his temper as well as to his policy to reign under the venerable names of ancient magistracy and artfully to collect in his own person all the scattered rays of civil jurisdiction with this view he permitted the senate to confer upon him for his life the powers of the consular cicero de legibus iii   gives the consular office the name of regia potestas and polybius l vi c   observes three powers in the roman constitution the monarchical was represented and exercised by the consuls and tribunitian offices as the tribunitian power distinct from the annual office was first invented for the dictator caesar dion l xliv p     we may easily conceive that it was given as a reward for having so nobly asserted by arms the sacred rights of the tribunes and people see his own commentaries de bell civil l i  which were in the same manner continued to all his successors the consuls had succeeded to the kings of rome and represented the dignity of the state they superintended the ceremonies of religion levied and commanded the legions gave audience to foreign ambassadors and presided in the assemblies both of the senate and people the general control of the finances was entrusted to their care and though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person they were considered as the supreme guardians of law equity and the public peace such was their ordinary jurisdiction but whenever the senate empowered the first magistrate to consult the safety of the commonwealth he was raised by that degree above the laws and exercised in the defense of liberty a temporary despotism augustus exercised nine annual consulships without interruption he then most artfully refused that magistracy as well as the dictatorship absented himself from rome and waited till the fatal effects of tumult and faction forced the senate to invest him with a perpetual consulship augustus as well as his successors affected however to conceal so invidious a title  the character of the tribunes was in every respect different from that of the consuls the appearance of the former was modest and humble but their persons were sacred and inviolable their force was suited rather for opposition than for action they were instituted to defend the oppressed to pardon offenses to arraign the enemies of the people and when they judged it necessary to stop by a single word the whole machine of government as long as the republic subsisted the dangerous influence which either the consul or the tribune might derive from their respective jurisdiction was diminished by several important restrictions their authority expired with the year in which they were elected the former office was divided between two the latter among ten persons and as both in their private and public interest they were averse to each other their mutual conflicts contributed for the most part to strengthen rather than to destroy the balance of the constitution but when the consular and tribunitian powers were united when they were vested for life in a single person when the general of the army was at the same time the minister of the senate and the representative of the roman people it was impossible to resist the exercise nor was it easy to define the limits of his imperial prerogative  to these accumulated honors the policy of augustus soon added the splendid as well as important dignities of supreme pontiff and of censor imperial prerogatives by the former he acquired the management of the religion and by the latter a legal inspection over the manners and fortunes of the roman people if so many distinct and independent powers did not exactly unite with each other the complaisance of the senate was prepared to supply every deficiency by the most ample and extraordinary concessions the emperors as the first ministers of the republic were exempted from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws they were authorized to convoke the senate to make several motions in the same day to recommend candidates for the honors of the state to enlarge the bounds of the city to employ the revenue at their discretion to declare peace and war to ratify treaties and by a most comprehensive clause they were empowered to execute whatsoever they should judge advantageous to the empire and agreeable to the majesty of things private or public human or divine see a

gruters inscriptions no ccxlii   when all the various powers of executive government the magistrates were committed to the imperial magistrate the ordinary magistrates of the commonwealth languished

discharge of it trajan revived the ancient oath and swore before the consuls tribunal that he would observe the laws plin panegyric c     in the election of these magistrates the people during the reign of augustus were permitted to expose all the inconveniences of a wild democracy that artful prince instead of discovering the least symptom of impatience humbly solicited their suffrages for

ferebat et ipse suffragium in tribubus ut unus e populo suetonius in august c     but we may venture to ascribe to his councils the first measure of the succeeding reign by which the elections were transferred to the senate tum primum comitia e campo ad patres translata sunt tacit annal i    the word primum seems to allude to some faint and unsuccessful efforts which were made toward restoring them to the people  the assemblies of the people were for ever abolished and the emperors were delivered from a dangerous multitude who without restoring liberty might have disturbed and perhaps endangered the established government  by declaring themselves the protectors of the the senate people marius and caesar had subverted the constitution of their country but as soon as the senate had been humbled and disarmed such an assembly consisting of five or six hundred persons was found a much more tractable and useful instrument of dominion it was on the dignity of the senate that augustus and his successors founded their new empire and they affected on every occasion to adopt the language and principles of patricians in the administration of their own powers they frequently consulted the great national council and seemed to refer to its decision the most important concerns of peace and war rome italy and the internal provinces were subject to the immediate jurisdiction of the senate with regard to civil objects it was the supreme court of appeal with regard to criminal matters a tribunal constituted for the trial of all offenses that were committed by men in any public station or that affected the peace and majesty of the roman people the exercise of the judicial power became the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate and the important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence as a council of state and as a court of justice the senate possessed very considerable prerogatives but in its legislative capacity in which it was supposed virtually to represent the people the rights of sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly every power was derived from their authority every law was ratified by their sanction their regular meetings were held on three stated days in every month the calends the nones and the ides the debates were conducted with decent freedom and the emperors themselves who gloried in the name of senators sat voted and divided with their equals  to resume in a few words the system of the general idea of the imperial system imperial government as it was instituted by augustus and maintained by those princes who understood their own interest and that of the people it may be defined an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth the masters of the roman world surrounded their throne with darkness concealed their irresistible strength and humbly prosessed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed dion cassius l liii p  0       has given a very loose and partial sketch of the imperial system to illustrate and often to correct him i have meditated tacitus examined suetonius and consulted the following moderns the abbe de la bleterie in the memoires de lacademie des inscriptions tom xix xxi xxiv xxv xxvii beaufort republique roman tom i p          the

court corresponded with the court of the emperors forms of the administration the emperors if we except those tyrants whose capricious folly violated every law of nature and decency difdained that pomp and ceremony which might offend their countrymen but could add nothing to their real power in all the offices of life they affected to confound themselves with their subjects and maintained with them an equal intercourse of visits and entertainments their habit their palace their table were suited only to the rank of an opulent senator their family however numerous or splendid was composed entirely of their domestic slaves and freedmen a weak prince will always be governed by his domestics the power of slaves aggravated the shame of the romans and the senate paid court to a pallas or a narcissus there is a chance that a modern favorite may be a gentleman  augustus or trajan would have blushed at employing the meanest of the romans in those menial offices which in the household and bedchamber of a limited monarch are so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of britain  the deification of the emperors see a treatise of vandale de consecratione principium it would be easier for me to copy than it has been to verify the quotations of that learned dutchman is the only instance in which they departed from their accustomed prudence and modesty the asiatic deification greeks were the first inventors the successors of alexander the first objects of this servile and impious mode of adulation it was easily transferred from the kings to the governors of asia and the roman magistrates very frequently were adored as provincial deities with the pomp of altars and temples of festivals and sacrifices see a dissertation of the abbe mongault in the first volume of the academy of inscriptions  it was natural that the emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted and the divine honors which both the one and the other received from the provinces attested rather the despotism than the servitude of rome but the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations in the arts of flattery and the imperious spirit of the first caesar too easily consented to assume during his lifetime a place among the tutelar deities of rome the milder temper of his successor declined so dangerous an ambition which was never afterward revived except by the madness of caligula and domitian augustus permitted indeed some of the provincial cities to erect temples to his honor on condition that they should associate the worship of rome with that of the sovereign he tolerated private superstition of which he might be the object jurandasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras says horace to the emperor himself and horace was well acquainted with the court of augustus  but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and people in his human character and wisely left to his successor the care of his public deification a regular custom was introduced that on the decease of every emperor who had neither lived nor died like a tyrant the senate by a solemn decree should place him in the number of the gods and the ceremonies of his apotheosis were blended with those of his funeral this legal and as it should seem injudicious profanation so abhorrent to our stricter principles was received with a very faint murmur see cicero in philippic i   julian in caesaribus inque deum templis jurabit roma per umbras is the indignant expression of lucan but it is a patriotic rather than a devout indignation  by the easy nature of polytheism but it was received as an institution not of religion but of policy we should disgrace the virtues of the antonines by comparing them with the vices of hercules or jupiter even the character of caesar or augustus were far superior to those of the popular deities but it was the misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened age and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a mixture of fable and mystery as the devotion of the vulgar requires as soon as their divinity was established by law it sunk into oblivion without contributing either to their own fame or to the dignity of succeeding princes  in the consideration of the imperial government we have frequently mentioned the artful founder under his wellknown title of augustus titles of augustus and caesar which was not however conferred upon him till the edifice was almost completed the obscure name of octavianus he derived from a mean family in the little town of aricia it was stained with the blood of the proscription and he was desirous had it been possible to erase all memory of his former life the illustrious surname of caesar he had assumed as the adopted son of the dictator but he had too much good sense either to hope to be confounded or to wish to be compared with that extraordinary man it was proposed in the senate to dignify their minister with a new appellation and after a very serious discussion that of augustus was chosen among several others as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity which he uniformly affected dion cassius l liii p   0 with the curious annotations of reymar  augustus was therefore a personal caesar a family distinction the former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed and however the latter was diffused by adoption and female alliance nero was the last prince who could allege any hereditary claim to the honors of the julian line but at the time of his death the practice of a century had inseparably connected those appellations with the imperial dignity and they have been preserved by a long succession of emperors romans greeks franks and germans from the fall of the republic to the present time a distinction was however soon introduced the sacred title of augustus was always reserved for the monarch whilst the name of caesar was more freely communicated to his relations and from the reign of hadrian at least was appropriated to the second person in the state who was considered as the presumptive heir of the empire  the tender respect of augustus for a free constitution character and policy of augustus which he had destroyed can only be explained by an attentive consideration of the character of that subtle tyrant a cool head an unfeeling heart and a cowardly disposition prompted him at the age of nineteen to assume the mask of hypocrisy which he never afterward laid aside with the same hand and probably with the same temper he signed the proscription of cicero and the pardon of cinna his virtues and even his vices were artificial and according to the various dictates of his interest he was at first the enemy and at last the father of the roman world as octavianus advanced to the banquet of the caesars his color changed like that of the camelion pale at first then red afterward black he at last assumed the mild livery of venus and the graces caesars p  0  this image employed by julian in his ingenious fiction is just and elegant but when he considers this change of character as real and ascribes it to the power of philosophy he does too much honor to philosophy and to octavianus  when he framed the artful system of the imperial authority his moderation was inspired by his fears he wished to deceive the people by an image of civil liberty and the armies by an image of civil government  i the death of caesar was ever before his image of liberty for the people eyes he had lavished wealth and honors on his adherents but the most favored friends of his uncle were in the number of the conspirators the fidelity of the legions might defend his authority against open rebellion but their vigilance could not secure his person from the dagger of a determined republican and the romans who revered the memory of brutus two centuries after the establishment of monarchy the emperor marcus antoninus recommends the character of brutus as a perfect model of roman virtue  would applaud the imitation of his virtue caesar had provoked his fate as much by the ostentation of his power as by his power itself the consul or the tribune might have reigned in peace the title of king had armed the romans against his life augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom a feeble senate and enervated people cheerfully acquiesced in the pleasing illusion as long as it was supported by the virtue or even by the prudence of the successors of augustus it was a motive of selfpreservation not a principle of liberty that animated the conspirators against caligula nero and domitian they attacked the person of the tyrant without aiming their blow at the authority of the emperor  there appears indeed one memorable occasion attempt of the senate after the death of caligula in which the senate after seventy years of patience made an ineffectual attempt to reassume its long forgotten rights when the throne was vacant by the murder of caligula the consuls convoked that assembly in the capitol condemned the memory of the caesars gave the watchword liberty to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to their standard and during eight and forty hours acted as the independent chiefs of a free commonwealth but while they deliberated the praetorian guards had resolved the stupid claudius brother of germanicus was already in their camp invested with the imperial purple and prepared to support his election by arms the dream of liberty was at an end and the senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude deserted by the people and threatened by a military force that feeble assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the praetorians and to embrace the benefit of an amnesty which claudius had the prudence to offer and the generosity to observe it is much to be regretted that we have lost the part of tacitus which treated of that transaction we are forced to content ourselves with the popular rumors of josephus and the imperfect hints of dion and sueton   ii the insolence of the armies inspired augustus image of government for the armies with fears of a still more alarming nature the despair of the citizens could only attempt what the power of the soldiers was at any time able to execute how precarious was his own authority over men whom he had taught to violate every social duty he had heard their seditious clamours he dreaded their calmer moments of reflection one revolution had been purchased by immense rewards but a second revolution might double those rewards the troops professed the fondest attachment to the house of caesar but the attachments of the multitude are capricious and inconstant augustus summoned to his aid whatever remained in those fierce minds of roman prejudices enforced the rigor of discipline by the sanction of law and interposing the majesty of the senate between the emperor and the army boldly claimed their allegiance as the first magistrate of the republic augustus restored the ancient severity of discipline after the civil wars he dropped the endearing name of fellow soldiers and called them only soldiers sueton in august c    see the use tiberius made of the senate in the mutiny of the pannonian legions tacit annal i   during a long period of two hundred and their obedience twenty years from the establishment of this artful system to the death of commodus the dangers inherent to a military government were in a great measure suspended the soldiers were seldom roused to that fatal sense of their own strength and of the weakness of the civil authority which was before and afterward productive of such dreadful calamities caligula and domitian were assassinated in their palace by their own domestics the convulsions which agitated rome on the death of the former were confined to the walls of the city but nero involved the whole empire in his ruin in the space of eighteen months four princes perished by the sword and the roman world was shaken by the fury of the contending armies excepting only this short though violent eruption of military license the two centuries from augustus to commodus passed away unstained with civil blood and undisturbed by revolutions the emperor was elected by the authority of the senate and the consent of the soldiers these words seem to have been the constitutional language see tacit annal xiii    the legions respected their oath of fidelity and it requires a minute inspection of the roman annals to discover three inconsiderable rebellions which were all suppressed in a few months and without even the hazard of a battle the first was camillus scribonianus who took up arms in dalmatia against claudius and was deserted by his own troops in five days the second l antonius in germany who rebelled against domitian and the third avidius cassius in the reign of m antoninus the two last reigned but a few months and were cut off by their own adherents we may observe that both camillus and cassius colored their ambition with the design of restoring the republic a task said cassius peculiarly reserved for his name and family   in elective monarchies the vacancy of the designation of a successor throne is a moment big with danger and mischief the roman emperors desirous to spare the legions that interval of suspense and the temptation of an irregular choice invested their designed successor with so large a share of present power as should enable him after their decease to assume the remainder without suffering the empire to perceive the change of masters thus augustus after all his fairer prospects had been snatched from him by untimely deaths rested his last hopes on tiberius obtained for his adopted of tiberius son the censorial and tribunitian powers and dictated a law by which the future prince was invested with an authority equal to his own over the provinces and the armies velleius paterculus l ii c     sueton in tiber c  0  thus vespasian of titus subdued the generous mind of his eldest son titus was adored by the eastern legions which under his command had recently achieved the conquest of judaea his power was dreaded and as his virtues were clouded by

son ever approved himself the humble and faithful minister of so indulgent a father sueton in tit c   plin in praefat hist nature   the good sense of vespasian engaged him indeed the race of the caesars and the flavian family to embrace every measure that might confirm his recent and precarious elevation the military oath and the fidelity of the troops had been consecrated by the habits of an hundred years to the name and family of the caesars and although that family had been continued only by the fictitious rite of adoption the romans still revered in the person of nero the grandson of germanicus and the lineal successor of augustus it was not without reluctance and remorse that the praetorian guards had been persuaded to abandon the cause of the tyrant this idea is frequently and strongly inculcated by tacitus see hist i      ii     the rapid downfall of galba otho and vitellius taught the armies to consider the emperors as the creatures of their will and the instruments of their license the birth of vespasian was mean his grandfather had been a private soldier his father a petty officer of the revenue the emperor vespasian with his usual good sense laughed at the genealogists who deduced his family from flavius the founder of reate his native country and one of the companions of hercules suet in vespasian c     his own merit had raised him in an advanced age

mild disposition was respected by the good but the degenerate romans required a more vigorous character whose justice should strike terror into the guilty though he had several relations he fixed his choice on a stranger he adopted trajan then about forty years of age and who commanded a powerful army in the lower germany and immediately by a decree of the senate declared him his colleague and successor in the empire dion l lxviii p      plin secund in panegyric  it is sincerely to be lamented that a d    whilst we are fatigued with the disgustful relation of neros crimes and follies we are reduced to collect the actions of trajan from the glimmerings of an abridgment or the doubtful light of a panegyric there remains however one panegyric far removed beyond the suspicion of flattery above two hundred and fifty years after the death of trajan the senate in pouring out the customary acclamations on the accession of a new emperor wished that he might surpass the felicity of augustus

transaction yet dodwell praelect camden xvii has maintained that hadrian was called to the certain hope of the empire during the lifetime of trajan  the truth of which could not be safely disputed and hadrian was peaceably acknowledged as his lawful successor under his reign as has been already mentioned the empire flourished in peace and prosperity he encouraged the arts reformed the laws asserted military discipline and visited all his provinces in person his vast and active genius was equally suited to the most enlarged views and the minute details of civil policy but the ruling passions of his soul were curiosity and vanity as they prevailed and as they were attracted by different objects hadrian was by turns an excellent prince a ridiculous sophist and a jealous tyrant the general tenor of his conduct deserved praise for its equity and moderation yet in the first days of his reign he put to death four consular senators his personal enemies and men who had been judged worthy of empire and the tediousness of a painful illness rendered him at last peevish and cruel the senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a god or a tyrant and the honors decreed to his memory were

posterity by placing the most exalted merit on the roman throne his discerning eye easily discovered a senator about fifty years of age blameless in all the offices of life and a youth of about seventeen whose riper years opened the fair prospect of every virtue the elder of these was declared the son and successor of hadrian on condition however that he himself should immediately adopt the younger the two antonines for it is of them that we are now speaking governed the roman world fortytwo a d        0 years with the same invariable spirit of wisdom and virtue although pius had two

image of liberty and were pleased with considering themselves as the accountable ministers of the laws such princes deserved the honor of restoring the republic had the romans of their days been

was neglected by the anxious father and by the men of virtue and learning whom he summoned to his assistance to expand the narrow mind of young commodus to correct his growing vices and to render him worthy of the throne for which he was designed but the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous the distasteful lesson of a grave philosopher was in a moment obliterated by the whisper of a profligate favorite and marcus himself blasted the fruits of this labored education by admitting his son at the age of fourteen or fifteen to a full participation of the imperial power he lived but four years afterward but he lived long enough to repent a rash measure which raised the impetuous youth above the restraint of reason

imposed on the appetites of mankind by confining to a few the possession of those objects that are coveted by many of all our passions and appetites the love of power is of the most imperious and

humanity the ardor of contention the pride of victory the despair of success the memory of past injuries and the fear of future dangers all contribute to inflame the mind and to silence the voice of

dangerous superiority of merit and the friendship of the father always ensured the aversion of the son suspicion was equivalent to proof trial to condemnation the execution of a considerable senator

liberality they alone had experienced but the emergency of the occasion the authority of their prefect the reputation of pertinax and the clamours of the people obliged them to stifle their secret discontents to accept the donative promised of the new emperor to swear allegiance to him and with joyful acclamations and laurels in their hands to conduct him to the senate house that the military consent might be ratified by the civil authority  this important night was now far spent with and by the senate the dawn of day and the commencement of the a d      st january new year the senators expected a summons to attend an ignominious ceremony in spite of all remonstrances even of those of his creatures who yet preserved any regard for prudence or decency commodus had resolved to pass the night in the gladiators school and from thence to take possession of the consulship in the habit and with the attendance of that infamous crew on a sudden before the break of day the senate was called together in the temple of concord to meet the guards and to ratify the election of a new emperor for a few minutes they sat in silent suspense doubtful of their unexpected deliverance and suspicious of the cruel artifices of commodus but when at length they were assured that the tyrant was no more they resigned themselves to all the transports of joy and indignation pertinax who modestly represented the meanness of his extraction and pointed out several noble senators more deserving than himself of the empire was constrained by their dutiful violence to ascend the throne and received all the titles of imperial power confirmed by the most sincere vows of fidelity the memory of commodus the memory of commodus declared infamous was branded with eternal infamy the names of tyrant of gladiator of public enemy resounded in every corner of the house they decreed in tumultuous votes that his honors should be reversed his titles erased from the public monuments his statues thrown down his body dragged with a hook into the strippingroom of the gladiators to satiate the public fury and they expressed some indignation against those officious servants who had already presumed to screen his remains from the justice of the senate but pertinax could not refuse those last rites to the memory of marcus and the tears of his first protector claudius pompeianus who lamented the cruel fate of his brotherinlaw and lamented still more that he had deserved it capitolinus gives us the particulars of these tumultuary votes which were moved by one senator and repeated or rather chanted by the whole body hist august p      these effusions of impotent rage against a dead legal jurisdiction of the senate over the emperors emperor whom the senate had flattered when alive with the most abject servility betrayed a just but ungenerous spirit of revenge the legality of these decrees was however supported by the principles of the imperial constitution to censure to depose or to punish with death the first magistrate of the republic who had abused his delegated trust was the ancient and undoubted prerogative of the roman senate the senate condemned nero to be put to death more majorum sueton c     but that feeble assembly was obliged to content itself with inflicting on a fallen tyrant that public justice from which during his life and reign he had been shielded by the strong arm of military despotism  pertinax found a nobler way of condemning his predecessors memory by the contrast of his own virtues with the vices of commodus on virtues of pertinax the day of his accession he resigned over to his wife and son his whole private fortune that they might have no pretense to solicit favors at the expense of the state he refused to flatter the vanity of the former with the title of augusta or to corrupt the inexperienced youth of the latter by the rank of caesar accurately distinguishing between the duties of a parent and those of a sovereign he educated his son with a severe simplicity which while it gave him no assured prospect of the throne might in time have rendered him worthy of it in public the behavior of pertinax was grave and affable he lived with the virtuous part of the senate and in a private station he had been acquainted with the true character of each individual without either pride or jealousy considered them as friends and companions with whom he had shared the dangers of the tyranny and with whom he wished to enjoy the security of the present time he very frequently invited them to familiar entertainments the frugality of which was ridiculed by those who remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of commodus dion l lxxiii p      speaks of these entertainments as a senator who had supped with the emperor capitolinus hist august p    like a slave who had received his intelligence from one of the scullions   to heal as far as it was possible the wounds inflicted by the hand of tyranny was the pleasing but melancholy task of pertinax the he endeavors to reform the state innocent victims who yet survived were recalled from exile released from prison and restored to the full possession of their honors and fortunes the unburied bodies of murdered senators for the cruelty of commodus endeavored to extend itself beyond death were deposited in the sepulchers of their ancestors their memory was justified and every consolation was bestowed on their ruined and afflicted families among these consolations one of the most grateful was the punishment of the delators the common enemies of their master of virtue and of their country yet even in the inquisition of these legal assassins pertinax proceeded with a steady temper which gave every thing to justice and nothing to popular prejudice and resentment  the finances of the state demanded the most his regulations vigilant care of the emperor though every measure of injustice and extortion had been adopted which could collect the property of the subject into the coffers of the prince the rapaciousness of commodus had been so very inadequate to his extravagance that upon his death no more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted treasury

and to discharge the pressing demand of a liberal donative which the new emperor had been obliged to promise to the praetorian guards yet under these distressed circumstances pertinax had the generous firmness to remit all the oppressive taxes invented by commodus and to cancel all the unjust claims of the treasury declaring in a decree of the senate that he was better satisfied to administer a poor republic with innocence than to acquire riches by the ways of tyranny and dishonor economy and industry he considered as the pure and genuine sources of wealth and from them he soon derived a copious supply for the public necessities the expense of the household was immediately reduced to one half all the instruments of luxury pertinax exposed to public auction besides the design of converting these useless ornaments into money dion l lxxiii p      assigns two secret motives of pertinax he wished to expose the vices of commodus and to discover by the purchasers those who most resembled him  gold and silver plate chariots of a singular construction a superfluous wardrobe of silk and embroidery and a great number of beautiful slaves of both sexes excepting only with attentive humanity those who were born in a state of freedom and had been ravished from the arms of their weeping parents at the same time that he obliged the worthless favorites of the tyrant to resign a part of their illgotten wealth he satisfied the just creditors of the state and unexpectedly discharged the long arrears of honest services he removed the oppressive restrictions which had been laid upon commerce and granted all the uncultivated lands in italy and the provinces to those who would improve them with an exemption from tribute during the term of ten years though capitolinus has picked up many idle tales of the private life of pertinax he joins with dion and herodian in admiring his public conduct   such an uniform conduct had already secured and popularity to pertinax the noblest reward of a sovereign the love and esteem of his people those who remembered the virtues of marcus were happy to contemplate in their new emperor the features of that bright original and flattered themselves that they should long enjoy the benign influence of his administration a hasty zeal to reform the corrupted state accompanied with less prudence than might have been expected from the years and experience of pertinax proved fatal to himself and to his country his honest indiscretion united against him the servile crowd who found their private benefit in the public disorders and who preferred the favor of a tyrant to the inexorable equality of the laws leges rem surdam inexorabilem esse t live ii     amidst the general joy the sullen and angry discontent of the praetorians countenance of the praetorian guards betrayed their inward dissatisfaction they had reluctantly submitted to pertinax they dreaded the strictness of the ancient discipline which he was preparing to restore and they regretted the license of the former reign their discontents were secretly somented by laetus their prefect who found when it was too late that his new emperor would reward a servant but would not be ruled by a favorite on the third day of his reign the soldiers seized on a noble senator with a design to carry him to the camp and to invest him with the imperial purple instead of being dazzled by the dangerous honor the affrighted victim escaped from their violence and took refuge at the feet of pertinax a short time afterward a conspiracy prevented sosius falco one of the consuls of the year a rash youth if we credit capitolinus which is rather difficult falco behaved with the most petulant indecency to pertinax on the day of his accession the wise emperor only admonished him of his youth and inexperience hist august p     but of an ancient and opulent family listened to the voice of ambition and a conspiracy was formed during a short absence of pertinax which was crushed by his sudden return to rome and his resolute behavior falco was on the point of being justly condemned to death as a public enemy had he not been saved by the earnest and sincere entreaties of the injured emperor who conjured the senate that the purity of his reign might not be stained by the blood even of a guilty senator  these disappointments served only to irritate murder

unwieldy host it would be impracticable and the powers of the machine would be alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness or the excessive weight of its springs to illustrate this observation we need only reflect that there is no superiority of natural strength artificial weapons or acquired skill which could enable one man to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his fellow creatures the tyrant of a single town or a small district would soon discover that an hundred armed followers were a weak defense against ten thousand peasants or citizens but an hundred thousand welldisciplined

of so near a relation and so excellent a prince he had already begun to use the only effectual argument and to treat for the imperial dignity but the more prudent of the praetorians apprehensive that

philosophic cloak of austerity he stands accused of concealing most of the vices which degrade human nature spartianus in his undigested collections mixes up all the virtues and all the vices that

his cruelties or even as the associate of his pleasures he was employed in a distant honorable command when he received a confidential letter from the emperor acquainting him of the treasonable

the colleges of priests in their sacerdotal habits and bearing before them the sacred pledges of the roman religion should advance in solemn procession to meet the pannonian legions and at the same time he vainly tried to interrogate or to appease the fates by magic ceremonies and unlawful sacrifices hist august p         severus who dreaded neither his arms nor his is deserted by the

his progress and made a short halt at interamnia about seventy miles from rome his victory was already secure but the despair of the praetorians might have rendered it bloody and severus had the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing the sword victor and eutropius viii    mention a combat near the milvian bridge the ponte molle unknown to the better and more ancient writers

guards two measures the one dictated by policy the other by decency the revenge and the honors due to the memory of pertinax before the new emperor entered rome he issued his commands to the praetorian guards directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the city without arms but in the habits of ceremony in which they were accustomed to attend their sovereign he was obeyed by those haughty troops whose contrition was the effect of their just terrors a chosen part of the illyrian army encompassed them with levelled spears incapable of flight or resistance they expected their fate in silent consternation severus mounted the tribunal sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice dismissed them with ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed despoiled them of

last rites to that excellent prince whom they had loved and still regretted the concern of his successor was probably less sincere he esteemed the virtues of pertinax but those virtues would for ever have confined his ambition to a private station severus pronounced his funeral oration with studied eloquence inward satisfaction and wellacted sorrow and by this pious regard to his memory convinced the credulous multitude that he alone was worthy to supply his place sensible however that arms not ceremonies must assert his claim to the empire he left rome at the end of thirty days and without suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals  the uncommon abilities and fortune of severus success of severus against niger and against albinus have induced an elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the caesars herodian l iii p      the parallel is at least imperfect where shall we find in the character of severus the commanding superiority of soul the generous clemency and the various genius which could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure the thirst of knowledge and the fire of ambition though it is not most assuredly the intention of lucan to exalt the character of caesar yet the idea he gives of that hero in the tenth book of the pharsalia where he describes him at the same time making love to cleopatra sustaining a siege against the power of egypt and conversing with the sages of the country is in reality the noblest panegyric  in one instance only they may be compared with some degree of propriety in the celerity of their motions and their civil victories in less than four years reckoning from his election april        to the death of albinus february        see tillemonts chronology  severus subdued the riches of the east and the valor of the west he vanquished a d          two competitors of reputation and ability and defeated numerous armies provided with weapons and discipline equal to his own in that age the art of fortification and the principles of tactics were well understood by all the roman generals and the constant superiority of severus was that of an artist who uses the same instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals i shall not however enter into a minute narrative of these military operations but as the two civil wars against niger and against albinus were almost the same in their conduct event and consequences i shall collect into one point of view the most striking circumstances tending to develope the character of the conqueror and the state of the empire  falsehood and insincerity unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of public transactions offend conduct of the two civil wars us with a less degrading idea of meanness than when they are found in the intercourse of private life in the latter they discover a want of courage in the other only a defect of power and as it is impossible for the most able statesman to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength the world under the name of policy seems to have granted them a very liberal indulgence of craft and dissimulation yet arts of severus the arts of severus cannot be justified by the most ample privileges of state reason he promised only to betray he flattered only to ruin and however he might occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties his conscience obsequious to his interest always released him from the inconvenient obligation herodian l ii p      if his two competitors reconciled by their toward niger common danger had advanced upon him without delay perhaps severus would have sunk under their united effort had they even attacked him at the same time with separate views and separate armies the contest might have been long and doubtful but they fell singly and successively an easy prey to the arts as well as arms of their subtle enemy lulled into security by the moderation of his professions and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action he first marched against niger whose reputation and power he the most dreaded but he declined any hostile declarations suppressed the name of his antagonist and only signified to the senate and people his intention of regulating the eastern provinces in private he spoke of niger his old friend and intended successor whilst severus was very dangerously ill it was industriously given out that he intended to appoint niger and albinus his successors as he could not be sincere with respect to both he might not be so with regard to either yet severus carried his hypocrisy so far as to profess that intention in the memoirs of his own life  with the most affectionate regard and highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of pertinax to punish the vile usurper of the throne was the duty of every roman general to persevere in arms and to resist a lawful emperor acknowledged by the senate would alone render him criminal hist august p     the sons of niger had fallen into his hands among the children of the provincial governors detained at rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents this practice invented by commodus proved very useful to severus he found at rome the children of many of the principal adherents of his rivals and he employed them more than once to intimidate or seduce the parents  as long as the power of niger inspired terror or even respect they were educated with the most tender care with the children of severus himself but they were soon involved in their fathers ruin and removed first by exile and afterward by death from the eye of public compassion herodian l iii p    hist august p         whilst severus was engaged in his eastern war toward albinus he had reason to apprehend that the governor of britain might pass the sea and the alps occupy the vacant seat of empire and oppose his return with the authority of the senate and the forces of the west the ambiguous conduct of albinus in not assuming the imperial title left room for negotiation forgetting at once his professions of patriotism and the jealousy of sovereign power he accepted the precarious rank of caesar as a reward for his fatal neutrality till the first contest was decided severus treated the man whom he had doomed to destruction with every mark of esteem and regard even in the letter in which he announced his victory over niger he styles albinus the brother of his soul and empire sends him the affectionate salutations of his wife julia and his young family and entreats him to preserve the armies and the republic faithful to their common interest the messengers charged with this letter were instructed to accost the caesar with respect to desire a private audience and to plunge their daggers into his heart hist august p    spartianus has inserted this curious letter at full length  the conspiracy was discovered and the too credulous albinus at length passed over to the continent and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival who rushed upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army  the military labors of severus seem inadequate event of the civil wars to the importance of his conquests two engagements the one near the hellespont the other in the narrow defiles of cilicia decided the fate of his syrian competitor and the troops of europe asserted their usual ascendant over the effeminate natives of asia consult the third book of herodian and the seventyfourth book of dion cassius  the battle of lions where one hundred and fifty thousand dion l lxxv p    0 romans were engaged was equally fatal to albinus the valor of the british army maintained indeed a sharp and doubtful contest with the hardy discipline of the illyrian legions the fame and person of severus appeared during a few moments

battles distinguished not only by the fierce animosity but likewise by the obstinate perseverance of the contending factions they have generally been justified by some principle or at least colored by some pretext of religion freedom or loyalty the leaders were nobles of independent property and hereditary influence the troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused throughout the whole community a vanquished chief was immediately supplied with new adherents eager to shed their blood in the same cause but the romans after the fall of the republic combated only for the choice of masters under the standard of a popular candidate for empire a few enlisted from affection some from fear many from interest none from principle the legions uninflamed by party zeal were allured into civil war by liberal donatives and still more liberal promises a defeat by disabling the chief from the performance of his engagements dissolved the mercenary allegiance of his followers and left them to consult their own safety by a timely desertion of an unsuccessful cause it was of little moment to the provinces under whose name they were oppressed or governed they were driven by the impulsion of the present power and as soon as that power yielded to a superior force they hastened to implore the clemency of the conqueror who as he had an immense debt to discharge was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers in the vast extent of the roman empire there were few fortified cities capable of protecting a routed army nor was there any person or family or order of men whose natural interest unsupported by the powers of government was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party montesquieu considerations sur la grandeur et la decadence des romans c xii   yet in the contest between niger and severus siege of byzantium a single city deserves an honorable exception as byzantium was one of the greatest passages from europe into asia it had been provided with a strong garrison and a fleet of five hundred vessels was anchored in the harbor most of these as may be supposed were small open vessels some however were galleys of two and a few of three ranks of oars  the impetuosity of severus disappointed this prudent scheme of defense he left to his generals the siege of byzantium forced the less guarded passage of the hellespont and impatient of a meaner enemy pressed forward to encounter his rival byzantium attacked by a numerous and increasing army and afterward by the whole naval power of the empire sustained a siege of three years and remained faithful to the name and memory of niger the citizens and soldiers we know not from what cause were animated with equal fury several of the principal officers of niger who despaired of or who disdained a pardon had thrown themselves into this last refuge the fortifications were esteemed impregnable and in the defense of the place a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic powers known to the ancients the engineers name was priscus his skill saved his life and he was taken into the service of the conqueror for the particular facts of the siege consult dion cassius l lxxv p      and herodian l iii p    for the theory of it the fanciful chevalier de folard may be looked into see polybe tom i p     byzantium at length surrendered to famine the magistrates and soldiers were put to the sword the walls demolished the privileges suppressed and the destined capital of the east subsisted only as an open village subject to the insulting jurisdiction of perinthus the historian dion who had admired the flourishing and lamented the desolate state of byzantium accused the revenge of severus for depriving the roman people of the strongest bulwark against the barbarians of pontus and asia notwithstanding the authority of spartianus and some modern greeks we may be assured from dion and herodian that byzantium many years after the death of severus lay in ruins  the truth of this observation was but too well justified in the succeeding age when the gothic fleets covered the euxine and passed through the undefended bosphorus into the center of the mediterranean  both niger and albinus were discovered and deaths of niger and albinus put to death in their flight from the field of battle their fate excited neither surprise nor compassion cruel consequences of the civil wars they had staked their lives against the chance of empire and suffered what they would have inflicted nor did severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a private station but his unforgiving temper stimulated by avarice indulged a spirit of revenge where there was no room for apprehension the most considerable of the provincials who without any dislike to the fortunate candidate had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were accidentally placed were punished by death exile and especially by the confiscation of their estates many cities of the east were stripped of their ancient honors and obliged to pay into the treasury of severus four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for the service of niger dion l lxxiv p    0   till the final decision of the war the cruelty of severus was in some measure restrained by the uncertainty of the event and his pretended animosity of severus against the senate reverence for the senate the head of albinus accompanied with a menacing letter announced to the romans that he was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate competitors he was irritated by the just suspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the senate and he concealed his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some treasonable correspondences thirtyfive senators however accused of having favored the party of albinus he freely pardoned and by his subsequent behavior endeavored to convince them that he had forgotten as well as forgiven their supposed offenses but at the same time he condemned fortyone dion l lxxv p      only    senators are mentioned by him but

their wives children and clients attended them in death and the noblest provincials of spain and gaul were involved in the same ruin such rigid justice for so he termed it was in the opinion of severus the only conduct capable of ensuring peace to the people or stability to the prince and he condescended slightly to lament that to be mild it was necessary that he should first be cruel aurelius victor   the true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with that of his people their numbers their wealth their order and their security the wisdom and justice of his government are the best and only foundations of his real greatness and were he totally devoid of virtue prudence might supply its place and would dictate the same rule of conduct severus considered the roman empire as his property and had no sooner secured the possession than he bestowed his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition salutary laws executed with inflexible firmness soon corrected most of the abuses with which since the death of marcus every part of the government had been infected in the administration of justice the judgments of the emperor were characterized by attention discernment and impartiality and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity it was generally in favor of the poor and oppressed not so much indeed from any sense of humanity as from the natural propensity of a despot to humble the pride of greatness and to sink all his subjects to the same common level of absolute dependence his expensive taste for building magnificent shows and above all a constant and liberal distribution of corn and provisions were the surest means of captivating the affection of the roman people dion l lxxvi p      hist august p    severus celebrated the secular games with extraordinary magnificence and he left in the public granaries a provision of corn for seven years at the rate of   000 modii or about   00 quarters per day i am persuaded that the granaries of severus were supplied for a long term but i am not less persuaded that policy on one hand and admiration on the other magnified the hoard far beyond its true contents  the misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated the calm of peace and prosperity was once more experienced in the provinces and many cities general peace and prosperity restored by the munificence of severus assumed the title of his colonies and attested by public monuments their gratitude and felicity see spanheims treatise of ancient medals the inscriptions and our learned travelers spon and wheeler shaw pocock etc who in africa greece and asia have found more monuments of severus than of any other roman emperor whatsoever  the fame of the roman arms was revived by that warlike and successful emperor he carried his victorious arms to seleucia and ctesiphon the capitals of the parthian monarchy i shall have occasion to mention this war in its proper place  and he boasted with a just pride that having received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic wars he left it established in profound universal and honorable peace etiam in britannis was his own just and emphatic expression hist august      although the wounds of civil war appeared relaxation of military discipline completely healed its mortal poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution severus possessed a considerable share of vigor and ability but the daring soul of the first caesar or the deep policy of augustus were scarcely equal to the task of curbing the insolence of the victorious legions by gratitude by misguided policy by seeming necessity severus was induced to relax the nerves of discipline herodian l iii p     hist august p     the vanity of his soldiers was flattered with the honor of wearing gold rings their ease was indulged in the permission of living with their wives in the idleness of quarters he increased their pay beyond the example of former times and taught them to expect and soon to claim extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or festivity elated by success enervated by luxury and raised above the level of subjects by their dangerous privileges upon the insolence and privileges of the soldiers the   th satire falsely ascribed to juvenal may be consulted the style and circumstances of it would induce me to believe that it was composed under the reign of severus or that of his son  they soon became incapable of military fatigue oppressive to the country and impatient of a just subordination their officers asserted the superiority of rank by a more profuse and elegant luxury there is still extant a letter of severus lamenting the licentious state of the army and exhorting one of his generals to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes themselves since as he justly observes the officer who has forfeited the esteem will never command the obedience of his soldiers hist august p     had the emperor pursued the train of reflection he would have discovered that the primary cause of this general corruption might be ascribed not indeed to the example but to the pernicious indulgence however of the commander in chief  the praetorians who murdered their emperor new establishment of the praetorian guards and sold the empire had received the just punishment of their treason but the necessary though dangerous institution of guards was soon restored on a new model by severus and increased to four times the ancient number herodian l iii p      formerly these troops had been recruited in italy and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the softer manners of rome the levies were extended to macedonia noricum and spain in the room of these elegant troops better adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war it was established by severus that from all the legions of the frontiers the soldiers most distinguished for strength valor and fidelity should be occasionally draughted and promoted as an honor and reward into the more eligible service of the guards dion l lxxiv p       by this new institution the italian youth were diverted from the exercise of arms and the capital was terrified by the strange aspect and manners of a multitude of barbarians but severus flattered himself that the legions would consider these chosen praetorians as the representatives of the whole military order and that the present aid of fifty thousand men superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be brought into the field against them would for ever crush the hopes of rebellion and secure the empire to himself and his posterity  the command of these favored and formidable the office of praetorian prefect troops soon became the first office of the empire as the government degenerated into military despotism the praetorian prefect who in his origin had been a simple captain of the guards was placed not only at the head of the army but of the finances and even of the law in every department of administration he represented the person and exercised the authority of the emperor the first prefect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was plautianus the favourjte minister of severus his reign lasted above ten years till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the emperor which seemed to assure his fortune proved the occasion of his ruin one of his most daring and wanton acts of power was the castration of an hundred free romans some of them married men and even fathers of families merely that his daughter on her marriage with the young emperor might be attended by a train of eunuchs worthy of an eastern queen dion l lxxvi p       the animosities of the palace by irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of plautianus threatened to produce a revolution and obliged the emperor who still loved him to consent with reluctance to his death dion l lxxvi p      herodian l iii p         the grammarian of alexandria seems as it is not unusual much better acquainted with this mysterious transaction and more assured of the guilt of plautianus than the roman senator ventures to be  after the fall of plautianus an eminent lawyer the celebrated papinian was appointed to execute the motley office of praetorian prefect  till the reign of severus the virtue and even the senate oppressed by military despotism the good sense of the emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected reverence for the senate and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil policy instituted by augustus but the youth of severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps and his riper years spent in the despotism of military command his haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover or would not acknowledge the advantage of preserving an intermediate power however imaginary between the emperor and the army he disdained to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his person and trembled at his frown he issued his commands where his request would have proved as effectual assumed the conduct and style of a sovereign and a conqueror and exercised without disguise the whole legislative as well as the executive power  the victory over the senate was easy and inglorious new maxims of the imperial prerogative every eye and every passion were directed to the supreme magistrate who possessed the arms and treasure of the state whilst the senate neither elected by the people nor guarded by military force nor animated by public spirit rested its declining authority on the frail and crumbling basis of ancient opinion the fine theory of a republic insensibly vanished and made way for the more natural and substantial feelings of monarchy as the freedom and honors of rome were successively communicated to the provinces in which the old government had been either unknown or was remembered with abhorrence the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obliterated the greek historians of the age of the antonines appian in proem observe with a malicious pleasure that although the sovereign of rome in compliance with an obsolete prejudice abstained from the name of king he possessed the full measure of regal power in the reign of severus the senate was filled with polished and eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces who justified personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude these new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the court and with patience by the people when they inculcated the duty of passive obedience and descanted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom the lawyers and the historians concurred in teaching that the imperial authority was held not by the delegated commission but by the irrevocable resignation of the senate that the emperor was freed from the restraint of civil laws could command by his arbitrary will the lives and fortunes of his subjects and might dispose of the empire as of his private patrimony dion cassius seems to have written with no other view than to form these opinions into an historical system the pandects will show how assiduously the lawyers on their side labored in the cause of prerogative  the most eminent of the civil lawyers and particularly papinian paulus and ulpian flourished under the house of severus and the roman jurisprudence having closely united itself with the system of monarchy was supposed to have attained its full maturity and perfection  the contemporaries of severus in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of his

discovered almost from their infancy a fixed and implacable antipathy for each other their aversion confirmed by years and their mutual aversion to each other fomented by the arts of their interested favorites broke out in childish and gradually in more serious competitions and at length divided the theater the circus and the court into two factions actuated by the hopes and fears of their respective leaders the prudent emperor endeavored by every expedient of advice and authority to allay this growing animosity the unhappy discord of his sons clouded all his prospects and threatened to overturn a throne raised with so much labor cemented with so much blood and guarded with every defense of arms and treasure with an impartial hand he maintained between them an exact balance of favor

caledonian war in britain and of an invasion of the province by the barbarians of the north was received a d  0  with pleasure by severus though the vigilance of his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant enemy he resolved to embrace the honorable pretext of withdrawing his sons from the luxury of rome which enervated their minds and irritated their passions and of inuring their youth to the toils of war and government notwithstanding his advanced age for he was above threescore and his gout which obliged him to be carried in a litter he transported himself in person into that remote island attended by his two sons his whole court and a formidable army he immediately passed the walls of hadrian and antoninus and entered the enemys country with a design of completing the long attempted conquest of britain he penetrated to the northern extremity of the island without meeting an enemy but the concealed ambuscades of the caledonians who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army the coldness of the climate and the severity of a winter march across the hills and morasses of scotland are reported to have cost the romans above fifty thousand men the caledonians at length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack sued for peace and surrendered a part of their arms and a large tract of territory but their apparent submission lasted no longer than the present terror as soon as the roman legions had retired they resumed their hostile independence their restless spirit provoked severus to send a new army into caledonia with the most bloody

are of the same opinion and yet the opinion is not without difficulty in the caledonian war the son of severus was known only by the appellation of antoninus and it may seem strange that the highland

thousand feet see the notitia and victor in nardinis roma antica but we should recollect that the opulent senators had almost surrounded the city with their extensive gardens and suburb palaces the greatest part of which had been gradually confiscated by the emperors if geta resided in the gardens that bore his name on the janiculum and if caracalla inhabited the gardens of maecenas on the

minds they should separate their interest and divide the empire between them the conditions of the treaty were already drawn with some accuracy it was agreed that caracalla as the elder brother should remain in possession of europe and the western africa and that he should relinquish the sovereignty of asia and egypt to geta who might fix his residence at alexandria or antioch cities little inferior to rome itself in wealth and greatness that numerous armies should be constantly encamped on either side of the thracian bosphorus to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies and that the senators of european extraction should acknowledge the sovereign of rome whilst the natives of asia followed the emperor of the east the tears of the empress julia interrupted the negotiation the first idea of which had filled every roman breast with surprise and indignation the mighty mass of conquest was so intimately united by the hand of time and policy that it required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder the romans had reason to dread that the disjointed members would soon be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of one master but if the separation was permanent the division of the provinces must terminate in the dissolution of an empire whose unity had hitherto remained inviolate herodian l iv p       had the treaty been carried into execution the sovereign of

experienced rather than an able soldier and the civil affairs were transacted by opilius macrinus who by his dexterity in business had raised himself with a fair character to that high office but his favor varied with the caprice of the emperor and his life might depend on the slightest suspicion or the most casual circumstance malice or fanaticism had suggested to an african deeply skilled in the knowledge of futurity a very dangerous prediction that macrinus and his son were destined to reign over the empire the report was soon diffused through the province and when the man was sent in chains to rome he still asserted in the presence of the prefect of the city the faith of his prophecy that magistrate who had received the most pressing instructions to inform himself of the successors of caracalla immediately communicated the examination of the african to the imperial court which at that time resided in syria but notwithstanding the diligence of the public messengers a friend of macrinus found means to apprize him of the approaching danger the emperor received the letters from rome and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot race he delivered them unopened to the praetorian prefect directing him to dispatch the ordinary affairs and to report the more important business that might be contained in them macrinus read his fate and resolved to prevent it he inflamed the discontents of some inferior officers and employed the hand of martialis a desperate soldier who had been refused the rank of centurion the devotion of caracalla prompted him to make a pilgrimage from edessa to the celebrated temple of the moon at carrhae he was attended by a body of cavalry but having stopped on the road for some necessary occasion his guards preserved a respectful

the faintest resemblance of the macedonian hero except in the murder of a great number of his own and of his fathers friends the fondness of caracalla for the name and ensigns of alexander is still

ratified by the cheerful submission of the senate and provinces they exulted in their unexpected deliverance from a hated tyrant and it seemed of little consequence to examine into the virtues of the successor of caracalla but as soon as the first transports of joy and surprise had subsided they began to scrutinize the merits of macrinus with a critical severity and to arraign the hasty choice of the army it had hitherto been considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitution that the emperor must be always chosen in the senate and the sovereign power no longer exercised by the whole body

indeed from the equestrian order but they preserved the praesecture with the rank of senator and even with the consulship  the sudden elevation of the praetorian praesects betrayed the meanness of their origin and the equestrian order was still in possession of that great office which commanded with arbitrary sway the lives and fortunes of the senate a murmur of indignation was heard that a man whose obscure he was a native of caesarea in numidia and began his fortune by serving in the household of plautian from whose ruin he narrowly escaped his enemies asserted that he was born a slave and had exercised among other infamous professions that of gladiator the fashion of aspersing the birth and condition of an adversary seems to have lasted from the time of the greek orators to the learned grammarians of the last age extraction had never been illustrated by any signal service should dare to invest himself with the purple instead of bestowing it on some distinguished senator equal in birth and dignity to the splendor of the imperial station as soon as the character of macrinus was surveyed by the sharp eye of discontent some vices and many defects were easily discovered the choice of his ministers was in many instances justly censured and the dissatisfied people with their usual candor accused at once his indolent tameness and his excessive severity both dion and herodian speak of the virtues and vices of macrinus with candor and impartiality but the author of his life in the augustan history seems to have implicitly copied some of the venal writers employed by elagabalus to blacken the memory of his predecessor   his rash ambition had climbed a height where it was difficult to stand with firmness and impossible and the army to fall without instant destruction trained in the arts of courts and the forms of civil business he trembled in the presence of the fierce and undisciplined multitude over whom he had assumed the command his military talents were despised and his personal courage suspected a whisper that circulated in the camp disclosed the fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy and heightened contempt by detestation to alienate the soldiers and to provoke inevitable ruin the character of a reformer was only wanting and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate that macrinus was compelled to exercise that invidious office the prodigality of caracalla had left behind it a long train of ruin and disorder and if that worthless tyrant had been capable of reflecting on the sure consequences of his own conduct he would perhaps have enjoyed the dark prospect of the distress and calamities which he bequeathed to his successors  in the management of this necessary reformation macrinus attempts a reformation of the army macrinus proceeded with a cautious prudence which would have restored health and vigor to the roman army in an easy and almost imperceptible manner to the soldiers already engaged in the service he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and extravagant pay given by caracalla but the new recruits were received on the more moderate though liberal establishment of severus and gradually formed to modesty and obedience dion l lxxxiii p      the sense of the author is as clear as the intention of the emperor but m wotton has mistaken both

elevation in the luxurious idleness of their quarters the troops viewed their strength and numbers communicated their complaints and revolved in their minds the advantages of another revolution the veterans instead of being flattered by the advantageous distinction were alarmed by the first steps of the emperor which they considered as the presage of his future intentions the recruits with sullen reluctance entered on a service whose labors were increased while its rewards were diminished by a covetous and unwarlike sovereign the murmurs of the army swelled with impunity into seditious clamours and the partial mutinies betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection that waited only for the slightest occasion to break out on every side into a general rebellion to minds thus

experienced general the battle still raged with doubtful violence and macrinus might have obtained the victory had he not betrayed his own cause by a shameful and precipitate flight his cowardice served only to protract his life a few days and to stamp deserved ignominy on his misfortunes it is scarcely necessary to add that his son diadumenianus was involved in the same fate as soon as the

person of her son in a hasty sally of passion elagabalus resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to compass by fraud and by a despotic sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and

the usurpation of macrinus was annihilated and that the son of caracalla dated his reign from his fathers death after resolving this great difficulty the smaller knots of this question may be easily untied or cut asunder   in the room of elagabalus his cousin alexander accession of alexander severus was raised to the throne by the praetorian guards his relation to the family of severus whose name he assumed was the same as that of his predecessor his virtue and his danger had already endeared him to the romans and the eager liberality of the senate conferred upon him in one day the various titles and powers of the imperial dignity hist august p     by this unusual precipitation the senate meant to confound the hopes of pretenders and prevent the factions of the armies  but as alexander was a modest and dutiful youth of only seventeen years of age the reins of government were in the hands of two women of his mother mamaea and of maesa his grandmother after the death of the latter who survived but a short time the elevation of alexander mamaea remained the sole regent of her son and of the empire  in every age and country the wiser or at least power of his mother mamaea the stronger of the two sexes has usurped the powers of the state and confined the other to the cares and pleasures of domestic life in hereditary monarchies however and especially in those of modern europe the gallant spirit of chivalry and the law of succession have accustomed us to allow a singular exception and a woman is often acknowledged the absolute sovereign of a great kingdom in which she would be deemed incapable of exercising the smallest employment civil or military but as the roman emperors were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the republic their wives and mothers although distinguished by the name of augusta were never associated to their personal honors and a female reign would have appeared an inexpiable prodigy in the eyes of those primitive romans who married without love or loved without delicacy and respect metellus numidicus the censor acknowledged to the roman people in a public oration that had kind nature allowed us to exist without the help of women we should be delivered from a very troublesome companion and he could recommend matrimony only as the sacrifice of private pleasure to public duty aulus gellius i    the haughty

artful firmness of seneca and burrhus tacit annal xiii    the good sense or the indifference of succeeding princes restrained them from offending the prejudices of their subjects and it was reserved for the profligate elagabalus to discharge the acts of the senate with the name of his mother soaemias who was placed by the side of the consuls and subscribed as a regular member the decrees of the legislative assembly her more prudent sister mamaea declined the useless and odious prerogative and a solemn law was enacted excluding women for ever from the senate and devoting to the infernal gods the head of the wretch by whom this sanction should be violated hist august p  0   0   the substance not the pageantry of power was the object of mamaeas manly ambition she maintained an absolute and lasting empire over the mind of her son and in his affection the mother could not brook a rival alexander with her consent married the daughter of a patrician but his respect for his fatherinlaw and love for the empress were inconsistent with the tenderness or interest of mamaea the patrician was executed on the ready accusation of treason and the wife of alexander driven with ignominy from the palace and banished into africa dion l lxxx p      herodian l vi p  0  hist august p     herodian represents the patricians as innocent the augustan history on the authority of dexippus condemns him as guilty of a conspiracy against the life of alexander it is impossible to pronounce between them but dion is an irreproachable witness of the jealousy and cruelty of mamaea toward the young empress whose hard fate alexander lamented but durst not oppose   notwithstanding this act of jealous cruelty as wise and moderate administration well as some instances of avarice with which mamaea is charged the general tenor of her administration was equally for the benefit of her son and of the empire with the approbation of the senate she chose sixteen of the wisest and most virtuous senators as a perpetual council of state before whom every public business of moment was debated and determined the celebrated ulpian equally distinguished by his knowledge of and his respect for the laws of rome was at their head and the prudent firmness of this aristocracy restored order and authority to the government as soon as they had purged the city from foreign superstition and luxury the remains of the capricious tyranny of elagabalus they applied themselves to remove his worthless creatures from every department of public administration and to supply their places with men of virtue and ability

  the latter insinuates that when any law was to be passed the council was assisted by a number of able lawyers and experienced senators whose opinions were separately given and taken down in writing   but the most important care of mamaea and education and virtuous temper of alexander her wise counselors was to form the character of the young emperor on whose personal qualities the happiness or misery of the roman world must ultimately depend the fortunate soil assisted and even prevented the hand of cultivation an excellent understanding soon convinced alexander of the advantages of virtue the pleasure of knowledge and the necessity of labor a natural mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the assaults of passion and the allurements of vice his unalterable regard for his mother and his esteem for the wise ulpian guarded his unexperienced youth from the poison of flattery  the simple journal of his ordinary occupations journal of his ordinary life exhibits a pleasing picture of an accomplished emperor see his life in the augustan history the undistinguishing compiler has buried these interesting anecdotes under a load of tririal and unmeaning circumstances  and with some allowance for the difference of manners might well deserve the imitation of modern princes alexander rose early the first moments of the day were consecrated to private devotion and his domestic chapel was filled with the images of those heroes who by improving or reforming human life had deserved the grateful reverence of posterity but as he deemed the service of mankind the most acceptable worship of the gods the greatest part of his morning hours was employed in his council where he discussed public affairs and determined private causes with a patience and discretion above his years the dryness of business was relieved by the charms of literature and a portion of time was always set apart for his favorite studies of poetry history and philosophy the works of virgil and horace the republics of plato and cicero formed his taste enlarged his understanding and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government the exercises of the body succeeded to those of the mind and alexander who was tall active and robust surpassed most of his equals in the gymnastic arts refreshed by the use of the bath and a slight dinner he resumed with new vigor the business of the day and till the hour of supper the principal meal of the romans he was attended by his secretaries with whom he read and answered the multitude of letters memorials and petitions that must have been addressed to the master of the greatest part of the world his table was served with the most frugal simplicity and whenever he was at liberty to consult his own inclination the company consisted of a few select friends men of learning and virtue amongst whom ulpian was constantly invited their conversation was familiar and instructive and the pauses were occasionally enlivened by the recital of some pleasing composition which supplied the place of the dancers comedians and even gladiators so frequently summoned to the tables of the rich and luxurious romans see the   th satire of juvenal

general happiness of the roman world a d          not a moment for vice or folly is a better proof of the wisdom and justice of alexanders government than all the trifling details preserved in the

enjoyed an auspicious calm of thirteen years the provinces relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by caracalla and his pretended son flourished in peace and prosperity under the administration of magistrates who were convinced by experience that to deserve the love of the subjects was their best and only method of obtaining the favor of their sovereign while some gentle restraints were imposed on the innocent luxury of the roman people the price of provisions and the interest of money were reduced by the paternal care of alexander whose prudent liberality without distressing the industrious supplied the wants and amusements of the populace the dignity the freedom the authority of the senate were restored and every virtuous senator might approach the person of the emperor without fear and without a blush  the name of antoninus ennobled by the virtues alexander refuses the name of antoninus of pius and marcus had been communicated by adoption to the dissolute verus and by descent to the cruel commodus it became the honorable appellation of the sons of severus was bestowed on young diadumenianus and at length prostituted to the infamy of the high priest of emesa alexander though

the year     when the romans had enjoyed almost a twelvemonth the blessings of his reign before the appellation of antoninus was offered him as a title of honor the senate waited to see whether alexander would not assume it as a family name   in the civil administration of alexander wisdom he attempts to reform the army was enforced by power and the people sensible of the public felicity repaid their benefactor with their love and gratitude there still remained a greater a more necessary but a more difficult enterprise the reformation of the military order whose interest and temper confirmed by long impunity rendered them impatient of the restraints of discipline and careless of the blessings of public tranquillity in the execution of his design the emperor affected to display his love and to conceal his fear of the army the most rigid economy in every other branch of the administration supplied a fund of gold and silver for the ordinary pay and the extraordinary rewards of the troops in their marches he relaxed the severe obligation of carrying seventeen days provision on their shoulders ample magazines were formed along the public roads and as soon as they entered the enemys country a numerous train of mules and camels waited on their haughty laziness as alexander despaired of correcting the luxury of his soldiers he attempted at least to direct it to objects of martial pomp and ornament fine horses splendid armor and shield enriched with silver and gold he shared whatever fatigues he was obliged to impose visited in person the sick and wounded preserved an exact register of their services and his own gratitude and expressed on every occasion the warmest regard for a body of men whose welfare as he affected to declare was so closely connected with that

multitude with a sense of duty and to restore at least a faint image of that discipline to which the romans owed their empire over so many other nations as warlike and more powerful than themselves

praetorian guards and murder of ulpian youth of alexander they loved him as a tender pupil whom they had saved from a tyrants fury and placed on the imperial throne that amiable prince was sensible of the obligation but as his gratitude was restrained within the limits of reason and justice they soon were more dissatisfied with the virtues of alexander than they had ever been with the vices of elagabalus their prefect the wise ulpian was the friend of the laws and of the people he was considered as the enemy of the soldiers and to his pernicious counsels every scheme of reformation was imputed some trifling accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny and a civil war raged during three days in rome whilst the life of that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people terrified at length by the sight of some houses in flames and by the threats of a general conflagration the people yielded with a sigh and left the virtuous but unfortunate ulpian to his fate he was pursued into the imperial palace and massacred at the feet of his master who vainly strove to cover him with the purple and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers such was the deplorable weakness of government that the emperor was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his insulted dignity without stooping to the arts of patience and dissimulation epagathus the principal leader of the mutiny was removed from rome by the honorable employment of prefect of egypt from that high rank he was gently degraded to the government of crete and when at length his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and absence alexander ventured to inflict the tardy but deserved punishment of his crimes though the author of the life of alexander hist august p     mentions the sedition raised against ulpian by the soldiers he conceals the catastrophe as it might discover a weakness in the administration of his hero from this designed omission we may judge of the weight and candor of that author  under the reign of a just and virtuous prince the tyranny of the army threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers who were suspected of an intention to correct their intolerable disorders the historian dion cassius had commanded the danger of dion cassius pannonian legions with the spirit of ancient discipline their brethren of rome embracing the common cause of military license demanded the head of the reformer alexander however instead of yielding to their seditious clamours showed a just sense of his merit and services by appointing him his colleague in the consulship and defraying from his own treasury the expense of that vain dignity but as it was justly apprehended that if the soldiers beheld him with the ensigns of his office they would revenge the insult in his blood the nominal first magistrate of the state retired by the emperors advice from the city and spent the greatest part of his confulship at his villas in campania for

been related by a judicious historian we should find this action worthy of caesar himself reduced nearer to the level of probability and the common standard of the character of alexander severus the abilities of that amiable prince seem to have been inadequate to the difficulties of his situation the firmness of his conduct inferior to the purity of his intentions his virtues as well as the vices of elagabalus contracted a tincture of weakness and effeminacy from the soft climate of syria of which he was a native though he blushed at his foreign origin and listened with a vain complacency to

the ridiculous avarice of his mother  the fatigues of the persian war irritated the military discontent the unsuccessful event degraded the reputation of the emperor as a general and even as a soldier every cause prepared and every circumstance hastened a revolution which distracted the roman empire with a long series of intestine calamities  the dissolute tyranny of commodus the civil wars occasioned by his death and the new maxims digression on the finances of the empire of policy introduced by the house of severus had all contributed to increase the dangerous power of the army and to obliterate the faint image of laws and liberty that was still impressed on the minds of the romans this internal change which undermined the foundations of the empire we have endeavored to explain

difference of times and circumstances the general income of the roman provinces could seldom amount to less than fifteen or twenty millions of our money lipsius de magnitudine romana l ii c   computes the revenue at one hundred and fifty millions of gold crowns but his whole book though learned and ingenious betrays a very heated imagination  and  dly that so ample a revenue must have been fully adequate to all the expenses of the moderate government instituted by augustus whose court was the modest family of a private senator and whose military establishment was calculated for the defense of the frontiers without any aspiring views of conquest or any serious apprehension of a foreign invasion  notwithstanding the seeming probability of taxes on roman citizens instituted by augustus both these conclusions the latter of them at least is positively disowned by the language and conduct of augustus it is not easy to determine whether on this occasion he acted as the common father of the roman world or as the oppressor of liberty whether he wished to relieve the provinces or to impoverish the senate and the equestrian order but no sooner had he assumed the reins of government than he frequently intimated the insufficiency of the tributes and the necessity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon rome and italy in the prosecution of this unpopular design he advanced however by cautious and wellweighed steps the introduction of customs was followed by the establishment of an excise and the scheme of taxation was completed by an artful assessment on the real and personal property of the roman citizens who had been exempted from any kind of contribution above a century and a half  i in a great empire like that of rome a the customs natural balance of money must have gradually established itself it has been already observed that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the strong hand of conquest and power so a considerable part of it was restored to the industrious provinces by the gentle influence of commerce and arts in the reign of augustus and his successors duties were imposed on every kind of merchandise which through a thousand channels flowed to the great center of opulence and luxury and in whatsoever manner the law was expressed it was the roman purchaser and not the provincial merchant who paid the tax tacit annal xiii     the rate of the customs varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity and we have a right to suppose that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those of necessity and that the productions raised or manufactured by the labor of the subjects of the empire were treated with more indulgence than was shown to the pernicious or at least the unpopular commerce of arabia and india see pliny hist nature l vi c    l xii c    his observation that the indian commodities were sold at rome at a hundred times their original price may give us some notion of the produce of the customs since that original price amounted to more than eight hundred thousand pounds  there is still extant a long but imperfect catalogue of eastern commodities which about the time of alexander severus were subject to the payment of duties cinnamon myrrh pepper ginger and the whole tribe of aromatics a great variety of precious stones among which the diamond was the most remarkable for its price and the emerald for its beauty the ancients were unacquainted with the art of cutting diamonds  parthian and babylonian leather cottons silks both raw and manufactured ebony ivory and eunuchs m bouchaud in his treatise de limpot chez les romans has transcribed this catalogue from the digest and attempts to illustrate it by a very prolix commentary  we may observe that the use and value of those effeminate slaves gradually rose with the decline of the empire  ii the excise introduced by augustus after the civil wars was extremely moderate but it the excise was general it seldom exceeded one per cent but it comprehended whatever was sold in the markets or by public auction from the most considerable purchases of lands and houses to those minute objects which can only derive a value from their infinite multitude and daily consumption such a tax as it affects the body of the people has ever been the occasion of clamor and discontent an emperor well acquainted with the wants and resources of the state was obliged to declare by a public edict that the support of the army depended in a great measure on the produce of the excise tacit annal i    two years afterward the reduction of the poor kingdom of cappadocia gave tiberius a pretense for diminishing the excise to one half but the relief was of very short duration   iii when augustus resolved to establish a tax on legacies and inheritances permanent military force for the defense of his government against foreign and domestic enemies he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay of the soldiers the rewards of the veterans and the extraordinary expenses of war the ample revenue of the excise though peculiarly appropriated to those uses was found inadequate to supply the deficiency the emperor suggested a new tax of five per cent on all legacies and inheritances but the nobles of rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom their indignant murmurs were received by augustus with his usual temper he heartily referred the whole business to the senate and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other expedient of a less odious nature they were divided and perplexed he insinuated to them that their obstinacy would oblige him to propose a general land tax and capitation they acquiesced in silence dion cassius l lv p     l lvi p      the new imposition on legacies and inheritances was however mitigated by some restrictions it did not take place unless the object was of a certain value most probably of fifty or an hundred pieces of gold the sum is only fixed by conjecture  nor could it be exacted from the nearest of kin on the fathers side as the roman law subsisted for many ages the cognati or relations on the mothers side were not called to the succession this harsh institution was gradually undermined by humanity and finally abolished by justinian  when the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured it seemed reasonable that a stranger or a distant relation who acquired an unexpected accession of fortune should cheerfully resign a twentieth part of it for the benefit of the state plin panegyric c      such a tax plentiful as it must prove in every suited to the laws and manners wealthy community was most happily suited to the situation of the romans who could frame their arbitrary wills according to the dictates of reason or caprice without any restraint from the modern fetters of entails and settlements from various causes the partiality of paternal affection often lost its influence over the stern patriots of the commonwealth and the dissolute nobles of the empire and if the father bequeathed to his son the fourth part of his estate he removed all ground of legal complaint see heineccius in the antiquit juris romani l ii  but a rich childless old man was a domestic tyrant and his power increased with his years and infirmities a servile crowd in which he frequently reckoned praetors and consuls courted his smiles pampered his avarice applauded his follies served his passions and waited with impatience

blind impulse of benevolence conceived a wish of abolishing the oppression of the customs and excise the wisest senators applauded his magnanimity but they diverted him from the execution of a design which would have dissolved the strength and resources of the republic tacit annal xiii  0 esprit des loix l xii c     had it indeed been possible to realize this dream of fancy such princes as trajan and the antonines would surely have embraced with ardour the glorious opportunity of conferring so signal an obligation on mankind satisfied however with alleviating the public burden they attempted not to remove it the mildness and precision of their laws ascertained the rule and measure of taxation and protected the subject of every rank against arbitrary interpretations antiquated claims and the insolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue see plinys panegyric the augustan history and burman de vectigal passim  for it is somewhat singular that in every age the best and wisest of the roman governors persevered in this pernicious method of collecting the principal branches at least of the excise and customs the tributes properly so called were not farmed since the good princes often remitted many millions of arrears   the sentiments and indeed the situation of edict of caracalla caracalla were very different from those of the antonines inattentive or rather averse to the welfare of his people he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the insatiate avarice which he had excited in the army of the several impositions introduced by augustus the twentieth on inheritances and legacies was the most fruitful as well as the most comprehensive as its influence was not confined to rome or italy the produce continually increased with the gradual extension of the roman city the new citizens though charged on equal terms the situation of the new citizens is minutely described by pliny panegyric c          trajan published a law very much in their favor  with the payment of new taxes which had not affected them as subjects derived an ample compensation from the rank they obtained the privileges they acquired and the fair prospect of honors and fortune that was thrown open to their ambition but the favor which implied a distinction the freedom of the city given to all the provincials for the purpose of taxation was lost in the prodigality of caracalla and the reluctant provincials were compelled to assume the vain title and the real obligations of roman citizens nor was the rapacious son of severus contented with such a measure of taxation as had appeared sufficient to his moderate predecessors instead of a twentieth he exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances and during his reign for the ancient proportion was restored after his death he crushed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter dion l lxxvii p        when all the provincials became liable to the temporary reduction of the tribute peculiar impositions of roman citizens they seemed to acquire a legal exemption from the tributes which they had paid in their former condition of subjects such were not the maxims of government adopted by caracalla and his pretended son the old as well as the new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces it was reserved for the virtue of alexander to relieve them in a great measure from this intolerable grievance by reducing the tributes to a thirtieth part of the sum exacted at the time of his accession he who paid ten aurei the usual tribute was charged with no more than the third part of an aureus and proportional pieces of gold were coined by alexanders order hist august p     with the commentary of salmasius  it is impossible to conjecture the motive that engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil but the noxious weed which had not been totally eradicated again sprang up with the most luxuriant growth and in the succeeding age darkened the roman world with its deadly shade in the course of this history we shall be too often summoned to explain the land tax the capitation and the heavy contributions of corn wine oil and meat which were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court the army and the capital  as long as rome and italy were respected as consequences of the universal freedom of rome the center of government a national spirit was preserved by the ancient and insensibly imbibed by the adopted citizens the principal commands of the army were filled by men who had received a liberal education were well instructed in the advantages of laws and letters and who had risen by equal steps through the regular succession of civil and military honors see the lives of agricola vespasian trajan severus and his three competitors and indeed of all the eminent men of those times  to their influence and example we may partly ascribe the modest obedience of the legions during the two first centuries of the imperial history  but when the last enclosure of the roman constitution was trampled down by caracalla the separation of professions gradually succeeded to the distinction of ranks the more polished citizens of the internal provinces were alone qualified to act as lawyers and magistrates the rougher trade of arms was abandoned to the peasants and barbarians of the frontiers who knew no country but their camp no science but that of war no civil laws and scarcely those of military discipline with bloody hands savage manners and desperate resolutions they sometimes guarded but much oftener subverted the throne

fairest scope for ridicule is it possible to relate without an indignant the apparent ridicule smile that on the fathers decease the property of a nation like that of a drove of oxen descends to his infant son as yet unknown to mankind and to himself and that the bravest warriors and the wisest statesmen relinquishing their natural right to empire approach the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of inviolable fidelity satire and declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colors but our more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice that establishes a rule of succession independent of the passions of mankind and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous and indeed the ideal power of giving themselves a master  in the cool shade of retirement we may easily and solid advantages of hereditary succession devise imaginary forms of government in which the scepter shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy by the free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community experience overturns these airy fabrics and teaches us that in a large society the election of a monarch can never devolve to the wisest or to the most numerous part of the people the army is the only order of men sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments and powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their fellowcitizens but the temper of soldiers habituated at once to violence and to slavery renders them very unfit guardians of a legal or even a civil constitution justice humanity or political wisdom are qualities they are too little acquainted with in themselves to appreciate them in others valor will acquire their esteem and liberality will purchase their suffrage but the first of these merits is often lodged in the most savage breasts the latter can only exert itself at the expense of the public and both may be turned against the possessor of the throne by the ambition of a daring rival  the superior prerogative of birth when it has want of it in the roman empire productive of the greatest calamities obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among mankind the acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction and the conscious security disarms the cruelty of the monarch to the firm establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and mild administration of european monarchies to the defect of it we must attribute the frequent civil wars through which an asiatic despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers yet even in the east the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the reigning house and as soon as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the sword and the bowstring he no longer entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjects but the roman empire after the authority of the senate had sunk into contempt was a vast scene of confusion the royal and even noble families of the provinces had long since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans the ancient families of rome had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the caesars and whilst those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth and disappointed by the repeated failure of their posterity there had been no example of three successive generations on the throne only three instances of sons who succeeded their fathers the marriages of the caesars notwithstanding the permission and the frequent practice of divorces were generally unfruitful  it was impossible that any idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds of their subjects the right to the throne which none could claim from birth every one assumed from merit the daring hopes of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law and prejudice and the meanest of mankind might without folly entertain a hope of being raised by valor and fortune to a rank in the army in which a single crime would enable him to wrest the scepter of the world from his feeble and unpopular master after the murder of alexander severus and the elevation of maximin no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne and every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that august but dangerous station  about thirtytwo years before that event the birth and fortunes of maximin emperor severus returning from an eastern expedition halted in thrace to celebrate with military games the birthday of his younger son geta the country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited in his rude dialect that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wrestling as the pride of discipline would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a roman soldier by a thracian peasant he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground his victory was rewarded by some trifling gifts and a permission to inlist in the troops the next day the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits dancing and exulting after the fashion of his country as soon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperors notice he instantly ran up to his horse and followed him on foot without the least appearance of fatigue in a long and rapid career thracian said severus with astonishment art thou disposed to wrestle after thy race most willingly sir replied the unwearied youth and almost in a breath overthrew seven of the strongest soldiers in the army a gold collar was the prize of his matchless vigor and activity and he was immediately appointed to serve in the horseguards who always attended on the person of the sovereign hist august p       maximin for that was his name though born on the territories of the empire descended from his military service and honors a mixed race of barbarians his father was a goth and his mother of the nation of the alani he displayed on every occasion a valor equal to his strength and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the knowledge of the world under the reign of severus and his son he obtained the rank of centurion with the favor and esteem of both those princes the former of whom was an excellent judge of merit gratitude forbade maximin to serve under the assassin of caracalla honor taught him to decline the effeminate insults of elagabalus on the accession of alexander he returned to court and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service and honorable to himself the fourth legion to which he was appointed tribune soon became under his care the best disciplined of the whole army with the general applause of the soldiers who bestowed on their favorite hero the names of ajax and hercules he was successively promoted to the first military command hist august p   0 herodian l vi p     aurelius victor by comparing these authors it should seem that maximin had the particular command of the triballian horse with the general commission of disciplining the recruits of the whole army his biographer ought to have marked with more care his exploits and the successive steps of his military promotions  and had not he still retained too much of his savage origin the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in marriage to the son of maximin see the original letter of alexander severus hist august   instead of securing his fidelity these favors conspiracy of maximin served only to inflame the ambition of the thracian peasant who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit as long as he was constrained to acknowledge a superior though a stranger to real wisdom he was not devoid of a selfish cunning which showed him that the emperor had lost the affection of the army and taught him to improve their discontent to his own advantage it is easy for faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of the best of princes and to accuse even their virtues by artfully confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity the troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of maximin they blushed at their own ignominious patience which during thirteen years had supported the vexatious discipline imposed by an effeminate syrian the timid slave of his mother and of the senate it was time they cried to cast away that useless phantom of the civil power and to elect for their prince and general a real soldier educated in camps exercised in war who would assert the glory and distribute among his companions the treasures of the empire a great army was at that time assembled on the banks of the rhine under the command of the emperor himself who almost immediately after his return from the persian war had been obliged to march against the barbarians of germany the important care of training and reviewing the new levies was entrusted to maximin one day as he entered the field of exercise the troops either from a sudden impulse or a formed conspiracy saluted him emperor silenced by their loud acclamations his obstinate refusal and hastened to consummate their rebellion by the murder of a d     march    alexander severus  the circumstances of his death are variously murder of alexander severus related the writers who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of maximin affirm that after taking a frugal repast in the sight of the army he retired to sleep and that about the seventh hour of the day a part of his own guards broke into the imperial tent and with many wounds assassinated their virtuous and unsuspecting prince hist august p     i have softened some of the most improbable circumstances of this wretched biographer from this illworded narration it should seem that the princes buffoon having accidentally entered the tent and awakened the slumbering monarch the fear of punishment urged him to persuade the disaffected soldiers to commit the murder  if we credit another and indeed a more probable account maximin was invested with the purple by a numerous detachment at the distance of several miles from the headquarters and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army alexander had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among his troops but their reluctant professions of fidelity quickly vanished on the appearance of maximin who declared himself the friend and advocate of the military order and was unanimously acknowledged emperor of the romans by the applauding legions the son of mamaea betrayed and deserted withdrew into his tent desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multitude he was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions the ministers of death but instead of receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke his unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his life and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire his mother mamaea whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of his ruin perished with her son the most faithful of his friends were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper and those who experienced the mildest treatment were stripped of their employments and ignominiously driven from the court and army herodian l vi p            the former tyrants caligula and nero commodus tyranny of maximin and caracalla were all dissolute and unexperienced youths caligula the eldest of the four was only twentyfive years of age when he ascended the throne caracalla was twentythree commodus nineteen and nero no more than seventeen  educated in the purple and corrupted by the pride of empire the luxury of rome and the perfidious voice of flattery the cruelty of maximin was derived from a different source the fear of contempt though he depended on the attachment of the soldiers who loved him for virtues like their own he was conscious that his mean and barbarian origin his savage appearance and his total ignorance of the arts and institutions of civil life it appears that he was totally ignorant of the greek language which from its universal use in conversation and letters was an essential part of every liberal education  formed a very unfavourable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy alexander he remembered that in his humbler fortune he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of rome and had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves he recollected too the friendship of a few who had relieved his poverty and assisted his rising hopes but those who had spurned and those who had protected the thracian were guilty of the same crime the knowledge of his original obscurity for this crime many were put to death and by the execution of several of his benefactors maximin published in characters of blood the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude hist august p     herodian l vii p     the latter of these historians has been most unjustly censured for sparing the vices of maximin   the dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most distinguished by their birth or merit whenever he was alarmed with the sound of treason his cruelty was unbounded and unrelenting a conspiracy against his life was either discovered or imagined and magnus a consular senator was named as the principal author of it without a witness without a trial and without an opportunity of defense magnus with four thousand of his supposed accomplices were put to death italy and the whole empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers on the slightest accusation the first of the roman nobles who had governed provinces commanded armies and been adorned with the consular and triumphal ornaments were chained on the public carriages and hurried away to the emperors presence confiscation exile or simple death were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity some of the unfortunate sufferers he ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaughtered animals others to be exposed to wild beasts others again to be beaten to death with clubs during the three years of his reign he disdained to visit either rome or italy his camp occasionally removed from the banks of the rhine to those of the danube was the seat of his stern despotism which trampled on every principle of law and justice and was supported by the avowed power of the sword the wife of maximin by insinuating wise counsels with female gentleness sometimes brought back the tyrant to the way of truth and humanity see ammianus marcellinus l xiv c   where he alludes to the fact which he had more fully related under the reign of the gordians we may collect from the medals that paullina was the name of this benevolent empress and from the title of diva that she died before maximin valesius ad loc cit ammian spanheim de u et p n tom ii p  00  no man of noble birth elegant accomplishments or

or even to the bold adventurers who in the court or army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune the body of the people viewed their sufferings with indifference or perhaps with pleasure but the tyrants avarice stimulated by the insatiate desires of the soldiers at length attacked the public property every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue destined to purchase corn for the multitude and to supply the expenses of the games and entertainments by a single act of authority the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for the use of the imperial treasury the temples were stripped of their most valuable offerings of gold and silver and the statues of gods heroes and emperors were melted down and coined into money these impious orders could not be executed without tumults and massacres as in many places the people chose rather to die in the defense of their altars than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the rapine and cruelty of war the soldiers themselves among whom this sacrilegious plunder was distributed received it with a blush and hardened as they were in acts of violence they dreaded the just reproaches of their friends and relations throughout the roman world a general cry of indignation was heard imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind and at length by an act of private oppression a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against him herodian l vii p     zosim l i p      the procurator of africa was a servant worthy revolt in africa a d     april of such a master who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one of the most fruitful branches of the imperial revenue an iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that country the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony in this extremity a resolution that must either complete or prevent their ruin was dictated by despair a respite of three days obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes the leaders of the conspiracy as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments and by the assistance of their tumultuary train seized on the little town of thysdrus in the fertile territory of byzacium one hundred and fifty miles to the south of carthage this city was decorated probably by the gordians with the title of colony and with a fine amphitheatre which is still in a very perfect state see itinerar wesseling p    and shaws travels p      and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the roman empire they rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against maximin and they judiciously resolved to oppose to that detested tyrant an emperor whose mild virtues had already acquired the love and esteem of the romans and whose authority over the province would give weight and stability to the enterprise gordianus their proconsul and the object of their choice refused with unfeigned reluctance the dangerous honor and begged with tears that they would suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life without staining his feeble age with civil blood their menaces compelled him to accept the imperial purple his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of maximin since according to the reasoning of tyrants those who have been esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death and those who deliberate have already rebelled herodian l vii p     hist august p       the family of gordianus was one of the most character and elevation of the two gordians illustrious of the roman senate on the fathers side he was descended from the gracchi on his mothers from the emperor trajan a great estate enabled him to support the dignity of his birth and in the enjoyment of it he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent disposition the palace in rome formerly inhabited by the great pompey had been during several generations in the possession of gordians family hist august p     the celebrated house of pompey in carinis was usurped by marc antony and consequently became after the triumvirs death a part of the imperial domain the emperor trajan allowed and even encouraged the rich senators to purchase those magnificent and useless places plin panegyric c  0 and it may seem probable that on this occasion pompeys house came into the possession of gordians great grandfather  it was distinguished by ancient trophies of naval victories and decorated with the works of modern painting his villa on the road to praeneste was celebrated for baths of singular beauty and extent for three stately rooms of an hundred feet in length and for a magnificent portico supported by two hundred columns of the four most curious and costly sorts of marble the claudian the numidian the carystian and the synnadian the colors of roman marbles have been faintly described and imperfectly distinguished it appears however that the carystian was a seagreen and that the marble of synnada was white mixed with oval spots of purple see salmasius ad hist august p      the public shows exhibited at his expense and in which the people were entertained with many hundreds of wild beasts and gladiators hist august p         he sometimes gave five hundred pair of gladiators never less than one hundred and fifty he once gave for the use of the circus one hundred sicilian and as many cappadocian horses the animals designed for hunting were chiefly bears boars bulls stags elks wild asses etc elephants and lions seem to have been appropriated to imperial magnificence  seem to surpass the fortune of a subject and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was confined to a few solemn festivals in rome the magnificence of gordian was repeated when he was aedile every month in the year and extended during his consulship to the principal cities of italy he was twice elevated to the last mentioned dignity by caracalla and by alexander for he possessed the uncommon talent of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes without alarming the jealousy of tyrants his long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peaceful honors of rome and till he was named proconsul of africa by the voice of the senate and the approbation of alexander see the original letter in the augustan history p     which at once shows alexanders respect for the authority of the senate and his esteem for the proconsul appointed by that assembly  he appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the government of provinces as long as that emperor lived africa was happy under the administration of his worthy representative after the barbarous maximin had usurped the throne gordianus alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent when he reluctantly accepted the purple he was above fourscore years old a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the antonines whose virtues he revived in his own conduct and celebrated in an elegant poem of thirty books with the venerable proconsul his son who had accompanied him into africa as his lieutenant was likewise declared emperor his manners were less pure but his character was equally amiable with that of his father twentytwo acknowledged concubines and a library of sixtytwo thousand volumes attested the variety of his inclinations and from the productions which he left behind him it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation by each of his concubines the younger gordian left three or four children his literary productions though less numerous were by no means contemptible  the roman people acknowledged in the features of the younger gordian the resemblance of scipio africanus recollected with pleasure that his mother was the granddaughter of antoninus pius and rested the public hope on those latent virtues which had hitherto as they fondly imagined lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of a private life  as soon as the gordians had appeased the first they solicit the confirmation of their authority tumult of a popular election they removed their court to carthage they were received with the acclamations of the africans who honored their virtues and who since the visit of hadrian had never beheld the majesty of a roman emperor but these vain acclamations neither strengthened nor confirmed the title of the gordians they were induced by principle as well as interest to solicit the approbation of the senate and a deputation of the noblest provincials was sent without delay to rome to relate and justify the conduct of their countrymen who having long suffered with patience were at length resolved to act with vigor the letters of the new princes were modest and respectful excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the imperial title but submitting their election and their fate to the supreme judgment of the senate herodian l vii p

prospect of the restoration not only of the civil but even of the republican government the terror of military violence which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder of alexander and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant quod tamen patres dum periculosum existimant inermes armato resistere approbaverunt aurelius victor  now produced a contrary effect and provoked them to assert the injured rights of freedom and humanity the hatred of maximin toward the senate was declared and implacable the tamest submission had not appeased his fury the most cautious innocence would

equestrian orders were dispatched at the same time to the governors of the several provinces earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of their country and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of friendship with the roman senate and people the general respect with which these deputies were received and the zeal of italy and the provinces in favor of the senate sufficiently prove that the subjects of maximin were reduced to that uncommon distress in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression than from resistance the consciousness of that melancholy truth inspires a degree of persevering fury seldom to be found in those civil wars which are artificially supported for the benefit of a few factious and designing leaders herodian l vii p     l viii

to procure him an honorable death in the field of battle his aged father whose reign had not exceeded thirtysix days put an end to his life on the first news of the defeat carthage destitute of

of the day and seemed to decline with trembling anxiety the consideration of their own and the public danger a silent consternation prevailed on the assembly till a senator of the name and family of trajan awakened his brethren from their fatal lethargy he represented to them that the choice of cautious dilatory measures had been long since out of their power that maximin implacable by nature and exasperated by injuries was advancing toward italy at the head of the military force of the empire and that their only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the field or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful rebellion we have lost continued he two excellent princes but unless we desert ourselves the hopes of the republic have not perished with the gordians many are the senators whose virtues have deserved and whose abilities would sustain the imperial dignity let us elect two emperors one of whom may conduct the war against the public enemy whilst his colleague remains at rome to direct the civil administration i cheerfully expose myself to the danger and envy of the nomination and give my vote in favor of maximus and balbinus ratify my choice conscript fathers or appoint in their place others more worthy of the empire the general apprehension silenced the whispers of jealousy the merit of the candidates was universally acknowledged and the house resounded with the sincere acclamations of long life and victory to the emperors maximus and balbinus you are happy in the judgment of the senate may the republic be happy under your administration see the augustan history p     from the registers of the senate the date is confessedly faulty but the coincidence of the apollinarian games enables us to correct it   the virtues and the reputation of the new emperors justified the most sanguine hopes of the their characters romans the various nature of their talents seemed to appropriate to each his peculiar department of peace and war without leaving room for jealous emulation balbinus was an admired orator a poet of distinguished fame and a wise magistrate who had exercised with innocence and applause the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of the empire his birth was noble he was descended from cornelius balbus a noble spaniard and the adopted son of theophanes the greek historian balbus obtained the freedom of rome by the favor of pompey and preserved it by the eloquence of cicero see orat pro cornel balbo the friendship of caesar to whom he rendered the most important secret services in the civil war raised him to the consulship and the pontificate honors never yet possessed by a stranger the nephew of this balbus triumphed over the garamantes see dictionnaire de bail au mot balbus where he distinguishes the several persons of that name and rectifies with his usual accuracy the mistakes of former writers concerning them  his fortune affluent his manners liberal and affable in him the love of pleasure was corrected by a sense of dignity nor had the habits of ease deprived him of a capacity for business the mind of maximus was formed in a rougher mould by his valor and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments of the state and army his victories over the sarmatians and the germans the austerity of his life and the rigid impartiality of his justice whilst he was prefect of the city commanded the esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favor of the more amiable balbinus the two colleagues had both been consuls balbinus had twice enjoyed that honorable office both had been named among the twenty lieutenants of the senate and since the one was sixty and the other seventyfour years old zonaras l xii p     but little dependence is to be had on the authority of a moderate greek so grossly ignorant of the history of the third century that he creates several imaginary emperors and confounds those who really existed  they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience  after the senate had conferred on maximus tumult at rome the younger gordian is declared caesar and balbinus an equal portion of the consular and tribunitian powers the title of fathers of their country and the joint office of supreme pontiff they ascended to the capitol to return thanks to the gods protectors of rome herodian l vii p     supposes that the senate was at first convoked in the capitol and is very eloquent on the occasion the augustan history p     seems much more authentic  the solemn rites of sacrifice were disturbed by a sedition of the people the licentious multitude neither loved the rigid maximus nor did they sufficiently fear the mild and humane balbinus their increasing numbers surrounded the temple of jupiter with obstinate clamours they asserted their inherent right of consenting to the election of their sovereign and demanded with an apparent moderation that besides the two emperors chosen by the senate a third should be added of the family of the gordians as a just return of gratitude to those princes who had sacrificed their lives for the republic at the head of the cityguards and the youth of the equestrian order maximus and balbinus attempted to cut their way through the seditious multitude the multitude armed with sticks and stones drove them back into the capitol it is prudent to yield when the contest whatever may be the issue of it must be fatal to both parties a boy only thirteen years of age the grandson of the elder and nephew of the younger gordian was produced to the people invested with the ornaments and title of caesar the tumult was appeased by this easy condescension and the two emperors as soon as they had been peaceably acknowledged in rome prepared to defend italy against the common enemy  whilst in rome and africa revolutions succeeded maximin prepares to attack the senate and their emperors each other with such amazing rapidity the mind of maximin was agitated by the most furious passions he is said to have received the news of the rebellion of the gordians and of the decree of the senate against him not with the temper of a man but the rage of a wild beast which as it could not discharge itself on the distant senate threatened the life of his son of his friends and of all who ventured to approach his person the grateful intelligence of the death of the gordians was quickly followed by the assurance that the senate laying aside all hopes of pardon or accommodation had substituted in their room two emperors with whose merit he could not be unacquainted revenge was the only consolation left to maximin and revenge could only be obtained by arms the strength of the legions had been assembled by alexander from all parts of the empire three successful campaigns against the germans and the sarmatians had raised their fame confirmed their discipline and even increased their numbers by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian youth the life of maximin had been spent in war and the candid severity of history cannot refuse him the valor of a soldier or even the abilities of an experienced general in herodian l vii p     and in the augustan history we have three several orations of maximin to his army on the rebellion of africa and rome m de tillemont has very justly observed that they neither agree with each other nor with truth histoire des empereurs tom iii p      it might naturally be expected that a prince of such a character instead of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay should immediately have marched from the banks of the danube to those of the tyber and that his victorious army instigated by contempt for the senate and eager to gather the spoils of italy should have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative conquest yet as far as we can trust to the obscure chronology of that period the carelessness of the writers of that age leaves us in a singular perplexity   we know that maximus and balbinus were killed during the capitoline games herodian l viii p     the authority of censorinus de die natali c    enables us to fix those games with certainty to the year     but leaves us in ignorance of the month or day   the election of gordian by the senate is fixed with equal certainty to the   th of may but we are at a loss to discover whether it was in the same or the preceding year tillemont and muratori who maintain the two opposite opinions bring into the field a desultory troop of authorities conjectures and probabilities the one seems to draw out the other to contract the series of events between those periods more than can be well reconciled to reason and history yet it is necessary to choose between them  it appears that the operations of some foreign war deferred the italian expedition till the ensuing spring from the prudent conduct of maximin we may learn that the savage features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of party that his passions however impetuous submitted to the force of reason and that the barbarian possessed something of the generous spirit of sylla who subdued the enemies of rome before he suffered himself to revenge his private injuries velleius paterculus l ii c    the president de montesquieu in his dialogue between sylla and eucrates expresses the sentiments of the dictator in a spirited and even a sublime manner   when the troops of maximin advancing in marches into italy a d     february excellent order arrived at the foot of the julian alps they were terrified by the silence and desolation that reigned on the frontiers of italy the villages and open towns had been abandoned on their approach by the inhabitants the cattle was driven away the provisions removed or destroyed the bridges broke down nor was any thing left which could afford either shelter or subsistence to an invader such had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate whose design was to protract the war to ruin the army of maximin by the slow operation of famine and to consume his strength in the sieges of the principal cities of italy which they had plentifully stored with men and provisions from the deserted country aquileia received and withstood the siege of aquileia first shock of the invasion the streams that issue from the head of the hadriatic gulf swelled by the melting of the winter snows muratori annali ditalia tom ii p     thinks the melting of the snows suits better with the months of june or july than with those of february the opinion of a man who passed his life between the alps and the appennines is undoubtedly of great weight yet i observe   that the long winter of which muratori takes advantage is to be found only in the latin version and not in the greek text of herodian   that the vicissitude of suns and rains to which the soldiers of maximin were exposed herodian l viii p     denotes the spring rather than the summer we may observe likewise that these several streams as they melted into one composed the timavus so poetically in every sense of the word described by virgil they are about twelve miles to the east of aquileia see cluyer italia antiqua tom i p     etc  opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms of maximin at length on a singular bridge constructed with art and difficulty of large hogsheads he transported his army to the opposite bank rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neighborhood of aquileia demolished the suburbs and employed the timber of the buildings in the engines and towers with which on every side he attacked the city the walls fallen to decay during the security of a long peace had been hastily repaired on this sudden emergency but the firmest defense of aquileia consisted in the constancy of the citizens all ranks of whom instead of being dismayed were animated by the extreme danger and their knowledge of the tyrants unrelenting temper their courage was supported and directed by crispinus and menophilus two of the twenty lieutenants of the senate who with a small body of regular troops had thrown themselves into the besieged place the army of maximin was repulsed on repeated attacks his machines destroyed by showers of artificial fire and the generous enthusiasm of the aquileians was exalted into a confidence of success by the opinion that belenus their tutelar deity combated in person in the defense of his distressed worshippers herodian l viii p     the celtic deity was supposed to be apollo and received under that name the thanks of the senate a temple was likewise built to venus the bald in honor of the women of aquileia who had given up their hair to make ropes for the military engines   the emperor maximus who had advanced as conduct of maximus far as ravenna to secure that important place and to hasten the military preparations beheld the event of the war in the more faithful mirror of reason and policy he was too sensible that a single town could not resist the persevering efforts of a great army and he dreaded lest the enemy tired with the obstinate resistance of aquileia should on a sudden relinquish the fruitless siege and march directly toward rome the fate of the empire and the cause of freedom must then be committed to the chance of a battle and what arms could he oppose to the veteran legions of the rhine and danube some troops newly levied among the generous but enervated youth of italy and a body of german auxiliaries on whose firmness in the hour of trial it was dangerous to depend in the midst of these just alarms the stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes of maximin and delivered rome and the senate from the calamities that would surely have attended the victory of an enraged barbarian  the people of aquileia had scarcely experienced any of the common miseries of a siege their magazines were plentifully supplied and murder of maximin and his son a d     april several fountains within the walls assured them of an inexhaustible resource of fresh water the soldiers of maximin were on the contrary exposed to the inclemency of the season the contagion of disease and the horrors of famine the open country was ruined the rivers filled with the slain and polluted with blood a spirit of despair and disaffection began to diffuse itself among the troops and as they were cut off from all intelligence they easily believed that the whole empire had embraced the cause of the senate and that they were left as devoted victims to perish under the impregnable walls of aquileia the fierce temper of the tyrant was exasperated by disappointments which he imputed to the cowardice of his army and his wanton and illtimed cruelty instead of striking terror inspired hatred and a just desire of revenge a party of praetorian guards who trembled for their wives and children in the camp of alba near rome executed the sentence of the senate maximin abandoned by his guards was slain in his tent with his son whom he had associated to the honors of the purple anulinus the prefect and the principal ministers of his tyranny herodian l viii p     hist august p     the duration of maximins reign has not been defined with much accuracy except by eutropius who allows him three years and a few days l ix   we may depend on the integrity of the text as the latin original is checked by the greek version of paeanius  the sight of their heads borne on the point of spears convinced the citizens of aquileia that the siege was at an end the gates of the city were thrown open a liberal market was provided for the hungry troops of maximin and the whole army joined in solemn protestations of fidelity to the senate and the people of rome and to their lawful emperors maximus and balbinus such was the deserved fate of his portrait a brutal savage destitute as he has generally been represented of every sentiment that distinguishes a civilized or even a human being the body was suited to the soul the stature of maximin exceeded the measure of eight feet and circumstances almost incredible are related of his matchless strength and appetite eight roman feet and one third which are equal to above eight english feet as the two measures are to each other in the proportion of     to  000 see gravess discourse on the roman foot we are told that maximin could drink in a day an amphora or about seven gallons of wine and eat thirty or forty pounds of meat he could move a loaded wagon break a horses leg with his fist crumble stones in his hand and tear up small trees by the roots see his life in the augustan history  had he lived in a less enlightened age tradition and poetry might well have described him as one of those monstrous giants whose supernatural power was constantly exerted for the destruction of mankind  it is easier to conceive than to describe the joy of the roman world universal joy of the roman world on the fall of the tyrant the news of which is said to have been carried in four days from aquileia to rome the return of maximus was a triumphal procession his colleague and young gordian went out to meet him and the three princes made their entry into the capital attended by the ambassadors of almost all the cities of italy saluted with the splendid offerings of gratitude and superstition and received with the unfeigned acclamations of the senate and people who persuaded themselves that a golden age would succeed to an age of iron see the congratulatory letter of claudius julianus the consul to the two emperors in the augustan history  the conduct of the two emperors corresponded with these expectations they administered justice in person and the rigor of the one was tempered by the others clemency the oppressive taxes with which maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and succession were repealed or at least moderated discipline was revived and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were enacted by their imperial ministers who endeavored to restore a civil constitution on the ruins of military tyranny what reward may we expect for delivering rome from a monster was the question asked by maximus in a moment of freedom and confidence balbinus answered it without hesitation the love of the senate of the people and of all mankind alas replied his more penetrating colleague alas i dread the hatred of the soldiers and the fatal effects of their resentment hist august p      his apprehensions were but too well justified by the event  whilst maximus was preparing to defend italy against the common foe balbinus who remained sedition at rome at rome had been engaged in scenes of blood and intestine discord distrust and jealousy reigned in the senate and even in the temples where they assembled every senator carried either open or concealed arms in the midst of their deliberations two veterans of the guards actuated either by curiosity or a sinister motive audaciously thrust themselves into the house and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of victory gallicanus a consular and maecenas a praetorian senator viewed with indignation their insolent intrusion drawing their daggers they laid the spies for such they deemed them dead at the foot of the altar and then advancing to the door of the senate imprudently exhorted the multitude to massacre the praetorians as the secret adherents of the tyrant those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp which they defended with superior advantage against the reiterated attacks of the people assisted by the numerous bands of gladiators the property of opulent nobles the civil war lasted many days with infinite loss and confusion on both sides when the pipes were broken that supplied the camp with water the praetorians were reduced to intolerable distress but in their turn they made desperate sallies into the city set fire to a great number of houses and filled the streets with the blood of the inhabitants the emperor balbinus attempted by ineffectual edicts and precarious truces to reconcile the factions at rome but their animosity though smothered for a while burnt with redoubled violence the soldiers detesting the senate and the people despised the weakness of a prince who wanted either the spirit or the power to command the obedience of his subjects herodian l viii p       after the tyrants death his formidable army discontent of the praetorian guards had acknowledged from necessity rather than from choice the authority of maximus who transported himself without delay to the camp before aquileia as soon as he had received their oath of fidelity he addressed them in terms full of mildness and moderation lamented rather than arraigned the wild disorders of the times and assured the soldiers that of all their past conduct the senate would remember only their generous desertion of the tyrant and their voluntary return to their duty maximus enforced his exhortations by a liberal donative purified the camp by a solemn sacrifice of expiation and then dismissed the legions to their several provinces impressed as he hoped with a lively sense of gratitude and obedience herodian l viii p      but nothing could reconcile the haughty spirit of the praetorians they attended the emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into rome but amidst the general acclamations the sullen dejected countenance of the guards sufficiently declared that they considered themselves as the object rather than the partners of the triumph when the whole body was united in their camp those who had served under maximin and those who had remained at rome insensibly communicated to each other their complaints and apprehensions the emperors chosen by the army had perished with ignominy those elected by the senate were seated on the throne the observation had been made imprudently enough in the acclamations of the senate and with regard to the soldiers it carried the appearance of a wanton insult hist august p   0  the long discord between the civil and military powers was decided by a war in which the former had obtained a complete victory the soldiers must now learn a new doctrine of submission to the senate and whatever clemency was affected by that politic assembly they dreaded a slow revenge colored by the name of discipline and justified by fair pretenses of the public good but their fate was still in their own hands and if they had courage to despise the vain terrors of an impotent republic it was easy to convince the world that those who were masters of the arms were masters of the authority of the state  when the senate elected two princes it is massacre of maximus and balbinus probable that besides the declared reason of providing for the various emergencies of peace and war they were actuated by the secret desire of weakening by division the despotism of the supreme magistrate their policy was effectual but it proved fatal both to their emperors and to themselves the jealousy of power was soon exasperated by the difference of character maximus despised balbinus as a luxurious noble and was in his turn disdained by his colleague as an obscure soldier their silent discord was understood rather than seen discordiae tacitae et quae intelligerentur potius quam viderentur hist august p   0 this wellchosen expression is probably stolen from some better writer  but the mutual consciousness prevented them from uniting in any vigorous measures of defense against their common enemies of the praetorian camp the whole city was employed in the capitoline games and the emperors were left almost alone in the palace on a sudden they were alarmed a d     july    by the approach of a troop of desperate assassins ignorant of each others situation or designs for they already occupied very distant apartments afraid to give or to receive assistance they wasted the important moments in idle debates and fruitless recriminations the arrival of the guards put an end to the vain strife they seized on these emperors of the senate for such they called them with malicious contempt stripped them of their garments and dragged them in insolent triumph through the streets of rome with a design of inflicting a slow and cruel death on these unfortunate princes the fear of a rescue from the faithful germans of the imperial guards shortened their tortures and their bodies mangled with a thousand wounds were left exposed to the insults or to the pity of the populace herodian l viii p

day for having by his happy accession extinguished so many firebrands sheathed so many swords and put an end to the evils of a divided government after weighing with attention every word of the passage i am of opinion that it suits better with the elevation of gordian than with any other period of the roman history in that case it may serve to decide the age of quintus curtius those who place him under the first caesars argue from the purity of his style but are embarrassed by the silence of quintilian in his accurate list of roman historians   as the third gordian was only nineteen years innocence and virtues of gordian of age at the time of his death the history of his life were it known to us with greater accuracy than it really is would contain little more than the account of his education and the conduct of the ministers who by turns abused or guided the simplicity of his unexperienced youth immediately after his accession he fell into the hands of his mothers eunuchs that pernicious vermin of the east who since the days of elagabalus had infested the roman palace by the artful conspiracy of these wretches an impenetrable veil was drawn between an innocent prince and his oppressed subjects the virtuous disposition of gordian was deceived and the honors of the empire sold without his knowledge though in a very public manner to the most worthless of mankind we are ignorant by what fortunate accident the emperor escaped from this ignominious slavery and devolved his confidence on a minister whose wise counsels had no object except the glory of his sovereign and the happiness of the people it should seem that love and learning a d   0 administration of misitheus introduced misitheus to the favor of gordian the young prince married the daughter of his master of rhetoric and promoted his fatherinlaw to the first offices of the empire two admirable letters that passed between them are still extant the minister with the conscious dignity of virtue congratulates gordian that he is delivered from the tyranny of the eunuchs hist august p     from some hints in the two letters i should expect that the eunuchs were not expelled the palace without some degree of gentle violence and that young gordian rather approved of than consented to their disgrace  and still more that he is sensible of his deliverance the emperor acknowledges with an amiable confusion the errors of his past conduct and laments with singular propriety the misfortune of a monarch from whom a venal tribe of courtiers perpetually labor to conceal the truth duxit

duties of his place with vigor and ability the persians had invaded mesopotamia and threatened antioch by the persuasion of his fatherinlaw the young emperor quitted the luxury of rome opened for the last time recorded in history the temple of janus and marched in person into the east on his approach with a great army the persians withdrew their garrisons from the cities which they had already taken and retired from the euphrates to the tigris gordian enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the senate the first success of his arms which he ascribed with a becoming modesty and gratitude to the wisdom of his father and prefect during the whole expedition misitheus watched over the safety and discipline of the army whilst he prevented their dangerous murmurs by maintaining a regular plenty in

the army was attributed to the youth and incapacity of the prince it is not in our power to trace the successive steps of the secret conspiracy and open sedition which were at length fatal to gordian a sepulchral monument was erected to his memory murder of gordian a d     march on the spot about twenty miles from the little town of circesium on the frontier of the two empires where he was killed

traced of the military government of the roman empire what in that age was called the roman empire was only an irregular republic not unlike the aristocracy can the epithet of aristocracy be applied with any propriety to the government of algiers every military government floats between the extremes of absolute monarchy and wild democracy of algiers the military republic of the mamalukes in egypt would have afforded m de montesquieu see considerations sur la grandeur et la decadence des romans c    a juster and more noble parallel  where the militia possessed of the sovereignty creates and deposes a magistrate who is styled a dey perhaps indeed it may be laid down as a general rule that a military government is in some respects more republican than monarchical nor can it be said that the soldiers only partook of the government by their disobedience and rebellions the speeches made to them by the emperors were they not at length of the same nature as those formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the tribunes and although the armies had no regular place or forms of assembly though their debates were short their action sudden and their resolves seldom the result of cool reflection did they not dispose with absolute sway of the public fortune what was the emperor except the minister of a violent government elected for the private benefit of the soldiers  when the army had elected philip who was praetorian prefect to the third gordian the latter demanded that he might remain sole emperor he was unable to obtain it he requested that the power might be equally divided between them the army would not listen to his speech he consented to be degraded to the rank of caesar the favor was refused him he desired at least he might be appointed praetorian prefect his prayer was rejected finally he pleaded for his life the army in these several judgments exercised the supreme magistracy according to the historian whose doubtful narrative the president de

excite a dangerous compassion in the roman world he commanded without regard to his suppliant cries that he should be seized stripped and led away to instant death after a moments pause the inhuman sentence was executed the augustan history p         cannot in this instance be reconciled with itself or with probability how could philip condemn his predecessor and yet consecrate his memory how

assumed the double diadem and the title of king of kings which had been enjoyed by his predecessor but these pompous titles instead of gratifying the vanity of the persian served only to admonish him

the macedonian and the parthian yoke the nations of europe and asia had mutually adopted and corrupted each others superstitions the arsacides indeed practiced the worship of the magi but they disgraced and polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry the memory of zoroaster the ancient prophet and philosopher of the persians hyde and prideaux working up the persian legends and their own conjectures into a very agreeable story represent zoroaster as a contemporary of darius hystaspes but it is sufficient to observe that the greek writers who lived almost in the age of darius agree in placing the era of zoroaster many hundred or even thousand years before their own time the judicious criticism of mr moyle perceived and maintained against his uncle dr prideaux the antiquity of the persian prophet see his work vol ii  was still revered in the east but the obsolete and mysterious language in which the zendavesta was composed that ancient idiom was called the zend the language of the commentary the pehlvi though much more modern has ceased many ages ago to be a living tongue this fact alone if it is allowed as authentic sufficiently warrants the antiquity of those writings which m danquetil has brought into europe and translated into french  opened a field of dispute to seventy sects who variously explained the fundamental doctrines of their religion and were all indifferently derided by a crowd of infidels who rejected the divine mission and miracles of the prophet to suppress the idolaters reunite the schismatics and confute the unbelievers by the infallible decision of a general council the pious artaxerxes summoned the magi from all parts of his dominions these priests who had so long sighed in contempt and obscurity obeyed the welcome summons and on the appointed day appeared to the number of about eighty thousand but as the debates of so tumultuous an assembly could not have been directed by the authority of reason or influenced by the art of policy the persian synod was reduced by successive operations to forty thousand to four thousand to four hundred to forty and at last to seven magi the most respected for their learning and piety one of these erdaviraph a young but holy prelate received from the hands of his brethren three cups of soporiferous wine he drank them off and instantly fell into a long and profound sleep as soon as he waked he related to the king and to the believing multitude his journey to heaven and his intimate conferences with the deity every doubt was silenced by this supernatural evidence and the articles of the faith of zoroaster were fixed with equal authority and precision hyde de religione veterum pers c     a short delineation of that celebrated system will be found useful not only to display the character of the persian nation but to illustrate many of their most important transactions both in peace and war with the roman empire i have principally drawn this account from the zendavesta of m danquetil and the sadder subjoined to dr hydes treatise it must however be confessed that the studied obscurity of a prophet the figurative style of the east and the deceitful medium of a french or latin version may have betrayed us into error and heresy in this abridgement of persian theology   the great and fundamental article of the system persian theology two principles was the celebrated doctrine of the two principles a bold and injudicious attempt of eastern philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral and physical evil with the attributes of a beneficent creator and governor of the world the first and original being in whom or by whom the universe exists is denominated in the writings of zoroaster time without bounds but it must be confessed that this infinite substance seems rather a metaphysical abstraction of the mind than a real object endowed with selfconsciousness or possessed of moral perfections from either the blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite time which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the greeks the two secondary but active principles of the universe were from all eternity produced ormusd and ahriman each of them possessed of the powers of creation but each disposed by his invariable nature to exercise them with different designs the principle of good is eternally absorbed in light the principle of evil eternally buried in darkness the wise benevolence of ormusd formed man capable of virtue and abundantly provided his fair habitation with the materials of happiness by his vigilant providence the motion of the planets the order of the seasons and the temperate mixture of the elements are preserved but the malice of ahriman has long since pierced ormusds egg or in other words has violated the harmony of his works since that fatal irruption the most minute articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated together the rankest poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants deluges earthquakes and conflagrations attest the conflict of nature and the little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chains of their infernal enemy the faithful persian alone reserves his religious adoration for his friend and protector ormusd and fights under his banner of light in the full confidence that he shall in the last day share the glory of his triumph at that decisive period the enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power of ormusd superior to the furious malice of his rival ahriman and his followers disarmed and subdued will sink into their native darkness and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the universe the modern persees and in some degree the sadder exalt ormusd into the first and omnipotent cause whilst they degrade ahriman into an inferior but rebellious spirit their desire of pleasing the mahometans may have contributed to refine their theological system   the theology of zoroaster was darkly comprehended religious worship by foreigners and even by the far greater number of his disciples but the most careless observers were struck with the philosophic simplicity of the persian worship that people says herodotus herodotus l i c     but dr prideaux thinks with reason that the use of temples was afterward permitted in the magian religion  rejects the use of temples of altars and of statues and smiles at the folly of those nations who imagine that the gods are sprung from or bear any affinity with the human nature the tops of the highest mountains are the places chosen for sacrifices hymns and prayers are the principal worship the supreme god who fills the wide circle of heaven is the object to whom they are addressed yet at the same time in the true spirit of a polytheist he accuses them of adoring earth water fire the winds and the sun and moon but the persians of every age have denied the charge and explained the equivocal conduct which might appear to give a color to it the elements and more particularly fire light and the sun whom they called mithra were the objects of their religious reverence because they considered them as the purest symbols the noblest productions and the most powerful agents of the divine power and nature hyde de relig pers c   notwithstanding all their distinctions and protestations which seem sincere enough their tyrants the mahometans have constantly stigmatized them as idolatrous worshippers of the fire   every mode of religion to make a deep and lasting impression on the human mind must exercise ceremonies and moral precepts our obedience by enjoining practices of devotion for which we can assign no reason and must acquire our esteem by inculcating moral duties analogous to the dictates of our own hearts the religion of zoroaster was abundantly provided with the former and possessed a sufficient portion of the latter at the age of puberty the faithful persian was invested with a mysterious girdle the badge of the divine protection and from that moment all the actions of his life even the most indifferent or the most necessary were sanctified by their peculiar prayers ejaculations or genuflexions the omission of which under any circumstances was a grievous sin not inferior in guilt to the violation of the moral duties the moral duties however of justice mercy liberality etc were in their turn required of the disciple of zoroaster who wished to escape the persecution of ahriman and to live with ormusd in a blissful eternity where the degree of felicity will be exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety see the sadder the smallest part of which consists of moral precepts the ceremonies enjoined are infinite and trifling fifteen genuflexions prayers etc were required whenever the devout persian cut his nails or made water or as often as he put on the sacred girdle sadder art     0  0   but there are some remarkable instances in encouragement of agriculture which zoroaster lays aside the prophet assumes the legislator and discovers a liberal concern for private and public happiness seldom to be found among the grovelling or visionary schemes of superstition fasting and celibacy the common means of purchasing the divine favor he condemns with abhorrence as a criminal rejection of the best gifts of providence the saint in the magian religion is obliged to beget children to plant useful trees to destroy noxious animals to convey water to the dry lands of persia and to work out his salvation by pursuing all the labors of agriculture we may quote from the zendavesta a wise and benevolent maxim which compensates for many an absurdity he who sows the ground with care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers zendavesta tom i p     and precis du systeme de zoroastre tom iii  in the spring of every year a festival

must indeed have degenerated in a wealthy and despotic empire into a theatrical representation but it was at least a comedy well worthy of a royal audience and which might sometimes imprint a salutary lesson on the mind of a young prince  had zoroaster in all his institutions invariably power of the magi supported this exalted character his name would deserve a place with those of numa and confucius and his system would be justly entitled to all the applause which it has pleased some of our divines and even some of our philosophers to bestow on it but in that motley composition dictated by reason and passion by enthusiasm and by selfish motives some useful and sublime truths were disgraced by a mixture of the most abject and dangerous superstition the magi or sacerdotal order were extremely numerous since as we have already seen fourscore thousand of them were convened in a general council their forces were multiplied by discipline a regular hierarchy was diffused through all the provinces of persia and the archimagus who resided at balch was respected as the visible head of the church and the lawful successor of zoroaster hyde de religione persarum c    both hyde and

most fertile lands of media ammian marcellin xxiii   he informs us as far as we may credit him of two curious particulars   that the magi derived some of their most secret doctrines from the indian brachmans and   that they were a tribe or family as well as order  they levied a general tax on the fortunes and the industry of the persians the divine institution of tithes exhibits a singular instance of conformity between the law of zoroaster and that of moses those who cannot otherwise account for it may suppose if they please that the magi of the latter times inserted so useful an interpolation into the writings of their prophet  though your good works says the interested prophet exceed in number the leaves of the trees the drops of rain the stars in the heaven or the sands on the seashore they will all be unprofitable to you unless they are accepted by the destour or priest to obtain the acceptance of this guide to salvation you must faithfully pay him tithes of all you

the seacoast and the scarcity of fresh water in the inland provinces have been very unfavourable to the commerce and agriculture of the persians who in the calculation of their numbers seem to have indulged one of the meanest though most common articles of national vanity  as soon as the ambitious mind of artaxerxes recapitulation of the war between the parthian and roman empire had triumphed over the resistance of his vassals he began to threaten the neighboring states who during the long slumber of his predecessors had insulted persia with impunity he obtained some easy victories over the wild scythians and the effeminate indians but the romans were an enemy who by their past injuries and present power deserved the utmost efforts of his arms a forty years tranquillity the fruit of valor and moderation had succeeded the victories of trajan during the period that elapsed from the accession of marcus to the reign of alexander the roman and the parthian empires were twice engaged

trophies in armenia mesopotamia and assyria among their exploits the imperfect relation of which would have unseasonably interrupted the more important series of domestic revolutions we shall only mention the repeated calamities of the two great cities of seleucia and ctesiphon  seleucia on the western bank of the tigris cities of seleucia and ctesiphon about fortyfive miles to the north of ancient babylon was the capital of the macedonian conquests in upper asia for the precise situation of babylon seleucia ctesiphon modain and bagdad cities often confounded with each other see an excellent geographical tract of m danville in mem de lacademie tom xxx  many ages after the fall of their empire seleucia retained the genuine characters of a grecian colony arts military virtue and the love of freedom the independent republic was governed by a senate of three hundred nobles the people consisted of six hundred thousand citizens the walls were strong and as long as concord prevailed among the several orders of the state they viewed with contempt the power of the parthian but the madness of faction was sometimes provoked to implore the dangerous aid of the common enemy who was posted almost at the gates of the colony tacit annal xi    plin hist not vi     the parthian monarchs like the mogul sovereigns of hindostan delighted in the pastoral life of their scythian

maintain an obstinate siege against the emperor severus the city was however taken by assault the king who defended it in person escaped with precipitation an hundred thousand captives and a rich

the great capitals of the east in summer the monarch of persia enjoyed at ecbatana the cool breezes of the mountains of media but the mildness of the climate engaged him to prefer ctesiphon for his winterresidence  from these successful inroads the romans derived conquest of osrhoene by the romans no real or lasting benefit nor did they attempt to preserve such distant conquests separated from the provinces of the empire by a large tract of intermediate desert the reduction of the kingdom of osrhoene was an acquisition of less splendor indeed but of a far more solid advantage that little

0 a war on the side of artaxerxes had his views been confined to the defense or the acquisition of a useful frontier but the ambitious persian openly avowed a far more extensive design of conquest and he thought himself able to support his lofty pretensions by the arms of reason as well as by those of power cyrus he alleged had first subdued and his successors had for a long time possessed the whole extent of asia as far as the propontis and the aegaean sea the provinces of caria and ionia under their empire had been governed by persian satraps and all egypt to the confines of aethiopia had acknowledged their sovereignty xenophon in the preface to the cyropaedia gives a clear and magnificent idea of the extent of the empire of cyrus herodotus l iii c    etc enters into a curious and particular description of the twenty great satrapies into which the persian empire was divided by darius hystaspes  their rights had been suspended but not destroyed by a long usurpation and as soon as he received the persian diadem which birth and successful valor had placed upon his head the first great duty of his station called upon him to restore the ancient limits and splendor of the monarchy the great king therefore such was the haughty style of his embassies to the emperor alexander commanded the romans instantly to depart from all the provinces of his ancestors and yielding to the persians the empire of asia to content themselves with the undisturbed possession of europe this haughty mandate was delivered by four hundred of the tallest and most beautiful of the persians who by their fine horses splendid arms and rich apparel displayed the pride and greatness of their master herodian vi  0       such an embassy was much less an offer of negotiation than a declaration of war both alexander severus and artaxerxes collecting the military force of the roman and persian monarchies resolved in this important contest to lead their armies in person  if we credit what should seem the most authentic pretended victory of alexander severus a d     of all records an oration still extant and delivered by the emperor himself to the senate we must allow that the victory of alexander severus was not inferior to any of those formerly obtained over the persians by the son of philip the army of the great king consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse clothed in complete armor of steel of seven hundred elephants with towers filled with archers on their backs and of eighteen hundred chariots armed with scythes this formidable host the like of which is not to be found in eastern history and has scarcely been imagined in eastern romance there were two hundred scythed chariots at the battle of arbela in the host of darius in the vast army of tigranes which was vanquished by lucullus seventeen thousand horse only were completely armed antiochus brought fiftyfour elephants into the field against the romans by his frequent wars and negociations with the princes of india he had once collected an hundred and fifty of those great animals but it may be questioned whether the most powerful monarch of hindostan ever formed a line of battle of seven hundred

vanity of the monarch adorned by the unblushing servility of his flatterers and received without contradiction by a distant and obsequious senate hist august p      far from being inclined to believe that the arms of alexander obtained any memorable advantage over the persians we are induced to suspect that all this blaze of imaginary glory was designed to conceal some real disgrace  our suspicions are confirmed by the authority of a contemporary historian who mentions the virtues of alexander with respect and his faults more probable account of the war with candor he describes the judicious plan which had been formed for the conduct of the war three roman armies were destined to invade persia at the same time and by different roads but the operations of the campaign though wisely concerted were not executed either with ability or success the first of these armies as soon as it had entered the marshy plains of babylon toward the artificial conflux of the euphrates and

exploits of chosroes have been magnified and he acted as a dependent ally to the romans  and the long tract of mountainous country in which the persian cavalry was of little service opened a secure entrance into the heart of media to the second of the roman armies these brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces and by several successful actions against artaxerxes gave a faint color to the emperors vanity but the retreat of this victorious army was imprudent or at least unfortunate in repassing the mountains great numbers of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads and the severity of the winter season it had been resolved that whilst these two great detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the persian dominions the main body under the command of alexander himself should support their attack by invading the center of the kingdom but the unexperienced youth influenced by his mothers counsels and perhaps by his own fears deserted the bravest troops and the fairest prospect of victory and after consuming in mesopotamia an inactive and inglorious summer he led back to antioch an army diminished by sickness and provoked by disappointment the behavior of artaxerxes had been very different flying with rapidity from the hills of media to the marshes of the euphrates he had every where opposed the invaders in person and in either fortune had united with the ablest conduct the most undaunted resolution but in several obstinate engagements against the veteran legions of rome the persian monarch had lost the flower of his troops even his victories had weakened his power the favorable opportunities of the absence of alexander and of the confusions that followed that emperors death presented themselves in vain to his ambition instead of expelling the

ancient period of fables and a long interval of darkness the modern histories of persia begin to assume an air of truth with the dynasty of the sassanides  artaxerxes bequeathed his new empire and his ambitious designs against the romans to sapor a son not unworthy of his great father but those designs were too extensive for the power of persia and served only to involve both nations in a long series of destructive wars and reciprocal calamities  the persians long since civilized and corrupted were very far from possessing the martial independence and the intrepid hardiness both of military power of the persians mind and body which have rendered the northern barbarians masters of the world the science of war that constituted the more rational force of greece and rome as it now does of europe never made any considerable progress in the east those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and animate a confused multitude were unknown to the persians they were equally unskilled in the arts of constructing besieging or defending regular fortifications they trusted more to their numbers than to their courage more to their courage than to their discipline the infantry was a halfarmed spiritless crowd of peasants levied in haste by the their infantry contemptible allurements of plunder and as easily dispersed by a victory as by a defeat the monarch and his nobles transported into

changes produced by a century and a half   but the nobles of persia in the bosom of luxury their cavalry excellent and despotism preserved a strong sense of personal gallantry and national honor from the age of seven years they were taught to speak truth to shoot with the bow and to ride and it was universally confessed that in the two last of these arts they had made a more than common proficiency the persians are still the most skilful horsemen and their horses the finest in the east  the most distinguished youth were educated under the monarchs eye practiced their exercises in the gate of his palace and were severely trained up to the habits of temperance and obedience in their long and laborious parties of hunting in every province the satrap maintained a like school of military virtue the persian nobles so natural is the idea of feudal tenures received from the kings bounty lands and houses on the condition of their service in war they were ready on the first summons to mount on horseback with a martial and splendid train of followers and to join the numerous bodies of guards who were carefully selected from amongst the most robust slaves and the bravest

notice from their connection with the decline and fall of the roman empire we shall occasionally mention the scythian or sarmatian tribes which with their arms and horses their flocks and herds their wives and families wandered over the immense plains which spread themselves from the caspian sea to the vistula from the confines of persia to those of germany but the warlike germans who first resisted then invaded and at length overturned the western monarchy of rome will occupy a much more important place in this history and possess a stronger and if we may use the expression a more domestic claim to our attention and regard the most civilized nations of modern europe issued from the woods of germany and in the rude institutions of those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles of our present laws and manners in their primitive state of simplicity and independence the germans were surveyed by the discerning eye and delineated by the masterly pencil of tacitus the first of historians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts the expressive conciseness of his descriptions has deserved to exercise the diligence of innumerable antiquarians and to excite the genius and penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times the subject however various and important has already been so frequently so ably and so successfully discussed that it is now grown familiar to the reader and difficult to the writer we shall therefore content ourselves with observing and indeed with repeating some of the most important circumstances of climate of manners and of institutions which rendered the wild barbarians of germany such formidable enemies to the roman power  ancient germany excluding from its independent extent of germany limits the province westward of the rhine which had submitted to the roman yoke extended itself over a third part of europe almost the whole of modern germany denmark norway sweden finland livonia prussia and the greater part of poland were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation whose complexion manners and language denoted a common origin and preserved a striking resemblance on the west ancient germany was divided by the rhine from the gallic and on the south by the danube from the illyrian provinces of the empire a ridge of hills rising from the danube and called the carpathian mountains covered germany on the side of dacia or hungary the eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of the germans and the sarmatians and was often confounded by the mixture of warring and confederating tribes of the two nations in the remote darkness of the north the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen ocean that lay beyond the baltic sea and beyond the peninsula or islands the modern philosophers of sweden seem agreed that the waters of the baltic gradually sink in a regular proportion which they have ventured to estimate at half an inch every year twenty centuries ago the flat country of scandinavia must have been covered by the sea while the high lands rose above the waters as so many islands of various forms and dimensions such indeed is the notion given us by mela pliny and tacitus of the vast countries round the baltic see in the bibliotheque raisonnec tom xl and xlv a large abstract of dalins history of sweden composed in the swedish language of scandinavia  some ingenious writers in particular mr hume the abbe du bos and m pelloutier hist des celtes tom i have suspected that europe was much colder formerly than it is at climate present and the most ancient descriptions of the climate of germany tend exceedingly to confirm their theory the general complaints of intense frost and eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded since we have no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the thermometer the feelings or the expressions of an orator born in the happier regions of greece or asia but i shall select two remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature   the great rivers which covered the roman provinces the rhine and the danube were frequently frozen over and capable of supporting the most enormous weights the barbarians who often chose that severe season for their inroads transported without apprehension or danger their numerous armies their cavalry and their heavy wagons over a vast and solid bridge of ice diodorus siculus l v p   0 edit wessel herodian l vi p     jornandes c    on the banks of the danube the wine when brought to table was frequently frozen into great lumps

0 edit hutchinson  modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon   the rein deer that useful animal from whom the savage of the north derives the best comforts of his dreary life is

at present he cannot subsist much less multiply in any country to the south of the baltic buffon histoire naturelle tom xii p         in the time of caesar the rein deer as well as the elk and the wild bull was a native of the hercynian forest which then overshadowed a great part of germany and poland caesar de bell gallic vi    etc the most inquisitive of the germans were ignorant of its utmost limits although some of them had traveled in it more than sixty days journey  the modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes of the diminution of the cold these immense woods have been

finest provinces of france and england that country experiences the most rigorous cold the rein deer are very numerous the ground is covered with deep and lasting snow and the great river of st lawrence is regularly frozen in a season when the waters of the seine and the thames are usually free from ice charlevoix histoire du canada   it is difficult to ascertain and easy to exaggerate the influence of the climate of ancient germany its effects on the natives over the minds and bodies of the natives many writers have supposed and most have allowed though as it should seem without any adequate proof that the rigorous cold of the north was favorable to long life and generative vigor that the women were more fruitful and the human species more prolific than in warmer or more temperate climates olaus rudbeck asserts that the swedish women often bear ten or twelve children and not uncommonly twenty or thirty but the authority of rudbeck is much to be suspected  we may assert with greater confidence that the keen air of germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives who were in general of a more lofty stature than the people of the south in hos artus in

which can live and multiply in every country from the equator to the poles the hog seems to approach the nearest to our species in that privilege   there is not any where upon the globe a large origin of the germans tract of country which we have discovered destitute of inhabitants or whose first population can be fixed with any degree of historical certainty and yet as the most philosophic minds can seldom refrain from investigating the infancy of great nations our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed efforts when tacitus considered the purity of the german blood and the forbidding aspect of the country he was disposed to pronounce those barbarians indigenae or natives of the soil we may allow with safety and perhaps with truth that ancient germany was not originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a political society tacit german c   the emigration of the gauls followed the course of the danube and discharged itself on greece and asia tacitus could discover only one inconsiderable tribe that retained any traces of a gallic origin  but that the name and nation received their existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages of the hercynian woods to assert those savages to have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be a rash inference condemned by religion and unwarranted by reason  such rational doubt is but illsuited with the fables and conjectures genius of popular vanity among the nations who have adopted the mosaic history of the world the ark of noah has been of the same use as was formerly to the greeks and romans the siege of troy on a narrow basis of acknowledged truth an immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected and the wild irishman according to dr

falsehood and infidelity ever known in ireland  as well as the wild tartar genealogical history of the tartars by abulghazi bahadur khan  could point out the individual son of japhet from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended the last century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy faith who by the dim light of legends and traditions of conjectures and etymologies conducted the great grandchildren of noah from the tower of babel to the extremities of the globe of these judicious critics one of the most entertaining was olaus rudbeck professor in the university of upsal his work entitled atlantica is uncommonly scarce bail has given two most curious extracts from it republique des lettres janvier et fevrier       whatever is celebrated either in history or

the elysian fields were all but faint and imperfect transcripts a clime so profusely favored by nature could not long remain desert after the flood the learned rudbeck allows the family of noah a few

northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of europe africa and asia and to use the authors metaphor the blood circulated from the extremities to the heart  but all this welllaboured system of german antiquities is annihilated by a single fact too well the germans ignorant of letters attested to admit of any doubt and of too decisive a nature to leave room for any reply the germans in the age of tacitus were unacquainted with the use of letters tacit germ ii    literarum secreta viri pariter ac foeminae ignorant we may rest contented with this decisive authority without entering into the obscure disputes concerning the antiquity of the runic characters the learned celsius a swede a scholar and a philosopher was of opinion that they were nothing more than the roman letters with the curves changed into straight lines for the ease of engraving see pelloutier histoire des celtes l ii c    dictionnaire diplomatique tom i p     we may add that the oldest runic inscriptions are supposed to be of the third century and the most ancient writer who mentions the runic characters is venantius fortunatus carm vii    who lived toward the end of the sixth century barbara fraxineis pingatur runa tabellis  and the use of letters is the principal circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd of savages incapable of knowledge or reflection without that artificial help the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the ideas entrusted to her charge and the nobler faculties of the mind no longer supplied with models or with materials gradually forget their powers the judgment becomes feeble and lethargic the imagination languid or irregular fully to apprehend this important truth let us attempt in an improved society to calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and the illiterate peasant the former by reading and reflection multiplies his own experience and lives in distant ages and remote countries whilst the latter rooted to a single spot and confined to a few years of existence surpasses but very little his fellow laborer the ox in the exercise of his mental faculties the same and even a greater difference will be found between nations than between individuals and we may safely pronounce that without some species of writing no people has ever preserved the faithful annals of their history ever made any considerable progress in the abstract sciences or ever possessed in any tolerable degree of perfection the useful and agreeable arts of life  of these arts the ancient germans were wretchedly of arts and agriculture destitute they passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty which it has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of virtuous simplicity modern germany is said to contain about two thousand three hundred walled towns recherches philosophiques sur les americains tom iii p     the author of that very curious work is if i am not misinformed a german by birth  in a much wider extent of country the geographer ptolemy could discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the name of cities the alexandrian geographer is often criticized by the accurate cluverius  though according to our ideas they would but ill deserve that splendid title we can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications constructed in the center of the woods and designed to secure the women children and cattle whilst the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion see caesar and the learned mr whitaker in his history of manchester vol i  but tacitus asserts as a wellknown fact that the germans in his time had no cities tacit germ     and that they affected to despise the works of roman industry as places of confinement rather than of security when the germans commanded the ubii of cologne to cast off the roman yoke and with their new freedom to resume their ancient manners they insisted on the immediate demolition of the walls of

formed into regular villas the straggling villages of silesia are several miles in length see cluver l i c     each barbarian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain a wood or a stream of fresh water had induced him to give the preference neither stone nor brick nor tiles were employed in these slight habitations one hundred and forty years after tacitus a few more regular structures were erected near the rhine and danube herodian l vii p      they were indeed no more than low huts of a circular figure built of rough timber thatched with straw and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke in the most inclement winter the hardy german was satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal the nations who dwelt toward the north clothed themselves in furs and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse kind of linen tacit germ     the game of various sorts with which the forests of germany were plentifully stocked supplied its

of their wealth a small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the earth the use of orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the germans nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people whose property every year experienced a general change by a new division of the arable lands and who in that strange operation avoided disputes by suffering a great part of their territory to lie waste and without tillage tacit germ    caesar vi      gold silver and iron were extremely scarce in germany its barbarous inhabitants wanted and of the use of metals both skill and patience to investigate those rich veins of silver which have so liberally rewarded the attention of the princes of brunswick and saxony sweden which now supplies europe with iron was equally ignorant of its own riches and the appearance of the arms of the germans furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal the various transactions of peace and war had introduced some roman coins chiefly silver among the borderers of the rhine and danube but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the use of money carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities and prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases the presents of rome to their princes and ambassadors tacit germ    to a mind capable of reflection such leading facts convey more instruction than a tedious detail of subordinate circumstances the value of money has been settled by general consent to express our wants and our property as letters were invented to express our ideas and both these institutions by giving a more active energy to the powers and passions of human nature have contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to represent the use of gold and silver is in a great measure factitious but it would be impossible to enumerate the important and various services which agriculture and all the arts have received from iron when tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire and the dexterous hand of man money in a word is the most universal incitement iron the most powerful instrument of human industry and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people neither actuated by the one nor seconded by the other could emerge from the grossest barbarism it is said that the mexicans and peruvians without the use of either money or iron had made a very great progress in the arts those arts and the monuments they produced have been strangely magnified see recherches sur les americains tom ii p     etc   if we contemplate a savage nation in any part their indolence of the globe a supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to constitute their general character in a civilized state every faculty of man is expanded and exercised and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of society the most numerous portion of it is employed in constant and useful labor the select few placed by fortune above that necessity can however fill up their time by the pursuits of interest or glory by the improvement of their estate or of their understanding by the duties the pleasures and even the follies of social life the germans were not possessed of these varied resources the care of the house and family the management of the land and cattle were delegated to the old and the infirm to women and slaves the lazy warrior destitute of every art that might employ his leisure hours consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of sleep and food and yet by a wonderful diversity of nature according to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses the same barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless of mankind they delight in sloth they detest tranquillity tacit germ     the languid soul oppressed with its own weight anxiously required some new and powerful sensation and war and danger were the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper the sound that summoned the german to arms was grateful to his ear it roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy gave him an active pursuit and by strong exercise of the body and violent emotions of the mind restored him to a more lively sense of his existence in the dull intervals of peace these barbarians were immoderately addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking both of which by different means the one by inflaming their passions the other by extinguishing their reason alike relieved them from the pain of thinking they gloried in passing whole days and nights at table and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous and drunken assemblies tacit germ        their debts of honor for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play they discharged with the most romantic fidelity the desperate gamester who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice patiently submitted to the decision of fortune and suffered himself to be bound chastised and sold into remote slavery by his weaker but more lucky antagonist id    the germans might borrow the arts of play from the romans but the passion is wonderfully inherent in the human species   strong beer a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley and corrupted as it is their taste for strong liquors strongly expressed by tacitus into a certain semblance of wine was sufficient for the gross purposes of german debauchery but those who had tasted the rich wines of italy and afterward of gaul sighed for that more delicious species of intoxication they attempted not however as has since been executed with so much success to naturalize the vine on the banks of the rhine and danube nor did they endeavor to procure by industry the materials of an advantageous commerce to solicit by labor what might be ravished by arms was esteemed unworthy of the german spirit tacit germ     the intemperate thirst of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied

importance of the arts the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration of a third perhaps or a fourth part of their youth paul diaconus c       machiavel davila and the rest of pauls followers represent these emigrations too much as regular and concerted measures  the possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which bind a civilized people to an improved country but the germans who carried with them what they most valued their arms their cattle and their women cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest the innumerable swarms that issued or seemed to issue from the great storehouse of nations were multiplied by the fears of the vanquished and by the credulity of succeeding ages and from facts thus exaggerated an opinion was gradually established and has been supported by writers of distinguished reputation that in the age of caesar and tacitus the inhabitants of the north were far more numerous than they are in our days sir william temple and montesquieu have indulged on this subject the usual liveliness of their fancy  a more serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have

tacitus riches are held in honor they are therefore subject to an absolute monarch who instead of intrusting his people with the free use of arms as is practiced in the rest of germany commits them to

dedicated his supplement to livy to christina of sweden thinks proper to be very angry with the roman who expressed so very little reverence for northern queens  in the mention of these exceptions the great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of government we are only at a loss to conceive by what means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the north and extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the roman provinces or how the ancestors of those danes and norwegians so distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit could thus tamely resign the great character of german liberty may we not suspect that superstition was the parent of despotism the descendants of odin whose race was not extinct

germany the form of government was a democracy tempered indeed and controlled not so much by general and positive laws as by the occasional ascendant of birth or valor of eloquence or superstition id c          etc   civil governments in their first institutions are assemblies of the people voluntary associations for mutual defense to obtain the desired end it is absolutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself obliged to submit his private opinion and actions to the judgment of the greater number of his associates the german tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of political society as soon as a youth born of free parents had attained the age of manhood he was introduced into the general council of his countrymen solemnly invested with a shield and spear and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth the assembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at stated seasons or on sudden emergencies the trial of public offenses the election of magistrates and the great business of peace and war were determined by its independent voice sometimes indeed these important questions were previously considered and prepared in a more select council of the principal chieftains grotius changes an expression of tacitus pertractantur into praetractantur the correction is equally just and ingenious  the magistrates might deliberate and persuade the people only could resolve and execute and the resolutions of the germans were for the most part hasty and violent barbarians accustomed to place their freedom in gratifying the present passion and their courage in overlooking all future consequences turned away with indignant contempt from the remonstrances of justice and policy and it was the practice to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid counsels but whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury whenever he called upon his fellowcountrymen to assert the national honor or to pursue some enterprise full of danger and glory a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the eager applause of the assembly for the germans always met in arms and it was constantly to be dreaded lest an irregular multitude inflamed with faction and strong liquors should use those arms to enforce as well as to declare their furious resolves we may recollect how often the diets of poland have been polluted with blood and the more numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious even in our ancient parliament the barons often carried a question not so much by the number of votes as by that of their armed followers   a general of the tribe was elected on occasions authority of the princes and magistrates of danger and if the danger was pressing and extensive several tribes concurred in the choice of the same general the bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field by his example rather than by his commands but this power however limited was still invidious it expired with the war and in time of peace the german tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief caesar de bell

cluver germ ant l i c      the comparative view of the powers of the more absolute over the property than over the persons of the germans magistrates in two remarkable instances is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of german manners the disposal of the landed property within their district was absolutely vested in their hands and they distributed it every year according to a new division caesar vi    tacit germ     at the same time they were not authorized to punish with death to imprison or even to strike a private citizen tacit germ    a people thus jealous of their persons and careless of their possessions must have been totally destitute of industry and the arts but animated with a high sense of honor and independence  the germans respected only those duties which voluntary engagements they imposed on themselves the most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the magistrates the noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chief to whom they devoted their arms and service a noble emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief amongst the chiefs to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions to be ever surrounded by a band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs their ornament in peace their defense in war the glory of such distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe presents and embassies solicited their friendship and the fame of their arms often ensured victory to the party which they espoused in the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by his companions shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of their chief to survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy to protect his person and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits were the most sacred of their duties the chiefs combated for victory the companions for the chief the noblest warriors whenever their native country was sunk in the laziness of peace maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action to exercise their restless spirit and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers gifts worthy of soldiers the warlike steed the bloody and ever victorious lance were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief the rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that he could bestow or they would accept war rapine and the freewill offerings of his friends supplied the materials of this munificence tacit germ        this institution however it might accidentally weaken the several republics invigorated the general character of the germans and even ripened amongst them all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible the faith and valor the hospitality and the courtesy so conspicuous long afterward in the ages of chivalry the honorable gifts bestowed by the chief on his brave companions have been supposed by an ingenious writer to contain the first rudiments of the fiefs distributed after the conquest of the roman provinces by the barbarian lords among their vassals with a similar duty of homage and military service esprit des loix l xxx c   the brilliant imagination of montesquieu is corrected however by the dry cold reason of the abbe de mably observations sur lhistoire de france tom i p      these conditions are however very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient germans who delighted in mutual presents but without either imposing or accepting the weight of obligations gaudent muneribus sed nec data imputant nec acceptis obligantur tacit germ c      in the days of chivalry or more properly of german chastity romance all the men were brave and all the women were chaste and notwithstanding the latter of these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the former it is ascribed almost without exception to the wives of the ancient germans polygamy was not in use except among the princes and among them only for the sake of multiplying their alliances divorces were prohibited by manners rather than by laws adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable crimes nor was seduction justified by example and fashion the adulteress was whipped through the village neither wealth nor beauty could inspire compassion or procure her a second husband        we may easily discover that tacitus indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the roman ladies yet there are some striking circumstances that give an air of truth or at least of probability to the conjugal faith and chastity of the germans  although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly its probable causes contributed to assuage the fiercer passions of human nature it seems to have been less favorable to the virtue of chastity whose most dangerous enemy is the softness of the mind the refinements of life corrupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes the gross appetite of love becomes most dangerous when it is elevated or rather indeed disguised by sentimental passion the elegance of dress of motion and of manners gives a luster to beauty and inflames the senses through the imagination luxurious entertainments midnight dances and licentious spectacles present at once temptation and opportunity to female frailty ovid employs two hundred lines in the research of places the most favorable to love above all he considers the theater as the best adapted to collect the beauties of rome and to melt them into tenderness and sensuality  from such dangers the unpolished wives of the barbarians were secured by poverty solitude and the painful cares of a domestic life the german huts open on every side to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy were a better safeguard of conjugal fidelity than the walls the bolts and the eunuchs of a persian haram to this reason another may be added of a more honorable nature the germans treated their women with esteem and confidence consulted them on every occasion of importance and fondly believed that in their breasts resided a sanctity and wisdom more than human some of these interpreters of fate such as velleda in the batavian war governed in the name of the deity the fiercest nations of germany tacit hist iv        the rest of the sex

they had offered to surrender on condition that they should be received as the slaves of the vestal virgins  heroines of such a cast may claim our admiration but they were most assuredly neither lovely nor very susceptible of love whilst they affected to emulate the stern virtues of man they must have resigned that attractive softness in which principally consist the charm and weakness of woman conscious pride taught the german females to suppress every tender emotion that stood in competition with honor and the first honor of the sex has ever been that of chastity the sentiments and conduct of these highspirited matrons may at once be considered as a cause as an effect and as a proof of the general character of the nation female courage however it may be raised by fanaticism or confirmed by habit can be only a faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valor that distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found  the religious system of the germans if the religion wild opinions of savages can deserve that name was dictated by their wants their fears and their ignorance tacitus has employed a few lines and cluverius one hundred and twentyfour pages on this obscure subject the former discovers in germany the gods of greece and rome the latter is positive that under the emblems of the sun the moon and the fire his pious ancestors worshipped the trinity in unity  they adored the great visible objects and agents of nature the sun and the moon the fire and the earth together with those imaginary deities who were supposed to preside over the most important occupations of human life they were persuaded that by some ridiculous arts of divination they could discover the will of the superior beings and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering to their altars some applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion entertained by that people of the deity whom they neither confined within the walls of a temple nor represented by any human figure but when we recollect that the germans were unskilled in architecture and totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture we shall readily assign the true reason of a scruple which arose not so much from a superiority of reason as from a want of ingenuity the only temples in germany were dark and ancient groves consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations their secret gloom the imagined residence of an invisible power by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror the sacred wood described with such sublime horror by lucan was in the neighborhood of marseilles but there were many of the same kind in germany  and the priests rude and illiterate as they were had been taught by experience the use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest  the same ignorance which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving or embracing the useful restraints of laws exposes them naked and unarmed its effects in peace to the blind terrors of superstition the german priests improving this favorable temper of their countrymen had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns which the magistrate could not venture to exercise and the haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction when it was inflicted not by any human power but by the immediate order of the god of war tacit germania c    the defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority the latter was constantly exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular assemblies and was sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare a solemn procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries of mecklenburg and pomerania the unknown symbol of the earth covered with a thick veil was placed on a carriage drawn by cows and in this manner the goddess whose common residence was in the isle of rugen visited several adjacent tribes of her worshippers during her progress the sound of war was hushed quarrels were suspended arms laid aside and the restless germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and harmony tacit germania c  0  the truce of god so often and so ineffectually proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century was an obvious imitation of this ancient custom see dr robertsons history of charles v vol i note  0   but the influence of religion was far more in war powerful to inflame than to moderate the fierce passions of the germans interest and fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most daring and the most unjust enterprises by the approbation of heaven and full assurances of success the consecrated standards long revered in the groves of superstition were placed in the front of the battle tacit germ c   these standards were only the heads of wild beasts  and the hostile army was

curious version of that book published by m mallet in his introduction to the history of denmark  all agreed that a life spent in arms and a glorious death in battle were the best preparations for a happy futurity either in this or in another world  the immortality so vainly promised by the priests was in some degree conferred by the bards that singular order of men has most the bards deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to investigate the antiquities of the celts the scandinavians and the germans their genius and character as well as the reverence paid to that important office have been sufficiently illustrated but we cannot so easily express or even conceive the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breast of their audience among a polished people a taste for poetry is rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul and yet when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by homer or tasso we are insensibly seduced by the fiction and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour but how faint how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary study it was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but animated strains the view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song and the passions which it tended to excite the desire of fame and the contempt of death were the habitual sentiments of a german mind see tacit germ c   diodor sicul l v strabo l iv p     the classical reader may remember the rank of demodocus in the phaeacian court and the ardour infused by tyrtaeus into the fainting spartans yet there is little probability that the greeks and the germans were the same people much learned trifling might be spared if our antiquarians would condescend to reflect that similar manners will naturally be produced by similar situations   such was the situation and such were the manners of the ancient germans their climate their want of learning of arts and of causes which checked the progress of the germans laws their notions of honor of gallantry and of religion their sense of freedom impatience of peace and thirst of enterprise all contributed to form a people of military heroes and yet we find that during more than two hundred and fifty years that elapsed from the defeat of varus to the reign of decius these formidable barbarians made few considerable attempts and not any material impression on the luxurious and enslaved provinces of the empire their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline and their fury was diverted by the intestine divisions of ancient germany  i it has been observed with ingenuity and want of arms not without truth that the command of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold but the rude tribes of germany alike destitute of both those valuable metals were reduced slowly to acquire by their unassisted strength the possession of the one as well as the other the face of a german army displayed their poverty of iron swords and the longer kind of lances they could seldom use their frameae as they called them in their own language were long spears headed with a sharp but narrow iron point and which as occasion required they either darted from a distance or pushed in close onset with this spear and with a shield their cavalry was contented a multitude of darts scattered missilia spargunt tacit germ c   either that historian used a vague expression or he meant that they were thrown at random with incredible force were an additional resource of the infantry their military dress when they wore any was nothing more than a loose mantle a variety of colors was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses scarce any by helmets though the horses of germany were neither beautiful swift nor practiced in the skilful evolutions of the roman manage several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry but in general the principal strength of the germans consisted in their infantry it was their principal distinction from the sarmatians who generally fought on horseback  which was drawn up in several deep columns according to the distinction of tribes and families impatient of fatigue or delay these and of discipline halfarmed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks and sometimes by the effort of native valor prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of the roman mercenaries but as the barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the first onset they knew not how to rally or to retire a repulse was a sure defeat and a defeat was most commonly total destruction when we recollect the complete armor of the roman soldiers their discipline exercises evolutions fortified camps and military engines it appears a just matter of surprise how the naked and unassisted valor of the barbarians could dare to encounter in the field the strength of the legions and the various troops of the auxiliaries which seconded their operations the contest was too unequal till the introduction of luxury had enervated the vigor and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the discipline of the roman armies the introduction of barbarian auxiliaries into those armies was a measure attended with very obvious dangers as it might gradually instruct the germans in the arts of war and of policy although they were admitted in small numbers and with the strictest precaution the example of civilis was proper to convince the romans that the danger was not imaginary and that their precautions were not always sufficient the relation of this enterprise occupies a great part of the fourth and fifth books of the history of tacitus and is more remarkable for its eloquence than perspicuity sir henry saville has observed several inaccuracies  during the civil wars that followed the death of nero that artful and intrepid batavian whom his enemies condescended to compare with hannibal and sertorius tacit hist

effects that might have been produced by its united effort the wide extent of country might very possibly contain a million of warriors as all who were of age to bear arms were of a temper to use them but this fierce multitude incapable of concerting or executing any plan of national greatness was agitated by various and often hostile intentions germany was divided into more than forty independent states and even in each state the union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious the barbarians were easily provoked they knew not how to forgive an injury much less an insult their resentments were bloody and implacable the casual disputes that so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking were sufficient to inflame the minds of whole nations the private feud of any considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and allies to chastise the insolent or to plunder the defenseless were alike causes of war the most formidable states

was a murderer from the beginning etc etc  these sentiments less worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of tacitus express the invariable maxims of the policy of his countrymen they deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to combat the barbarians from whose defeat they could derive neither honor nor advantage the money and negociations of rome insinuated themselves into the heart of germany and every art of seduction was used with dignity to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the rhine or danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most troublesome enemies chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most trifling presents which they received either as marks of distinction or as the instruments of luxury in civil dissentions the weaker faction endeavored to strengthen its interest by entering into secret connexions with the governors of the frontier provinces every quarrel among the germans was fomented by the intrigues of rome and every plan of union and public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy and interest many traces of this policy may be discovered in tacitus and dion and many more may be inferred

barbarians were neither allured by the indolence or provoked by the ambition of the roman monarch this dangerous invasion required all the firmness and vigilance of marcus he fixed generals of ability in the several stations of attack and assumed in person the conduct of the most important province on the upper danube after a long and doubtful conflict the spirit of the barbarians was subdued the

have confined ourselves to the general outlines of the manners of germany without attempting to describe or to distinguish the various tribes which filled that great country in the time of caesar of tacitus or of ptolemy as the ancient or as new tribes successively present themselves in the series of this history we shall concisely mention their origin their situation and their particular character modern nations are fixed and permanent societies connected among themselves by laws and government bound to their native soil by arts and agriculture the german tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers almost of savages the same territory often changed its inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration the same communities uniting in a plan of defense or

ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution the confusion of the times and the scarcity of authentic memorials oppose equal difficulties to the historian who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration surrounded with imperfect fragments always concise often obscure and sometimes contradictory he is reduced to collect to compare and to conjecture and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts yet the knowledge of human nature and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions might on some occasions supply the want of historical materials  there is not for instance any difficulty in conceiving that the successive murders of so the emperor philip many emperors had loosened all the ties of allegiance between the prince and people that all the generals of philip were disposed to imitate the example of their master and that the caprice of armies long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions might every day raise to the throne the most obscure of their fellow soldiers history can only add that the rebellion against the emperor philip broke out in the summer of the year two hundred and fortynine among the legions of maesia and that a subaltern officer the expression used by zosimus and zonaras may signify that marinus commanded a century a cohort or a legion  named

created him the speedy completion of the prophecy inspired philip with a just esteem for so able a counselor and decius appeared to him the only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately subside after the murder of marinus decius who long resisted his own nomination seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a leader of merit to

dwelt on the banks of the lake maeotis till the fall of mithridates and the arms of pompey menaced the north with servitude that odin yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the asiatic sarmatia into sweden with the great design of forming in that inaccessible retreat of freedom a religion and a people which in some remote age might be subservient to his immortal revenge when his invincible goths armed with martial fanaticism should issue in numerous swarms from the neighborhood of the polar circle to chastise the oppressors of mankind this wonderful expedition of odin which by deducing the enmity of the goths and romans from so memorable a cause might supply the noble groundwork of an epic poem cannot safely

sapor over the sapor overruns syria cilicia and cappadocia euphrates and by the way of chalcis to the metropolis of the east so rapid were the motions of the persian cavalry that if we may credit a very judicious historian the sack of antioch anticipated by some historians is assigned by the decisive testimony of ammianus marcellinus to the reign of gallienus xxiii    the city of antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amusements of the theater the splendid buildings of antioch private as well as public were either pillaged or destroyed and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword or led away into captivity zosimus l i p     the tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of emesa arrayed in his sacerdotal robes he appeared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants armed only with slings and defended his god and his property from the sacrilegious hands of the followers of zoroaster john malala tom i p     he corrupts this probable event by some fabulous circumstances  but the ruin of tarsus and of many other cities furnishes a melancholy proof that except in this singular instance the conquest of syria and cilicia scarcely interrupted the progress of the persian arms the advantages of the narrow passes of mount taurus were abandoned in which an invader whose principal force consisted in his cavalry would have been engaged in a very unequal combat and sapor was permitted to form the sie geof caesarea the capital of cappadocia a city though of the second rank which was supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants demosthenes commanded in the place not so much by the commission of the emperor as in the voluntary defense of his country for a long time he deferred its fate and when at last caesarea was betrayed by the perfidy of a physician he cut his way through the persians who had been ordered to exert their utmost diligence to take him alive this heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who might either have honored or punished his obstinate valor but many thousands of his fellowcitizens were involved in a general massacre and sapor is accused of treating his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cruelty zonaras l xii p   0 deep valleys were filled up with the slain crowds of prisoners were driven to water like beasts and many perished for want of food  much should undoubtedly be allowed for national animosity much for humbled pride and impotent revenge yet upon the whole it is certain that the same prince who in armenia had displayed the mild aspect of a legislator showed himself to the romans under the stern features of a conqueror he despaired of making any permanent establishment in the empire and sought only to leave behind him a wasted desert whilst he transported into persia the people and the treasures of the provinces zosimus l i p    asserts that sapor had he not preferred spoil to conquest might have remained master of asia   at the time when the east trembled at the name of sapor he received a present not unworthy of the greatest kings a long train of camels boldness and success of odenathus against sapor laden with the most rare and valuable merchandises the rich offering was accompanied with an epistle respectful but not servile from odenathus one of the noblest and most opulent senators of palmyra who is this

rome oppressed by a persian was protected by a syrian or arab of palmyra  the voice of history which is often little treatment of valerian more than the organ of hatred or flattery reproaches sapor with a proud abuse of the rights of conquest we are told that valerian in chains but invested with the imperial purple was exposed to the multitude a constant spectacle of fallen greatness and that whenever the persian monarch mounted on horseback he placed his foot on the neck of a roman emperor notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his allies who repeatedly advised him to remember the vicissitude of fortune to dread the returning power of rome and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of peace not the object of insult sapor still remained inflexible when valerian sunk under the weight of shame and grief his skin stuffed with straw and formed into the likeness of a human figure was preserved for ages in the most celebrated temple of persia a more real monument of triumph than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so often erected by roman vanity the pagan writers lament the christian insult the misfortunes of valerian their various testimonies are accurately collected by tillemont tom iii p     etc so little has been preserved of eastern history before mahomet that the modern persians are totally ignorant of the victory of sapor an event so glorious to their nation see bibliotheque orientale  the tale is moral and pathetic but the truth of it may very fairly be called in question the letters still extant from the princes of the east to sapor are manifest forgeries one of these epistles is from artavasdes king of armenia since armenia was then a province in persia the king the kingdom and the epistle must be fictitious  nor is it natural to suppose that a jealous monarch should even in the person of a rival thus publicly degrade the majesty of kings whatever treatment the unfortunate valerian might experience in persia it is at least certain that the only emperor of rome who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy languished away his life in hopeless captivity  the emperor gallienus who had long supported character and administration of gallienus with impatience the censorial severity of his father and colleague received the intelligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed indifference i knew that my father was a mortal said he and since he has acted as becomes a brave man i am satisfied whilst rome lamented the fate of her sovereign the savage coldness of his son was extolled by the servile courtiers as the perfect firmness of a hero and a stoic see his life in the augustan history  it is difficult to paint the light the various the inconstant character of gallienus which he displayed without constraint as soon as he became sole possessor of the empire in every art that he attempted his lively genius enabled him to succeed and as his genius was destitute of judgment he attempted every art except the important ones of war and government he was a master of several curious but useless sciences a ready orator and elegant poet there is still extant a very pretty epithalamium composed by gallienus for the nuptials of his nephews ite ait o juvenes pariter sudate medullis omnibus inter vos non murmura vestra columbae brachia non hederae non vincant oscula conchae   a skilful

emperor by delivering africa from the usurper celsus she deserved the title of augusta on a medal in the french kings collection we read a similar inscription of faustina augusta round the head of marcus aurelius with regard to the ubique pax it is easily explained by the vanity of gallienus who seized perhaps the occasion of some momentary calm see nouvelles de la republique des lettres janvier   00 p         the repeated intelligence of invasions defeats and rebellions he received with a careless smile and singling out with affected contempt some particular production of the lost province he carelessly asked whether rome must be ruined unless it was supplied with linen from egypt and arras cloth from gaul there were however a few short moments in the life of gallienus when exasperated by some recent injury he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant till satiated with blood or fatigued by resistance he insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his character this singular character has i believe been fairly transmitted to us the reign of his immediate successor was short and busy and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of gallienus   at a time when the reins of government were the thirty tyrants held with so loose a hand it is not surprising that a crowd of usurpers should start up in every province of the empire against the son of valerian it was probably some ingenious fancy of comparing the thirty tyrants of rome with the thirty tyrants of athens that induced the writers of the augustan history to select that celebrated number which has been gradually received into a popular appellation pollio expresses the most minute anxiety to complete the number  but in every light the parallel is idle and defective what resemblance can we discover between a council of thirty persons the united oppressors of a single city and an uncertain list of independent rivals who rose and fell in irregular succession through the extent of a vast empire nor can the number of thirty be completed unless we include in the account the women and children who were honored with the imperial title the reign of gallienus distracted as it was produced only nineteen pretenders to the throne cyriades their real number was no more than nineteen  macrianus balista odenathus and zenobia in the east in gaul and the western provinces posthumus lollianus victorinus and his mother victoria marius and tetricus in illyricum and

others  saturninus in isauria trebellianus piso in thessaly valens in achaia aemilianus in egypt and celsus in africa to illustrate the obscure monuments of the life and death of each individual would prove a laborious task alike barren of instruction and of amusement we may content ourselves with investigating some general characters that most strongly mark the condition of the times and the manners of the men their pretensions their motives their fate and the destructive consequences of their usurpation tillemont tom iii p      reckons them somewhat differently   it is sufficiently known that the odious appellation character and merit of the tyrants of tyrant was often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of supreme power without any reference to the abuse of it several of the pretenders who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor gallienus were shining models of virtue and almost all possessed a considerable share of vigor and ability their merit had recommended them to the favor of valerian and gradually promoted them to the most important commands of the empire the generals who assumed the title of augustus were either respected by their troops for their able conduct and severe discipline or admired for valor and success in war or beloved for frankness and generosity the field of victory was often the scene of their election and even the armourer marius the most contemptible of all the candidates for the purple was distinguished however by intrepid courage matchless strength and blunt honesty see the speech of marius in the augustan history p     the accidental identity of names was the only circumstance that could tempt pollio to imitate sallust  his mean and recent trade cast indeed an air of ridicule on his elevation but his birth could not be more obscure their obscure birth than was that of the greater part of his rivals who were born of peasants and inlisted in the army as private soldiers in times of confusion every active genius finds the place assigned him by nature in a general state of war military merit is the road to glory and to greatness of the nineteen tyrants tetricus only was a senator piso alone

second headed a formidable conspiracy against nero and a third was adopted and declared caesar by galba  his ancestors had been repeatedly dignified with all the honors which the commonwealth could bestow and of all the ancient families of rome the calphurnian alone had survived the tyranny of the caesars the personal qualities of piso added new luster to his race the usurper valens by whose order he was killed confessed with deep remorse that even an enemy ought to have respected the sanctity of piso and although he died in arms against gallienus the senate with the emperors generous permission decreed the triumphal ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel hist august p     the senate in a moment of enthusiasm seems to have presumed on the approbation of gallienus   the lieutenants of valerian were grateful to the causes of their rebellion the father whom they esteemed they disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of his unworthy son the throne of the roman world was unsupported by any principle of loyalty and treason against such a prince might easily be considered as patriotism to the state yet if we examine with candor the conduct of these usurpers it will appear that they were much oftener driven into rebellion by their fears than urged to it by their ambition they dreaded the cruel suspicions of gallienus they equally dreaded the capricious violence of their troops if the dangerous favor of the army had imprudently declared them deserving of the purple they were marked for sure destruction and even prudence would counsel them to secure a short enjoyment of empire and rather to try the fortune of war than to expect the hand of an executioner when the clamor of the soldiers invested the reluctant victims with the ensigns of sovereign authority they sometimes mourned in secret their approaching fate you have lost said saturninus on the day of his elevation you have lost a useful commander and you have made a very wretched emperor hist august p       the apprehensions of saturninus were justified their violent deaths by the repeated experience of revolutions of the nineteen tyrants who started up under the reign of gallienus there was not one who enjoyed a life of peace or a natural death as soon as they were invested with the bloody purple they inspired their adherents with the same fears and ambition which had occasioned their own revolt encompassed with domestic conspiracy military sedition and civil war they trembled on the edge of precipices in which after a longer or shorter term of anxiety they were inevitably lost these precarious monarchs received however such honors as the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could bestow but their claim founded on rebellion could never obtain the sanction of law or history italy rome and the senate constantly adhered to the cause of gallienus and he alone was considered as the sovereign of the empire that prince condescended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of odenathus who deserved the honorable distinction by the respectful conduct which he always maintained toward the son of valerian with the general applause of the romans and the consent of gallienus the senate conferred the title of augustus on the brave palmyrenian and seemed to entrust him with the government of the east which he already possessed in so independent a manner that like a private succession he bequeathed it to his illustrious widow zenobia the association of the brave palmyrenian was the most popular act of the whole reign of gallienus

philosopher were it possible for a philosopher to remain indifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind the election of these precarious emperors their power and their death were equally destructive to their subjects and adherents the price of their fatal elevation was instantly discharged to the troops by an immense donative drawn from the bowels of the exhausted people however virtuous was their character however pure their intentions they found themselves reduced to the hard necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty when they fell they involved armies and provinces in their fall there is still extant a most savage mandate from gallienus to one of his ministers after the suppression of ingenuus who had assumed the purple in illyricum

exposed to every invader the bravest usurpers were compelled by the perplexity of their situation to conclude ignominious treaties with the common enemy to purchase with oppressive tributes the neutrality or services of the barbarians and to introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the roman monarchy regillianus had some bands of roxolani in his service posthumus a body of franks it was perhaps in the character of auxiliaries that the latter introduced themselves into spain   such were the barbarians and such the tyrants who under the reigns of valerian and gallienus dismembered the provinces and reduced the empire to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin from whence it seemed impossible that it should ever emerge as far as the barrenness of materials would permit we have attempted to trace with order and perspicuity the general events of that calamitous period there still remain some particular facts i the disorders of sicily ii the tumults of alexandria and iii the rebellion of the isaurians which may serve to reflect a strong light on the horrid picture  i whenever numerous troops of banditti disorders of sicily multiplied by success and impunity publicly defy instead of eluding the justice of their country we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the community the situation of sicily preserved it from the barbarians nor could the disarmed province have supported an usurper the sufferings of that once flourishing and still fertile island were inflicted by baser hands a licentious crowd of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered country and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more ancient times the augustan history p     calls it servile

multitude whose resentments were furious and implacable hist august p     this long and terrible sedition was first occasioned by a dispute between a soldier and a townsman about a pair of shoes
