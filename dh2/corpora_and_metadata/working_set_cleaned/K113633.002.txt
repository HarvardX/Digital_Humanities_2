the poetical works of oliver goldsmith mb  volume the second  the poetical and dramatic works of oliver goldsmith mb now first collected  with an account of the life and writings of the author  in two volumes  london printed by h goldney for messieurs rivington t carnan and f newbery in st pauls churchyard t lowndes and g kearsley in fleet street t cadell and t evans in the strand mdcclxxx  plays by dr goldsmith the goodnatured man a comedy  as performed at the theater royal in covent garden  first printed in mdcclxviii  preface when i undertook to write a comedy i confess i was strongly prepossessed in favor of the poets of the last age and strove to imitate them the term genteel comedy was then unknown amongst us and little more was desired by an audience than nature and humor in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous the author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be expected of him and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim those who know any thing of composition are sensible that in pursuing humor it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean i was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunginghouse but in deference to the public taste grown of late perhaps too delicate the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the representation in deference also to the judgment of a few friends who think in a particular way the scene is here restored the author submits it to the reader in his closet and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humor and character from ours as it has already done from the french theater indeed the french comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental that it has not only banished humor and moliere from the stage but it has banished all spectators too  upon the whole the author returns his thanks to the public for the favorable reception which the goodnatured man has met with and to mr colman in particular for his kindness to it it may not also be improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theater that merit or supposed merit will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection  prologue written by dr johnson spoken by mr bensley pressed by the load of life the weary mind surveys the general toil of human kind with cool submission joins the laboring train and social sorrow loses half its pain our anxious bard without complaint may share this bustling seasons epidemic care like caesars pilot dignified by fate tossed in one common storm with all the great distressed alike the statesman and the wit when one a borough courtsand one the pit the busy candidates for power and fame have hopes and fears and wishes just the same disabled both to combat or to fly must hear all taunts and hear without reply uncheckd on both loud rabbles vent their rage as mongrels bay the lion in a cage the offended burgess hoards his angry tale for that blessed year when all that vote may rail their schemes of spite the poets foes dismiss till that glad night when all that hate may hiss  this day the powdered curls and golden coat says swelling crispin begged a coblers vote  this night our wit the pert apprentice cries  lies at my feet i hiss him and he dies the great it is true can charm the electing tribe the bard may supplicate but cannot bribe yet judged by those whose voices never were sold he feels no want of illpersuading

green landlady mrs white scene london the goodnatured man act the first scene an apartment in young honeywoods house enter sir william honeywood jarvis sir william good jarvis make no apologies for this honest bluntness fidelity like yours is the best excuse for every freedom   jarvis i cannot help being blunt and being very angry too when i hear you talk of disinheriting so good so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew my master all the world loves him   sir william say rather that he loves all the world that is his fault   jarvis i am sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are though he has not seen you since he was a child   sir william what signifies his affection to me or how can i be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance   jarvis i grant you that he is rather too goodnatured that he is too much every mans man that he laughs this minute with one and cries the next with another but whose instructions may he thank for all this   sir william not mine sure my letters to him during my employment in italy taught him only that philosophy which might prevent not defend his errors   jarvis faith begging your honors pardon i am sorry they taught him any philosophy at all it has only served to spoil him this same philosophy is a good horse in the stable but an arrant jade on a journey for my own part whenever i hear him mention the name on it i am always sure he is going to play the fool   sir william dont let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy i entreat you no jarvis his good nature arises rather from his fears of offending the importunate than his desire of making the deserving happy   jarvis what it rises from i dont know but to be sure every body has it that asks it   sir william ay or that does not ask it i have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies and find them as boundless as his dissipation   jarvis and yet faith he has some fine name or other for them all he calls his extravagance generosity and his trusting every body universal benevolence it was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew and that he called an act of exalted mu  mu  munificence ay that was the name he gave it   sir william and upon that i proceed as my last effort though with very little hopes to reclaim him that very fellow has just absconded and i have taken up the security now my intention is to involve him in fictitious distress before he has plunged himself into real calamity to arrest him for that very debt to clap an officer upon him and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief   jarvis well if i could but any way see him thoroughly vexed every groan of his would be music to me yet faith i believe it impossible i have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years but instead of being angry he sits as calmly to hear me scold as he does to his hairdresser   sir william we must try him once more however and i will go this instant to put my scheme into execution and i dont despair of succeeding as by your means i can have frequent opportunities of being about him without being known what a pity it is jarvis that any mans good will to others should produce so much neglect of himself as to require correction yet we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate hand there are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue  exit jarvis well go thy ways sir william honeywood it is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men but here comes his hopeful nephew the strange goodnatured foolsh openhearted  and yet all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them   enter honeywood honeywood well jarvis what messages from my friends this morning   jarvis you have no friends   honeywood well from my acquaintance then   jarvis pulling out bills a few of our usual cards of compliment that is all this bill from your tailor this from your mercer and this from the little broker in crookedlane he says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed   honeywood that i dont know but i am sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it   jarvis he has lost all patience   honeywood then he has lost a very good thing   jarvis there is that ten guineas you were fending to the poor gentleman and his children in the fleet i believe that would stop his mouth for a while at least   honeywood ay jarvis but what will fill their mouths in the mean time must i be cruel because he happens to be importunate and to relieve his avarice leave them to insupportable distress   jarvis sdeath sir the question now is how to relieve yourself yourself  havnt i reason to be out of my senses when i see things going at sixes and sevens   honeywood whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses i hope you will allow that i am not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine   jarvis youre the only man alive in your present situation that could do so  every thing upon the waste there is miss richland and her fine fortune gone already and upon the point of being given to your rival   honeywood i am no mans rival   jarvis your uncle in italy preparing to disinherit you your own fortune almost spent and nothing but pressing creditors false friends and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family   honeywood then they have the more occasion for being in mine   jarvis soh what will you have done with him that i caught stealing your plate in the pantry in the fact i caught him in the fact   honeywood in the fact if so i really think that we should pay him his wages and turn him off   jarvis he shall be turned off at tyburn the dog well hang him if it be only to frighten the rest of the family   honeywood no jarvis it is enough that we have lost what he has stolen let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature   jarvis very fine well here was the footman just now to complain of the butler he says he does most work and ought to have most wages   honeywood that is but just though perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman   jarvis ay its the way with them all from the scullion to the privycounsellor if they have a bad master they keep quarrelling with him if they have a good master they keep quarrelling with one another   enter butler drunk butler sir i will not stay in the family with jonathan you must part with him or part with me that is the exexexposition of the matter sir   honeywood full and explicit enough but what is his fault good philip   butler sir he is given to drinking sir and i shall have my morals corrupted by keeping such company   honeywood have ha he has such a diverting way    jarvis o quite amusing   butler i find my wines agoing sir and liquors dont go without mouths sir i hate a drunkard sir   honeywood well well philip i will hear yon upon that another time so go to bed now   jarvis to bed let him go the devil   butler begging your honors pardon and begging your pardon master jarvis i will not go to bed nor to the devil neither i hare enough to do to mind my cellar i forgot your honor mr croaker is below i came on purpose to tell you   honeywood why didnt you show him up blockhead   butler show him up sir with all my heart sir up or down all is one to me  exit jarvis ay we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night he comes on the old affair i suppose the match between his son that is just returned from paris and miss richland the young lady he is guardian to   honeywood perhaps so mr croaker knowing my friendship for the young lady has got it into his head that i can persuade her to what i please   jarvis ah if you loved yourself but half as well as she loves you we should soon fee a marriage that would set all things to rights again   honeywood love me sure jarvis you dream no no her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friendship  mere friendship that she is the most lovely woman that ever warmed the human heart with desire i own but never let me harbor a thought of making her unhappy by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as i am no jarvis it shall be my study to serve her even in spite of my wishes and to secure her happiness though it destroys my own  jarvis  was ever the like i want patience   honeywood besides jarvis though i could obtain miss richlands consent do you think i could succeed with her guardian or mrs croaker his wife who though both very fine in their way are yet a little opposite in their dispositions you know   jarvis opposite enough heaven knows the very reverse of each other she all laugh and no joke he always complaining and never sorrowful a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty    honeywood hum hush he is coming up he will hear you   jarvis one who is voice is a passing bell    honeywood well well go do   jarvis a raven that bodes nothing but mischief a coffin and cross bones a bundle of rue a sprig of deadly night shadea    honeywood stopping his mouth at last pushes him off exit jarvis honeywood i must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong there is something in my friend croakers conversation that quite depresses me his very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety and his appearance has a stronger effect on my spirits than an undertakers shop  mr croaker this is such a satisfaction    enter croaker croaker a pleasant morning to mr honeywood and many of them how is this you look most shockingly to day my dear friend i hope this weather does not affect your spirits to be sure if this weather continues  i say nothing  but god send we be all better this day three months   honeywood i heartily concur in the wish though i own not in your apprehensions   croaker may be not indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours taxes rising and trade falling money flying out of the kingdom and jesuits swarming into it i know at this time no less than an hundred and twentyseven jesuits between charing cross and temple bar   honeywood the jesuits will scarce pervert you or me i should hope   croaker may be not indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose i am only afraid for our wives and daughters   honeywood i have no apprehensions for the ladies i assure you   croaker may be not indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no the women in my time were good for something i have seen a lady dressed from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly but now adays the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them except their faces   honeywood but however these faults may be practiced abroad you dont find them at home either with mrs croaker olivia or miss richland   croaker the best of them will never be canonized for a saint when she is dead by the bye my dear friend i dont find this match between miss richland and my son much relished either b y one side or the other   honeywood i thought otherwise   croaker ah mr honeywood a little of your fine serious advice to the young lady might go far i know she has a very exalted opinion of your understanding   honeywood but would not that be usurping an authority that more properly belongs to yourself   croaker my dear friend you know but little of my authority at home people think indeed because they see me come out in a morning thus with a pleasant face and to make my friends merry that all is well within but i have cares that would break an heart of stone my wife has so encroached upon every one of my privileges that i am now no more than a mere lodger in my own house   honeywood but a little spirit exerted on your side might perhaps restore your authority   croaker no though i had the spirit of a lion i do rouse sometimes but what then always haggling and haggling a man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory   honeywood it is a melancholy consideration indeed that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties and that an increase of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes   croaker ah my dear friend these were the very words of poor dick doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself indeed mr honeywood i never fee you but you put me in mind of poor  dick ah there was merit neglected for you and so true a friend we loved each other for thirty years and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing   honeywood pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last   croaker i dont know some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me because we used to meet now and then and open our hearts to each other to be sure i loved to hear him talk and he loved to hear me talk poor dear dick he used to say that croaker rhimd to joker and so we used to laugh  poor dick going to cry   honeywood his fate affects me   croaker ay he grew sick of this miserable life where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry dress and undress get up and lie down while reason that should watch like a nurse by our side falls as fast asleep as we do   honeywood to say truth if we compare that part of life which is to come by that which we have past the prospect is hideous   croaker life at the greatest and best is but a froward child that must be humored and coaxd a little till it falls asleep and then all the care is over   honeywood very true sir nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence but the folly of our pursuits we wept when we came into the world and every day tells us why   croaker ah my dear friend it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you my son leontine shall not lose the benefit of such fine conversation i will just step home for him i am willing to show him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himself  and what if i bring my last letter to the gazetteer on the increase and progress of earthquakes it will amuse us i promise you i there prove how the late earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit from london to lisbon from lisbon to the canary islands from the canary islands to palmyra from palmyra to constantinople and so from constantinople back to london again  exit honeywood poor croaker his situation deserves the utmost pity i shall scarce recover my spirits these three days sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself and yet when i consider my own situation a broken fortune an hopeless passion friends in distress the wish but not the power to serve them  pausing and sighing   enter butler butler more company below sir mrs croaker and miss richland shall i show them up but they are showing up themselves  exit enter mrs croaker and miss richland miss richland youre always in such spirits   mrs croaker we have just come my dear honeywood from the auction there was the old deaf dowager as usual bidding like a fury against herself and then so curious in antiques herself the most genuine piece of antiquity in the whole collection   honeywood excuse me ladies if some uneasiness from friendship makes me unfit to share in this good humor i know you will pardon me   mrs croaker i vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning well if richland here can pardon you i must   miss richland you would seem to insinuate madam that i have particular reasons for being disposed to refuse it   mrs croaker whatever i insinuate my dear dont be so ready to wish an explanation   miss richland i own i should be sorry mr honeywoods long friendship and mine should be misunderstood   honeywood there is no answering for others madam but i hope you will never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow   miss richland and i shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others   honeywood my own sentiments madam friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals love an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves   miss richland and without a compliment i know none more disinterested or more capable of friendship than mr honeywood   mrs croaker and indeed i know nobody that has more friends at least among the ladies miss fruzz miss odbody and miss winterbottom praise him in all companies as for miss biddy bundle she is his professed admirer   miss richland indeed an admirer i did not know sir you were such a favorite there but is she seriously so handsome is she the mighty thing talked of   honeywood the town madam seldom begins to praise a ladys beauty till she is beginning to lose it smiling   mrs croaker but she is resolved never to lose it it seems for as her natural face decays her skill improves in making the artificial one well nothing diverts me more than one of those fine old dressy things who thinks to conceal her age by every where exposing her person sticking herself up in the front of a sidebox trailing through a minuet at almacks and then in the public gardens looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place   honeywood every age has its admirers ladies while you perhaps are trading among the warmer climates of youth there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty   miss richland but then the mortifications they must suffer before they can be fitted out for traffic i have seen one of them fret an whole morning at her hairdresser when all the fault was her face   honeywood and yet i will engage has carried that face at last to a very good market this goodnatured town madam has husbands like spectacles to fit every age from fifteen to fourscore  mrs croaker  well youre a dear goodnatured creature but you know youre engaged with us this morning upon a strolling party i want to show olivia the town and the things i believe i shall have business for you for the whole day   honeywood i am sorry madam i have an appointment with mr croaker which it is impossible to put off   mrs croaker what with my husband then i am resolved to take no refusal nay i protest you must you know i never laugh so much as with you   honeywood why if i must i must i will swear you have put me into such spirits well do you find jest and i will find laugh i promise you well wait for the chariot in the next room   exeunt enter leontine and olivia leontine there they go thoughtless and happy my dearest olivia what would i give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements and as cheerful as they are   olivia how my leontine how can i be cheerful when i have so many terrors to oppress me the fear of being detected by this family and the apprehensions of a censuring world when i must be detected    leontine the world my love what can it say at worst it can only say that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice that you confided in his honor and took refuge in my fathers house the only one where yours could remain without censure   olivia but consider leontine your disobedience and my indiscretion your being sent to france to bring home a sister and instead of a sister bringing home    leontine one dearer than a thousand sisters one that i am convinced will be equally dear to the rest of the family when she comes to be known   olivia and that i fear will shortly be   leontine impossible till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery my sister you know has been with her aunt at lions since she was a child and you find every creature in the family takes you for her   olivia but may not she write may not her aunt write   leontine her aunt scarce ever writes and all my sisters letters are directed to me   olivia but will not your refusing miss richland for whom you know the old gentleman intends you create a suspicion   leontine there there is my masterstroke i have resolved not to refuse her nay an hour hence i have consented to go with my father to make her an offer of my heart and fortune   olivia your heart and fortune   leontine dont be alarmed my dearest can olivia think so meanly of my honor or my love as to suppose i could ever hope for happiness from any but her no my olivia neither the force nor permit me to add the delicacy of my passion leave any room to suspect me i only offer miss richland an heart i am convinced she will refuse as i am confident that without knowing it her affections are fixed upon mr honeywood   olivia mr honeywood you will excuse my apprehensions but when your merits come to be put in the balance    leontine you view them with too much partiality however by making this offer i show a seeming compliance with my fathers command and perhaps upon her refusal i may have his consent to choose for myself   olivia well i submit and yet my leontine i own i shall envy her even your pretended addresses i consider every look every expression of your esteem as due only to me this is folly perhaps i allow it but it is natural to suppose that merit which has made an impression on ones own heart may be powerful over that of another   leontine dont my lifes treasure dont let us make imaginary evils when yon know we have so many real ones to encounter at worst yon know if miss richland should consent or my father refuse his pardon it can but end in a trip to scotland and    enter croaker croaker where have you been boy i have been seeking you my friend honeywood here has been saying such comfortable things ah he is an example indeed where is he i left him here   leontine sir i believe you may see him and hear him too in the next room he is preparing to go out with the ladies   croaker good gracioas can i believe my eyes or my ears i am struck dumb with his vivacity and stunned with the loudness of his laugh was there ever such a transformation a laugh behind the scenes croaker mimics it ha ha ha there it goes a plague take their balderdash yet i could expect nothing lest when my precious wife was of the party on my conscience i believe she could spread an horselaugh through the pews of a tabernacle   leontine since you find so many objections to a wife sir how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me   croaker i have told you and tell you again boy that miss richlands fortune must not go out of the family one may find comfort in the money whatever one does in the wife   leontine but sir though in obedience to your desire i am ready to marry her it may be possible she has no inclination to me   croaker i will tell you once for all how it stands a good part of miss richlands large fortune consists in a claim upon government which my good friend mr lofty assures me the treasury will allow one half of this she is to forfeit by her fathers will in case she refuses to marry you so if she rejects you we seize half her fortune if she accepts you we seize the whole and a fine girl into the bargain   leontine but sir if you will but listen to reason    croaker come then produce your reasons i tell you i am fixed determined so now produce your reasons when i am determined i always listen to reason because it can then do no harm   leontine you have alleged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness   croaker well and you have both of you a mutual choice she has her choice  to marry you or lose half her fortune and you have your choice  to marry her or pack out of doors without any fortune at all   leontine an only son sir might expect more indulgence   croaker an only father sir might expect more obedience besides has not your sister here that never disobliged me in her life as good a right as you he is a sad dog livy my dear and would take all from you but he shall not i tell you he shall not for you shall have your share   olivia dear sir i wish you would be convinced that i can never be happy in any addition to my fortune which is taken from his   croaker well well it is a good child so say no more but come with me and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure i promise you old ruggins the currycombmaker lying in state i am told he makes a very handsome corpse and becomes his coffin prodigiously he was an intimate friend of mine and these are friendly things we ought to do for each other   exeunt act the second scene croakers house miss richland garnet miss richland olivia not his sister olivia not leontines sister you amaze me   garnet no more his sister than i am i had it all from his own servant i can get any thing from that quarter   miss richland but how tell me again garnet   garnet why madam as i told you before instead of going to lions to bring home his sister who has been there with her aunt these ten years he never went further than paris there he saw and fell in love with this young lady by the bye of a prodigious family   miss richland and brought her home to my guardian as his daughter   garnet yes and his daughter she will be if he dont consent to their marriage they talk of trying what a scotch parson can do   miss richland well i own they have deceived me  and so demurely as olivia carried it to  would you believe it garnet i told her all my secrets and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me   garnet and upon my word madam i dont much blame her she was loath to trust one with her secrets that was so very bad at keeping her own   miss richland but to add to their deceit the young gentleman it seems pretends to make me serious proposals my guardian and he are to be here presently to open the affair in form you know i am to lose half my fortune if i refuse him   garnet yet what can you do for being as you are in love with mr honeywood madam    miss richland how idiot what do you mean in love with mr honeywood is this to provoke me   garnet that is madam in friendship with him i meant nothing more than friendship as i hope to be married nothing more   miss richland well no more of this as to my guardian and his son they shall find me prepared to receive them i am resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure to mortify them by compliance and so throw the refusal at last upon them   garnet delicious and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself well who could have thought so innocent a face could cover so much cuteness   miss richland why girl i only oppose my prudence to their cunning and practice a lesson they have taught me against themselves   garnet then youre likely not long to want employment for here they come and in close conference   enter croaker leontine leontine excuse me sir if i seem to hesitate upon the point of putting to the lady so important a question   croaker lord good sir moderate your fears youre so plaguey shy that one would think you had changed sexes i tell you we must have the half or the whole come let me see with what spirit you begin well why dont you eh what well then  i must it seems  miss richland my dear i believe yon guess at our business an affair which my son here comes to open that nearly concerns your happiness   miss richland sir i should be ungrateful not to be pleased with any thing that comes recommended by you   croaker how boy could you desire a finer opening why dont you begin i say to leont   leontine it is true madam my father madam has some intentions  hem  of explaining an affair  which  himself  can best explain madam   croaker yes my dear it comes entirely from my son it is all a request of his own madam and i will permit him to make the best of it   leontine the whole affair is only this madam my father has a proposal to make which he insists none but himself shall deliver   croaker my mind misgives me the fellow will never be brought on aside in short madam you see before you one that loves you one whose whole happiness is all in you   miss richland i never had any doubts of your regard sir and i hope you can have none of my duty   croaker that is not the thing my little sweeting my love no no another guess lover than i there he stands madam his very looks declare the force of his passion  call up a look you dog aside  but then had you seen him as i have weeping speaking soliloquies and blank verse sometimes melancholy and sometimes absent    miss richland i fear sir he is absent now or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself   croaker himself madam he would die before he could make such a confession and if he had not a channel for his passion through me it would ere now have drowned his understanding   miss richland i must grant sir there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words a silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity   croaker madam he has forgot to speak any other language silence is become his mother tongue   miss richland and it must be confessed sir it speaks very powerfully in his favor and yet i shall be thought too forward in making such a confession shall not i mr leontine   leontine confusion my reserve will undo me but if modesty attracts her impudence may disgust her i will try aside dont imagine from my silence madam that i want a due sense of the honor and happiness intended me my father madam tells me your humble servant is not totally indifferent to you he admires you i adore you and when we come together upon my soul i believe we shall be the happiest couple in all st jamess   miss richland if i could flatter myself you thought as you speak sir    leontine doubt my sincerity madam by your dear self i swear ask the brave if they desire glory ask cowards if they covet safety    croaker well well no more questions about it   leontine ask the sick if they long for health ask misers if they love money ask    croaker ask a fool if he can talk nonsense what is come over the boy what signifies asking when there is not a soul to give you an answer if you would ask to the purpose ask this ladys consent to make you happy   miss richland why indeed sir his uncommon ardour almost compels me  forces me to comply and yet i am afraid he will despise a conquest gained with too much ease will not you mr leontine   leontine confusion aside oh by no means madam by no means and yet madam you talked of force there is nothing i would avoid so much as compulsion in a thing of this kind no madam i will still be generous and leave you at liberty to refuse   croaker but i tell you sir the lady is not at liberty it is a match you see she says nothing silence gives consent   leontine but sir she talked of force consider sir the cruelty of constraining her inclinations   croaker but i say there is no cruelty dont you know blockhead that girls have always a roundabout way of saying yes before company so get you both gone together into the next room and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation get you gone i say i will not hear a word   leontine but sir i must beg leave to insist    croaker get off you puppy or i will beg leave to insist upon knocking you down stupid whelp but i dont wonder the toy takes entirely after his mother   exeunt miss rich and leont enter mrs croaker mrs croaker mr croaker i bring you something my dear that i believe will make you smile   croaker i will hold you a guinea of that my dear   mrs croaker a letter and as i knew the hand i ventured to open it   croaker and how can you expect your breaking open my letters should give me pleasure   mrs croaker poo it is from your sister at lions and contains good news read it   croaker what a frenchified cover is here that sister of mine has some good qualities but i could never teach her to fold a letter   mrs croaker fold a fiddlestick read what it contains   croaker reading dear nick an english gentleman of large fortune has for some time made private though honorable proposals to your daughter olivia they love each other tenderly and i find she has consented without letting any of the family know to crown his addresses as such good offers dont come every day your own good sense his large fortune and family considerations will induce you to forgive her  yours ever rachael croaker   my daughter olivia privately contracted to a man of large fortune this is good news indeed my heart never foretold me of this and yet how silly the little baggage has carried it since she came home not a word on it to the old ones for the world yet i thought i saw something she wanted to conceal   mrs croaker well if they have concealed their amor they shall not conceal their wedding that shall be public i am resolved   croaker i tell thee woman the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony i can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engagement   mrs croaker what would you have me think of their funeral but come tell me my dear dont you owe more to me than you care to confess would you have ever been known to mr lofty who has undertaken miss richlands claim at the treasury but for me who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady shabbaroons rout who got him to promise us his interest is not he a backstairs favorite one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please is not he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us   croaker he is a man of importance i grant you and yet what amazes me is that while he is giving away places to all the world he cannot get one for himself   mrs croaker that perhaps may be owing to his nicety great men are not easily satisfied   enter french servant servant an express from monsieur lofty he vil be vait upon your honors instrammant he be only giving four five instruction read two three memorial call upon von ambassadeur he vil be vid you in one tree minutes   mrs croaker you see now my dear what an extensive department well friend let your master know that we are extremely honored by this honor was there any thing ever in a higher style of breeding all messages among the great are now done by express

never mind the world my dear you were never in a pleasanter place in your life let us now think of receiving him with proper respect a loud rapping at the door and there he is by the thundering rap   croaker ay verily there he is as close upon the heels of his own express as an indorsement upon the back of a bill well i will leave you to receive him whilst i go to chide my little olivia for intending to steal a marriage without mine or her aunts consent i must seem to be angry or she too may begin to despise my authority  exit enter lofty speaking to his servant lofty and if the venetian ambassador or that teazing creature the marquis should call i am not at home damme i will be packhorse to none of them my dear madam i have just snatched a moment  and if the expresses to his grace be ready let them be sent off they are of importance madam i ask a thousand pardons   mrs croaker sir this honor    lofty and dubardieu if the person calls about the commission let him know that it is

public while i detain you   lofty sink the public madam when the fair are to be attended ah could all my hours be so charmingly devoted sincerely dont you pity us poor creatures in affairs thus it is eternally solicited for places here teized for pensions there and courted every where i know you pity me yes i see you do   mrs croaker excuse me sir toils of empires pleasures are as waller says   lofty waller waller is he of the house   mrs croaker the modern poet of that name sir   lofty oh a modern we men of business despise the moderns and as for the ancients we have no time to read them poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters but not for us why now here i stand that know nothing of books i say madam i know nothing of books and yet i believe upon a land carriage fishery a stamp act or a jaghire i can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them   mrs croaker the world is no stranger to mr loftys eminence in every capacity   lofty i vow to gad madam you make me blush i am nothing nothing nothing in the world a mere obscure gentleman to be sure indeed one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formidable man i know they are pleased to bespatter me at all their little dirty levees yet upon my soul i wander what they see in me to treat me so measures not men have always been my mark and i vow by all that is honorable my resentment has never done the men as mere men any manner of harm  that is as mere men   mrs croaker what importance and yet what modesty   lofty oh if you talk of modesty madam there i own i am accessible to praise modesty is my foible it was so the duke of brentford used to say of me i love jack lofty he used to say no man has a finer knowledge of things quite a man of information and when he speaks upon his legs by the lord he is prodigious he scouts them and yet all men have their faults too much modesty is his says his grace   mrs croaker and yet i dare say you dont want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends   lofty o there indeed i am in bronze apropos i have just been mentioning miss richlands case to a certain personage we must name no names when i ask i am not to be put off madam no no i take my friend by the button a fine girl sir great justice in her case a friend of mine borough interest business must be done mr secretary i say mr secretary her business must be done sir that is my way madam   mrs croaker bless me you said all this to the secretary of state did you   lofty i did not say the secretary did i well curse it since you have found me out i will not deny it it was to the secretary   mrs croaker this was going to the fountain head at once not applying to the understrappers as mr honeywood would have had us   loftt honeywood he he he was indeed a fine solicitor i suppose you have heard what has just happened to him   mrs croaker poor dear man no accident i hope   lofty undone madam that is all his creditors have taken him into custody a prisoner in his own house   mrs croaker a prisoner in his own house how at this very time i am quite unhappy for him   lofty why so am i the man to be sure was immensely goodnatured but then i could never find that he had any thing in him   mrs croaker his manner to be sure was excessive harmless some indeed thought it a little dull for my part i always concealed my opinion   lofty it cannot be concealed madam the man was dull dull as the last new comedy a poor impracticable creature i tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business but he had scarce talents to be groomporter to an orange barrow   mrs croaker how differently does miss richland think of him for i believe with all his faults she loves him   lofty loves him does she you should cure her of that by all means let me see what if she were sent to him this instant in his present doleful situation my life for it that works her cure distress is a perfect antidote to love suppose we join her in the next room miss richland is a fine girl has a fine fortune and must not be thrown away upon my honor madam i have a regard for miss richland and rather than she should be thrown away i should think it no indignity to marry her myself   exeunt enter olivia and leontine leontine and yet trust me olivia i had every reason to expect miss richlands refusal as i did every thing in my power to deserve it her indelicacy surprises me   olivia sure leontine there is nothing so indelicate in being sensible of your merit if so i fear i shall be the most guilty thing alive   leontine but you mistake my dear the same attention i used to advance my merit with you i practiced to lessen it with her what more could i do   olivia let us now rather consider what is to be done we have both dissembled too long  i have always been ashamed  i am now quite weary of it sure i could never have undergone so much for any other but you   leontine and you shall find my gratitude equal to your kindest compliance though our friends should totally forsake us olivia we can draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune   olivia then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness when it is now in our power i may be the favorite of your father it is true but can it ever be thought that his present kindness to a supposed child will continue to a known deceiver   leontine i have many reasons to believe it will as his attachments are but few they are lasting his own marriage was a private one as ours may be besides i have sounded him already at a distance and find all his answers exactly to our wish nay by an expression or two that dropped from him i am induced to think he knows of this affair   olivia indeed but that would be an happiness too great to be expected   leontine however it be i am certain you have power over him and am persuaded if you informed him of our situation that he would be disposed to pardon it   olivia you had equal expectations leontine from your last scheme with miss richland which you find has succeeded most wretchedly   leontine and that is the best reason for trying another   olivia if it must be so i submit   leontine as we could wish he comes this way now my dearest olivia be resolute i will just retire within hearing to come in at a proper time either to share your danger or confirm your victory  exit enter croaker croaker yes i must forgive her and yet not too easily neither it will be proper to keep up the decorums of resentment a little if it be only to impress her with an idea of my authority   olivia how i tremble to approach him  might i presume sir  if i interrupt you    croaker no child where i have an affection it is not a little thing that can interrupt me affection gets over little things   olivia sir youre too kind i am sensible how ill i deserve this partiality yet heaven knows there is nothing i would not do to gain it   croaker and you have but too well succeeded you little hussy you with those endearing ways of yours on my conscience i could be brought to forgive any thing unless it were a very great offense indeed   olivia but mine is such an offense  when you know my guilt  yes you shall know it though i feel the greatest pain in the confession   croaker why then if it be so very great a pain you may spare yourself the trouble for i know every syllable of the matter before you begin   olivia indeed then i am undone   croaker ay miss you wanted to steal a match without letting me know it did you but i am not worth being consulted i suppose when there is to be a marriage in my own family no i am to have no hand in the disposal of my own children no i am nobody i am to be a mere article of family lumbe a piece of cracked china to be stuck up in a corner   olivia dear sir nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you   croaker no no my consequence is no more i am as little minded as a dead russian in winter just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thaw  it goes to my heart to vex her aside   olivia i was prepared sir for your anger and despaired of pardon even while i presume to ask it but your severity shall never abate my affection as my punishment is but justice   croaker and yet you should not despair neither livy we ought to hope all for the best   olivia and do you permit me to hope sir can i ever expect to be forgiven but hope has too long deceived me   croaker why then child it shall not deceive you now for i forgive you this very moment i forgive you all and now you are indeed my daughter   olivia o transport this kindness overpowers me   croaker i was always against severity to our children we have been young and giddy ourselves and we cannot expect boys and girls to be old before their time   olivia what generosity but can you forget the many falsehoods the dissimulation    croaker you did indeed dissemble you urchin you but where is the girl that will not dissemble for an husband my wife and i had never been married if we had not dissembled a little beforehand   olivia it shall be my future care never to put such generosity to a second trial and as for the partner of my offense and folly from his native honor and the just sense he has of his duty i can answer for him that    enter leontine leontine permit him thus to answer for himself kneeling thus sir let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited forgiveness yes sir this even exceeds all your former tenderness i now can boast the most indulgent of fathers the life he gave compared to this was but a trifling blessing   croaker and good sir who sent for you with that fine tragedy face and flourishing manner i dont know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion   leontine how sir is it possible to be silent when so much obliged would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful of adding my thanks to my olivias of sharing in the transports that you have thus occasioned   croaker lord sir we can be happy enough without your coming in to make up the party i dont know what is the matter with the boy all this day he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all this morning   leontine but sir i that have so large a part in the benefit is it not my duty to show my joy is the being admitted to your favor so slight an obligation is the happiness of marrying my olivia so small a blessing   croaker marrying olivia marrying olivia marrying his own sister sure the boy is out of his senses his own sister   leontine my sister   olivia sister how have i been mistaken aside   leontine some cursed mistake in all this i find aside   croaker what does the booby mean or has he any meaning eh what do you mean you blockhead you   leontine mean sir  why sir  only when my sister is to be married that i have the pleasure of marrying her sir that is of giving her away sir  i have made a point of it   croaker o is that all give her away you have made a point of it then yon had as good make a point of first giving away yourself as i am going to prepare the writings between you and miss richland this very minute what a fuss is here about nothing why what is the matter now i thought i had made you at least as happy as you could wish   olivia o yes sir very happy   croaker do you foresee any thing child you look as if you did i think if any thing was to be foreseen i have as sharp a look out as another and yet i foresee nothing   exit leontine olivia olivia what can it mean   leontine he knows something and yet for my life i cannot tell what   olivia it cannot be the connection between us i am pretty certain   leontine whatever it be my dearest i am resolved to put it out of fortunes power to repeat our mortification i will haste and prepare for our journey to scotland this very evening my friend honeywood has promised me his advice and assistance i will go to him and repose our distresses on his friendly bosom and i know so much of his honest heart that if he cannot relieve our uneasiness he will at least share them   exeunt act the third scene young honeywoods house bailiff honeywood follower bailiff lookey sir i have arrested as good men as you in my time no disparagement of you neither men that would go forty guineas on a game of cribbage i challenge the town to show a man in more genteeler practice than myself   honeywood without all question mr  i forget your name sir   bailiff how can you forget what you never knew he he he   honeywood may i beg leave to ask your name   bailiff yes you may   honeywood then pray sir what is your name sir   bailiff that i didnt promise to tell you he he he a joke breaks no bones as we say among us that practice the law   honeywood you may have reason for keeping it a secret perhaps   bailiff the law does nothing without reason i am ashamed to tell my name to no man sir if you can show cause as why upon a special capus that i should prove my name  but come timothy twitch is my name and now you know my name what have you to say to that   honeywood nothing in the world good mr twitch but that i have a favor to ask that is all   bailiff ay favors are more easily asked than granted as we say among us that practice the law i have taken an oath against granting favors would you have me perjure myself   honeywood but my request will come recommended in so strong a manner as i believe you will have no scruple pulling out his purse the thing is only this i believe i shall be able to discharge this trifle in two or three days at farthest but as i would not have the affair known for the world i have thoughts of keeping you and your good friend here about me till the debt is discharged for which i shall be properly grateful   bailiff oh that is another maxum and altogether within my oath for certain if an honest man is to get any thing by a thing there is no reason why all things should not be done in civility   honeywood doubtless all trades must live mr twitch and yours is a necessary one gives him money   bailiff oh your honor i hope your honor takes nothing amiss as i does as i does nothing but my duty in so doing i am sure no man can say i ever give a gentleman that was a gentleman ill usage if i saw that a gentleman was a gentleman i have taken money not to see him for ten weeks together   honeywood tenderness is a virtue mr twitch   bailiff ay sir it is a perfect treasure i love to see a gentleman with a tender heart i dont know but i think i have a tender heart myself if all that i have lost by my heart was put together it would make a  but no matter for that   honeywood dont account it lost mr twitch the ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves   bailiff humanity sir is a jewel it is better than gold i love humanity people may say that we in our way have no humanity but i will show yon my humanity this moment there is my follower here little flanigan with a wife and four children a guinea or two would be more to him than twice as much to another now as i cannot show him any humanity myself i must beg leave you will do it for me   honeywood i assure you mr twitch yours is a most powerful recommendation giving money to the follower   bailiff sir youre a gentleman i see you know what to do with your money but to business we are to be with you here as your friends i suppose but set in case company comes  little flanigan here to be sure has a good face a very good face but then he is a little seedy as we say among us that practice the law not well in clothes smoke the pocketholes   honeywood well that shall be remedied without delay   enter servant servant sir miss richland is below   honeywood how unlucky detain her a moment we must improve my good friend little mr flanigans appearance first here let mr flanigan have a suit of my clothes  quick  the brown and silver  do you hear   servant that your honor gave away to the begging gentleman that makes verses because it was as good as new   honeywood the white and gold then   servant that your honor i made bold to sell because it was good for nothing   honeywood well the first that comes to hand then the blue and gold then i believe mr flanigan will look best in blue   exit flanigan bailiff rabbit me but little flanigan will look well in any thing ah if your honor knew that bit of flesh as well as i do you would be perfectly in love with him there is not a prettier scout in the four counties after a shycock than he scents like a hound sticks like a weazle he was master of the ceremonies to the black queen of morocco when i took him to follow me reenter flanigan heh ecod i think he looks so well that i dont care if i have a suit from the same place for myself   honeywood well well i hear the lady coming dear mr twitch i beg you will give your friend directions not to speak as for yourself i know you will say nothing without being directed   bailiff never you fear me i will show the lady that i have something to say for myself as well as another one man has one way of talking and another man has another that is all the difference between them   enter miss richland and her maid miss richland you will be surpised sir with this visit but you know i am yet to thank you for choosing my little library   honeywood thanks madam are unnecessary as it was i that was obliged by your commands chairs here two of my very good friends mr twitch and mr flanigan pray gentlemen sit without ceremony   miss richland who can these oddlooking men be i fear it is as i was informed it must be so aside   bailiff after a pause pretty weather very pretty weather for the time of the year madam   follower very good circuit weather in the country   honeywood you officers are generally favorites among the ladies my friends madam have been upon very disagreeable duty i assure you the fair should in some measure recompense the toils of the brave   miss richland our officers do indeed deserve every favor the gentlemen are in the marine service i presume sir   honeywood why madam they do  occasionally serve in the fleet madam a dangerous service   miss richland i am told so and i own it has often surprised me that while we have had so many instances of bravery there we have had so few of wit at home to praise it   honeywood i grant madam that our poets have not written as our soldiers have fought but they have done all they could and hawke or amherst could do do more   miss richland i am quite displeased when i see a fine subject spolied by a dull writer   honeywood we should not be so severe against dull writers madam it is ten to one but the dullest writer exceeds the most rigid french critic who presumes to despise him   follower damn the french the parle vous and all that belongs to them   miss richland sir   honeywoood ha ha ha honest mr flanigan a true english officer madam he is not contented with beating the french but he will scold them too   miss richland yet mr honeywood this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary it was our first adopting the severity of french taste that has brought them in turn to taste us   bailiff taste us by the lord madam they devour us give monseers but a taste and i will be damned but they come in for a bellyful   miss richland very extraordinary this   follower but very true what makes the bread rising the parle vous that devour us what makes the mutton fivepence a pound the parle vous that eat it up what makes the beer threepencehalfpenny a pot    honeywood ah the vulgar rogues all will be out aside right gentlemen very right upon my word and quite to the purpose they draw a parallel madam between the mental taste and that of our senses we are injured as much by french severity in the one as by french rapacity in the other that is their meaning   miss richland though i dont see the force of the parallel yet i will own that we should sometimes pardon books as we do our friends that have now and then agreeable absurdities to recommend them   bailiff that is all my eye the king only can pardon as the laws says for set in case    honeywood i am quite of your opinion sir i see the whole drift of your argument yes certainly our presuming to pardon any work is arrogating a power that belongs to a another if all have power to condemn what writer can be free   briliff by his habus corpus his habus corpus can set him free at any time for set in case    honeywood i am obliged to you sir for the hint if madam as my friend observes our laws are so careful of a gentlemans person sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part his fame   follower ay but if so be a mans nabbd you know    honeywood mr flanigan if you spoke for ever you could not improve the last observation for my own part i think it conclusive   bailiff as for the matter of that mayhap    honeywood nay sir give me leave in this instance to be positive for where is the necessity of censuring works without genius which must shortly sink of themselves what is it but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice   bailiff justice o by the elevens if you talk about justice i think i am at home there for in a course of law    honeywood my dear mr twitch i discern what you would be at perfectly and i believe the lady must be sensible of the art with which it is introduced i suppose you perceive the meaning madam of his course of law   miss richland i protest sir i do not i perceive only that you answer one gentleman before he has finished and the other before he has well begun   bailiff madam you are a gentlewoman and i will make the matter out this here question is about severity and justice and pardon and the like of they now to explain the thing    honeywood o curse your explanations aside   enter servant servant mr leontine sir below desires to speak with you upon earnest business   honeywood that is lucky aside dear madam you will excuse me and my good friends here for a few minutes there are books madam to amuse you come gentlemen you know i make no ceremony with such friends after you sir excuse me well if i must but i know your natural politeness   bailiff before and behind you know   follower ay ay before and behind before and behind   exeunt honeywood bailiff and follower miss richland what can all this mean garnet   garnet mean madam why what should it mean but what mr lofty sent you here to see these people he calls officers are officers sure enough sheriffs officers bailiffs madam   miss richland ay it is certainly so well though his perplexities are far from giving me pleasure yet i own there is something very ridiculous in them and a just punishment for his dissimulation   garnet and so they are but i wonder madam that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts and set him free has not done it by this time he ought at least to have been here before now but lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles than out of them   enter sir william sir william for miss richland to undertake setting him free i own was quite unexpected it has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him yet it gives me pleasure to find that among a number of worthless friendships he has made one acquisition of real value for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity ha here before me i will endeavor to sound her affections madam as i am the person that have had some demands upon the gentleman of this house i hope you will excuse me if before i enlarged him i wanted to see yourself   miss richland the precaution was very unnecessary sir i suppose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy   sir william partly madam but i was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve   miss richland it must come sir with a very ill grace from you to censure it after what you have done would look like malice and to speak favorably of a character you have oppressed would be impeaching your own and sure his tenderness his humanity his universal friendship may atone for many faults   sir william that friendship madam which is exerted in too wide a sphere becomes totally useless our bounty like a drop of water disappears when diffused too widely they who pretend most to this universal benevolence are either deceivers or dupes men who desire to cover their private ill nature by a pretended regard for all or men who reasoning themselves into false feelings are more earnest in pursuit of splendid than of useful virtues   miss richland i am surprised sir to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others so severe in his censure of it   sir william whatever i may have gained by folly madam you see i am willing to prevent your losing by it   miss richland you cares for me sir are unnecessary i always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted and offered perhaps in hopes of a refusal no sir my directions have been given and i insist upon their being complied with   sir william thou amiable woman i can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude my pleasure you see before you one who has been equally careful of his interest one who has for some time been a concealed spectator of his follies and only punished in hopes to reclaim them  his uncle   miss richland sir william honeywood you amaze me how shall i conceal my confusion i fear sir you will think i have been too forward in my services i confess i    sir william dont make any apologies madam i only find myself unable to repay the obligation and yet i have been trying my interest of late to serve you having learnt madam that you had some demands upon government i have though unasked been your solicitor there   miss richland sir i am infinitely obliged to your intentions but my guardian has employed another gentleman who assures him of success   sir william who the important little man that visits here trust me madam he is quite contemptible among men in power and utterly unable to serve you mr loftys promises are much better known to people of fashion than his person i assure you   miss richland how have we been deceived as sure as can be here he comes   sir william does he remember i am to continue unknown my return to england has not as yet been made public with what impudence he enters   enter lofty lofty let the chariot  let my chariot drive off i will visit to his graces in a chair miss richland here before me punctual as usual to the calls of humanity i am very sorry madam things of this kind should happen especially to a man i have shown every where and carried amongst us as a particular acquaintance   miss richland i find sir you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own   lofty my dear madam what can a private man like me do one man cannot do every thing and then i do so much in this way every day let me see something considerable might be done for him by subscription it could not fail if i carried the list i will undertake to set down a brace of dukes two dozen lords and half the lower house at my own peril   sir william and after all it is more than probable sir he might reject the offer of such powerful patronage   lofty then madam what can we do you know i never make promises in truth i once or twice tried to do something with him in the way of business but as i often told his uncle sir william honeywood the man was utterly impracticable   sir william his uncle then that gentleman i suppose is a particular friend of yours   lofty meaning me sir  yes madam as i often said my dear sir william you are sensible i would do any thing as far as my poor interest goes to serve your family but what can be done there is no procuring firstrate places for ninthrate abilities   miss richland i have heard of sir william honeywood he is abroad in employment he confided in your judgment i suppose   lofty why yes madam i believe sir william had some reason to confide in my judgment one little reason perhaps   miss richland pray sir what was it   lofty why madam  but let it go no further  it was i procured him his place   sir william did you sir   lofty either you or i sir   miss richland this mr lofty was very kind indeed   lofty i did love him to be sure he had some amusing qualities no man was fitter to be toastmaster to a club or had a better head   miss richland a better head   lofty ay at a bottle to be sure he was as dull as a choice spirit but hand it he was grateful very grateful and gratitude hides a multitude of faults   sir william he might have reason perhaps his place is pretty considerable i am told   lofty a trifle a mere trifle among us men of business the truth is he wanted dignity to fill up a greater   sir william dignity of person do you mean sir i am told he is much about my size and figure sir   lofty ay tall enough for a marching regiment but then he wanted a something  a consequence of form  a kind of a  i believe the lady perceives my meaning   miss richland o perfectly you courtiers can do any thing i see   lofty my dear madam all this is but a mere exchange we do greater things for one another every day why as thus now let me suppose you the first lord of the treasury you have an employment in you that i want i have a place in me that you want do me here do you there interest of both sides few words flat done and done and its over   sir william a thought strikes me aside now you mention sir william honeywood madam and as he seems sir an acquaintance of yours you will be glad to hear he is arrived from italy i had it from a friend who knows him as well as he does me and you may depend on my information   lofty the devil he is if i had known that we should not have been quite so well acquainted aside   sir william he is certainly returned and as this gentleman is a friend of yours he can be of signal service to us by introducing me to him there are some papers relative to your affairs that require dispatch and his inspection   miss richland this gentleman mr lofty is a person employed in my affairs i know you will serve us   lofty my dear madam i live but to serve you sir william shall even wait upon him if you think proper to command it   sir william that would be quite unnecessary   lofty well we must introduce you then call upon me  let me see  ay in two days   sir william now or the opportunity will be lost for ever   lofty well if it must be now now let it be but damn it that is unfortunate my lord grigs cursed pensacola business comes on this very hour and i am engaged to attend  another time    sir william a short letter to sir william will do   lofty you shall have it yet in my opinion a letter is a very bad way of going to work face to face that is my way   sir william the letter sir will do quite as well   lofty zounds sir do you pretend to direct me direct me in the business of office do you know me sir who am i   miss richland dear mr lofty this request is not so much his as mine if my commands  but you despise my power   lofty delicate creature your commands could even control a debate at midnight to a power so constitutional i am all obedience and tranquillity he shall have a letter where is my secretary dubardieu and yet i protest i dont like this way of doing business i think if i spoke first to sir william  but you will have it so  exit with miss richland sir william alone ha ha ha this too is one of my nephews hopeful associates o vanity thou constant deceiver how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us thy false colorings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy i am not displeased at this interview exposing this fellows impudence to the contempt it deserves may be of use to my design at least if he can reflect it will be of use to himself   enter jarvis sir william how now jarvis where is your master my nephew   jarvis at his wits end i believe he is scarce gotten out of one scrape but he is running his head into another   sir william how so   jarvis the house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs and now he is again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old croakers son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister   sir william ever busy to serve others   jarvis aye any body but himself the young couple it seems are just setting out for scotland and he supplies them with money for the journey   sir william money how is he able to

honeywood mr honeywood i am glad to see you abroad again i find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfortunate affairs i had put things in a train to do your business but it is not for me to say

benefactor   lofty how not know the friend that served you   honeywood cannot guess at the person   lofty inquire   honeywood i have but all i can learn is that he chooses to remain concealed and that all inquiry must be fruitless   lofty must be fruitless   honeywood absolutely fruitless   lofty sure of that   honeywood very sure   lofty then i will be damned if you shall ever know it from me   honeywood how sir   lofty i suppose now mr honeywood you think my rentroll very considerable and that i have vast sums of money to throw away i know you do the world to be sure says such things of me   honeywood the world by what i learn is no stranger to your generosity but where does this tend   lofty to nothing nothing in the world the town to be sure when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation has asserted that i never yet patronized a man of merit   honeywood i have heard instances to the contrary even from yourself   lofty yes honeywood and there are instances to the contrary that you shall never hear from myself   honeywood ha dear sir permit me to ask you but one question   lofty sir ask me no questions i say sir ask me no questions i will be damned if i answer them   honeywood i will ask no further my friend my benefactor it is it must be here that i am indebted for freedom for honor yes thou worthiest of men from the beginning i suspected it but was afraid to return thanks which if undeserved might seem reproaches   lofty i protest i dont understand all this mr honeywood you treat me very cavalierly i do assure you sir  blood sir cannot a man be permitted to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings without all this parade   honeywood nay do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honor your looks your air your manner all confess it

my bosom by jupiter   honeywood heavens was ever any thing more unfortunate it is too much to be endured   lofty unfortunate indeed and yet i can endure it till you have opened the affair to her for me between ourselves i think she likes me i am not apt to boast but i think she does   honeywood indeed but do you know the person you apply to   lofty yes i know you are her friend and mine that is enough to you therefore i commit the success of my paffion i will say no more let friendship do the rest i have only to add that if at any time my little interest can be of service  but hang it i will make no promises  you know my interest is yours at any time no apologies my friend i will not be answered it shall be so  exit honeywood open generous unsuspecting man he little thinks that i love her

been my tormentor a friend that has perhaps distressed himself to serve me it shall be so yes i will discard the fondling hope from my bosom and exert all my influence in his favor and yet to see her

into the clouds murder we shall be all burnt in our beds we shall be all burnt in our beds   enter miss richland miss richland lord sir what is the matter   croaker murders the matter we shall be all blown up in our beds before morning   miss richland i hope not sir   croaker what signifies what you hope madam when i have a certificate of it here in my hand will nothing alarm my family sleeping and eating sleeping and eating is the only work from morning till night in my house my insensible crew could sleep though rocked by an earthquake and fry beef steaks at a volcano   miss richland but sir you have alarmed them so often already we have nothing but earthquakes famines plagues and mad dogs from years end to years end you remember sir it is not above a month ago you assured us of a conspiracy among the bakers to poison us in our bread and so kept the whole family a week upon potatoes   croaker and potatoes were too good for them but why do i stand talking here with a girl when i should be facing the enemy without here john nicodemus search the house look into the cellars to see if there be any combustibles below and above in the apartments that no matches be thrown in at the windows let all the fires be put out and let the engine be drawn out in the yard to play upon the house in case of necessity  exit miss richland alone what can he mean by all this yet why should i inquire when he alarms us in this manner almost every day but honeywood has desired an interview with me in private what can he mean or rather what means this palpitation at his approach it is the first time he ever showed any thing in his conduct that seemed particular sure he cannot mean to  but he is here   enter honeywood honeywood i presumed to solicit this interview madam before i left town to be permitted    miss richland indeed leaving town sir    honeywood yes madam perhaps the kingdom i have presumed i say to desire the favor of this interview  in order to disclose something which our long friendship prompts and yet my fears    miss richland his fears what are his fears to mine aside we have indeed been long acquainted sir very long if i remember our first meeting was at the french ambassadors  do you recollect how you were pleased to rally me upon my complexion there   honeywood perfectly madam i presumed to reprove you for painting but your warmer blushes soon convinced the company that the coloring was all from nature   miss richland and yet you only meant it in your goodnatured way to make me pay a compliment to myself in the same manner you danced that night with the most awkward woman in company because you saw nobody else would take her out   honeywood yes and was rewarded the next night by dancing with the finest woman in company whom every body wished to take out   miss richland well sir if you thought so then i fear your judgment has since corrected the errors of a first impression we generally show to most advantage at first our sex are like poor tradesmen that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows   honeywood the first impression madam did indeed deceive me i expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty i expected to find her vain and insolent but every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride and beauty without affectation   miss richland this sir is a style very unusual with mr honeywood and i should be glad to know why he thus attempts to increase that vanity which his own lessons have taught me to despise   honeywood i ask pardon madam yet from our long friendship i presumed i might have some right to offer without offense what you may refuse without offending   miss richland sir i beg you would reflect though i fear i shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours yet you may be precipitate consider sir   honeywood i own my rashness but as i plead the cause of friendship of one who loves  dont be alarmed madam  who loves you with the most ardent passion whose whole happiness is placed in you    miss richland i fear sir i shall never find whom you mean by this description of him   honeywood ah madam it but too plainly points him out though he should be too humble himself to urge his pretensions or you too modest to understand them   miss richland well it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance and i will own sir i have long been prejudiced in his favor it was but natural to wish to make his heart mine as he seemed himself ignorant of its value   honeywood i see she always loved him aside i find madam youre already sensible of his worth his passion how happy is my friend to be the favorite of one with such sense to distinguish merit and such beauty to reward it   miss richland your friend sir what friend   honeywood my best friend  my friend mr lofty madam   miss richland he sir   honeywood yes he madam he is indeed what your warmest wishes might have formed him and to his other qualities he adds that of the most passionate regard for you   miss richland amazement  no more of this i beg you sir   honeywood i see your confusion madam and know how to interpret it and since i so plainly read the language of your heart shall i make my friend happy by communicating your sentiments   miss richland by no means   honeywood excuse me i must i know you desire it   miss richland mr honeywood let me tell you that you wrong my sentiments and yourself when i first applied to your friendship i expected advice and assistance but now sir i see that it is vain to expect happiness from him who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own and that i must disclaim his friendship who ceases to be a friend to himself  exit honeywood how is this she has confessed she loved him and yet she seemed to part in displeasure can i have done any thing to reproach myself with no i believe not yet after all these things should not be done by a third person i should have spared her confusion my friendship carried me a little too far   enter croaker with the letter in his hand and mrs croaker mrs croaker ha ha ha and so my dear it is your supreme wish that i should be quite wretched upon this occasion ha ha   croaker mimicking ha ha ha and so my dear it is your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation   mrs croaker positively my dear what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me our house may travel through the air like the house of loretto for aught i care if i am to be miserable in it   croaker would to heaven it were converted into an house of correction for your benefit have we not every thing to alarm us perhaps this very moment the tragedy is beginning   mrs croaker then let us reserve our distress till the rising of the curtain or give them the money they want and have done with them   croaker give them my money  and pray what right have they to my money   mrs croaker and pray what right then have you to my good humor   croaker and so your good humor advises me to part with my money why then to tell your good humor a piece of my mind i would sooner part with my wife here is mr honeywood see what he will say to it my dear honeywood look at this incendiary letter dropped at my door it will freeze you with terror and yet lovey here can read it  can read it and laugh   mrs croaker yes and so will mr honeywood   croaker if he does i will suffer to be hanged the next minute in the rogues place that is all   mrs croaker speak mr honeywood is there any thing more foolish than my husbands fright upon this occasion   honeywood it would not become me to decide madam but doubtless the greatness of his terrors now will but invite them to renew their villainy another time   mrs croaker i told you he would be of my opinion   croaker how sir do you maintain that i should lie down under such an injury and show neither by my tears or complaints that i have something of the spirit of a man in me   honeywood pardon me sir you ought to make the loudest complaints if you desire redress the surest way to have redress is to be earnest in the pursuit of it   croaker aye whose opinion is he of now   mrs croaker but dont you think that laughing off our fears is the best way   honeywood what is the best madam few can say but i will maintain it to be a very wise way   croaker but we are talking of the best surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field and not wait till he plunders us in our very bedchamber   honeywood why sir as to the best that  that is a very wise way too   mrs croaker but can any thing be more absurd than to double our distresses by our apprehensions and put it in the power of every low fellow that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling to torment us   honeywood without doubt nothing more absurd   croaker how would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake   honeywood without doubt perfectly absurd   croaker then you are of my opinion   honeywood entirely   mrs croaker and you reject mine   honeywood heavens forbid madam no sure no reasoning can be more just than yours we ought certainly to despise malice if we cannot oppose it and not make the incendiarys pen as fatal to our repose as the highwaymans pistol   mrs croaker o then you think i am quite right   honeywood perfectly right   croaker a plague of plagues we cannot be both right i ought to be sorry or i ought to be glad my hat must be on my head or my hat must be off   mrs croaker certainly in two opposite opinions if one be perfectly reasonable the other cannot be perfectly right   honeywood and why may not both be right madam mr croaker in earnestly seeking redress and you in waiting the event with good humor pray let me see the letter again i have it this letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the talbot inn if it be indeed an incendiary letter what if you and i sir go there and when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty seize him   croaker my dear friend it is the very thing the very thing while i walk by the door you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery extort a confession at once and so hang him up by surprise   honeywood yes but i would not choose to exercise too much severity it is my maxim sir that crimes generally punish themselves   croaker well but we may upbraid him a little i suppose ironically   honeywood aye but not punish him too rigidly   croaker well well leave that to my own benevolence   honeywood well i do but remember that universal benevolence is the first law of nature   exeunt honeywood and mrs croaker croaker yes and my universal benevolence will hang the dog if he had as many necks as a hydra   act the fifth scene an inn enter olivia jarvis olivia well we have got safe to the inn however now if the postchaise were ready    jarvis the horses are just finishing their oats and as they are not going to be married they choose to take their own time   olivia you are for ever giving wrong motives to my impatience   jarvis be as impatient as you will the horses must take their own time besides you dont consider we have got no answer from our fellowtraveller yet if we hear nothing from mr leontine we have only one way left us   olivia what way   jarvis the way home again   olivia not so i have made a resolution to go and nothing shall induce me to break it   jarvis aye resolutions are well kept when they jump with inclination however i will go hasten things without and i will call too at the bar to see if any thing should be left for us there dont be in such a plaguey hurry madam and we shall go the faster i promise you   exit jarvis enter landlady landlady what solomon why dont you move pipes and tobacco for the lamb there  will nobody answer to the dolphin quick the angel has been outrageous this half hour did your ladyship call madam   olivia no madam   landlady i find as youre for scotland madam  but that is no business of mine married or not married i ask no questions to be sure we had a sweet little couple set off from this two days ago for the same place the gentleman for a tailor was to be sure as fine a spoken tailor as ever blew froth from a full pot and the young lady so bashful it was near half an hour before we could get her to finish a pint of rasberry between us   olivia but this gentleman and i are not going to be married i assure you   landlady may be not that is no business of mine for certain scotch marriages seldom turn out there was of my own knowledge miss macfag that married her fathers footman  alackaday she and her husband soon parted and now keep separate cellars in hedgelane   olivia a very pretty picture of what lies before me  aside enter leontine leontine my dear olivia my anxiety till you were out of danger was too great to be resisted i could not help coming to see you set out though it exposes us to a discovery   olivia may every thing you do prove as fortunate indeed leontine we have been most cruelly disappointed mr honeywoods bill upon the city has it seems been protested and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed   leontine how an offer of his own too sure he could not mean to deceive us   olivia depend upon his sincerity he only mistook the desire for the power of serving us but let us think no more of it i believe the postchaise is ready by this   landlady not quite yet and begging your ladyships pardon i dont think your ladyship quite ready for the postchaise the north road is a cold place madam i have a drop in the house of as pretty rasberry as ever was tipped over tongue just a thimble full to keep the wind off your stomach to be sure the last couple we had here they said it was a perfect nosegay ecod i sent them both away as good natured  up went the blinds round went the wheels and drive away postboy was the word   enter croaker croaker well while my friend honeywood is upon the post of danger at the bar it must be my business to have an eye about me here i think i know an incendiarys look for wherever the devil makes a purchase he never fails to set his mark ha who have we here my son and daughter what can they be doing here   landlady i tell you madam it will do you good i think i know by this time what is good for the north road it is a raw night madam  sir    leontine not a drop more good madam i should now take it as a greater favor if you hasten the horses for i am afraid to be seen myself   landlady that shall be done wha solomon are you all dead there wha solomon i say  exit bawling olivia well i dread lest an expedition begun in fear should end in repentance  every moment we stay increases our danger and adds to my apprehensions   leontine there is no danger trust me my dear there can be none if honeywood has acted with honor and kept my father as he promised in employment till we are out of danger nothing can interrupt our journey   olivia i have no doubt of mr honeywoods sincerity and even his desires to serve us my fears are from your fathers suspicions a mind so disposed to be alarmed without a cause will be but too ready when there is a reason   leontine why let him when we are out of his power but believe me olivia yon have no great reason to dread his resentment his repining temper as it does no manner of injury to himself so will it never do harm to others he only frets to keep himself employed and scolds for his private amusement   olivia i dont know that but i am sure on some occasions it makes him look most shockingly   croaker discovering himself how does he look now  how does he look now   olivia ah   leontine undone   croaker how do i look now sir i am your very humble servant madam i am yours what you are going off are you then first if you please take a word or two from me with you before you go tell me first where you are going and when you have told me that perhaps i shall know as little as i did before   leontine if that be so our answer might but increase your displeasure without adding to your information   croaker i want no information from you puppy and you too good madam what answer have you got eh a cry without stop him i think i heard a noise my friend honeywood without  has he seized the incendiary ah no for now i hear no more on it   leontine honeywood without then sir it was mr honeywood that directed you hither   croaker no sir it was mr honeywood conducted me hither   leontine is it possible   croaker possible why he is in the house now sir more anxious about me than my own son sir   leontine then sir he is a villain   croaker how sirrah a villain because he takes most care of your father i will not bear it i tell you i will not bear it honeywood is a friend to the family and i will have him treated as such   leontine i shall study to repay his friendship as it deserves   croaker ah rogue if you knew how earnestly he entered into my griefs and pointed out the means to detect them you would love him as i do a cry without stop him fire and fury they have seized the incendiary they have the villain the incendiary in view stop him stop an incendiary a murderer stop him  exit olivia oh my terrors what can this new tumult mean   leontine some new mark i suppose of mr honeywoods sincerity but we shall have satisfaction he shall give me instant satisfaction   olivia it must not be my leontine if you value my esteem or my happiness whatever be our fate let us not add guilt to our misfortunes  consider that our innocence will shortly be all we have left us you must forgive him   leontine forgive him has he not in every instance betrayed us forced me to borrow money from him which appears a mere trick to delay us promised to keep my father engaged till we were out of danger and here brought him to the very scene of our escape   olivia dont be precipitate we may yet be mistaken   enter postboy dragging in jarvis honeywood entering soon after postboy aye master we have him fast enough here is the incendiary dog i am entitled to the reward i will take my oath i saw him ask for the money at the bar and then run for it   honeywood come bring him along let us see him let him learn to blush for his crimes discovering his mistake death what is here jarvis leontine olivia what can all this mean   jarvis why i will tell you what it means that i was an old fool and that you are my master  that is all   honeywood confusion   leontine yes sir i find you have kept your word with me after such baseness i wonder how you can venture to see the man you have injured   honeywood my dear leontine by my life my honor    leontine peace peace for shame and do not continue to aggravate baseness by hypocrisy i know you sir i know you   honeywood why will not you hear me by all that is just i knew not    leontine hear you sir to what purpose i now see through all your low arts your ever complying with every opinion your never refusing any request your friendship as common as a prostitutes favors and as fallacious all these sir have long been contemptible to the world and are now perfectly so to me   honeywood ha contemptible to the world that reaches me aside   leontine all the seeming sincerity of your professions i now find were only allurements to betray and all your seeming regret for their consequences only calculated to cover the cowardice of your heart draw villain   enter croaker out of breath croaker where is the villain where is the incendiary seizing the postboy hold him fast the dog he has the gallows in his face come you dog confess confess all and hang yourself   postboy zounds master what do you throttle me for   croaker beating him  dog do you resist do you resist   postboy zounds master i am not he there is the man that we thought was the rogue and turns out to be one of the company   croaker how   honeywood mr croaker we have all been under a strange mistake here i find there is nobody guilty it was all an error entirely an error of our own   croaker and i say sir that youre in an error for there is guilt and double guilt a plot a damned jesuitical pestilential plot and i must have proof of it   honeywood do but hear me   croaker what you intend to bring em off i suppose i will hear nothing   honeywood madam you seem at least calm enough to hear reason   olivia excuse me   honeywood good jarvis let me then explain it to you   jarvis what signifies explanations when the thing is done   honeywood will nobody hear me was there ever such a set so blinded by passion and prejudice to the postboy my good friend i believe you will be surprised when i assure you    postboy sure me nothing  i am sure of nothing but a good beating   croaker come then you madam if you ever hope for any favor or forgiveness tell me sincerely all you know of this affair   olivia unhappily sir i am but too much the cause of your suspicions you see before you sir one that with false pretenses has stepped into your family to betray it not your daughter    croaker not my daughter   olivia not your daughter  but a mean deceiver  who  support me i cannot    honeywood help she is going give her air   croaker aye aye take the young woman to the air i would not hurt a hair of her head whose ever daughter she may be  not so bad as that neither   exeunt all but croaker croaker yes yes all is out i now see the whole affair my son is either married or going to be so to this lady whom he imposed upon me as his sister aye certainly so and yet i dont find it afflicts me so much as one might think there is the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand we never feel them when they come   enter miss richland and sir william sir william but how do you know madam that my nephew intends setting off from this place   miss richland my maid assured me he was come

upon my arrival at paris and as i had been once her fathers friend i did all in my power to frustrate her guardians base intentions i had even meditated to rescue her from his authority when your son stepped in with more pleasing violence gave her liberty and you a daughter   croaker but i intend to have a daughter of my own choosing sir a young lady sir whose fortune by my interest with those who

friendships and nothing remains henceforward for me but solitude and repentance   miss richland is it true mr honeywood that you are setting off without taking leave of your friends the report is that you are quitting england can it be   honeywood yes madam and though i am so unhappy as to have fallen under your displeasure yet thank heaven i leave you to happiness to one who loves you and deserves

incapable of serving any what happiness can i find but in solitude what hope but in being forgotten   miss richland a thousand to live among friends that esteem you whose happiness it will be to be permitted to oblige you   honeywood no madam my resolution is fixed inferiority among strangers is easy but among those that once were equals insupportable nay to show you how far my resolution can go

yes madam while i was pleading the passion of another my heart was tortured with its own but it is over it was unworthy our friendship and let it be forgotten   miss richland you amaze me   honeywood but you will forgive it i know you will since the confession should not have come from me even now but to convince you of the sincerity of my intention of  never mentioning it more going   miss

lofty let him go on let him go on i say you will find it come to something presently   sir william yes sir i believe you will be amazed if after waiting some time in the antichamber after being surveyed with insolent curiosity by the passing servants i was at last assured that sir william honeywood knew no such person and i must certainly have been imposed upon   lofty good let me die very good ha ha ha   croaker now for my life i cannot find out half the goodness of it   lofty you cannot ha ha   croaker no for the soul of me i think it was as confounded a bad answer as ever was sent from one private gentleman to another   lofty and so you cannot find out the force of the message why i was in the house at that very time ha ha it was i that sent that very answer to my own letter ha ha   croaker indeed how why   lofty in one word things between sir william and me must be behind the curtain a party has many eyes he sides with lord buzzard i side with sir gilbert goose so that unriddles the mystery   croaker and so it does indeed and all my suspicions are over   lofty your suspicions what then you have been suspecting you have been suspecting have you mr croaker you and i were friends we are friends no longer never talk to me it is over i say it is over   croaker as i hope for your favor i did not mean to offend it escaped me dont be discomposed   lofty zounds sir but i am discomposed and will be discomposed to be treated thus who am i was it for this i have been dreaded both by ins and outs have i been libelled in the gazetteer and praised in the st jamess have i been chaired at wildmans and a speaker at merchanttaylors hail have i had my hand to addresses and my head in the printshops and talk to me of suspects   croaker my dear sir be pacified what can you have but asking pardon   lofty sir i will not be pacified  suspects who am i to be used thus have i paid court to men in favor to serve my friends the lords of the treasury sir william honeywood and the rest of the gang and talk to me of suspects who am i i say who am i   sir william since sir you are so pressing for an answer i will tell you who you are a gentleman as well acquainted with politics as with men in power as well acquainted with persons of fashion as with modesty with lords of the treasury as with truth and with all as you are with sir william honeywood i am sir william honeywood  discovering his ensigns of the bath   croaker sir william honeywood   honeywood astonishment my uncle aside   lofty so then my confounded genius has been all this time only leading me up to the garret in order to fling me out of the window   croaker what mr importance and are these your works suspect yon you who have been dreaded by the ins and outs you who have had your hand to addresses and your head stuck up in printshops if you were served right you should have your head stuck up in the pillory   lofty aye stick it where you will for by the lord it cuts but a very poor figure where it sticks at present   sir william well mr croaker i hope you now see how incapable this gentleman is of serving you and how little miss richland has to expect from his influence   croaker aye sir too well i see it and i cannot but say i have had some boding of it these ten days so i am resolved since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune to be satisfied with his choice and not run the hazard of another mr lofty in helping him to a better   sir william i approve your resolution and here they come to receive a confirmation of your pardon and consent   enter mrs croaker jarvis leontine and olivia mrs croaker where is my husband come come lovey you must forgive them jarvis here has been to tell me the whole affair and i say you must forgive them our own was a stolen match you know my dear and we never had any reason to repent of it   croaker i wish we could both say so however this gentleman sir william honeywood has been beforehand with you in obtaining their pardon so if the two poor fools have a mind to marry i think we can tack them together without crossing the tweed for it joining their hands   leontine how blessed and unexpected what what can we say to such goodness but our future obedience shall be the best reply and as for this gentleman to whom we owe    sir william excuse me sir if i interrupt your thanks as i have here an interest that calls me turning to honeywood yes sir you are surprised to see me and i own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither i saw with indignation the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others that easiness of disposition which though inclined to the right had not courage to condemn the wrong i saw with regret those splendid errors that still took name from some neighboring duty your charity that was but injustice your benevolence that was but weakness and your friendship but credulity i saw with regret great talents and extensive learning only employed to add sprightliness to error and increase your perplexities i saw your mind with a thousand natural charms but the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for it is prostitution   honeywood cease to upbraid me sir i have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your reproaches but there is one way still left me yes sir i have determined this very hour to quit for ever a place where i have made myself the voluntary slave of all and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind and marshal all its dissipated virtues yet ere i depart permit me to solicit favor for this gentleman who notwithstanding what has happened has laid me under the most signal obligations mr lofty    lofty mr honeywood i am resolved upon a reformation as well as you i now begin to find that the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than i thought him and to prove that i design to speak truth for the future i must now assure you that you owe your late enlargement to another as upon my soul i had no hand in the matter so now if any of the company has a mind for preferment he may take my place i am determined to resign  exit honeywood how have i been deceived   sir william no sir you have been obliged to a kinder fairer friend for that favor to miss richland would she complete our joy and make the man she has honored by her friendship happy in her love i should then forget all and be as blessed as the welfare of my dearest knisman can make me   miss richland after what is past it would be but affectation to pretend to indifference yes i will own an attachment which i find was more than friendship and if my entreaties cannot alter his resolution to quit the country i will even try if my hand has not power to detain him giving her hand   honeywood heavens how can i have deserved all this how express my happiness my gratitude a moment like this overpays an age of apprehension   croaker well now i see content in every face but heaven send we be all better this day three months  sir william  henceforth nephew learn to respect yourself he who secks only for applause from without has all his happiness in anothers keeping   honeywood yes sir i now too plainly perceive my errors my vanity in attempting to please all by fearing to offend any my meanness in approving folly lest fools should disapprove henceforth therefore it shall be my study to reserve my pity for real distress my friendship for true merit and my love for her who first taught me what it is to be happy   epilogue the

impairing the most unaffected piety  i have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance the undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and mr colman

dress to please you   hardcastle well remember i insist on the terms of our agreement and by the bye i believe i shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening   miss hardcastle i protest sir i dont comprehend your meaning   hardcastle then to be plain with you kate i expect the young gentleman i have chosen to be your busband from town this very day i have his fathers letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after   miss hardcastle indeed i wish i had known something of this before bless me how shall i behave it is a thousand to one i shall not like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that i shall find no room for friendship or esteem   hardcastle depend upon it child i will never control your choice but mr marlow whom i have pitched upon is the son of my old friend sir charles marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often the young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country i am told he is a man of an excellent understanding   miss hardcastle is he   hardcastle very generous   miss hardcastle i believe i shall like him   hardcastle young and brave   miss hardcastle i am sure i shall like him   hardcastle and very handsome   miss hardcastle my dear papa say no more kissing his hand he is mine i will have him   hardcastle and to crown all kate he is one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world   miss hardcastle eh you have frozen me to death again that word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments a reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband   hardcastle on the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues it was the very feature in his character that first struck me   miss hardcastle he must have more striking features to catch me i promise you however if he be so young so handsome and so every thing as you mention i believe he will do still i think i will have him   hardcastle aye kate but there is still an obstacle it is more than an even wager he may not have you   miss hardcastle my dear papa why will you mortisy one so  well if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference i will only break my glass for its flattery set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer   hardcastle bravely resolved in the mean time i will go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first days muster  exit miss hardcastle sola lud this news of papas puts me all in a flutter young handsome these he put last but i put them foremost sensible goodnatured i like all that but then reserved and sheepish that is much against him yet cannot he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife yes and cannot i  but i vow i am disposing of the husband before i have secured the lover   enter miss neville miss hardcastle i am glad youre come neville my dear tell me constance how do i look this evening is there any thing whimsical about me is it one of my well looking days child am i in face today   miss neville perfectly my dear yet now i look again  bless me  sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes has your brother or the cat been meddling or has the last novel been too moving   miss hardcastle no nothing of all this i have been threatened  i can scarce get it out  i have been threatened with a lover   miss neville and his name    miss hardcastle is marlow   miss neville indeed   miss hardcastle the son of sir charles marlow   miss neville as i live the most intimate friend of mr hastings my admirer they are never asunder i believe you must have seen him when we lived in town   miss hardcastle never   miss neville he is a very singular character i assure you among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me   miss hardcastle an odd character indeed i shall never be able to manage him what shall i do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success but how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual   miss neville i have just come from one of our agreeable teteatetes she has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection   miss hardcastle and her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so a fortune like yours is no small temptation besides as she has the sole management of it i am not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family   miss neville a fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation but at any rate if my dear hastings be but constant i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last however i let her suppose that i am in love with her son and me never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another   miss hardcastle my good brother holds out stoutly i could almost love him for hating you so   miss neville it is a goodnatured creature at bottom and i am sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself but my aunts bell rings for our afternoons walk round the

yard and call stoutly about you   hastings sir we are obliged to you the servants cannot miss the way   tony no no but i tell you though the landlord is rich and going to leave off business so he

your pockets roger and from your head you blockhead you see how diggory carries his hands they are a little too stiff indeed but that is no great matter   diggory aye mind how i hold them i learned to hold my hands this way when i was upon drill for the militia and so being upon drill    hardcastle you must not be so talkative diggory you must be all attention to the guests you must hear us talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating   diggory by the laws your worship that is parfectly unpossible whenever diggory sees yeating going forward ecod he is always wishing for a mouthful himself   hardcastle blockhead is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour stay your stomach with that reflection   diggory ecod i thank your worship i will make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry   hardcastle diggory you are too talkative then if i happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company   diggory then ecod your worship must not tell the story of old grouse in the gun room i cannot help laughing at that  he he he  for the soul of me we have laughed at that these twenty years  ha ha ha   hardcastle ha ha ha the story is a good one well honest diggory you may laugh at that  but still remember to be attentive suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave a glass of wine sir if you please to diggory  eh why dont you move   diggory ecod your worship i never have courage till i see the eatables and drinkables brought upo the table and then i am as bauld as a lion   hardcastle what will nobody move   first servant i am not to leave this place   second servant i am sure it is no place of mine   third servant nor mine for sartain   diggory wauns and i am sure it canna be mine   hardcastle you numbskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved o you dunces i find i must begin all over again  but dont i hear a coach drive into the yard to your posts you blockheads i will go in the mean time and give my old friends son a hearty reception at the gate   exit hardcastle diggory by the elevens my place is gone quite out of my head   roger i know that my place is to be every where   first servant where the devil is mine   second servant my pleace is to be no where at all and so ize go about my business   exeunt servants running about as if frighted different ways enter servant with candles showing in marlow and hastings servant welcome gentlemen very welcome this way   hastings after the disappointments of the day welcome once more charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable   marlow the usual fate of a large mansion having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn   hastings as you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries i have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly   marlow travelers george must pay in all places the only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved   hastings you have lived pretty much among them in truth i have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requite share of assurance   marlow the englishmans malady but tell me george where ould i have learned that assurance you talk of my life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence i dont know that i was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman  except my mother  but among females of another class you know    hastings aye among them you are impudent enough of all conscience   marlow they are of us you know   hastings but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room   marlow why man that is because i do want to steal out of the room faith i have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate but i dont know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution an impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but i will be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence   hastings if you could but say half the fine things to them that i have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker    marlow why george i cannot say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me they may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle but to me a modest woman dressed out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation   hastings ha ha ha at this rate man how can you ever expect to marry   marlow never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy if indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured but to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me no no that is a strain much above me i assure you   hastings i pity you but how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father   marlow as i behave to all other ladies bow very low answer yes or no to all her demands  but for the rest i dont think i shall venture to look in her face till i see my fathers again   hastings i am surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover   marlow to be explicit my dear hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own miss neville loves you the family dont know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honor do the rest   hastings my dear marlow but i will suppress the emotion were i a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world i would apply to for assistance but miss nevilles person is all i ask and that is mine both from her deceased fathers consent and her own inclination   marlow happy man you have talents and art to captivate any woman i am doomed to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it i despise this stammer in my address and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliners prentice or one of the duchesses of drury lane pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us   enter hardcastle hardcastle gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome which is mr marlow sir youre heartily welcome it is not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire i like to give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate i like to see their horses and trunks taken care of   marlow aside he has got our names from the servants already to him we approve your caution and hospitality sir to hastings i have been thinking george of changing our traveling dresses in the morning i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine   hardcastle i beg mr marlow you will use no ceremony in this house   hastings i fancy george youre right the first blow is half the battle i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold   hardcastle mr marlow  mr hastings  gentlemen  pray be under no constraint in this house this is libertyhall gentlemen you may do just as you please here   marlow yet george if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over i think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat   hardcastle your talking of a retreat mr marlow puts me in wind of the duke of marlborough when we went to besiege denain he first summoned the garrison   marlow dont you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown   hardcastle he first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men    hastings i think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly   hardcastle i say gentlemen as i was telling you he summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men    marlow the girls like finery   hardcastle which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war now says the duke of marlborough to george brooks that stood next to him  you must have heard of george brooks  i will pawn my dukedom says he but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood so    marlow what my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigor   hardcastle punch sir aside this is the most unaccountable kind of modesty i ever met with   marlow yes sir punch a glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable this is libertyhall you know   hardcastle here is cup sir   marlow aside so this fellow in his libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases   hardcastle taking the cup i hope you will find it to your mind i have prepared it with my own hands and i believe you will own the ingredients are tolerable will you be so good as to pledge me sir here mr marlow here is to our better acquaintance drinks   marlow aside a very impudent fellow this but he is a character and i will humor him a little sir my service to you drinks   hastings aside i see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that he is an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman   marlow from the excellence of your cup my old friend i suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country warm work now and then at elections i suppose   hardcastle no sir i have long given that work over since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business for us that sell ale   hastings so then you have no turn for politics i find   hardcastle not in the least there was a time indeed i fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better i left it to mend itself since that i no more trouble my head about heyder ally or ally cawn than about ally croaker sir my service to you   hastings so that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it   hardcastle i do stir about a great deal that is certain half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour   marlow after drinking and you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in westminster hall   hardcastle aye young gentleman that and a little philosophy   marlow aside well this is the first time i ever heard of an innkeepers philosophy   hastings so then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter if you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this here is your health my philosopher drinks   hardcastle good very good thank you ha ha your generalship puts me in mind of prince eugene when he fought the turks at the battle of belgrade you shall hear   marlow instead of the battle of belgrade i believe it is almost time to talk about supper what has your philosophy got in the house for supper   hardcastle for supper sir aside was ever such a request to a man in his own house   marlow yes sir supper sir i begin to feel an appetite i shall make devilish work tonight in the larder i promise you   hardcastle aside such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld to him why really sir as for supper i cannot well tell my dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them i leave these kind of things entirely to then   marlow yon do do you   hardcastle entirely bythebye i believe they are in actual consultation upon what is for supper this moment in the kitchen   marlow then i beg they will admit me as one of their privy council it is a way i have got when i travel i always choose to regulate my own supper let the cook be called no offense i hope sir   hardcastle o no sir none in the least yet i dont know how our bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house   hastings let us see your list of the larder then i ask it as a favor i always match my appetite to my bill of fare   marlow to hardcastle who looks at them with surprise sir he is very right and it is my way too   hardcastle sir you have a right to command here here roger bring us the bill of fare for tonights supper i believe it is drawn out your manner mr hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel wallop it was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it   hastings aside all upon the high ropes his uncle a colonel we shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace but let us hear the bill of fare   marlow perusing what is here for the first course for the second course for the desert the devil sir do you think we have brought down the whole joiners company or the corporation of bedford to eat up such a supper two or three little things clean and comfortable will do   hastings but let us hear it   marlow reading for the first course at the top a pig and pruin sauce   hastings damn your pig i say   marlow and damn your pruin sauce say i   hardcastle and yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with pruin sauce is very good eating   marlow at the bottom a calves tongue and brains   hastings let your brains be knocked out my good sir i dont like them   marlow or you may clap them on a plate by themselves   hardcastle aside their impudence confounds me to them gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please is there any thing else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen   marlow item a pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tiff  taff  taffety cream   hastings confound your made dishes i shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassadors table i am for plain eating   hardcastle i am sorry gentlemen that i have nothing you like but if there be any thing you have a particular fancy to    marlow why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another send us what you please so much for supper and now to see that our beds are aird and properly taken care of   hardcastle i entreat you will leave all that to me you shall not stir a step   marlow leave that to you i protest sir you must excuse me i always look to these things myself   hardcastle i must insist sir you will make yourself easy on that head   marlow you see i am resolved on it aside a very troublesome fellow this as ever i met with   hardcastle well sir i am resolved at least to attend you aside this may be modern modesty but i never saw any thing look so like oldfashioned impudence   exeunt marlow and hardcastle hastings solus so i find this fellows civilities begin to grow troublesome but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ha what do i see miss neville by all that is happy   enter miss neville miss neville my dear hastings to what unexpected good fortune to what accident am i to ascribe this happy meeting   hastings rather let me ask the same question as i could never have hoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn   miss neville an inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here what could induce you to think this house an inn   hastings my friend mr marlow with whom i came down and i have been sent here as to an inn i assure you a young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither   miss neville certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousins tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha   hastings he whom your aunt intends for you he of whom i have such just apprehensions   miss neville you have nothing to fear from him i assure you you would adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me my aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest   hastings thou dear dissembler you must know my constance i have just seized this happy opportunity of my friends visit here to get admittance into the family the horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but they will soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings we shall soon be landed in france where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected   miss neville i have often told you that though ready to obey you i yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance the greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the india director and chiefly consists in jewels i have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them i fancy i am very near succeeding the instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours   hastings perish the baubles your person is all i desire in the mean time my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake i know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instanly quit die house before our plan was ripe for execution   miss neville but how shall we keep him in the deception miss hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive him  this this way    they confer enter marlow marlow the assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing my host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back they talk of coming to sup with us too and then i suppose we are to run the gauntlet through all the rest of the family  what have we got here    hastings my dear charles let me congratulate you  the most fortunate accident  who do you think is just alighted   marlow cannot guess   hastings our mistresses boy miss hardcastle and miss neville give me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your acquaintance happening to dine in the neighborhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here miss hardcastle has just stepped into the next room and will be back in an instant was not it lucky eh   marlow aside i have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment   hastings well but wasnt it the most fortunate thing in the world   marlow oh yes very fortunate  a most joyful encounter  but our dresses george you know are in disorder  what if we should postpone the happiness till tomorrow  tomorrow at her own house  it will be every bit as convenient  and rather more respectful  tomorrow let it be offering to go   miss neville by no means sir your ceremony will displease her the disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her   marlow o the devil how shall i support it hem hem hastings you must not go you are to assist me you know i shall be confoundedly ridiculous yet hang it i will take courage hem   hastings pshaw man it is but the first plunge and all is over she is but a woman you know   marlow and of all women she that i dread most to encounter   enter miss hardcastle as returned from walking a bonnet etc hastings introducing them miss hardcastle mr marlow i am proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other   miss hardcastle aside now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner after a pause in which be appears very uneasy and disconcerted i am glad of your safe arrival sir  i am told you had some accidents by the way   marlow only a few madam yes we had some yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorry  madam  or rather glad of any accidents  that are so agreeably concluded hem   hastings to him you never spoke better in your whole life keep it up and i will insure you the victory   miss hardcastle i am afraid you flatter sir you that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country   marlow gathering courage i have lived indeed in the world madam but i have kept very little company i have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it   miss neville but that i am told is the way to enjoy it at last   hastings to him cicero never spoke better once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever   marlow to him hem stand by me then and when i am down throw in a word or two to set me up again   miss hardcastle an observer like you upon life were i fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve   marlow pardon me madam i was always willing to be amused the folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness   hastings to him bravo bravo never spoke so well in your whole life well miss hardcastle i see that you and mr marlow are going to be very good company i believe our being here will but embarrass the interview   marlow not in the least mr hastings we like your company of all things to him zounds george sure you will not go how can you leave us   hastings our presence will but spoil conversation so well retire to the next room to him yon dont consider man that we are to manage a little teteatete of our own   exeunt miss hardcastle after a pause i but you have not been wholly an observer i presume sir the ladies i should hope have employed some part of your addresses   marlow relapsing into timidity pardon me madam i  i  i  as yet have studied  only  to  deserve them   miss hardcastle and that some say is the very worst way to obtain them   marlow perhaps so madam but i love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex  but i am afraid i grow tiresome   miss hardcastle not at all sir there is nothing i like so much as grave conversation myself i could hear it for ever indeed i have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart   marlow it is  a disease  of the mind madam in the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relish  for  um  a  um   miss hardcastle i understand you sir there must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting   marlow my meaning madam but infinitely better expressed and i cannot help observing  a    miss hardcastle aside who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon such occasions to him you were going to observe sir    marlow i was observing madam  i protest madam i forget what i was going to observe   miss hardcastle aside i vow and so do i to him you were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy sir   marlow yes madam in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do not  a  a  a    miss hardcastle i understand you perfectly sir   marlow aside egad and that is more than i do myself   miss hardcastle you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practice in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it   marlow true madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms but i am sure i tire you madam   miss hardcastle not in the least sir there is something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and force  pray sir go on   marlow yes madam i was saying  that there are some occasions  when a total want of courage madam destroys all the  and puts us  upon a  a  a    miss hardcastle i agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel i beg you will proceed   marlow yes madam morally speaking madam  but i see miss neville expecting us in the next room i would not intrude for the world   miss hardcastle i protest sir i never was more agreeably entertained in all my life pray go on   marlow yes madam i was  but she beckons us to join her madam shall i do myself the honor to attend you   miss hardcastle well then i will follow   marlow aside this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me  exit miss hardcastle sola ha ha ha was there ever such a sober sentimental interview i am certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too he has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance if i could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of service but who is that somebody  that faith is a question i can scarce answer  exit enter tony and miss neville followed by mrs hardcastle and hastings tony what do you follow me for cousin con i wonder youre not ashamed to be so very engaging   miss neville i hope cousin one may speak to ones own relations and not be to blame   tony aye but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it will not do i tell you cousin con it will not do so i beg you will keep your distance i want no nearer relationship  she follows coquetting him to the back scene   mrs hardcastle well i vow mr hastings you are very entertaining there is nothing in the world i love to talk of so much as london and the fashions though i was never there myself   hastings never there you amaze me from your air and manner i conclude you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh st jamess or tower wharf   mrs hardcastle o sir youre only pleased to say so we country persons can have no manner at all i am in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighboring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the pantheon the grotto gardens the borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort all i can do is to enjoy london at secondhand i take care to know every teteatete from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss rickets of crookedlane pray how do you like this head mr hastings   hastings extremely elegant and degagee upon my word madam your friseur is a frenchman i suppose   mrs hardcastle i protest i dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year   hastings indeed such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady mayress at a city ball   mrs hardcastle i vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd   hastings but that can never be your case madam in any dress bowing   mrs hardcastle yet what signifies my dressing when i have such a piece of antiquity by my side as mr hardcastle all i can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes i have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaster it over like my lord pately with powder   hastings you are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old   mrs hardcastle but what do you think his answer was why with his usual gothic vivacity he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tete for my own wearing   hastings intolerable at your age you may wear what you please and it must become you   mrs hardcastle pray mr hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town   hastings some time ago forty was all the mode but i am told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter   mrs hardcastle seriously then i shall be too young for the fashion   hastings no lady begins now to put on jewels till she is past forty for instance miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers   mrs hardcastle and yet mrs niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all   hastings your niece is she and that young gentleman a brother of yours i should presume   mrs hardcastle my son sir they are contracted to each other observe their little sports they fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already to them well tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening   tony i have been saying no soft things but that it is very hard to be followed about so ecod i have not a place in the house now that is left to myself but the stable   mrs hardcastle never mind him con my dear he is in another story behind your back   miss neville there is something generous in my cousins manner he falls out before faces to be forgiven in private   tony that is a damned confounded  crack   mrs hardcastle ah he is a sly one dont you think they are like each other about the month mr hastings the blenkinsop mouth to a t they are of a size too back to back my pretties that mr hastings may see you come tony   tony you had as good not make me i tell you  measuring   miss neville o lud he has almost cracked my head   mrs hardcastle o the monster for shame tony you a man and behave so   tony if i am a man let me have my fortin ecod i will not be made a fool of no longer   mrs hardcastle is this ungrateful boy all that i am to get for the pains i have taken in your education i that have rocked yon in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon did not i work that waistcoat to make you genteel did not i prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating   tony ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since i was born i have gone through every receipt in the complete housewife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through quincy next spring but ecod i tell you i will not be made a fool of no longer   mrs hardcastle was not it all for your good viper was not it all for your good   tony i wish you would let me and my good alone then snubbing this way when i am in spirits if i am to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so   mrs hardcastle that is false i never see you when youre in spirits no tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel i am never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster   tony ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two   mrs hardcastle was ever the like but i see he wants to break my heart i see he does   hastings dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little i am certain i can persuade him to his duty   mrs hardcastle well i must retire come constance my love you see mr hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy   exeunt mrs hardcastle and miss neville hastings tony tony singing there was a young man riding by and fain would have his will rang do didlo dee  dont mind her let her cry it is the comfort of her heart i have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry   hastings then youre no friend to the ladies i find my pretty young gentleman   tony that is as i find um   hastings not to her of your mothers choosing i dare answer and yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl   tony that is because you dont know her as well as i ecod i know every inch about her and there is not a more bitter cantanckerous toad in all christendom   hastings aside pretty encouragement this for a lover   tony i have seen her since the height of that she has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first days breaking   hastings to me she appears sensible and silent   tony aye before company but when she is with her playmate she is as loud as a hog in a gate   hastings but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me   tony yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and youre flung in a ditch   hastings well but you must allow her a little beauty  yes you must allow her some beauty   tony bandbox she is all a made up thing mum ah could you but see bet bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty ecod she has two eyes as black as stoes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion she would make two of she   hastings well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands   tony anon   hastings would you thank him that would take miss neville and leave you to happiness and your dear betsy   tony aye but where is there such a friend for who would take her   hastings i am he if you but assist me i will engage to whip her off to france and you shall never hear more of her   tony assist you ecod i will to the last drop of my blood i will clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may be get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of   hastings my dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit   tony come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me  singing  we are the boys  that fears no noise  where the thundering cannons roar   exeunt act the third enter hardcastle solus hardcastle what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town to me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue he has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already he took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of i am desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter  she will certainly be shocked at it   enter miss hardcastle plainly dressed hardcastle well my kate i see you have changed your dress as i bid you and yet i believe there was no great occasion   miss hardcastle i find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that i take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety   hardcastle and yet kate i sometimes give you some cause particularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today   miss hardcastle you taught me to expect something extraordinary and i find the original exceeds the description   hardcastle i was never so surprised in my life he has quite confounded all my faculties   miss hardcastle i never saw any thing like it and a man of the world too   hardcastle aye he learned it all abroad  what a fool was i to think a young man could learn modesty by traveling he might as soon learn wit at a masquerade   miss hardcastle it seems all natural to him   hardcastle a good deal assisted by bad company and a french dancing master   miss hardcastle sure you mistake papa a french dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid look  that awkward address  that bashful manner    hardcastle whose look whose manner child   miss hardcastle mr marlows his mauvaise honte his timidity struck me at the first sight   hardcastle then your first sight deceived you for i think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses   miss hardcastle sure sir you rally i never saw any one so modest   hardcastle and can you be serious i never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since i was born bully dawson was but a fool to him   miss hardcastle surprising he met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground   hardcastle he met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again   miss hardcastle he treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam i would not for the world detain you   hardcastle he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when i was in my best story of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene he asked if i had not a good hand at making punch yes kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch   miss hardcastle one of us must certainly be mistaken   hardcastle if he be what he he has shown himself i am determined he shall never have my consent   miss hardcastle and if he be the fullen thing i take him he shall never have mine   hardcastle in one thing then we are agreed  to reject him   miss hardcastle yes but upon conditions for if you should find him less impudent and i more presuming if you find him more respectful and i more importunate  i dont know  the fellow is well enough for a man  certainly we dont meet many such at a horse race in the country   hardcastle if we should find him so  but that is impossible the first appearance has done my business i am seldom deceived in that   miss hardcastle and yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance   hardcastle aye when a girl finds a fellows outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture with her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue   miss hardcastle i hope sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense will not end with a sneer at my understanding   hardcastle pardon me kate but if young mr brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps   miss hardcastle and as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries   hardcastle agreed but depend on it i am in the right   miss hardcastle and depend on it i am not much in the wrong   exeunt enter tony running in with a casket tony ecod i have got them here they are my cousin cons necklaces bobs and all my mother shall not

most delicate way at least of obtaining them   tony well keep them till you know how it will be but i know how it will be well enough she would as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head

miss hardcastle what an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine to send them to the house as an inn ha ha i dont wonder at his impudence   maid but what is more madam the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress asked me if you were the barmaid he mistook you for the barmaid madam   miss hardcastle did he then as i live i am resolved to keep up the delusion tell me pimple how do you like my present dress dont you think i look something like cherry in the beaux stratagem   maid it is the dress madam that every lady wears is the country but when she visits or receives company   miss hardcastle and are you sure he does not remember my face or person   maid certain of it   miss hardcastle i vow i thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me   maid but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake   miss hardcastle in the first place i shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market then i shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that is no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex but my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giants force before i offer to combat   maid but are you sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person   miss hardcastle never fear me i think i have got the true barcant

malicious eye yes yes my dear i did call have you got any of your  a  what do you call it in the house   miss hardcastle no sir we have been out of that these ten days   marlow one may call in this house i find to very little purpose suppose i should call for a taste just by way of trial of the nectar of your lips perhaps i might be disappointed in that too   miss hardcastle nectar nectar that is a liquor there is no call for in those parts french i suppose we keep no french wines here sir   marlow of true english growth i assure you   miss hardcastle then it is odd i should not know it we brew all sorts of wines in this house and i have lived here these eighteen years   marlow eighteen years why one would think child you kept the bar before you were born how old are you   miss hardcastle o sir i must not tell my age they say women and music should never be dated   marlow to guess at this distance you cannot be much above forty approaching yet nearer i dont think so much approaching by coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed  attempting to kiss her   miss hardcastle pray sir keep your distance one would think you wanted to know ones age as they do horses by mark of mouth   marlow i protest child you use me extremely ill if you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and i can ever be acquainted   miss hardcastle and who wants to be acquainted with you i want no such acquaintance not i i am sure you did not treat miss hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner i will warrant me before her you looked dashed and kept bowing to the ground and talked for all the word as if you was before a justice of peace   marlow aside egad she has hit it sure enough to her in awe of her child s ha ha ha a mere awkward squinting thing no no i find you dont know me i laughed and rallied her a little but i was unwilling to be too severe no i could not be too severe curse me   miss hardcastle o then sir you are a favorite i find among the ladies   marlow yes my dear a great favorite and yet hang me i dont see what they find in me to follow at the ladies club in town i am called their agreeable rattle

their work or their family   marlow aside all is well she dont laugh at me to her do you ever work child   miss hardcastle aye sure there is not a screen or a quilt in the whole house but what can bear witness to that   marlow odso then you must show me your embroidery i embroider and draw patterns myself a little if you want a judge of your work you must apply to me seizing her hand   miss hardcastle aye but the colors do not look well by candlelight you shall see all in the morning  struggling   marlow and why not now my angel such beauty fires beyond the power of resistance  pshaw the father here my old luck i never nicked seven that i did not throw ames ace three times following   exit marlow enter hardcastle who stands in surprise hardcastle so madam so i find this is your modest lover this is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only adored at humble distance kate kate art thou not ashamed to deceive your father so   miss hardcastle never trust me dear papa but he is still the modest man i first took him for you will be convinced of it as well as i   hardcastle by the hand of my body i believe his impudence is infectious didnt i see him seize your hand didnt i see him hawl you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth   miss hardcastle but if i shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age i hope you will forgive him   hardcastle the girl would actually make one run mad i tell you i will not be convinced i am convinced he has scarce been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives you may like his impudence and call it modesty but my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications   miss hardcastle sir i ask but this night to convince you   hardcastle you shall not have half the time for i have thoughts of turning him out this very hour   miss hardcastle give me that hour then and i hope to satisfy you   hardcastle well an hour let it be then but i will have no trifling with your father all fair and open do you mind me   miss hardcastle i hope sir you have

few hours after his son   hastings then my constance all must be completed before he arrives he knows me and should he find me here would discover my name and perhaps my designs to the rest of the family   miss neville the jewels i hope are safe   hastings yes yes i have sent them to marlow who keeps the keys of our baggage in the mean time i will go to prepare matters for our elopement i have had the squires promise of a fresh pair of horses and if i should not see him again will write him further directions  exit miss neville well success attend you in the mean time i will go amuse my aunt with the old pretense of a violent passion for my cousin  exit enter marlow followed by a servant marlow i wonder what hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place i have is the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor have you deposited the casket with the landlady as i ordered you have you put it into her own hands   servant yes your honor   marlow she said she would keep it safe did she   servant yes she said she would keep it safe enough she asked me how i came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself   exit servant marlow ha ha ha they are safe however what an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst this little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family she is mine she must be mine or i am greatly mistaken   enter hastincs hastings bless me i quite forgot to tell her that i intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden marlow here and in spirits too   marlow give me joy george crown me shadow me with laurels well george after all we modest fellows dont want for success among the women   hastings some women you mean but what success has your honors modesty been crowned with now that it grows so insolent upon us   marlow didnt you see the tempting brisk lovely little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle   hastings well and what then   marlow she is mine you rogue you such fire such motion such eyes such lips  but egad she would not let me kiss them though   hastings but are you so sure so very sure of her   marlow why man she talked of showing me her work above stairs and i am to improve the pattern   hastings but how can you charles go about to rob a woman of her honor   marlow pshaw pshaw we all know the honor of the barmaid of an inn i dont intend to rob her take my word for it there is nothing in this house i shall not honestly pay for   hastings i believe the girl has virtue   marlow and if she has i should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it   hastings you have taken care i hope of the casket i sent you to lock up it is in safety   marlow yes yes it is safe enough i have taken care of it but how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety ah numbskull i have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourself  i have    hastings what   marlow i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you   hastings to the landlady   marlow the landlady   hastings you did   marlow i did she is to be answerable for its forthcoming you know   hastings yes she will bring it forth with a witness   marlow was not i right i believe you will allow that i acted prudently upon this occasion   hastings aside he must not see my uneasiness   marlow you seem a little disconcerted though methinks sure nothing has happened   hastings no nothing never was in better spirits in all my life and so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge   marlow rather too readily for she nor only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too ha ha ha   hastings he he he they are safe however   marlow as a guinea in a misers purse   hastings aside so now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without it to him well charles i will leave you to your meditations on the pretty barmaid and he he he may you be as successful for yourself as you have been for me  exit marlow thank ye george i ask no more ha ha ha   enter hardcastle hardcastle i no longer know my own house it is turned all topseyturvey his servants have got drunk already i will bear it no longer and yet from my respect for his father i will be calm to him mr marlow your servant i am your very humble servant  bowing low   marlow sir your humble servant aside what is to be the wonder now   hardcastle i believe sir you must be sensible sir that no man alive ought to be more welcome than your fathers son sir i hope you think so   marlow i do from my soul sir i dont want much entreaty i generally make my fathers son welcome wherever he goes   hardcastle i believe you do from my soul sir but though i say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is unsufferable their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house i assure you   marlow i protest my very good sir that is no fault of mine if they dont drink as they ought they are to blame i ordered them not to spare the cellar i did i assure you to the side scene here let one of my servants come up to him my positive directions were that as i did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below   hardcastle then they had your orders for what they do i am satisfied   marlow they had i assure you you shall hear from one of themselves   enter servant drunk marlow you jeremy come forward sirrah what were my orders were you not told to

distracted if i contain myself any longer mr marlow sir i have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours and i see no likelihood of its coming to an end i am now resolved to be master here sir and i desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly   marlow leave your house  sure you jest my good friend what when i am doing what i can to please you   hardcastle i tell you sir you dont please me so i desire you will leave my house   marlow sure you cannot be serious at this time onight and such a night you only mean to banter me   hardcastle i tell you sir i am serious and now that my passions are rouzed i say this house is mine sir this house is mine and i command you to leave it directly   marlow ha ha ha a puddle in a storm i shall not stir a step i assure you in a serious tone this your house fellow it is my house this is my house mine while i choose to stay what right have you to bid me to leave this house sir i never met with such impudence curse me never in my whole life before   hardcastle nor i confound me if ever i did to come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me this house is mine sir by all that is impudent it makes me laugh ha ha ha pray sir bantering as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture there is a pair of silver candlesticks and there is a firescreen and here is a pair of brazen nosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them   marlow bring me your bill sir bring me your bill and let us make no more words about it   hardcastle there are a set of prints too what think you of the rakes progress for your own apartment   marlow bring me your bill i say and i will leave

particular slumbers after a hearty meal   marlow zounds bring me my bill i say and let us hear no more on it   hardcastle young man young man from your fathers letter to me i was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now i find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it  exit marlow how is this sure i have not mistaken the house every thing looks like an inn the servants cry coming the attendance is awkward the barmaid too to attend us but she is here and will further inform me whither so fast child a word with you   enter miss hardcastle miss hardcastle let it be short then i am in a hurry aside i believe he begins to find out his mistake but it is too soon quite to undeceive him   marlow pray child answer me one question what are you and what may your business in this house be   miss hardcastle a relation of the family sir   marlow what a poor relation   miss hardcastle yes sir a poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them   marlow that is you act as the barmaid of this inn   miss hardcastle inn o law  what brought that in your head one of the best families in the county keep an inn ha ha ha old mr hardcastles house an inn   marlow mr hardcastles house is this house mr hardcastles house child   miss hardcastle aye sure whose else should it be   marlow so then all is out and i have been damnably imposed on o confound my stupid head i shall be laughed at over the whole town i shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops the dullissimo maccaroni to mistake this house of all others for an inn and my fathers old friend for an innkeeper what a swaggering puppy must he take me for what a silly puppy do i find myself there again may i be hanged my dear but i mistook you for the barmaid   miss hardcastle dear me dear me i am sure there is nothing in my behavior to put me upon a level with one of that stamp   marlow nothing my dear nothing but i was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber my stupidity saw every thing the wrong way i mistook your affiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement but its over  this house i no more show my face in   miss hardcastle i hope sir i have done nothing to disoblige you i am sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me i am sure i should be sorry pretending to cry if he left the family upon my account i am sure i should be sorry people said any thing amiss since i have no fortune but my character   marlow aside by heaven she weeps this is the first mark of tenderness i ever had from a modest woman and it touches me to her excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family i leave with reluctance but to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education make an honorable connection impossible and i can never harbor a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honor of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely   miss hardcastle aside generous man i now begin to admire him to him but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastles and though i am poor that is no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment i never thought that it was bad to want fortune   marlow and why now my pretty simplicity   miss hardcastle because it puts me at a distance from one that if i had a thousand pound i would give it all to   marlow aside this simplicity bewitches me so that if i stay i am undone i must make one bold effort and leave her to her your partiality in my favor my dear touches me most sensibly and were i to live for myself alone i could easily fix my choice but i owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so that  i can scarcely speak it  it affects me farewell  exit miss hardcastle i never knew half his merit till now he shall not go if i have power or art to detain him i will still preserve the character in which i stooped to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution  exit enter tony miss neville tony aye you may steal for yourselves the next time i have done my duty she has got the jewels again that is a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants   miss neville but my dear cousin sure you will not forsake us in this distress if she in the least suspects that i am going off i shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt pedigrees which is ten times worse   tony to be sure aunts of all kinds are damned bad things but what can i do i have got you a pair of horses that will fly like whistlejacket and i am sure you cannot say but i have courted you nicely

baskets   marlow as for him he is below resentment but your conduct mr hastings requires an explanation you knew of my mistakes yet would not undeceive me   hastings tortured as i am with my own

ill nature lies before me i am sure it would convert your resentment into pity   marlow i am so distracted with a variety of passions that i dont know what i do forgive me madam george forgive me you know my hasty temper and should not exasperate it   hastings the torture of my situation is my only excuse   miss neville well my dear hastings if you have that esteem for me that i think that i am sure you have your constancy for three years will but increase the happiness of our future connection if    mrs hardcastle within miss neville constance why constance i say   miss neville i am coming

folly what might be amusement to you is here disappointment and even distress   tony from a reverie ecod i have hit it it is here your hands yours and yours my poor sulky my boots there ho meet me two hours hence at the bottom of the garden and if you dont find tony lumpkin a more goodnatured fellow than you thought for i will give you leave to take my best horse and bet bouncer into the bargain come along my boots ho   exeunt act the fifth scene continues enter hastings and servant hastings you saw the old lady and miss neville drive off you say   servant yes your honor they went off in a post coach and the young squire went on horseback they are thirty miles off by this time   hastings then all my hopes are over   servant yes sir old sir charles is arrived he and the old gentleman of the house have been laughing at mr marlows mistake this half hour they are coming this way   hastings then i must not be seen so now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden this is about the time  exit enter sir charles and hardcastle hardcastle ha ha ha the peremptory tone in which be sent forth his sublime commands   sir charles and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your advances   hardcastle and yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too   sir charles yes dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha   hardcastle well i am in too good spirits to think of any thing but joy yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughters fortune is but small    sir charles why dick will you talk of fortune to me my son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it if they like each other as you say they do    hardcastle if man i tell you they do like each other my daughter as good as told me so   sir charles but girls are apt to flatter themselves you know   hardcastle i saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs i warrant him   enter marlow marlow i come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct i can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion   hardcastle tut boy a trifle you take it too gravely an hour or twos laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again she will never like you the worse for it   marlow sir i shall be always proud of her approbation   hardcastle approbation is but a cold word mr marlow if i am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts you take me   marlow really sir i have not that happiness   hardcastle come boy i am an old fellow and know what is what as well as you that are younger i know what has past between you but mum   marlow sure sir nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers you dont think sir that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family   hardcastle impudence no i dont say that  not quite imprudence  though girls like to be played with and rumpled a little too sometimes but she has told no tales i assure you   marlow i never gave her the slightest cause   hardcastle well well i like modesty in its place well enough but this is overacting young gentleman you may be open your father and i will like you the better for it   marlow may i die sir if i ever    hardcastle i tell you she dont dislike you and as i am sure you like her    marlow dear sir  i protestsir    hardcastle i see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you   marlow but hear me sir    hardcastle your father approves the match i admire it every moments delay will be doing mischief so    marlow but why will not you hear me by all that is just and true i never gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection we had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting   hardcastle aside this fellows formal modest impudence is beyond bearing   sir charles and you never grasped her hand or made any protestations   marlow as heaven is my witness i came down in obedience to your commands i saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance i hope you will exact no further proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many mortifications  exit sir charles i am astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted   hardcastle and i am astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance   sir charles i dare pledge my life and honor upon his truth   hardcastle here comes my daughter and i would stake my happiness upon her veracity   enter miss hardcastle hardcastle kate come hither child answer us sincerely and without reserve has mr marlow made you any professions of love and affection   miss hardcastle the question is very abrupt sir but since you require unreserved sincerity i think he has   hardcastle to sir charles you see   sir charles and pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview   miss hardcastle yes sir several   hardcastle to sir charles you see   sir charles but did he profess any attachment   miss hardcastle a lasting one   sir charles did he talk of love   miss hardcastle much sir   sir charles amazing and all this formally   miss hardcastle formally   hardcastle now my friend i hope you are satisfied   sir charles and how did he behave madam   miss hardcastle as most professed admirers do said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture   sir charles now i am perfectly convinced indeed i know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive this forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and i am confident he never sat for the picture   miss hardcastle then what sir if i should convince you to your face of my sincerity if you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person   sir charles agreed and if i find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end  exit miss hardcastle and if you dont find him what i describe  i fear my happiness must never have a beginning   exeunt scene changes to the back of the garden enter hastings hastings what an idiot am i to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me he never intended to be punctual and i will wait no longer what do i see it is he and perhaps with news of my constance   enter tony booted and spattered hastings my honest squire i now find you a man of your word this looks like friendship   tony aye i am your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all this riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome it has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach   hastings but how where did you leave your fellow travelers are they in safety are they housed   tony five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving the poor beasts have smoaked for it rabbet me but i would rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment   hastings well but where have you left the ladies i die with impatience   tony left them why where should i leave them but where i found them   hastings this is a riddle   tony riddle me this then what is that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house   hastings i am still astray   tony why that is it mon i have led them astray by jingo there is not a pond or slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of   hastings ha ha ha i understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward and so you have at last brought them home again   tony you shall hear i first took them down featherbedlane where we stuck fast in the mud i then rattled them crack over the stones of upanddown hill  i then introduced them to the gibbet on heavytree heath and from that with a circumbendibus i fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden   hastings but so accident i hope   tony no no only mother is confoundedly frightened she thinks herself fortymiles off she is sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl so if your own horses be ready you may whip off with coufin and i will be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you   hastings my dear friend how can i be gratesul   tony aye now its dear friend noble squire just now it was all idiot cub and run me through the guts damn your way of fighting i say after we take a knock in this part of the country we kiss and be friends but if you had run me through the guts then i should be dead and you might go kiss the hangman   hastings the rebuke is just but i must hasten to relieve miss neville if you keep the old lady employed i promise to take care of the young one   exit hastings tony never fear me here she comes vanish she is got from the pond and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid   enter mrs hardcastle mrs hardcastle oh tony i am killed shook battered to death i shall never survive it that last jolt that laid us against the quickset hedge has done my business   tony alack mamma it was all your own fault you would be for running away by night without knowing one inch of the way   mrs hardcastle i wish we were at home again i never met so many accidents in so short a journey drenched in the mud overturned in a ditch stuck fast in a slough jolted to a jelly and at last to lose our way whereabouts do you think we are tony   tony by my guess we should come upon crackskull common about forty miles from home   mrs hardcastle o lud o lud the most notorious spot in all the country we only want a robbery to make a complete night on it   tony dont be afraid mamma dont be afraid two of the five that kept here are hanged and the other three may not find us dont be afraid is that a man that is galloping behind us no it is only a tree dont be afraid   mrs hardcastle the fright will certainly kill me   tony do you

little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity   miss neville i find it impossible my spirits are so sunk with the agitations i have suffered that i am unable to face any new danger two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness   hastings such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy let us fly my charmer let us date our happiness from this very moment perish fortune love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarchs revenue let me prevail   miss neville no mr hastings no prudence once more comes to my relief and i will obey its dictates in the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance i am resolved to apply to mr hardcastles compasion and justice for redress   hastings but though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you   miss neville but he has influence and upon that i am resolved to rely   hastings i have no hopes but since you persist i must reluctantly obey you   exeunt scene changes enter sir charles and miss hardcastle   sir charles what a situation am i in if what you say appears i shall then find a guilty son if what he says be true i shall then lose one that of all others i most wished for a daughter   miss hardcastle i am proud of your approbation and to show i merit it if you place yourselves as i directed you shall hear his explicit declaration but he comes   sir charles i will to your father and keep him to the appointment   exit sir charles enter marlow marlow though prepared for setting out i come once more to take leave nor did i till this moment know the pain i feel in the separation   miss hardcastle in her own natural manner i believe these sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove a day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret   marlow aside this girl every moment improves upon me to her it must not be madam i have already trifled too long with my heart my very pride begins to submit to my passion the disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painsul effort of resolution   miss hardcastle then go sir i will urge nothing more to detain you though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education i hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence i must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit i must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune   enter hardcastle and sir charles from behind sir charles here behind this screen   hardcastle aye aye make no noise i will engage my kate covers him with confusion at last   marlow by heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion but every moment that i converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression what at first seemed rustic plainness now appears resind simplicity what seemed forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue   sir charles what can it mean he amazes me   hardcastle i told you how it would be hush   marlow i am now determined to stay madam and i have too good an opinion of my fathers discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation  miss hardcastle  no mr marlow i will not cannot detain you do you think i could suffer a connection in which there is the smallest room for repentance do you think i would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion do you think i could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours   marlow by all that is good i can have no happiness but what is in your power to grant me nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before i will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me i will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past condust   miss hardcastle sir i must entreat you will desist as our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference i might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously mr marlow do you think i could ever submit to a connection where i must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think i could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer   marlow kneeling does this look like security does this look like confidence no madam every moment that shows me your merit only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion here let me continue    sir charles i can hold it no longer charles charles how have thou deceived me is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation   hardcastle your cold contempt your formal interview what have you to say now   marlow that i am all amazement what can it mean   hardcastle it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure that you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter   marlow daughter  this lady your daughter   hardcastle yes sir my only daughter my kate whose else should she be   marlow oh the devil   miss hardcastle yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for curtesying she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha   marlow zounds there is no bearing this it is worse than death   miss hardcastle in which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you as the faultering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with mrs mantrap and old miss biddy buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha   marlow o curse on my noisy head i never attempted to be impudent yet that i was not taken down i must be gone   hardcastle by the hand of my body but you shall not i see it was all a mistake and i am rejoiced to

modest visitor here   sir charles who my honest george hastings as worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice   hardcastle then by the hand of my body i am proud of the connection   mrs hardcastle well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss   hardcastle sure dorothy you would not be so mercenary   mrs hardcastle aye that is my affair not yours but you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal   hardcastle aye but he is not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal   enter hastings and miss neville mrs hardcastle aside what returned so soon i begin not to like it   hastings to hardcastle for my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment we are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity by her fathers consent i first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty   miss neville since his death i have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression in an hour of levity i was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice but i am now recovered from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connection   mrs hardcastle pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel   hardcastle be it what it will i am glad they are come back to reclaim their due come hither tony boy do you refuse this ladys hand whom i now offer you   tony what signifies my refusing you know i cannot refuse her till i am of age father   hardcastle while i thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement i concurred with your mothers desire to keep it secret but since i find she turns it to a wrong use i must now declare you have been of age these three months   tony of age i am i of age father   hardcastle above three months   tony then you will see the first use i will make of my liberty taking miss nevilles band witness all men by these presents that i anthony lumpkin esquire of blank place refuse you constantia neville spinster of no place

hardcastle joining their hands and i say so too and mr marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter i dont believe you will ever repent your bargain so now to supper tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife   epilogue by dr goldsmith well having stooped to conquer with success and gained a husband without aid from dress still as a barmaid i could wish it too as i have conquered him to conquer you and let me say for all your resolution that pretty barmaids have done execution our life is all a play composed to please  we have our exits and our entrances the first act shows the simple country maid harmless and young of every thing afraid blushes when hired and with unmeaning action  i hopes as how to give you satisfaction her second act displays a livelier scene  the unblushing barmaid of a country inn who whisks about the house at market caters talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters next the scene shifts to town and there she soars the chophouse toast of ogling connoisieurs on squires and cits she there displays her arts and on the gridiron broils her lovers hearts  and as she smiles her triumphs to complete even common councilmen forget to eat the fourth act shows her wedded to the squire and madam now begins to hold it higher pretends to taste at operas cries caro and quits her nancy dawson for che faro doats upon dancing and in all her pride swims round the room the heinell of cheapside ogles and leers with artificial skill till having lost in age the power to kill she sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille such through our lives the eventful history  the fifth and last act still remains for me the barmaid now for your protection prays turns female barrister and pleads for bays epilogue to be spoken in the character of tony lumpkin this came too late to be spoken  by j craddock esquire well  now all is ended  and my comrades gone pray what becomes of mothers nonly son a hopeful blade  in town i will fix my station and try to make a bluster in the nation as for my cousin neville i renounce her off  in a crack  i will carry big bett bouncer why should not i in the great world appear i soon shall have a thousand pounds a year no matter what a man may here inherit in london  gad they have some regard to spirit i see the horses prancing up the streets and big bett bouncer bobs to all she meets then hoikes to jiggs and pastimes every night  not to the plays  they say it ant polite to sadlerswells perhaps or operas go and once by chance to the roratorio thus here and there for ever up and down well set the fashions too to half the town and then at auctions  money never regard buy pictures like the great ten pounds a yard zounds we shall make these london gentry say we know what is damned genteel as well as they finis
