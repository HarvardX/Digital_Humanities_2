its conclusion and i shall bid farewell to this eventful period with a grateful mind for its having passed lightly over my head without any extraordinary perturbation or misfortune on my part suffered gently leading me toward that destined and not far distant hour when i like it shall be no more  i have accompanied it through all those changes and successions of seasons which in our climate are so strongly discriminated have shared in the pleasures and productions of each and if any little idle jars or bickerings may occasionally have started up betwixt us as will sometimes happen to the best of friends i willingly consign them to oblivion and keep in mind only those kind and good offices which will please on reflection and serve to endear the memory of the deceased  all days in twelve months will not be days of sunshine but i will say this for my friend in his last moments that i cannot put my finger upon one in the same century that has given birth to more interesting events been a warmer advocate for the liberties and rights of mankind in general or a kinder patron to this country in particular i could name a day if there was any need to point out what is so strongly impressed on our hearts a day of gratulation and thanksgiving which will ever stand forth amongst the whitest in our calendar  hic dies vere mihi festus atras eximet curas ego nec tumultum nec mori per vim metuam tenente caesare terras horat this is indeed a festal day a day that heals my cares and pains drives death and danger far away and tells me  caesar lives and reigns though my friend in his last moments has in this and other instances been so considerate of our happiness i am afraid he is not likely to leave our morals much better than he found them i cannot say that in the course of my duty as an observer any very striking instance of amendment has come under my notice and though i have all the disposition in life to speak as favorably in my friends behalf as truth will let me i am bound to confess he was not apt to think so seriously of his latter end as i could have wished there was a levity in his conduct which he took no pains to conceal he did not seem to reflect upon the lapse of time how speedily his spring summer and autumn would pass away and the winter of his days come upon him like wolsey he was not aware how soon the frost the killing frost would nip his root he was however a gay convivial fellow loved his bottle and his friend passed his time peaceably amongst us and certainly merits the good word of every loyal subject in this kingdom  as for his proceedings in other countries it is not here the reader must look for an account of them politics have no place in these volumes but it cannot be denied that he has made many widows and orphans in europe been an active agent for the court of death and dipped his hands deep in christian and mohammedan blood by the friends of freedom he will be celebrated to the latest time he has begun a business which if followed up by his successor with equal zeal less ferocity and more discretion may lead to wonderful revolutions there are indeed some instances of cruelty which bear hard upon his character if separately viewed they admit of no palliation in a general light allowances may be made for that phrensy which seizes the mind when impelled to great and arduous undertakings when the wound is gangrened the incision must be deep and if that is to be done by coarse instruments and unskilful hands who can wonder if the gash more resembles the stab of an assassin than the operation of a surgeon an era is now opened awful interesting and so involved in mystery that the acutest speculation cannot penetrate to the issue of it in short my friend in his last moments has put a vast machine in motion and left a task to futurity that will demand the strongest hands and ablest heads to complete in the mean time i shall hope that my countrymen who have all those blessings by inheritance which lessfavoured nations are now struggling to obtain by force will so use their liberty that the rest of the world who are not so happy may think it an object worth contending for and quote our peace and our prosperity as the best proofs existing of its real value  whilst my thoughts have been thus employed in reflecting upon the last day of an evermemorable year i have composed a few elegiac lines to be thrown into the grave which time is now opening to receive his relics  the years gay verdure all its charms are gone and now comes old december chill and drear dragging a darkling length of evening on whilst all things droop as natures death were near time flies amain with broadexpanded wings whence never yet a single feather fell but holds his speed and through the welkin rings of all that breathe the inexorable knell oh for a moment stop  a moments space for recollection mercy might concede a little pause for mans unthinking race to ponder on that world to which they speed but it is in vain old time disdains to rest and moment after moment flits along each with a sting to pierce the idlers breast and vindicate its predecessors wrong though the newdawning year in its advance with hopes gay promise may entrap the mind let memory give one retrospective glance through the bright period which it leaves behind era of mercies my wrapped bosom springs to meet the transport recollection gives heavens angel comes with healing on his wings he shakes his plumes my countrys father lives the joyful tidings over the distant round of britains empire the four winds proclaim her sunburned islands swell the exulting sound and farthest ganges echoes georges name period of bliss can any british muse bid thee farewell without a parting tear shall the historians gratitude refuse his brightest page to this recorded year thou freedoms nursing mother shall be styled the glories of its birth are all thine own upon thy breasts hung the herculean child and tyrants trembled at its baby frown a sanguine mantle the dread infant wore before it rolled a stream of human blood smiling it stood and pointing to the shore beckoned the nations from across the flood then at that awful sight as with a spell the everlasting doors of death gave way prone to the dust oppressions fortress fell and rescued captives hailed the light of day meanwhile ambition chased its fairy prize with moonstruck madness down the danubes stream the turkish crescent glittering in its eyes and lost an empire to pursue a dream the trampled serpent superstition wreathed her festring scales with anguish to and fro torpid she lay then darting forward sheathed her deadly fangs in the unguarded foe oh austria why so prompt to venture forth when fate now hurries thee to lifes last goal thee too thou crowned eagle of the north deaths dart arrests though towering to the pole down then ambition drop into the grave and by thy follies be this maxim shown  it is not the monarchs glory to enslave his neighbors empire but to bless his own come then sweet peace in britain fix thy reign bid plenty smile and commerce crowd her coast and may this everblessed year remain her kings her peoples and her muses boast no cxxvii i am under promise to resume the history of my friend ned drowsy from which i was obliged to break off in my last volume no     the events which have since occurred shall now be related  the reader will perhaps recollect that the worthy hebrew who assumes the name of abrahams had just concluded the narrative of his adventures and that the next morning was appointed for a conciliatory interview between mrs goodison and her father ned whose natural indolence had now began to give place to the most active of all passions had been so much agitated by the events of the day that we had no sooner parted from honest abrahams than he began to comment upon the lucky incident of our rencontre with the old gentleman at the comedy he seemed strongly inclined to deal with destiny for some certain impulses which he remembered to have felt when he was so earnest to go to the play and declared with much gravity that he went thither fully prepossessed some good fortune would turn up well to be sure said he i ought to rejoice in the happy turn affairs have now taken and i do rejoice but it would have given me infinite delight to have fulfilled the plan i had in design for mrs goodisons accommodation she will now want no assistance from me my little cottage will never have the honor of receiving her all those schemes are at an end constantia too will be a great fortune she will have higher views in life and think no more of me or if she did it is not to be supposed her grandfather who so bitterly resented his daughters match will suffer her to fall into the offense i must confess i thought so entirely with my friend ned in the concluding part of these remarks that i could only advise him to wait the event of time and recommend himself in the mean while as well as he could to mr somerville the grandfather of constantia art and education it is true had not contributed much to neds accomplishments but nature had done great things in his favor to a person admirably though not finically formed she had given a most interesting set of features with such a striking character of benevolence and open honesty that he might be said to carry his heart in his countenance though there was a kind of lassitude in his deportment the effect of habits long indulged yet his sensibibility was ever ready to start forth upon the first call and on those occasions no one would have regretted that he had not been trained in the school of the graces there was something then displayed which they cannot teach and only nature in her happiest moments can bestow  the next morning produced a letter from honest abrahams full of joy for the happy reconciliation now established and inviting us to celebrate the day with mrs somerville and the ladies at his house this was an anxious crisis for my friend ned and i perceived his mind in such a state of agitation that i thought fit to stay with him for the rest of the forenoon he began to form a variety of conjectures as to the reception he was likely to meet from the old gentleman with no less a variety of plans for his own behavior and even of speeches with which he was to usher in his first addresses sometimes he sunk into melancholy and despair at other times he would snatch a gleam of hope and talk himself into transports he was now for the first time in his life studiously contriving how to set off his person to the best advantage his hair was fashionably dressed and a handsome new suit was tried on during which he surveyed himself in the glass with some attention and as i thought not entirely without a secret satisfaction which indeed i have seen other gentlemen bestow upon their persons in a much greater degree with much less reason for their excuse  when he was completely equipt and the time approached for our going alas he cried what does all this signify i am but a clown in better clothes why was my father so neglectful of my education or rather why was i so negligent to avail myself of the little he allowed me what would i not give to redeem the time i have thrown away but it is in vain i have neither wit to recommend myself nor address to disguise my want of it i have nothing to plead in my favor but common honor and honesty and what cares that old hardhearted fellow for qualities which could not reconcile him to his own soninlaw he will certainly look upon me with contempt as for constantia gratitude perhaps might in time have disposed her heart toward me and my zealous services might have induced her mother to overlook my deficiencies but there is an end of that only chance i had for happiness and i am a fool to thrust myself into a society where i am sure to heap fresh fuel on my passion and fresh misfortunes on my head  with these impressions which i could only sooth but not dispel ned proceeded to the place of meeting with an aching heart and dejected countenance we found the whole party assembled to receive us and though my friends embarrassment disabled him from uttering any one of the readymade speeches he had digested for the purpose yet i saw nothing in mr somervilles countenance or address that could augur otherwise than well for honest ned mrs goodison was as gracious as possible and constantias smile was benignity itself honest abrahams who has all the hospitality as well as virtues of his forefathers the patriarchs received us with open arms and a face in whichwidemouthed joy grinned most delectably it was with pleasure i observed mr somervilles grateful attentions toward him and his good dame they had nothing of ostentation or artifice in them but seemed the genuine effusions of his heart they convinced me he was not a man innately morose and that the resentment so long fostered in his bosom was effectually extirpated mrs abrahams in her province had exerted herself to very good purpose and spread her board if not elegantly yet abundantly abrahams on his part kept his wine and his tongue going with incessant gaiety and good humor and whilst he took every opportunity of drawing forth neds honest heart and natural manners to the best advantage i was happy in discovering that they did not escape the intuition of somerville and that he made faster progress toward his good opinion than if he had exhibited better breeding and less sincerity of character  in the course of the evening the old gentleman told us he had determined upon taking his daughter and constantia into the country with him where he flattered himself mrs goodison would recover her health and spirits sooner than in town and at the same time gave us all in turn a pressing invitation to his house abrahams and his wife excused themselves on the score of business but ned who had no such plea to make nor any disposition to invent one thankfully accepted the proposal  the day succeeding and some few others were passed by mrs goodison and constantia at mr somervilles in the necessary preparations and arrangements previous to their leaving london during this time neds diffidence and their occupations did not admit of any interview and their departure was only announced to him by a note from the old gentleman reminding him of his engagement his spirits were by this time so much lowered from their late elevation that he even doubted if he should accept the invitation love however took care to settle this point in his own favor and ned arrived at the place of his destination rather as a victim under the power of a hopeless passion than as a modern fine gentleman with the assuming airs of a conqueror the charms of the beautiful constantia which had drawn her indolent admirer so much out of his character and so far from his home now heightened by the happy reverse of her situation and set off with all the aids of dress dazzled him with their luster and though her change of fortune and appearance was not calculated to diminish his passion it seemed to forbid his hopes in sorrow poverty and dependence she had inspired him with the generous ambition of rescuing her from a situation so ill proportioned to her merits and though he had not actually made he had very seriously meditated a proposal of marriage he saw her now in a far different point of view and comparing her with himself her beauty fortune and accomplishments with his own conscious deficiencies he sunk into despair this was not unobserved by constantia neither did she want the penetration to discern the cause of it when he had dragged on this wretched existence for some days he found the pain of it no longer supportable and ashamed of wearing a face of woe in the house of happiness he took the hardy resolution of bidding farewell to constantia and his hopes for ever  whilst he was meditating upon this painful subject one evening during a solitary walk he was surprised to hear himself accosted by the very person from whose chains he had determined to break loose constantia was unattended the place was retired the hour was solemn and her looks were soft and full of compassion what cannot love effect it inspired him with resolution to speak it did more it supplied him with eloquence to express his feelings  constantia in few words gave him to understand that she rightly guessed the situation of his mind this at once drew from him a confession of his love and his despair  of the former he spoke little and with no display he neither sought to recommend his passion or excite her pity of his own defects he spoke more at large and dwelt much upon his want of education he reproached himself for the habitual indolence of his disposition and then for the first time raising his eyes from the ground he turned them on constantia and after a pause exclaimed thank heaven you are restored to a condition which no longer subjects you to the possible sacrifice i had once the audacity to hint at conscious as i am of my own unworthiness at all times to aspire to such a proposal let me do myself the justice to declare that my heart was open to you in the purest sense that to have tendered an asylum to your beloved mother without ensnaring your heart by the obligation would still have been the pride of my life and i as truly abhorred to exact as you could disdain to grant an interested surrender of your hand and now lovely constantia when i am about to leave you in the bosom of prosperity if i do not seem to part from you with all that unmixt felicity which your good fortune ought to inspire do not reproach me for my unhappy weakness but recollect for once in your life that your charms are irresistible and my soul only too susceptible of their power and too far plunged into despair to admit of any happiness hereafter  at the conclusion of this speech ned again fixed his eyes on the ground after a short silence i perceive replied constantia that my observations of late were rightly formed and you have been torturing your mind with reflections very flattering to me but not very just toward yourself believe me sir your opinion is as much too exalted in one case as it is too humble in the other as for me having as yet seen little of the world but its miseries and being indebted to the benevolence of human nature for supporting me under them i shall ever look to that principle as a greater recommendation in the character of a companion for life than the most brilliant talents or most elegant accomplishments in the quiet walks of life i shall expect to find my enjoyments here ned started from his reverie a gleam of joy rushed upon his heart by an involuntary motion he had grasped one of her hands she perceived the tumult her words had created and extricating her hand from his  permit me said she to qualify my respect for a benevolent disposition by remarking to you that without activity there can be no virtue i will explain myself more particularly i will speak to you with the sincerity of a friend  you are blessed with excellent natural endowments a good heart and a good understanding you have nothing to do but to shake off an indolent habit and having youth at your command to employ the one and cultivate the other the means of doing this it would be presumption in me to prescribe but as my grandfather is a man well acquainted with the world and fully qualified to give advice i should earnestly recommend to you not to take a hasty departure before you have consulted him and i may venture to promise you will never repent of any confidence you may repose in his friendship and discretion  here constantia put an end to the conference and turned toward the house ned stood fixed in deep reflection his mind sometimes brightening with hope sometimes relapsing into despair his final determination however was to obey constantias advice and seek an interview with mr somerville  no cxxviii the next morning as soon as ned and mr somerville met the old gentleman took him into his library and when he was seated sir said he i shall save you some embarrassment if i begin our conference by telling you that i am well apprised of your sentiments toward my constantia i shall make the same haste to put you out of suspense by assuring you that i am not unfriendly to your wishes  this was an opening of such unexpected joy to ned that his spirits had nearly sunk under the surprise he stared wildly without power of utterance scarce venturing to credit what he had heard the blood rushed into his cheeks and somerville seeing his disorder proceeded when i have said this on my own part understand young gentleman that i only engage not to obstruct your success i do not nay i cannot undertake to ensure it that must depend upon constantia permit me to add it must depend upon yourself here ned unable to suppress his transports eagerly demanded what there could be in his power to do that might advance him in the good opinion and esteem of constantia such was his gratitude to the old gentleman for his kindness that he could scarce refrain from throwing himself at his feet and he implored him instantly to point out the happy means which he would implicitly embrace were they every so difficult ever so dangerous  there will be neither hardship nor hazard replied mr somerville in what i shall advise great things may be accomplished in a short time where the disposition is good and the understanding apt though your father neglected your education it is no reason you should neglect yourself you must shake off your indolence and as the first step necessary toward your future comfort is to put yourself at ease in point of fortune you must make yourself master of your own estate that i suspect can only be done by extricating your affairs from the hands they are in but as this is a business that will require the assistance of an honest and able agent i shall recommend to you my own lawyer on whose integrity you may securely rely he will soon reduce your affairs to such a system of regularity that you will find it an easy business and when you discover how many sources of future happiness it opens to you you will pursue it as an employment of no less pleasure than advantage  to this good advice ned promised the fullest and most unreserved obedience mr somerville resumed his subject and proceeded when you have thus laid the foundation in economy what remains to be done will be a task of pleasure this will consist in furnishing your mind and enlarging your experience in short sir rubbing off the rust of indolence and the prejudices of a narrow education now for this important undertaking i have a friend in my eye whose understanding temper morals and manners qualify him to render you most essential services with this amiable and instructive companion i should in the first place recommend you to take a tour through the most interesting parts of your own country and hereafter as occasion shall serve you may or you may not extend your travels into other countries this is the best counsel i have to give you and i tender it with all possible good wishes for your success  a plan proposed with so much cordiality and holding forth such a reward for the accomplishment of its conditions could not fail to be embraced with ardour by the late despairing lover of constantia the worthy lawyer was prepared for the undertaking and ned was all impatience to convince mr somerville that indolence was no longer his ruling defect he gave instant orders for his journey and then flew to constantia at whose feet he poured forth the humble yet ardent acknowledgments of a heart overflowing with gratitude and love it seemed as if loves arrow like ithuriels spear possessed the magic powers of transformation with a touch there was a spirit in his eyes an energy in his motions an illumination over his whole person that gave his form and features a new cast constantia saw the sudden transformation with surprise and as it evinced the flexibility of his nature and the influence of her own charms she saw it also with delight so soon was her only reply when he announced his immediate departure but those words were uttered with such a cadence and accompanied by such a look as to the eye and ear of love conveyed more meaning than volumes would contain unaided by such expression  yes adorable constantia he exclaimed i am now setting forth to give the earliest proof in my power of a ready and alert obedience to the dictates of my best adviser these few moments which your condescension indulges me with are the only moments i shall not rigidly devote to the immediate duties of my task inspired with the hope of returning less unworthy of your attention i cheerfully submit to banish myself from your sight for a time content to cherish in my heart the lovely image there impressed and flattering myself i have the sanction of your good wishes for the success of my undertaking constantia assured him he had her good wishes for every happiness in life and then yielding her hand to him he tenderly pressed it to his lips and departed  it would be an uninteresting detail to enumerate the arrangements which ned by the instructions of his friendly and judicious agent adopted on his return to poppyhall his affairs had indeed been much neglected but they were not embarrassed so that they were easily put into such order and regulation as gave him full leisure for pursuing other objects of a more animating nature with this view he returned to his friend mr somerville and was again blessed with the presence of constantia to whom every day seemed to add new graces he was welcomed by all parties in the most affectionate manmer mr somerville upon conversing with his lawyer received a very flattering report of neds activity and attention nor was he displeased to hear from the same authority that his estate and property far exceeded any amount which the unpretending owner himself had ever hinted at  it was now the latter end of april and ned had allowed himself only a few days to prepare for his tour and to form an acquaintance with the amiable person who at mr somervilles request had engaged to accompany him their plan was to employ six months in this excursion through england and part of scotland during which they were to visit the chief towns and principal manufactories and mr somerville had further contrived to lay out their course so as to fall in with the houses of some of his friends by the way where he had secured them a welcome in such societies as promised no less profit than amusement to a young person in the pursuit of experience measures had been taken to provide equipage servants and all things requisite for a traveling establishment amongst which a few wellselected books were not forgotten and thus at length equipt ned with his companion on the first morning of the month of may having taken leave of mr somerville and mrs goodison and received a tender adieu from his beloved constantia slept reluctantly into his chaise and left the finest eyes in the creation to pay the tribute of a tear to the sorrows of the scene  from this period i had heard nothing of his proceedings till a few days ago when i was favored by him with the following letter dated from the house of mr somerville dear sir i am just returned from a six months tour in the course of which i have visited a variety of places and persons in company with a gentleman from whose pleasing society i have reaped the highest enjoyment and if i do not deceive myself no small degree of profit and instruction  before i sat out upon this excursion i had the satisfaction of seeing my private affairs put in such a train and arranged upon so clear a system that i find myself in possession of a fund of occupation for the rest of my days in superintending the concerns of my estate and interesting myself in the welfare and prosperity of every person who depends upon me  when i returned to this charming place the reception i met with from mr somerville was as flattering as can be conceived the worthy mother of my beloved constantia was no less kind to me but in what words can i attempt to convey to you the impression i felt on my heart when i was welcomed with smiles of approbation by the everadorable object of my affection what transport did it give me when i found her anxious to enquire into every circumstance that had occured in the course of my travels none were too minute for her notice she seemed to take an interest in every thing that had happened to me and our conversations were renewed time after time without weariness on her part or any prospect of exhausting our subject  at this time i had no other expectation but of a second excursion with the conductor of the first and as that gentleman was in frequent conference with mr somerville i took for granted they were concerting the plan of a foreign tour and though my heart was every hour more and more fondly attached to constantia so that a separation from her was painful to reflect on yet i was resolved at all events not to swerve from my engagements with her grandfather and therefore held myself in trembling expectation of another summons to go forth delightfully as the hours passed away in her society i dreaded lest any symptoms of selfindulgence should lower me in her opinion or create suspicions in mr somerville and mrs goodison that i was in any danger of relapsing into my former indolence i therefore seized the first opportunity of explaining myself to those respectable friends when constantia was not present and addressing myself to mr somerville assured him that i was not disposed to forget any part of his good advice nor so much my own enemy as to evade any one of those conditions to the performance of which he had annexed the hope of so transcendant a reward conscious that he could impose nothing upon me so hard to do or so painful to suffer which such a prize would not infinitely overbalance i had no other backwardness or apprehension as to his commands but what sprung from the conviction that after all my efforts i must ever remain unworthy of constantia  i shall never forget mr somervilles reply nor the action which accompanied it my good friend said he leaning over the arm of the chair and kindly taking me by the hand it is more than enough for a man to have made one such fatal error in his life as i have done one such unhappy sacrifice to the false opinions of the world but though i have heartily repented of this error i am not so far reformed as to be without ambition in the choice of a husband for our constantia no sir i am still as ambitious as ever but i hope with better judgment and upon better principles i will not bate an atom of virtue in the bargain i am to make i insist upon the good qualities of the heart and temper to the last scruple these are the essentials which i rigidly exact and all these you possess there are indeed other many other incidental articles which you may or you may not superadd to the account but i am contented to strike hands with you on the spot though you shall never have set foot upon foreign soil  what says my daughter to this  when i cast my eyes upon the countenance of the most benevolent of women and saw it turned expressively upon me smiling through tears joy palpitated at my heart whilst she delivered herself as follows  i were of all beings most insensible could i withhold my testimony to this gentlemans merits or my entire assent to his alliance with my daughter but as i have ever reposed perfect confidence in her and as far as i was enabled always consulted her wishes i should be glad this question might be fairly and heartily referred to her unbiassed judgment for decision she is very young our friend here is neither old in years nor experience both parties have time before them should she be willing to hold off from the married state for a while should she foresee advantages in our friends undertaking a second tour with the same instructive associate whether into foreign countries or nearer home let her be the judge of what is most likely to conduce to her future happiness in a husband and as i am persuaded our friend here will practicse no unfair measures for biassing her judgment let him consult constantias wishes on the case and as she determines so let him act and so let us agree  with these instructions which mr somerville seconded i hastened to constantia and without hesitation or disguise related to her what had passed and requested her decision judge if it be possible to judge of my transports when that ingenuous that angelic creature gave me a reply that left no room to doubt that i was blessed in the possession of her heart and that she could not endure a second separation  i flew to mr somerville i fell at the feet of mrs goodison i interceded implored and was accepted nothing ever equalled the generosity of their behavior i am now to change my name to somerville at that worthy gentlemans express desire and measures are already in train for that purpose the same abilities which i am indebted to for the good condition of my affairs are employed in perfecting the marriage settlement and the period now between me and happiness would by any other person but myself be termed a very short one  thus am i on the very eve of being blessed with the loveliest the divinest object upon earth and thus have i by the good counsel of my friends in which number i shall ever reckon you broke the shackles of that unmanly indolence under which i was sinking apace into irretrievable languor and insignificance henceforward i entreat you to regard me as a new man and believe that with my name i have put off my infirmity we are in daily expectation of our friendly abrahams who is an israelite indeed your company would round our circle and complete the happiness of  your ever affectionate edward     no cxxix facilitas animi ad partem stultitiae rapit p syrus to the observer sir the ancient family of the saplings whereof your humble servant is the unworthy representative has been for many generations distinguished for a certain pliability of temper which with some people passes for good humor and by others is called weakness but however the world may differ in describing it there seems a general agreement in the manner of making use of it  our family estate though far from contemptible is considerably reduced from its ancient spendor not only by an unlucky tumble that my grandfather sir paul got in the famous missisippi scheme but also by various losses bad debts and incautious securities which have fallen heavy upon the purses of my predecessors at different times but as every man must pay for his good character i dare say they did not repent of their purchase and for my part it is a reflection that never gives me any disturbance this aforesaid grandfather of mine was supposed to have furnished congreve with the hint for his character of sir paul pliant at least it has been so whispered to me very frequently by my aunt jemima who was a great collector of family anecdotes and to speak the truth i am not totally without suspicion that a certain ingenious author lately deceased had an eye toward my insignificant self in the dramatic pourtrait of his goodnatured man  though i scorn the notion of setting myself off to the public and you by panegyrics of my own penning as the manner of some is yet i may truly say without boasting that i had the character at school of being the very best fag that ever came into it and this i believe every gentleman who was my contemporary at westminster will do me the justice to acknowledge it was a reputation i confess that i did not earn for nothing for whilst i worked the clothes off my back and the skin off my bones in scouting upon every bodys errands i was pummeled to a mummy by the boys showed up by the ushers slead alive by the masters and reported for an incorrigible dunce at my book a report which under correction i must think had some degree of injustice in it as it was impossible for me to learn a book i was never allowed to open in this period of my education i took little food and less sleep so that whilst i shot up in stature after the manner of my progenitors who were a tall race of men i grew as gaunt as a greyhound but having abundantly more spirit than strength and being voted by the great boys to to be what is called true game i was singled out as a kind of trialcock and pitted against every new comer to make proof of his bottom in fair fighting though i may safely say i never turned out upon a quarrel of my own making in all my life notwithstanding all these honors which i obtained from my colleagues i will not attempt to disguise from you that i left the school in disgrace being expelled by the master when head of my boarding house for not supporting my authority over the petty boys belonging to it who i must confess were just then not in the most orderly and correct state of discipline  my father whose maxim it was never to let trifles vex him received me with all the good humor in life and admitted me of the university of oxford here i was overjoyed to find that the affair of the expulsion was so far from having prejudiced my contemporaries against me that i was resorted to by numbers whose time hung upon their hands and my rooms became the rendezvous of all the loungers in the college few or no schemes were set on foot without me and if a loose guinea or two was wanted for the purpose every body knew where to have it i was allowed a horse for my healths sake which was rather delicate but i cannot say my health was much the better for him as i never mounted his back above once or twice whilst my friends kept him in exercise morning and evening as long as he lasted which indeed was only till the hunting season set in when the currier had his hide and his flesh went to the kennel i must own i did not excel in any of my academical exercises save that of circumambulating the colleges and public buildings with strangers who came to gaze about them for curiositys sake in this branch of learning i gained such general reputation as to be honored with the title of keeper of the lions neither will i disguise the frequent jobations i incurred for neglect of college duties and particularly for nonattendance at chapel but in this i should not perhaps have been thought so reprehensible had it been known that my surplice never failed to be there though i had rarely the credit of bearing it company  my mother died of a cold she caught by attending some young ladies on a waterparty before i had been a month in the world and my father never married again having promised her on her deathbed not to bring a stepdame into his family whilst i survived i had the misfortune to lose him when i was in my twentysecond year he got his death at a country canvass for sir harry osier a very obliging gentleman and nearly related to our family i attended my fathers corpse to the grave on which melancholy occasion such were the lamentations and bewailings of all the servants in the house that i thought it but a proper return for their affection to his memory to prove myself as kind a master by continuing them in their several employs this however was not altogether what they meant as i was soon convinced every one amongst them had a remonstrance to make and a new demand to prefer the butler would have better perquisites the footman wanted to be out of livery the scullion demanded teamoney and the cook murmured about kitchenstuff  though i was now a single being in the world my friends and neighbors kindly took care i should not be a solitary one i was young indeed and of small experience in the world but i had plenty of counselors some advised me to buy horses they wanted to sell others to sell horses they wanted to buy a lady of great taste fell in love with two or three of my best cows for their color they were upon her lawn the next day a gentleman of extraordinary virtu discovered a picture or two in my collection that exactly fitted his pannels an eminent improver whom every body declared to be the first genius of the age for laying out grounds had taken measures for transporting my garden a mile out of my sight and floating my richest meadow grounds with a lake of muddy water as for my mansion and its appendages i am persuaded i could never have kept them in their places had it not been that the several projectors who all united in pulling them down could never rightly agree in what particular spot to build them up again one kind friend complimented me with the first refusal of a mistress whom for reasons of economy he was obliged to part from and a neighboring gentlewoman whose daughter had perhaps stuck on hand a little longer than was convenient more than hinted to me that miss had every requisite in life to make the married state perfectly happy  in justice however to my own discretion let me say that i was not hastily surprised into a serious measure by this latter overture nor did i ask the young ladys hand in marriage till i was verily persuaded by her excessive fondness that there were no other means to save her life now whether it was the violence of her passion before our marriage that gave some shock to her intellects or from what other cause it might proceed i know not certain however it is that after marriage she became subject to very odd whims and caprices and though i made it a point of humanity never to thwart her in these humors yet i was seldom fortunate enough to please her so that had i not been sure to demonstration that love for me was the cause and origin of them all i might have been so deceived by appearances as to have imputed them to aversion she was in the habit of deciding upon almost every action in her life by the interpretation of her dreams in which i cannot doubt her great skill though i could not always comprehend the principles on which she applied it she never failed as soon as winter set in to dream of going to london and our journey as certainly succeeded i remember upon our arrival there the first year after our marriage she dreamt of a new coach and at the same time put the servants in new liveries the colors and pattern of which were circumstantially revealed to her in sleep sometimes dear creature she dreamt of winning large sums at cards but i am apt to think those dreams were of the sort which should have been interpreted by their contraries she was not a little fond of running after conjurors and deaf and dumb fortune tellers who dealt in figures and cast nativities and when we were in the country my barns and outhouses were haunted with gypsies and vagabonds who made sad havoc with our pigs and poultry of ghosts and evil spirits she had such terror that i was fain to keep a chaplain in my house to exorcise the chambers and when business called me from home the good man condescended so far to her fears as to sleep in a little closet within her call in case she was troubled in the night and i must say this for my friend that if there is any trust to be put in flesh and blood he was a match for the best spirit that ever walked she had all the sensibility in life toward omens and prognostics and though i guarded every motion and action that mighty give any possible alarm to her yet my unhappy awkwardnesses were always boding ill luck and i had the grief of heart to hear her declare in her last moments that a capital oversight i had been guilty of in handing to her a candle with an enormous winding sheet appending to it was the immediate occasion of her death and my irreparable misfortune  my second wife i married in mere charity and compassion because a young fellow whom she was engaged to had played her a base trick by scandalously breaking off the match when the wedding clothes were bought the day appointed for the wedding and myself invited to it such transactions ever appeared shocking to me and therefore to make up her loss to her as well as i was able i put myself to extraordinary charges for providing her with every thing handsome upon our marriage she was a fine woman loved show and was particularly fond of displaying herself in public places where she had an opportunity of meeting and mortifying the young man who had behaved so ill to her she took this revenge against him so often that one day to my great surprise i discovered that she had eloped from me and fairly gone off with him there was something so unhandsome as i thought in this proceeding that i should probably have taken legal measures for redress as in like cases other husbands have done had i not been diverted from my purpose by a very civil note from the gentleman himself wherein he says  that being a younger son of little or no fortune he hopes i am too much of a gentleman to think of resorting to the vexatious measures of the law for revenging myself upon him and as a proof of his readiness to make me all the reparation in his power in an honorable way he begs leave to inform me that he shall most respectfully attend upon me with either sword or pistols or with both whenever i shall be pleased to lay my commands upon him for a meeting and appoint the hour and place  after such atonement on the part of the offender i could no longer harbor any thoughts of a divorce especially as my younger brother the parson has heirs to continue the family and seems to think so entirely with me in the business that i have determined to drop it altogether and give the parties no further molestation for as my brother very properly observes it is the part of a christian to forget and to forgive and in truth i see no reason why i should disturb them in their enjoyments or return evil for good to an obliging gentleman who has taken a task of trouble off my hands and set me at my ease for the rest of my days in which tranquil and contented state of mind as becomes a man whose inheritance is philanthropy and whose mothers milk has been the milk of human kindness i remain in all brotherly charity and good will  yours and the worlds friend simon sapling   no cxxx  demophili sententia he who anothers peace annoys by the same act his own destroys  to the observer as i have lived long enough to repent of a fatal propensity that has led me to commit many offenses not the less irksome to my present feelings for the secrecy with which i contrived to execute them and as these can now be no otherwise atoned for than by a frank confession i have resolved upon this mode of addressing myself to you few people choose to display their own characters to the world in such colors as i shall give to mine but as i have mangled so many reputations in my time without mercy i should be the meanest of mankind if i spared my own and being now about to speak of a person whom no man loves i may give vent to an acrimony at which no man can take offense if i have been troublesome to others i am no less uncomfortable to myself and amidst vexations without number the greatest of all is that there is not one which does not originate from myself  i entered upon life with many advantages natural and acquired i am indebted to my parents for a liberal education and to nature for no contemptible share of talents my propensities were not such as betrayed me into dissipation and extravagance my mind was habitually of a studious cast i had a passion for books and began to collect them at an early period of my life to them i devoted the greatest portion of my time and had my vanity been of a sort to be contented with the literary credit i had now acquired i had been happy but i was ambitious of convincing the world i was not the idle owner of weapons which i did not know the use of i seized every safe opportunity of making my pretensions respected by such dabblers in the belles lettres who paid court to me and as i was ever cautious of stepping an inch beyond my tether on these occasions i soon found myself credited for more learning than my real stock amounted to i received all visitors in my library affected a studious air and took care to furnish my table with volumes of a select sort upon these i was prepared to descant if by chance a curious friend took up any one of them and as there is little same to be got by treading in the beaten track of popular opinion i sometimes took the liberty to be eccentric and paradoxical in my criticisms and cavils which gained me great respect from the ignorant for upon such only i took care to practice this chicanery so that in a short time i became a sovereign dictator within a certain set who looked up to me for second hand opinions in all matters of literary taste and saw myself inaugurated by my flatterers censor of all new publications  my trumpeters had now made such a noise in the world that i began to be in great request and men of real literature laid out for my acquaintance but here i acted with a coldness that was in me constitutional as well as prudential i was resolved not to risk my laurels and throw away the fruits of a triumph so cheaply purchased solicitations that would have flattered others only alarmed me such was not the society i delighted in against such attacks i entrenched myself with the most jealous caution if however by accident i was drawn out of my fastnesses and trapped unawares into an ambuscade of wicked wits i armed myself to meet them with a triple tier of smiles i primed my lips with such a ready charge of flattery that when i had once engaged them in the pleasing contemplation of their own merits they were seldom disposed to scrutinize into mine and thus in general i contrived to escape undetected though it was no easy matter to extort an opinion from me in such companies yet sometimes i was unavoidably entangled in conversation and then i was forced to have recourse to all my address happily my features were habituated to a smile of the most convertible sort for it would answer the purposes of affected humility as well as those of actual contempt to which in truth it was more congenial my opinion therefore upon any point of controversy flattered both parties and befriended neither it was calculated to impress the company with an idea that i knew much more than i professed to know it was in short so insinuating so submitted so hesitating that a man must have had the heart of nero to have persecuted a being so absolutely inoffensive but these sacrifices cost me dear for they were foreign to my nature and as i hated my superiors i avoided their society  having sufficiently distinguished myself as a critic i now began to meditate some secret attempts as an author but in these the same caution attended me and my performances did not rise above a little sonnet or a parody which i circulated through a few hands without a name prepared to disavow it if it was not applauded to my wishes i also wrote occasional essays and paragraphs for the public prints by way of trying my talents in various kinds of style by these experiments i acquired a certain facility of imitating other peoples manner and disguising my own and so far my point was gained but as for the secret satisfaction i had promised myself in hearing my productions applauded of that i was altogether disappointed for though i tried both praise and dispraise for the purpose of bringing them into notice i never had the pleasure to be contradicted by any man in the latter case or seconded by a living soul in the former i had circulated a little poem which cost me some pains and as i had been flattered with the applause it gained from several of its readers i put it one evening in my pocket and went to the house of a certain person who was much resorted to by men of genius an opportunity luckily offered for producing my manuscript which i was prepared to avow as soon as the company present had given sentence in its favor it was put into the hands of a dramatic author of some celebrity who read it aloud and in a manner as i thought that clearly anticipated his disgust as soon therefore as he had finished it and demanded of me if i knew the author i had no hesitation to declare that i did not  then i presume rejoined he it is no offense to say i think it the merest trash i ever read  none in life i replied and from that moment held him in everlasting hatred  disgusted with the world i now began to dip my pen in gall and as soon as i had singled out a proper object for my spleen i looked round him for his weak side where i could place a blow to best effect and wound him undiscovered the author abovementioned had a full share of my attention he was an irritable man and i have seen him agonized with the pain which my very shafts had given him whilst i was foremost to arraign the scurrility of the age and encourage him to disregard it the practice i had been in of masking my style facilitated my attacks upon every body who either moved my envy or provoked my spleen  the meanest of all passions had now taken entire possession of my heart and i surrendered myself to it without a struggle still there was a consciousness about me that sunk me in my own esteem and when i met the eye of a man whom i had secretly defamed i felt abashed society became painful to me and i shrunk into retirement for my selfesteem was lost though i had gratified my malice i had destroyed my comfort i now contemplated myself a solitary being at the very moment when i had every requisite of fortune health and endowments to have recommended me to the world and to those tender ties and engagements which are natural to man and constitute his best enjoyments  the solitude i resorted to made me every day more morose and supplied me with reflections that rendered me intolerable to myself and unfit for society i had reason to apprehend in spite of all my caution that i was now narrowly watched and that strong suspicions were taken up against me when as i was feasting my jaundiced eye one morning with a certain newspaper which i was in the habit of employing as the vehicle of my venom i was startled at discovering myself conspicuously pointed out in an angry column as a cowardly defamer and menaced with personal chastisement as soon as ever proofs could be obtained against me and this threatening denunciation evidently came from the very author who had unknowingly given me such umbrage when he recited my poem  the sight of this resentful paragraph was like an arrow to my brain habituated to skirmish only behind entrenchments i was ill prepared to turn into the open field and had never put the question to my heart how it was provided for the emergency in early life i had not any reason to suspect my courage nay it was rather forward to meet occasions in those days of innocence but the meanness i had lately sunk into had sapped every manly principle of my nature and i now discovered to my sorrow that in taking up the lurking malice of an assassin i had lost the gallant spirit of a gentleman  there was still one alleviation to my terrors it so chanced that i was not the author of the particular libel which my accuser had imputed to me and though i had been father of a thousand others i felt myself supported by truth in almost the only charge against which i could have fairly appealed to it it seemed to me therefore advisable to lose no time in disculpating myself from the accusation yet to seek an interview with this irascible man was a service of some danger chance threw the opportunity in my way which i had probably else wanted spirit to invite i accosted him with all imaginable civility and made the strongest asseverations of my innocence whether i did this with a servility that might aggravate his suspicions or that he had others impressed upon him besides those i was laboring to remove so it was that he treated all i said with the most contemptuous incredulity and elevating his voice to a tone that petrified me with fear bade me avoid his fight threatening me both by words and actions in a manner too humiliating to relate  alas can words express my feelings is there a being more wretched than myself to be friendless an exile from society and at enmity with myself is a situation deplorable in the extreme let what i have now written be made public if i could believe my shame would be turned to others profit it might perhaps become less painful to myself if men want other motives to divert them from defamation than what their own hearts supply let them turn to my example and if they will not be reasoned let them be frightened out of their propensity  i am sir etc walter wormwood   the case of this correspondent is a melancholy one and i have admitted his letter because i do not doubt the present good motives of the writer but i shall not easily yield a place in these essays to characters so disgusting and representations so derogatory to human nature the historians of the day who profess to give us intelligence of what is passing in the world ought not to be condemned if they sometimes make a little free with our soibles and our follies but downright libels are grown too dangerous and scurrility is become too dull to find a market the pillory is a great reformer the detail of a court drawing room though not very edifying is perfectly inoffensive a lady cannot greatly complain of the liberty of the press if it is contented with the humble task of celebrating the workmanship of her mantuamaker as for such inveterate malice as my correspondent wormwood describes i flatter myself it is very rarely to be found i can only say that though i have often heard of it in conversation and read of it in books i do not meet in human nature originals so strongly featured as their paintings amongst a small collection of sonnets in manuscript descriptive of the human passions which has fallen into my hands the following lines upon envy as coinciding with my subject shall conclude this paper  envy oh never let me see that shape again exile me rather to some savage den far from the social haunts of men horrible phantom pale it was as death consumption fed upon its meager cheek and ever as the fiend essayed to speak dreadfully steamd its pestilential breath fangd like the wolf it was and all as gaunt and still it prowld around us and around rolling its squinting eyes askaunt wherever human happiness was found furious thereat the selftormenting sprite drew forth an asp and terrible to sight to its left pap the envenomed reptile pressed which gnawed and wormd into its tortured breast the desperate suicide with pain writhed to and fro and yelld amain and then with hollow dying cadence cries  it is not of this asp that envy dies it is not this reptiles tooth that gives the smart it is others happiness that gnaws my heart no cxxxi alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi derisor lecti sic nutum divitis horret sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit horat i am bewildered by the definitions which metaphysical writers give us of the human passions i can understand the characters of theophrastus and am entertained by his sketches but when your profound thinkers take the subject in hand they appear to me to dive to the bottom of the deep in search of that which floats upon its surface if a man in the heat of anger would describe the movements of his mind he might paint the tempest to the life but as such descriptions are not to be expected moral essayists have substituted personification in their place and by the pleasing introduction of a few natural incidents form a kind of little drama in which they make their fictitious hero describe those follies foibles and passions which they who really feel them are not so forward to confess  when mr lock in his essay on the human understanding describes all pity as partaking of contempt i cannot acknowledge that he is speaking of pity as i feel it when i pity a fellow creature in pain a woman for instance in the throes of childbirth i cannot submit to own there is any ingredient of so bad a quality as contempt in my pity but if the metaphysicians tell me that i do not know how to call my feelings by their right name and that my pity is not pity properly so defined i will not pretend to dispute with any gentleman whose language i do not understand and only beg permission to enjoy a sensation which i call pity without indulging a propensity which he calls contempt  the flatterer is a character which the moralists and wits of all times and all nations have ridiculed more severely and more successfully than almost any other yet it still exists and a few pages perhaps would not be misapplied if i was to make room for a civil kind of gentleman of this description by name billy simper who having seen his failings in their proper light of ridicule is willing to expose them to public view for the amusement it is hoped if not for the use and benefit of the reader  i beg leave therefore to introduce mr billy simper to my candid friends and protectors and shall leave him to tell his story in his own words   i am the younger son of a younger brother my father qualified himself for orders in the university of aberdeen and by the help of an insinuating address a soft countertenor voice a civil smile and a happy flexibility in the vertebrae of his backbone recommended himself to the good graces of a right reverend patron who after a due course of attendance and dependence presented him to a comfortable benefice which enabled him to support a pretty numerous family of children the good bishop it seems was passionately fond of the game of chess and my father though the better player of the two knew how to make a timely move so as to throw the victory into his lordships hands after a hard battle which was a triumph very grateful to his vanity and not a little serviceable to my fathers purposes  under this expert professor i was instructed in all the shifts and movements in the great game of life and then sent to make my way in the world as well as i was able my first object was to pay my court to my fathers elder brother the head of our family an enterprise not less arduous than important my uncle antony was a widower parsimonious peevish and recluse he was rich however egregiously selfconceited and in his own opinion a deep philosopher and metaphysician by which i would be understood to say that he doubted every thing disputed every thing and believed nothing he had one son his only child and him he had lately driven out of doors and disinherited for nonsuiting him in an argument upon the immortality of the soul here then was an opening no prudent man could miss who scorned to say his soul was his own when it stood in the way of his interest and as i was well tutored beforehand i no sooner gained admission to the old philosopher than i so far worked my way into his good graces as to be allowed to take possession of a trucklebed in a spare garret of the family mansion envy must have owned if envy could have looked asquint upon so humble a situation as mine was that considering what a game i had to play i managed my cards well for uncle antony was an old dog at a dispute and as that cannot well take place whilst both parties are on the same side i was forced at times to make battle for the good of the argument and seldom failed to find antony as completely puzzled with the zigzaggeries of his metaphysics as uncle toby of more worthy memory was with the hornworks and counterscarps of his fortifications  amongst the various topics from which antonys ingenuity drew matter of dispute some were so truly ridiculous that if i were sure my reader was as much at leisure to hear as i am just now to relate them i should not scruple the recital one morning having been rather longwinded in describing the circumstances of a dream that had disturbed his imagination in the night i thought it not amiss to throw in a remark in the way of consolation upon the fallacy of dreams in general this was enough for him to turn over to the other side and support the credit of dreams totis viribus i now thought it advisable to trim and took a middle course between both extremes by humbly conceiving dreams might be sometimes true and sometimes false this he contended to be nonsense upon the face of it and if i would undertake to show they were both true and false he would engage to prove by sound logic they could be neither one nor the other  but why do we begin to talk added he before we settle what we are to talk about what kind of dreams are you speaking of and how do you distinguish dreams  i see no distinction between them i replied dreams visit our fancies in sleep and are all according to mr lockes idea made up of the waking mans thoughts  does mr lock say that exclaimed my uncle then mr lockes an impostor for telling you so and you are a fool for believing him wiser men than mr lock have settled that matter many centuries before he was born or even dreamt of but perhaps mr lock forgot to tell you how many precise sorts of dreams there are and how to denominate and define them perhaps he forgot that i say i confessed that i neither knew any thing of the matter myself nor did i believe the author alluded to had left any clue toward the discovery  i thought as much retorted my uncle antony in a tone of triumph and yet this is the man who sets up for an investigator of the human understanding but i will tell you sir though he could not that there are neither more nor less than five several sorts of dreams particularly distinguished and i defy even the seven sleepers themselves to name a sixth the first of these was by the greeks denominated oneiros by the latins somnium simply a dream and you must be asleep to dream it granted quoth i what is granted rejoined the philosopher not that sleep is in all cases indispensable to the man who dreams  humph quoth i  my uncle proceeded  the second sort of dreams you shall understand was by the aforesaid greeks called orama by the latins visio or as we might say a vision in this case take notice you may be asleep or you may be awake or neither or as it were between both your eyes may be shut or they may be open looking inwards or outward or upwards either with sight or without sight as it pleases god but the vision you must see or how else can it rightly be called a vision true replied i there is a sect who are particularly favored with this kind of visions prithee dont interrupt me said my uncle and again went on  the third sort of dreams to speak according to the greeks we shall call chrematismos according to the latins we must denominate it oraculum an oracle now this differs from a vision in as much as it may happen to a man born blind as well as to argus himself for he has nothing for it but to listen understand and believe and whatever it tells him shall come true though it never entered into his head to preconceive one tittle of what is told him and where is mr lock and his waking thoughts here  he is done for i answered there is no disputing against an oracle  the fourth sort resumed he is the enuption of the aforesaid greeks and answers to the latin insomnium which is in fact a dream and no dream a kind of resverie when a man doses between sleeping and waking and builds castles as we say in the air upon the ramblings of his own fancy  the fifth and last sort of dreams is by greeks and latins mutually styled phantasma a word adopted into our own language by the greatest poet who ever wrote in it now this phantasma is a visitation peculiar to the first mental absence or slumber when the man fancies himself yet waking and in fact can scarce be called asleep at which time strange images and appearances seem to float before him and terrify his imagination here then you have all the several denominations of dreams perfectly distinguished and defined quoth the old sophist and throwing himself back in his chair with an air of triumph waited for the applause which i was not backward in bestowing upon this pedantic farrago of dogmatizing dullness  it will readily be believed that my uncle antony did not fail to revive his favorite controversy which had produced such fatal consequences to his discarded son in fact he held fast with those ancient philosophers who maintained the eternity of this material world and as he saw no period when men would not be in existence no moment in time to come when mortality shall cease he by consequence argued that there could be no moment in time when immortality shall commence there were other points respecting this grand stumbling block of his philosophy the human soul upon which he was equally puzzled for he sided with aristotle against plato in the unintelligible controversy concerning its power of motion but whilst my uncle antony was thus unluckily wedded to the wrong side in all cases where reason ought to have been his guide in points of mere quibble and sophistry which reason has nothing to say to and where a wise man would take neither side he regularly took both or hung suspended between them like socrates in the basket  of this sort was the celebrated question  ovumne prius fuerit an gallina  viz whether the egg was anterior to the hen or the hen to the egg  this enquiry never failed to interest his passions in a peculiar degree and he found so much to say on both sides that he could never well determine which side to be of at length however hoping to bring it to some point he took up the cause of egg versus hen and having composed a learned essay published it in one of the monthly magazines as a lure to future controversialists this essay he had so often avowed in my hearing and piqued himself so highly upon it that i must have been dull indeed not to have understood how to flatter him upon it but when he had found month after month slip away and nobody mounting the stage upon his challenge he felt angry at the contempt with which his labors were passed over and without imparting to me his purpose furnished the same magazine with a counteressay in which his former argument was handled with an asperity truly controversial and the hen was triumphantly made to cackle over the newlaid egg decidedly posterior to herself  i am inclined to think that if antony had any partiality it was not to this side but as the second essay was clearly posterior to the first whatever the egg may have been to the hen it had the advantage of being couched in all the spirit of a reply with an agreeable tinge of the malice of one so that when at length it came down printed in a fair type and respectfully posted in the front of the longwishtfor magazine his heart beat with joy and calling out to me in a lofty tone of counterfeited anger as he run his eye over it  by the horns of jupiter ammon quoth he here is a fellow has the confidence to enter the lists against me in the notable question of the egg  then i hope you will break that egg about his ears replied i  hold your tongue puppy and listen quoth the sophist and immediately began to read  at every pause i was ready with a pooh or a pish which i hooked in with every mark of contempt i could give it both by accent and action at the conclusion of the essay my uncle antony shut the book and demanded what i thought of the author  hang him i exclaimed poor grubstreet garreteer the fellow is too contemptible for your notice he can neither write nor reason he is a mere ignoramus and does not know the commonest rules of logic he has no feature of a critic about him but the malice of one  hold your tongue cried antony no longer able to contain himself you are a booby i will maintain it to be as fine an essay as ever was written  with these words he snatched up the magazine and departed i saw no more of him that night and early next morning was presented by a servant with the following billet  the grubstreet garreteer finds himself no longer fit company for the sagacious mr william simper therefore desires him without loss of time to seek out better society than that of a mere ignoramus who does not know the common rules of logic one rule however he makes bold to lay down which is never again to see the face of an impertinent upstart called william simper whilst he remains on this earth a s  no cxxxii sunt verba et voces quibus hunc lenire dolorent possis et magnam morbi deponere partem horat driven from my uncle antonys doors by my unlucky mistake between the hen and her egg my case would have been desperate but that i had yet one string left to my bow and this was my aunt mrs susanna simper who lived within a few miles of my uncle but in such declared hostility that i promised myself a favorable reception if i could but flatter her animosity with a sufficient portion of invective and for this i deemed myself very tolerably qualified having so much good will toward the business and no slight inducements to spur me to it  my aunt who was an aged maiden and a valetudinarian was at my arrival closeted with her apothecary upon his departure i was admitted to my audience in which i acquitted myself with all the address i was master of my aunt heard my story through without interrupting me by a single word at last fixing her eyes upon me she said it is very well child you have said enough your uncles character i perfectly understand look well to your own for upon that will depend the terms you and i shall be upon  she now took up a phial from the table and surveying it for some time said to me  here is a nostrum recommended by my apothecary that promises great things but perhaps contains none of the wondrous properties it professes to have the label says it is a carminative sedative mixture in other words it will expel vapors and spasms and quiet the mind and spirits do you think it will make good what it promises  so whimsical a question put to me at such a moment confounded me not a little and i only murmured out in reply that i hoped it would  take it then said my aunt as you have faith in it swallow it yourself and when i see how it operates with you i may have more confidence in it on my own account  i was now in a more awkward dilemma than ever for she had emptied the dose into a cup and tendered it to me in so peremptory a manner that not knowing how to excuse myself and being naturally submissive i silently took the cup with a trembling hand and swallowed its abominable contents  much good may it do you child cried she you have done more for me than i would for any doctor in the kingdom dont you find it nauseous to the palate  i confessed that it was very nauseous  and did you think yourself in need of such a medicine  i did not perceive that i was then you did not swallow it by your own choice but my desire  i had no hesitation in acknowledging that  upon my word child she replied you have a very accommodating way with you i was now fighting with the cursed drug and had all the difficulty in life to keep it where it was my aunt saw my distress and smiling at it demanded if i was not sick i confessed i was rather discomposed in my stomach with the draught  i dont doubt it she replied but as you have so civilly made yourself sick for my sake cannot you flatter me so far as to be well when i request it i was just then struggling to keep the nausea down and though i could not answer put the best face upon the matter in my power  a maidservant came in upon my aunts ringing her bell  betty said she take away these things this doctor will poison us with his doses  foh cried the wench how it smells nay but only put your lips to the cup said the mistress there is enough left for you to taste it  i taste it i will not touch it i want none of his nasty physic  well but though you dont want it rejoined the mistress taste it nevertheless if it be only to flatter my humor  excuse me madam replied betty i will not make myself sick to flatter any body  humph cried my aunt how this wenchs want of manners must have shocked you nephew william you swallowed the whole dose at a word she though my servant at my repeated command would not touch it with her lips but these lowbred creatures have a will of their own  there was something in my aunts manner i did not understand she puzzled me and i thought it best to keep myself on the reserve and wait the further developement of her humor in silence  we went down to supper it was elegantly served and my aunt particularly recommended two or three dishes to me her hospitality embarrassed me not a little for my stomach was by no means reconciled yet i felt myself bound in good manners to eat of her dishes and commend their cookery this i did though sorely against the grain and whilst my stomach rose against its food i flattered what i nauseated  a grave welllooking personage stood at the sideboard with whom my aunt entered into conversation  johnson said she i think i must lodge my nephew in your room which is warm and wellaired and dispose of you in the tapestry chamber which has not lately been slept in  madam replied johnson i am ready to give up my bed to mr william at your command but as to sleeping in the tapestry chamber you must excuse me why replied my aunt what is your objection i am almost ashamed to tell you answered johnson but every body has his humor perhaps my objection may be none to the young gentleman but i confess i dont choose to pass the night in a chamber that is under an ill name an ill name for what demanded the lady for being haunted answered the butler for being visited by noises and rattling of chains and apparitions the gentleman no doubt is a scholar and can account for these things i am a plain man and dont like to have my imagination disturbed nor my rest broken though it were only by my own fancies what then is to be done said my aunt directing her question to me johnson dont choose to trust himself in a haunted chamber i shall have my house brought into discredit by these reports now nephew if you will encounter this ghost and exorcise the chamber by sleeping in it a few nights i dare say we shall hear no more of it are you willing to undertake it  i was ashamed to confess my fears and yet had no stomach to the undertaking i was also afraid of giving umbrage to my aunt and impressing her with an unfavourable opinion of me i therefore assented upon the condition of johnsons taking part of the bed with me upon which the old lady turning to her butler said well johnson you have no objection to this proposal pardon me madam said he i have such objections to that chamber that i will not sleep in it for any body living you see he is obstinate said my aunt you must even undertake it alone or my house will lie under an ill name for ever sooner than this shall be the case i replied i will sleep in the chamber by myself you are very polite cried my aunt and i admire your spirit johnson light my nephew to his room johnson took up the candle but absolutely refused to march before me with the light when we came into the gallery where pointing to a door he told me that was my chamber and hastily made his retreat down the stairs  i opened the door with no small degree of terror and found a chamber comfortably and elegantly furnished and by no means of that melancholy cast which i had pictured to myself from johnsons report of it my first precaution was to search the closet i then peeped under the bed examined the hangings all was as it should be nothing seemed to augur a ghost or which i take to be worse the counterfeit of a ghost i plucked up as good a spirit as i could said my prayers and turned into bed with the darkness my terrors returned i passed a sleepless night though neither ghost nor noise of any sort molested me  why said i within myself could not i be as sincere and peremptory as johnson he takes his rest and is at peace i am sleepless and in terrors though a servant by condition in his will he is independent i who have not the like call of duty have not the same liberty of mind he refuses what he does not choose to obey i obey all things whether i choose them or not and wherefore do i this because i am a flatterer and why did i swallow a whole nauseous dose to humor my aunts caprice which her own chambermaid who receives her wages would not touch with her lips because i am a flatterer and what has this flattery done for me who am a slave to it what did i gain by it at my uncles i was the echo of his opinions shifted as they shifted sided with him against truth demonstration reason and even the evidence of my own senses abject wretch i sunk myself in my own esteem first then lost all shadow of respect with him and was finally expelled from his doors whilst i was in the very act of prostituting my own judgment to his gross absurdities and now again here i am at my aunts devoted to the same mean flattery that has already so shamefully betrayed me what has flattery gained for me here a bitter harvest truly i have had of it poisoned by an infernal dose which i had no plea for swallowing surfeited by dainties i had no appetite to taste and now condemned to sleepless hours within a haunted chamber which her own domestic would not consent even to enter fool that i am to be the dupe of such a vapor as flattery despicable wretch not to assert a freedom of will which is the natural right of every man and which even servants and hirelings exercise with a spirit i envy but have not the heart to imitate i am ashamed of my own meanness i blush for myself in the comparison and am determined if i survive till tomorrow to assert the dignity of a man and abide by the consequences  in meditations like these night passed away and the dawn of morning called me from my bed i rose and refreshed my spirits with a walk through a most charming plantation i met a countryman at his work  friend said i you are early at your labor  yes answered he it is by my labor i live and whilst i have health and strength to follow it i have nothing to fear but god alone so thought i here is a lesson for me this man is no flatterer then why do i worship what a clown despises  i found my aunt ready for breakfast she questioned me about my nights rest i answered her with truth that i had enjoyed no rest but had neither seen nor heard any thing to alarm me and was persuaded there were no grounds for the report of her chamber being haunted i am as well persuaded as yourself of that she replied i know it is only one of johnsons whims but people you know will have their whims and it was great courtesy in you to sacrifice a nights rest to his humor my servants have been spoilt by indulgence but it is to be hoped they will learn better submission by your example there was a sarcastic tone in my aunts manner of uttering this which gave it more the air of ridicule than compliment and i blushed to the eyes with the consciousness of deserving it  after breakfast she took me into her closet and desiring me to sit down to a writing table nephew says she i know my brother antony full well he is a tyrant in his nature a bigot to his opinions and a man of a most perverted understanding but he is rich and you have your fortune to make he can insult but you can flatter he has his weaknesses and you can avail yourself of them suppose you write him a penitential letter  i now saw the opportunity present for exerting my newmade resolution and felt a spirit rising within me that prompted me to deliver myself as follows no madam i will neither gratify my uncles pride nor lower my own selfesteem by making him any submission i despise him for the insults he has put upon me and myself for having in some sort deserved them but i will never flatter him or any living creature more and if i am to forfeit your favor by resisting your commands i must meet the consequences and will rather trust to my own labor for support than depend upon the caprice of any person living least of all on him heyday cried my aunt you refuse to write  you will not do as i advise you in this particular i replied permit me to say i neither can nor will obey you and you are resolved to think and act for yourself in the present case i am and in all cases let me add where my honor and my conscience tell me i am right then exclaimed my aunt i acknowledge you for my nephew i adopt you from this hour and with that she took me by the hand most cordially i saw said she or thought i saw the symptoms of an abject spirit in you and was resolved to put my suspicions to the test all that has past here since your coming has been done in concert and by way of trial your haunted chamber the pretended fears of my butler his blunt refusal all have been experiments to found your character and i should totally have despaired of you had not this last instance of a manly spirit restored you to my esteem you have now only to persist in the same line of conduct to confirm my good opinion of you and ensure your own prosperity and happiness  thus i have given my history and if the example of my reformation shall warn others from the contemptible character which i have fortunately escaped from i shall be most happy being truly anxious to approve myself the friend of mankind and the observers very sincere wellwisher  will simper  no cxxxiii cito scribendo non fit ut been scribatur been scribendo fit ut cito quintil lib x the celebrated author of the rambler in his concluding paper says i have labored to refine our language to grammatical purity and to clear it from colloquial barbarisms licentious idioms and irregular combinations something perhaps i have added to the elegance of its construction and something to the harmony of its cadence i hope our language has gained all the profit which the labors of this meritorious writer were exerted to produce in style of a certain description he undoubtedly excels but though i think there is much in his essays for a reader to admire i should not recommend them as a model for a disciple to copy  simplicity ease and perspicuity should be the first objects of a young writer addison and other authors of his class will furnish him with examples and assist him in the attainment of these excellencies but after all the style in which a man shall write will not be formed by imitation only it will be the style of his mind it will assimilate itself to his mode of thinking and take its color from the complexion of his ordinary discourse and the company he consorts with as for that distinguishing characteristic which the ingenious essayist terms very properly the harmony of its cadence that i take to be incommunicable and immediately dependant upon the ear of him who models it this harmony of cadence is so strong a mark of discrimination between authors of note in the world of letters that we can depose to a style whose modulation we are familiar with almost as confidently as to the handwriting of a correspondent but though i think there will be found in the periods of every established writer a certain peculiar tune whether harmonious or otherwise which will depend rather upon the natural ear than upon the imitative powers yet i would not be understood to say that the study of good models can fail to be of use in the first formation of it when a subject presents itself to the mind and thoughts arise which are to be committed to writing it is then for a man to choose whether he will express himself in simple or in elaborate diction whether he will compress his matter or dilate it ornament it with epithets and robe it in metaphor or whether he will deliver it plainly and naturally in such language as a wellbred person and a scholar would use who affects no parade of speech nor aims at any flights of fancy let him decide as he will in all these cases he has models in plenty to choose from which may be said to court his imitation  for instance if his ambition is to glitter and surprise with the figurative and metaphorical brilliancy of his period let him tune his ear to some such passages as the following where doctor johnson in the character of critic and biographer is pronouncing upon the poet congreve his scenes exhibit not much of humor imagery or passion his personages are a kind of intellectual gladiators every sentence is to ward or strike the contest of smartness is never intermitted his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate coruscations if he can learn to embroider with as much spendor taste and address as this and many other samples from the same master exhibit he cannot study in a better school  on the contrary if simplicity be his object and a certain serenity of style which seems in unison with the soul he may open the spectator and take from the first paper of mr addison the first paragraph that meets his eye  the following for instance  there is nothing that makes its way more directly to the soul than beauty which immediately diffuses a secret satisfaction and complacency through the imagination and gives a finishing to any thing that is great or uncommon the very first discovery of it strikes the mind with an inward joy and spreads a cheerfulness and delight through all its faculties or again in the same essay we no where meet with a more glorious or pleasing show in nature than what appears in the heavens at the rising and setting of the sun which is wholly made up of those different stains of light that show themselves in clouds of a different situation a florid writer would hardly have resisted the opportunities which here court the imagination to indulge its flights whereas few writers of any sort would have been tempted on a topic merely critical to have employed such figurative and spendid diction as that of doctor johnson these little samples therefore though selected with little or no care but taken as they came to hand may serve to exemplify my meaning and in some degree characterize the different styles of the respective writers  now as every student who is capable of copying either of these styles or even of comparing them must discern on which side the greater danger of miscarrying lies as well as the greater disgrace in case of such miscarriage prudence will direct him in his outset not to hazard the attempt at a florid diction if his ear has not been vitiated by vulgar habitudes he will only have to guard against mean expressions whilst he is studying to be simple and perspicuous he will put his thoughts into language naturally as they present themselves giving them for the present little more than mere grammatical correction afterward upon a closer review he will polish those parts that seem rude harmonize them where they are unequal compress what is too diffusive raise what is low and attune the whole to that general cadence which seems most grateful to his ear  but if our student has been smitten with the turbulent oratory of the senate the acrimonious declamation of the bar or the pompous eloquence of the pulpit and shall take the lofty speakers in these several orders for his models rather than such as address the ear in humbler tones his passions will in that case hurry him into the florid and figurative style to a sublime and swelling period and if in this he excels it must be owned he accomplishes a great and arduous task and he will gain a liberal share of applause from the world which in general is apt to be captivated with those high and towering images that strike and surprise the senses in this style the hebrew prophets write whose discourse to use the words of the learned doctor bentley after the genius of the eastern nations is thick setwith metaphor and allegory the same bold comparisons and dithyrambic liberty of style every where occurring  for when the spirit of god came upon them and breathed a new warmth and vigor through all the powers of the body and soul when by the influx of divine light the whole scene of christs heavenly kingdom was represented to their view so that their hearts were ravished with joy and their imaginations turgid and pregnant with the glorious ideas then surely if ever their style would be strong and lofty full of allusions to all that is great and magnificent in the kingdoms of this world commencement sermon  and these flights of imagination these effusions of rapture and sublimity will occasionally be found in the pulpit eloquence of some of our most correct and temperate writers witness that brilliant apostrophe at the conclusion of the ninth discourse of bishop sherlock than whom few or none have written with more didactic brevity and simplicity  go says he to the deists go to your natural religion lay before her mahomet and his disciples arrayed in armor and in blood riding in triumph over the spoils of thousands and tens of thousands who fell by his victorious sword show her the cities which he set in flames the countries which he ravaged and destroyed and the miserable distress of all the inhabitants of the earth when she has viewed him in this scene carry her into his retirements show her the prophets chamber his concubines and wives let her see his adultery and hear him allege revelation and his divine commission to justify his lust and oppression when she is tired with this prospect then show her the blessed jesus humble and meek doing good to all the sons of men patiently instructing both the ignorant and perverse let her see him in his most retired privacies let her follow him to the mount and hear his devotions and supplications to god carry her to his table to view his poor fare and hear his heavenly discourse let her see him injured but not provoked let her attend him to the tribunal and consider the patience with which he endured the scoffs and reproaches of his enemies lead her to his cross and let her view him in the agony of death and hear his last prayer for his persecutors  father forgive them for they know not what they do  this is a lofty passage in the high imperative tone of declamation it is richly colored boldly contrasted and replete with imagery and is amongst the strongest of those instances where the orator addresses himself to the senses and passions of his hearers but let the disciple tread this path with caution let him wait the call and be sure he has an occasion worthy of his efforts before he makes them  allegory personification and metaphor will press upon his imagination at certain times but let him soberly consult his judgment in those moments and weigh their fitness before he admits them into his style as for allegory it is at best but a kind of fairy form it is hard to naturalize it and it will rarely fill a graceful part in any manly composition with respect to personification as i am speaking of prose only it is but an exotic ornament and may be considered rather as the loan of the muses than as the property of prose let our student therefore beware how he borrows the feathers of the jay lest his unnatural finery should only serve to make him pointed at and despised metaphor on the other hand is common property and he may take his share of it provided he has discretion not to abuse his privilege and neither surfeits the appetite with repletion nor confounds the palate with too much variety let his metaphor be apposite single and unconfused and it will serve him as a kind of rhetorical lever to lift and elevate his style above the pitch of ordinary discourse let him also so apply this machine as to make it touch in as many points as possible otherwise it can never so poise the weight above it as to keep it firm and steady on its proper center  to give an example of the right use and application of this figure i again apply to a learned author already quoted  our first parents having fallen from their native state of innocence the tincture of evil like an hereditary disease infected all their posterity and the leaven of sin having once corrupted the whole mass of mankind all the species ever after would be soured and tainted with it the vicious ferment perpetually diffusing and propagating itself through all generations  bentley comm sermon  there will be found also in certain writers a profusion of words ramifying indeed from the same root yet rising into climax by their power and importance which seems to burst forth from the overflow and impetuosity of the imagination resembling at first sight what quintilian characterises as the abundantia juvenilis but which when tempered by the hand of a master will upon closer examination be found to bear the stamp of judgment under the appearance of precipitancy i need only turn to the famous commencement sermon before quoted and my meaning will be fully illustrated  let them tell us then what is the chain the cement the magnetism what they will call it the invisible tie of that union whereby matter and an incorporeal mind things that have no similitude or alliance to each other can so sympathize by a mutual league of motion and sensation no they will not pretend to that for they can frame no conceptions of it they are sure there is such an union from the operations and effects but the cause and the manner of it are too subtle and secret to be discovered by the eye of reason it is mystery it is divine magic it is natural miracle  no cxxxiv  democrates remember only that your words be true no matter then how many or how few  to the observer i have a habit of dealing in the mavelous which i cannot overcome some people who seem to take a pleasure in magnifying the little flaws to be found in all characters call this by a name which no gentleman ought to use or likes to hear the fact is i have so much tender consideration for truth in her state of nakedness that till i have put her into decent clothing i cannot think of bringing her into company and if her appearance is sometimes so much altered by dress that her best friends cannot find her out am i to blame for that  there is a matteroffact man of my acquaintance who haunts me in all places and is the very torment of my life he sticks to me as the thresher does to the whale and is the perfect nightmare of my imagination this fellow never lets one of my stories pass without docking it like an attorneys bill before a master in chancery he cut forty miles out of a journey of one hundred which but for him i had performed in one day upon the same horse in which i confess i had stretched a point for the pleasure of outriding a fat fellow in company who by the malicious veracity of my aforesaid damper threw me at least ten miles distance behind him  this provoking animal cut up my success in so many intrigues and adventures that i was determined to lay my plan out of his reach in a spot which i had provided for an evil day and accordingly i led him a dance into corsica where i was sure he could not follow me here i had certainly been and knew my ground well enough to prance over it at a very handsome rate i noticed a kind of sly leer in some of the company which was pointed toward a gentleman present who was a stranger to me and so far from joining in the titter was very politely attentive to what i was relating i was at this moment warm in the cause of freedom and had performed such prodigies of valor in its defense that before my story was well ended i had got upon such close terms with general paoli that had my hearers been but half as credulous as they ought to have been they might have set us down for sworn friends and inseparables but here again as ill luck would have it my evil genius tapt me on the shoulder and remarking that i principally addressed myself to the gentleman whose politeness and attention were so flattering said to me with a smile that had the malice of the devil in it  give me leave to introduce you to general paoli here present  death and confusion what i felt a stroke of lightning would have been charity compared to this  my persecutor had not done with me  i am afraid you have forgot your old friend and familiar who no doubt will be overjoyed at recognizing a brother warrior who has performed such noble services jointly with himself in the glorious struggle for the liberties of his beloved country  can i paint the shame i suffered at this moment it is impossible i can only say there is a generosity in true valor which scorns to triumph over the fallen  there were so many brave men said that gallant person in a tone i shall never lose the impression of of whose services i shall ever preserve a grateful memory but whose persons have slipped from my recollection that i have only to entreat your pardon for a forgetfulness which i desire you to believe is not my fault but my infirmity  if a bottle had been vollied at my head i could not have been more in need of a surgeon than i was at this instant i could never have suspected truth of playing me such a jades trick i always considered her as a goodnatured simple creature without gall or bitterness and was in the habit of treating her accordingly but this was such a specimen of her malice that i fled out of her company as hastily as i could  the very next morning i took my passage in the stagecoach for my native town in the north of england heartily out of humor with my trip to corsica but even here i could not shake off old habits so far as to resist the temptation of getting into a postchaise for the last stage by which maneuver i took the credit of having traveled like a gentleman and became entitled to rail against the posttax and the expenses of the road  i was now voted into a club of the chief inhabitants of the place and as i had no reason to believe the story of my late discomfiture had reached them i soon recovered my spirits and with them the amplifying powers of my invention my stories for a considerable time were swallowed so glibly and seemed to sit so easy on the stomachs of these natural unsophisticated people that i was encouraged to increase the dose to such a degree as seemed at length to produce something like a nausea with those i administered it to especially with a certain precise personage of the sect of quakers one simon stiff a wealthy trader and much respected for his probity and fairdealing simon had a way of asking me at the end of a story  but is it true  which sometimes disconcerted me and considerably lessened the applauses that the rest of the club had been accustomed to bestow upon my narratives  one evening when i had been describing an enormous shark by which i had been attacked in one of my west india voyages simon stiff lifting up both his hands in an attitude of astonishment cried out  verily friend cracker thou drawest a long bow with an angry look i demanded the meaning of that expression  i mean replied simon thou speak the thing which is not that is as much as to say i tell a lie  even so friend thou have hit it said simon without altering his voice or regarding the tone of rage i had thrown mine into the steady serenity of his countenance put me down and i suffered him to proceed without interruption  thou have told us many things friend cracker that are perfectly incredible were i to attempt imposing upon my customers in the way of traffic as thou do upon thy company in the way of talk the world would justly set me down for a dishonest man believe me thou may be a very good companion without swerving from the truth nay thou can no otherwise be a good one than by adhering to it for if thou art in the practice of uttering falsehoods we shall be in the practice of disbelieving thee even when thou speak the truth and so there will be an end of all confidence in society and thy word will pass for nothing i have observed it is thy vanity that betrays thee into falsehood i should have hoped thou would not have forgotten how thy falsehood betrayed thee into shame and how we received and welcomed thee into our society when thy friends in the metropolis had hooted thee out of theirs think not thou can establish a credit with us by the fictions of imagination plain truths suit men of plain understandings had thy shark been as big again as thou would have us believe it was what would thou have gained by it nothing but the merit of having seen a monster and what is that compared to the risque of being thought a monstermaker if thou wast snatched from the jaws of the animal by the hand of god give god the praise if thine own courage and address contributed to save thee give him still the praise who inspired thee with those means of furthering his providence in thy rescue where is the ground for boasting in all this sometimes thou would persuade us thou art a man of consequence in the favor of princes and in the secrets of ministers if we are to believe all this thou do but libel those ministers for letting such a babbler into their councils and if thou think to gain a consequence with us thereby thou art grievously deceived friend cracker for we do not want to know what thou ought not to tell and we despise the servant who betrayeth his masters trust as for wonders what signifies telling us of them the time is full of wonders the revolution of empires the fall of despotism and the emancipation of mankind are objects whose superior magnitude makes thy shark shrink into an atom had the monster gorged thee at a mouthful how many thousands nay tens of thousands have the voracious jaws of death devoured in a succession of campaigns which have made creation melt did thou escape the monster what then how can we have leisure to reflect upon thy single deliverance when we call to mind the numbers of despairing captives who have been liberated from the dungeons of tyranny in a word friend cracker if it is through a love for the mavelous thou make so free with the sacred name of truth thou do but abuse our patience and thine own time in hunting after sharks and monsters of the deep and if thou have any other motive for fiction than the above it must be a motive less innocent than what i have supposed and in that case we hold thee dangerous to society and a disgrace to human nature  here he concluded and though the length and deliberate solemnity of his harangue had given me time enough yet i had not so availed myself of it as to collect my thoughts and prepare myself for any kind of defense how to deal with this formal old fellow i knew not to cudgel him was a service of more danger than i saw fit to engage in for he was of athletic limbs and stature to challenge him to a gentlemans satisfaction being a quaker would have subjected me to universal ridicule i rose from my chair took my hat from the peg and abruptly quitted the room next morning i sent to cut my name out of the club but behold they had saved me that ceremony overnight and i had once more a new set of acquaintance to go in search of  in this solitary interim i strove to lighten the burden of time by starting a correspondence with one of our public prints and so long as i supplied it with anecdotes from the country i may say without vanity there was neither fire nor flood murder rape nor robbery wanting to embellish it i broke two or three necks at a horserace without any detriment to the community and for the amusement of my readers drove over blind beggars drowned drunken farmers and tossed women with child by mad bullocks without adding one item to the bills of mortality i made matches without number which the register never recorded i was at the same time a correspondent at brussels a resident in spain and a traveller at constantinople who gave secret information of all proceedings in those several places and by the mysterious style in which i enveloped my dispatches nobody could fix a falsehood on my intelligence till i imprudently fought a battle on the banks of the danube after the armies were gone into winter quarters which did the turk no mischief and effectually blasted me with the compiler and him with the public  i am now out of business and if you want any thing in my way to enliven your observers which give me leave to remark are sometimes rather of the dullest i shall be proud to serve you being  your very humble servant at command kit cracker   n b i do not want any thing in kit crackers way but though i decline the offer of his assistance i willingly avail myself of the moral of his example  no cxxxv a writer of miscellaneous essays is open to the correspondence of persons of all descriptions and though i think fit to admit the following letter into my collection i hope my readers will not suppose i wish to introduce the writer of it into their company or even into my own  to the observer sir as we hear a great deal of the affluence of this flourishing country and the vast quantity of sleeping cash as it is called locked up in vaults and strong boxes we conceive it would be a good deed to waken some of it and put it into use and circulation we have therefore associated ourselves into a patriotic fraternity of circulators commonly called pickpockets but with sorrow we let you know that notwithstanding our best endeavors to put forward the purposes of our institution and the great charges of providing ourselves with instruments and tools of all sorts for the better furtherance of our business we have yet hooked up little except dirty handkerchiefs leathern snuffboxes empty purses and bathmetal watches from the pockets of the public articles these let me say that would hardly be received at the depot of the patriotic contributors in paris are these the symptoms of a great and wealthy nation we blush for our country whilst we are compelled by truth and candor to reply  they are not  as we have a number of petty articles on hand which will not pass in our trade nothing deters us from putting them up to public cant but the tax our unworthy parliament has laid upon auctions i send you two or three papers which a brother artist angled out of the pocket of a penniless gentleman the other night at the playhouse door the one a letter signed urania the other gorgon they can be of no use to us as we have nothing to do with uranias virtue nor stand in need of gorgon to paint scenes which we can act better than he describes neither do we want his effigy of a man under the gallows to remind us of what we must all come to  yours crookfingered jack   the letter from urania breathes the full spirit of that amiable ambition which at present seems generally to inspire our heroines of the stage to accept of none but shining characters and never to present themselves to the public but as illustrious models of purity and grace if virtue be thus captivating by resemblance only how beautiful must it be in the reality i cannot however help pitying the unknown poet whose hopes were dashed with the following rebuke  sir i have run my eye over your tragedy and am beyond measure surprised you could think of allotting a part to me which is so totally unamiable sir i neither can nor will appear in any public character which is at variance with my private one and though i have no objection to your scene of selfmurder and flatter myself i could do it justice yet my mind revolts from spilling any blood but my own  i confess there are many fine passages and some very striking situations that would fall to my lot in your drama but permit me to tell you sir that until you can clear up the legitimacy of the child you have been pleased therein to lay at my door and will find a father for it whom i may not blush to own for a husband you must never hope for the assistance of your humble servant  urania   the other letter is addressed to the same unfortunate poet from an artist who seems to have studied nature in her deformities only  dear dismal i wait with impatience to hear of the success of your tragedy and in the mean time have worked off a frontispiece for it that you who have a passion for the terrific will be perfectly charmed with  i am scandalized when i hear people say that the fine arts are protected in this country nothing can be further from the truth as i am one amongst many to witness painting i presume will not be disputed to be one of the fine arts and i may say without vanity i have some pretensions to rank with the best of my brethren in that profession  my first studies were carried on in the capital of a certain county where i was born and being determined to choose a striking subject for my debut in the branch of portraitpainting i persuaded my grandmother to sit to me and i am bold to say there was great merit in my picture considering it as a maiden production particularly in the execution of a hairmole upon her chin and a wart under her eye which i touched to such a nicety as to make every body start who cast their eyes upon the canvass  there was a little dwarfish lad in the parish who besides the deformity of his person had a remarkable harelip which exposed to view a broken row of discolored teeth and was indeed a very brilliant subject for a painter of effect i gave a fulllength of him that was executed so to the life as to turn the stomach of every body who looked upon it  at this time there came into our town a traveling showman who amongst other curiosities of the savage kind brought with him a manape or ourongoutong and this person having seen and admired my portrait of the little humpbacked dwarf employed me to take the figure of his celebrated savage for the purpose of displaying it on the outside of his booth such an occasion of introducing my art into notice spurred my genius to extraordinary exertions and though i must premise that the savage was not the best sitter in the world yet i flatter myself i acquitted myself to the satisfaction of his keeper and did justice to the ferocity of my subject i caught him in one of his most striking attitudes standing erect with a huge club in his paw i put every muscle into play and threw such a terrific dignity into his features as would not have disgraced the character of a nero or caligula i was happy to observe the general notice which was taken of my performance by all the country folks who resorted to the show and i believe my employer had no cause to repent of having set me upon the work  the figure of this animal with the club in his paw suggested a hint to a publican in the place of treating his alehouse with a new sign and as he had been in the service of a noble family who from ancient time have borne the bear and ragged staff for their erest he gave me a commission to provide him with a sign to that effect though i spared no pains to get a real bear to sit to me for his portrait my endeavors proved abortive and i was forced to resort to such common prints of that animal as i could obtain and trusted to my imagination for supplying what else might be wanted for the piece as i worked upon this capital design in the room where my grandmothers portrait was before my eyes it occurred to me to introduce the same hairmole into the whiskers of bruin which i had so successfully copied from her chin and certainly the thought was a happy one for it had a picturesque effect but in doing this i was naturally enough though undesignedly betrayed into giving such a general resemblance to the good dame in the rest of bruins features that when it came to be exhibited on the signpost all the people cried out upon the likeness and a malicious rumor ran through the town that i had painted my grandmother instead of the bear which lost me the favor of that indulgent relation though heaven knows i was as innocent of the intention as the child unborn  the disgust my grandmother conceived against her likeness with the ragged staff gave me incredible uneasiness and as she was a good customer to the landlord and much respected in the place he was induced to return the bear upon my hands i am now thinking to what use i can turn him and as it occurs to me that by throwing a little more authority into his features and gilding his chain he might very possibly hit the likeness of some lord mayor of london in his furgown and gold chain and make a respectable figure in some city hall i am willing to dispose of him to any such at an easy price  as i have also preserved a sketch of my famous ourongoutong a thought has struck me that with a few finishing touches he might easily be converted into a caliban for the tempest and when that is done i shall not totally despair of his obtaining a niche in the shakspere gallery  it has been common with the great masters rubens vandyke sir joshua reynolds and others when they paint a warrior or other great personage on horseback to throw a dwarf or some such contrasted figure into the background should any artist be in want of such a thing i can very readily supply him with my harelipped boy if otherwise i am not totally without hopes that he may suit some spanish grandee when any such shall visit this country upon his travels or in the character of ambassador from that illustrious court  before i conclude i shall beg leave to observe that i have a complete set of readymade devils that would do honor to saint antony or any other person who may be in want of such accompaniments to set off the selfdenying virtues of his character i have also a fine parcel of murdered innocents which i meant to have filled up with the story of herod but if any gentleman thinks fit to lay the scene in ghent and make a modern composition of it i am bold to say my pretty babes will not disgrace the pathos of the subject nor violate the costuma i took a notable sketch of a man hanging and seized him just in the dying twitches before the last stretch gave a stiffness and rigidity unfavourable to the human figure this i would willingly accommodate to the wishes of any lady who is desirous of preserving a portrait of her lover friend or husband in that interesting attitude  these cum multis aliis are part of my stock on hand and i hope upon my arrival at my lodgings in bloodbowlalley to exhibit them with much credit to myself and to the entire satisfaction of such of my neighbors in that quarter as may incline to patronize the fine arts and restore the credit of this drooping country  yours gorgon   no cxxxvi   menander still to be tattling still to prate no luxury in life so great  the humors and characters of a populous county town at a distance from the capital furnish matter of much amusement to a curious observer i have now been some weeks resident in a place of this description where i have been continually treated with the private lives and little scandalizing anecdotes of almost every person of any note in it having passed most of my days in the capital i could not but remark the striking difference between it and these subordinate capitals in this particular in london we are in the habit of looking to our own affairs and caring little about those with whom we have no dealings here every bodys business seems to be no less his neighbors concern than his own a set of tattling gossips including all the idlers in the place male as well as female seem to have no other employment for their time or tongue but to run from house to house and circulate their silly stories up and down a few of these contemptible impertinents i shall now describe  miss penelope tabby is an antiquated maiden of at least forty years standing a great observer of decorum and particularly hurt by the behavior of two young ladies who are her nextdoor neighbors for a custom they have of lolling out of their windows and talking to fellows in the street the charge cannot be denied for it is certainly a practice these young ladies indulge themselves in very freely but on the other hand it must be owned miss pen tabby is also in the habit of lolling out of her window at the same time to stare at them and put them to shame for the levity of their conduct they have also the crime proved upon them of being unpardonably handsome and this they neither can nor will attempt to contradict miss pen tabby is extremely regular at morning prayers but she complains heavily of a young staring fellow in the pew next to her own who violates the solemnity of the service by ogling her at her devotions he has a way of leaning over the pew and dangling a white hand ornamented with a flaming paste ring which sometimes plays the lights in her eyes so as to make them water with the reflection and miss pen has this very natural remark ever ready on the occasion  such things you know are apt to take off ones attention  another of this illustrious junto is billy bachelor an old unmarried petitmaitre billy is a courter of ancient standing he abounds in anecdotes not of the freshest date nor altogether of the most interesting sort for he will tell you how such and such a lady was dressed when he had the honor of handing her into the drawing room he has a courtatalantis of his own from which he can favor you with some hints of sly doings amongst maids of honor particularly of a certain dubious duchess now deceased for he names no names who appeared at a certain masquerade in puris naturalibus and other wonderful discoveries which all the world has long ago known and long ago been tired of billy has a smattering in the fine arts for he can nett purses and make admirable coffee and write sonnets he has the best receipt in nature for a dentifrice which he makes up with his own hands and gives to such ladies as are in his favor and have an even row of teeth he can boast some skill in music for he plays barberinis minuet to admiration and accompanies the airs in the beggars opera on his flute in their original taste he is also a playhouse critic of no mean pretensions for he remembers mrs woffington and quin and mrs cibber and when the players come to town billy is greatly looked up to and has been known to lead a clap where nobody but himself could find a reason for clapping at all when his vanity is in the cue billy bachelor can talk to you of his amors and upon occasion stretch the truth to save his credit particularly in accounting for a certain old lameness in his kneepan which some who are in the secret know was got by being kicked out of a coffeehouse but which to the world at large he asserts was incurred by leaping out of a window to save a ladys reputation and escape the fury of an enraged husband  dr pyeball is a dignitary of the church and a mighty proficient in the belles lettres he tells you voltaire was a man of some fancy and had a knack of writing but he bids you beware of his principles and doubts if he had any more christianity than pontius pilate he has wrote an epigram against a certain contemporary historian which cuts him up at a stroke by a happy jargon of professional phrases with a kind of socratic mode of arguing he has so bamboozled the dons of the cathedral as to have effected a total revolution in their church music making purcell crofts and handel give place to a quaint quirkish style little less capricious than if the organist was to play cotillons and the dean and chapter dance to them the doctor is a mighty admirer of those ingenious publications which are entitled the flowers of the several authors they are selected from this short cut to parnassus not only saves him a great deal of roundabout riding but supplies him with many an apt couplet for offhand quotations in which he is very expert and has besides a clever knack of weaving them into his pulpit essays for i will not call them sermons in much the same way as tiddydoll stuck plumbs on his short pigs and his long pigs and his pigs with a curley tail by a proper sprinkling of these spiritual nosegays and the recommendation of a soft insinuating address doctor pyeball is universally cried up as a very pretty genteel preacher one who understands the politeness of the pulpit and does not surfeit wellbred people with more religion than they have stomachs for amiable miss pen tabby is one of his warmest admirers and declares doctor pyeball in his gown and cassock is quite the man of fashion the illnatured world will have it she has contemplated him in other situations with equal approbation  elegant mrs dainty is another ornament of this charming coterie she is separated from her husband but the eye of malice never spied a speck upon her virtue his manners were insupportable she good lady never gave him the least provocation for she was always sick and mostly confined to her chamber in nursing a delicate constitution noises racked her head company shook her nerves all to pieces in the country she could not live for country doctors and apothecaries knew nothing of her case in london she could not sleep unless the whole street was littered with straw her husband was a man of no refinement all the fine feelings of the human heart were heathen greek to him he loved his friend had no quarrel with his bottle and coming from his club one night a little flustered his horrid dalliances threw mrs dainty into strong hysterics and the covenanted truce being now broken she kept no further terms with him and they separated it was a step of absolute necessity for she declares her life could no otherwise have been saved his boisterous familiarities would have been her death she now leads an uncontaminated life supporting a feeble frame by medicine sipping her tea with her dear quiet friends every evening chatting over the little news of the day sighing charitably when she hears any evil of her kind neighbors turning off her femmedechambre once a week or thereabouts fondling her lapdog who is a dear sweet pretty creature and so sensible and taking the air now and then on a pillion behind faithful john who is so careful of her and so handy and at the same time one of the stoutest handsomest bestlimbed lads in all england  sir hugo fitzhugo is a decayed baronet of a family so very ancient that they have long since worn out the estate that supported them sir hugo knows his own dignity none the less and keeps a little snivelling boy who can scarce move under the load of worsted lace that is plaistered down the edges and seams of his livery he leaves a visiting card at your door stuck as full of emblems as an american paper dollar sir hugo abominates a tradesman his olfactory nerves are tortured with the scent of a grocer or a butcher quite across the way and as for a tallowchandler he can wind him to the very end of the street these are people whose visits he cannot endure their very bills turn his stomach upside down sir hugo inveighs against modern manners as severely as cato would against french cookery he notes down omissions in punctilio as a merchant does bills for protesting and in cold weather sir hugo is of some use for he suffers no man to turn his back to the fire and screen it from the company who sit round he holds it for a solecism in goodbreeding for any man to touch a ladys hand without his glove this as a general maxim miss pen tabby agrees to but doubts whether there are not some cases when it may be waved he anathematizes the heresy of a gentlemans sitting at the head of a ladys table and contends that the honors of the upper dish are the unalienable rights of the mistress of the family in short sir hugo fitzhugo has more pride about him than he knows how to dispose of and yet cannot find in his heart to bestow one atom of it upon honesty from the world he merits no other praise but that of having lived single all his life and being the last of his family at his decease the fitzhugos will be extinct  this society may also boast a tenth muse in the person of the celebrated rhodope her talents are multifarious poetical biographical epistolary miscellaneous she can reason like socrates dispute like aristotle and love like sappho her magnanimity equals that of marc antony for when the world was at her feet she sacrificed it all for love and accounted it well lost she was a philosopher in her leadingstrings and had traveled geographically over the globe ere she could set one foot fairly before the other her cradle was rocked to the iambic measure and she was lulled to sleep by singing to her an ode of horace rhodope has written a book of travels full of most enchanting incidents which some of her admirers say was actually sketched in the nursery and only filled up with little temporary touches in her riper years i know they make appeal to her style as internal evidence of what they assert about the nursery but though i am ready to admit that it has every infantine charm which they discover in it yet i cannot go the length of thinking with them that a mere infant could possibly dictate any thing so nearly approaching to the language of men and women we all know that goody twoshoes and other amusing books though written for children were not written by children rhodope has preserved some singular curiosities in her museum she has a bottle of coagulated foam something like the congealed blood of saint januarius this she maintains was the veritable foam of the tremendous minotaur of crete of immortal memory there are some indeed who profess to doubt this and assert that it is nothing more than the slaver of a noble english mastiff which went tame about her house and though formidable to thieves and interlopers was ever gentle and affectionate to honest men she has a lyre in fine preservation held to be the identical lyre which phaon played upon when he won the heart of the amorous sappho this also is made matter of dispute amongst the cognoscenti these will have it to be a common italian instrument such as the ladies of that country play upon to this day this is a point they must settle as they can but all agree it is a wellstrung instrument and discourses sweet music she has in her cabinet an evergreen of the cypress race which is supposed to be the very individual shrub that led up the ball when orpheus fiddled and the groves began a vegetable dance and this they tell you was the origin of all country dances now in such general practice she has also in her possession the original epistle which king agenor wrote to europa dissuading her from her ridiculous partiality for her favorite bull when jupiter in the form of that animal took her off in spite of all agenors remonstrances and carried her across the sea with him upon a tour that has immortalized her name through the most enlightened quarter of the globe rhodope is so tenacious of this manuscript that she rarely indulges the curiosity of her friends with a sight of it she has written an answer in europas behalf after the manner of ovids epistle in which she makes a very ingenious defense for her heroine and every body who has seen the whole of the correspondence allows that agenor writes like a man who knew little of human nature and that rhodope in her reply has the best of the argument  no cxxxvii nothing now remains for completing the literary annals of greece according to the plan i have proceeded upon in the foregoing volumes but to give some account of the drama within that period of time which commences with the death of alexander of macedon and concludes with that of menander or at most extends to a very few years beyond it when the curtain may figuratively be said to have dropped upon all the glories of the athenian stage  this though the last is yet a brilliant era for now flourished menander philemon diphilus apollodorus philippides posidippus poets no less celebrated for the luxuriancy than for the elegance of their genius all writers of the new comedy which if it had not all the wit and fire of the old satirical drama produced in times of greater public freedom is generally reputed to have been far superior to it in delicacy regularity and decorum all attacks upon living characters ceased with what is properly denominated the old comedy the writers of the middle class contented themselves with venting their raillery upon the works of their dramatic predecessors the persons and politics of their contemporaries were safe whereas neither the highest station nor the brightest talents were any sure protection from the unrestrained invectives of the comic muse in her earliest sallies  the poets under our present review were not however so closely circumscribed as to be afraid of indulging their talent for ridicule and satire upon topics of a general nature without a latitude like this comedy could hardly have existed but this was not all for amongst their fragments some are to be found which advance sentiments and opinions so directly in the teeth of the popular religion that we cannot but admire at the extraordinary toleration of their pagan audiences justin quotes a passage from menanders comedy of the charioteer in which an old mendicant is introduced carrying about a painted figure of the great mother of the gods after the manner of the present popish rosaries and begging a boon as usual on those occasions the person addressed for his subscription contemptuously replies  i have no relish for such deities as stroll about with an old beggarwoman from door to door nor for that painted cloth you have the impudence to thrust into my presence let me tell you woman if your mother of the gods was good for any thing she would keep to her own station and take charge of none but those who merit her protection by their piety and devotion this rebuff is of a piece with the surly answer of the cynic antisthenes recorded by clemens alexandrinus when being teazed by these mendicants the philosopher replied  let the gods provide for their own mother i am not bound to maintain her in another fragment quoted both by clemens and eusebius menander breaks forth into a bolder rhapsody which breathes the spirit and nearly the very words of the hebrew prophets a person in what drama does not appear addresses his companion in the scene to this effect  if any man o pamphilus thinks that god will be well pleased with the sacrifice of multitudes of oxen or of goats or of any other victims or by robing his images in cloth of gold and purple and decking them out with ivory and emeralds that man deceives himself and his imaginations are vain let him rather study to conciliate gods favor by doing good to all men let him abstain from violation and adultery let him not commit theft or murder through the lust of money nay covet not o pamphilus so much even as the thread of anothers needle for god is ever present and his eye is upon thee this will serve in the place of many more passages which might be adduced to prove that the comic poets of this period were not only bold declaimers against the vice and immorality of the age they lived in but that they ventured upon truths and doctrines in religion totally irreconcilable to the popular superstition and idolatries of the heathen world  it was on the new comedy of the greeks that the roman writers in general founded theirs and this they seem to have accomplished by the servile vehicle of translation it is said that terence alone translated all menanders plays and these by the lowest account amounted to eighty some authorities more than double them an improbable number to have been composed by a poet who died at the age of fifty or very little after  quin et longa dies delebit scripta menandri et quandoque levis carmina pulvis erunt t faber menander was born at athens the son of diopethes and hegesistrata he was educated in the school of theophrastus the peripatetic aristotles successor at the early age of twenty he began to write for the stage and his passions seem to have been no less forward and impetuous than his genius his attachment to the fair sex and especially to his mistress glycera is upon record and was vehement in the extreme several of his epistles to that celebrated courtesan written in a very ardent style were collected and made public after his decease the celebrity of his muse and the brilliancy of his wit were probably his chief recommendations to that ladys favor for it should seem that nature had not been very partial to his external besides which he squinted most egregiously and was of a temper extremely irascible if we were to take his character as a writer from no other authorities but of the fragments we should form a very different idea from that of pliny who says he was omnis luxuriae interpres and this even plutarch his avowed panegyrist is candid enough to admit ovid also says  the gay menander charms each youthful heart and love in every fable claims a part   however this may be the remains which have come down to us bear the stamp of an austere and gloomy muse rather than of a wanton and voluptuous one but these it must be owned prove little terence is supposed to have copied all his comedies from menander except the phormio and the hecyra and he gives us the best insight into the character of his elegant original  all greece seems to have joined in lamenting the premature loss of this celebrated poet who unfortunately perished as he was bathing in the piraean harbor to which ovid alludes in his ibis  comicus ut liquidis periit dum nabat in undis  this happened in olymp cxxii his first comedy entitled orge was performed in olymp cxv which gives him something less than thirty years for the production of more than one hundred plays and if we take the former account of his beginning to write for the stage at the age of twenty it will agree with what we have before said respecting the age at which he died  fatal as was the piraean sea to the person of this lamented poet posterity has more cause to execrate that barbarous gulf which has swallowed up his works nor his alone but those of above two hundred other eminent dramatic poets whose labors are totally lost and extinguished we have some lines of callimachus upon the death of menander who was one amongst many of his poetic survivors that paid the tribute of their ingenious sorrow to his memory nor poets only but princes bewailed his loss particularly ptolemy the son of lagus who loved and favored him very greatly and maintained a friendly correspondence with him till his death some of menanders letters to this prince were published with those addressed to his beloved glycera  though many great authorities concur in placing menander decidedly at the head of all the comic writers of his time yet his contemporaries must have been of a different opinion or else his rivals were more popular with their judges for out of one hundred and five comedies which apollodorus ascribes to him he tells us that he obtained only eight prizes and that philemon in particular triumphed over him in the suffrages of the theater very frequently if these decisions were so glaringly unjust and partial as we are taught to believe they were we have some sort of apology for the sarcastic question put to his successful competitor when upon meeting him he said  do you not blush philemon when you prevail over me this anecdote however at best only proves that menander rated his own merits very highly and that if they were unjustly treated by those who decided for philemon he laid the blame upon the wrong person and betrayed a very irritable temper upon the occasion  we have a collection of menanders fragments and the titles of seventythree comedies the fragments consist only of short sentences and do not give us the spirit and character of the dialogue much less of any one entire scene for though hertelius has gone further than grotius and le clerc in arranging them under distinct topics and has brought into one view every passage of a correspondent sort still it is a mere disjointed medley interesting only to the curious but affording little edification to the generality of readers many of them however are to be respected for their moral sentiment some are of a very elevated cast and others more in number than i could wish of a gloomy acrimonious and morose quality  ancient authorities are nevertheless so loud in the praise of menander that we cannot doubt of his excellence quintilian after applauding him for his peculiar address in preserving the manners and distinctions proper to every character he introduces on his scene adds in general terms that he eclipses every writer of his class and by the superior brilliancy of his genius throws them all into shade  he condemns the perverted judgment of his contemporaries for affecting to prefer philemon on so many occasions and c j caesar whilst he is passing a compliment upon terence styles him only dimidiatum menandrum dion chrysostom recommends him as a model for all who study to excel in oratory and let none of our wise men reprehend me he adds for preferring menander to the old comic poets inasmuch as his art in delineating the various manners and graces is more to be esteemed than all the force and vehemence of the ancient drama there is so much classical elegance in the lines which t faber has prefixed to his edition of terence particularly in the introductory stanza and this is withal so apposite to the subject in hand that i shall conclude this paper by transcribing it  sacrum menandri pectus aura jam reliquerat vagulaque animula elysias penetrarat oras tum dolor percitae virgineasque suffusae lacrymis genas huc et illuc cursitarunt perque lucos perque montes perque vallium sinus cursitarunt gratiae querentes sibi queis nova sedibus templa ponere possent no cxxxviii apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto virgil the various authors who have contributed to the collection of menanders remains seem to have extracted from him as if by general agreement little else but the most unfavourable delineations of the human character so far from finding those facetious and sprightly sallies to be expected from a comic writer those voluptuous descriptions which pliny alludes to or any fragments of the love scenes ovid tells us he so abounded in we meet a melancholy display of the miseries the enormities the repinings of mankind  what can be more gloomy and misanthropic than the following strain of discontent extracted by eustathius  suppose some god should say  die when thou will  mortal expect another life on earth  and for that life make choice of all creation  what thou will be dog sheep goat man or horse  for live again thou must it is thy fate  choose only in what form there thou art free   so help me crato i would fairly answer  let me be all things any thing but man he only of all creatures feels affliction the generous horse is valued for his worth and dog by merit is preferred to dog the warrior cock is pampered for his courage and awes the baser brood  but what is man truth virtue valor how do they avail him of this worlds good the first and greatest share is flatterys prize the informer takes the next and barefaced knavery garbles what is left i would rather be an ass than what i am and see these villains lord it over their betters   another fragment presents itself of the same cast but colored a little nearer to the hue of comedy  all creatures are more blessed in their condition and in their natures worthier than man look at yond ass  a sorry beast you will say and such in truth he is  poor hapless thing yet these his sufferings spring not from himself for all that nature gave him he enjoys whilst we besides our necessary ills make ourselves sorrows of our own begetting if a man sneeze we are sad  for that is ill luck if he traduce us we run mad with rage a dream a vapor throws us into terrors and let the nightowl hoot we melt with fear anxieties opinions laws ambition all these are torments we may thank ourselves for   the reader will observe that these are specimens of a general disgust against mankind and of discontent with the common lot of human life as such they can class with the humor of no other character but that of an absolute misanthrope a kind of timon for general invective differs widely from that which is pointed against any particular vice or folly and in fact can hardly be considered as falling within the province of comedy in any case  if menander has been justly celebrated for his faithful pictures of the living manners of the age he wrote in we cannot but receive a gloomy impression from the dark and dismal tints in which these sketches are cast and though the age we live in has follies and failings enough still to feed the comic poets appetite for satire we may console ourselves in the comparison of our own time with his provided the stage is to be regarded as a faithful mirror in both instances it is not however improbable but the writers of the new comedy might fall with more severity upon general vices to revenge themselves for the restrictions they were subjected to with respect to personalities add to this that as far as the early christian writers were concerned in selecting these passages it may well be supposed they would naturally take the most moral and sententious from amongst the comedies they quoted and such as afforded grave and useful remarks upon life harmonizing with their own doctrines and instructions more especially it is to be supposed that they would eagerly catch at any of those passages which exhibit purer and more worthy notions of the being and providence of god than the vulgar herd of heathens were known to entertain of this cast is the following contemptuous ridicule upon the pagan ceremony of lustration if your complaints were serious twould be well you sought a serious cure but for weak minds weak medicines may suffice  go call around you the women with their purifying water drug it with salt and lentils and then take a treble sprinkling from the holy mess now search your heart if that reproach you not then and then only you are truly pure ex famulo matris ideae i am sorry to remark that amongst all the fragments of this poet not one has been preserved that is stamped with even the slightest commendation of the fair sex on the contrary i find abundance of invective chiefly against marriage and married women often coarse and always bitter i may venture to say if there was a single woman in all athens who merited one good word it is one more than the strictest scrutiny can discover in his remains mark how he rails  if such the sex was not the sentence just that riveted prometheus to his rock   why for what crime  a spark a little spark but oh ye gods how infinite the mischief  that little spark gave being to a woman and let in a new race of plagues to curse us where is the man that weds show me the wretch woe to his lot  insatiable desires his nuptial bed defiled poisonings and plots and maladies untold  these are the fruits of marriage these the blessings of a wife the poet who can thus lend his wit to libel the greatest blessing of life may well be ingenious in depreciating life itself  the lot of all most fortunate is his who having staid just long enough on earth to feast his sight with this fair face of nature sun sea and clouds and heavens bright starry fires drops without pain into an early grave for what is life the longest life of man but the same scene repeated over and over a few more lingering days to be consumed in throngs and crowds with sharpers knaves and thieves from such the speediest riddance is the best having given some passages from this poet where he speaks in the character of a misanthropist it is but justice to exhibit him as a moralist if the following fragment suggests no new ideas upon the subject of envy it will at least serve to convince us that mankind in all ages have thought alike upon that despicable passion  thou seem to me young man not to perceive that every thing contains within itself the seeds and sources of its own corruption the cankering rust corrodes the brightest steel the moth frets out your garment and the worm eats its slow way into the solid oak but envy of all evil things the worst the same today tomorrow and for ever saps and consumes the heart in which it lurks in the fragment next ensuing an old man is reproved for the vice of covetousness there is a delicacy in the manner of it that well becomes both the age and condition of the speaker for he is a youth and son to the character whom he addresses this fragment is extracted from the comedy entitled dyscolus the churl which plautus is said to have translated and performed under its original title but of this only a few fragments remain in our volume of that poet probably the father herein addressed is the person who gives name to the comedy  weak is the vanity that boasts of riches for they are fleeting things were they not such could they be yours to all succeeding time it were wise to let none share in the possession but if whatever you have is held of fortune and not of right inherent why my father why with such niggard jealousy engross what the next hour may ravish from your grasp and cast into some worthless favorites lap snatch then the swift occasion while it is yours put this unstable boon to noble uses foster the wants of men impart your wealth and purchase friends twill be more lasting treasure and when misfortune comes your best resource there is another fragment of a more comic sort which is a relic of the minstrel pointed at the same vice  never trust me phanias but i thought till now that you rich fellows had the knack of sleeping a good sound nap that held you for the night and not like us poor rogues who toss and turn sighing ah me and grumbling at our duns but now i find in spite of all your money you rest no better than your needy neighbors and sorrow is the common lot of all we are indebted to plutarch for a very respectable fragment of his favorite poet he quotes it for the consolatory advice it contains and addresses it to apollonius i give it to my readers as one of the most valuable specimens of its author if you o trophimus and you alone of all your mothers sons have natures charter for privilege of pleasures uncontrolled with full exemption from the strokes of fortune and that some god has ratified the grant you then with cause may vent your loud reproach for he has broke your charter and betrayed you but if you live and breathe the common air on the same terms as we do then i tell you and tell it in the tragic poets words  of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils  the sum of which philosophy is this  you are a man and therefore fortunes sport this hour exalted and the next abasd you are a man and though by nature weak by nature arrogant climbing to heights that mock your reach and crush you in the fall nor was the blessing you have lost the best of all lifes blessings nor is your misfortune the worst of its afflictions therefore trophimus make it not such by overstraind complaints but to your disappointment suit your sorrow the lines it italics quoted from shaksperes julius caesar not only correspond with the exact meaning of the original but are also apposite as a quotation from a tragic poet menander himself having applied the words of some one of the writers of tragedy probably euripides  amongst the smaller fragments there are several good apothegms some brief moral maxims well expressed and though not many of those witty points which are so frequent in aristophanes yet there are some specimens of the vis comica which have a very ingenious turn of words in their own tongue but generally such passages elude translation  this quaint confession from the mouth of an old miser is of that sort  i own i am rich abominably rich all the world accuses me of being a very warm old fellow but not a soul alive can slander me so far as to say i am a happy one  the following scrap once belonged to the thrasyleon you say not always wisely know thyself know others often times is the better maxim a strong moral truth told with epigrammatic neatness strikes me in this pointed remark  of all bad things with which mankind are cursed their own bad tempers surely are the worst i could not pass over a short but touching apostrophe quoted from the comedy of the olynthian  what pity it is when happy nature rears a noble pile that fortune should oerthrow it i shall conclude with a fragment of the declamatory sort not as offering any novelty either in the sentiment or expression but simply for the sake of contrasting it with other specimens  if you would know of what frail stuff youre made go to the tombs of the illustrious dead there rest the bones of kings there tyrants rot there sleep the rich the noble and the wise there pride ambition beautys fairest form all dust alike compound one common mass reflect on these and in them see yourself i now take leave of menander the most renowned of the writers of the latter comedy and if my readers shall remark that these fragments of a poet so eminent in his time offer nothing which has not been said over and over again by poets of our own i hope it will serve to strengthen their conviction that frequently there shall be a coincidence of sentiment and expression between authors without communication for it will hardly be supposed that plagiarisms have been committed upon these fragments and much less upon others of more obscurity which i have in former papers introduced into our language  in short i should be happy if any thing i have done now or may hereafter do shall serve to mitigate the zeal of critics for detecting their contemporaries in pretended pilferings and misdemeanors where the letter of the law may perhaps appear against them but the spirit of it if interpreted with candor condemns them not i would call upon them as terence did upon his audience to reflect that men in all ages will think and speak alike  nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum sit prius quare aequum est vos cognoscere atque ignoscere quae veteres sactitarunt si faciunt novi   no cxxxix habent tamen et alii quoque comici si cum venia legantur quaedam quae possis decerpere et praecipue philemon qui ut pravis sui temporis judiciis menandro soepe praelatus est ita consensu tamen omnium meruit esse secundus  quintil lib x there is not amongst all the greek dramatic poets a more amiable character than philemon he was a syracusan by suidass account but strabo says he was born in solae a city of cilicia he was some years elder than menander and no unworthy rival of that poet though more frequently successful in his competitions with him than the critics in general seem to think he deserved to be of this we can form little or no judgment they who had access to the works of both authors had the best materials to decide upon apulcius however speaks rather doubtingly in the comparison for he says of philemon that he was fortasse impar to which he subjoins that though his frequent triumphs over menander are not reputable to insist upon yet there are to be found in him many witty strokes plots ingeniously disposed discoveries strikingly brought to light characters well adapted to their parts sentiments that accord with human life  joca non infra soccum seria non usque cothurnum viz jests that do not degrade the sock gravity that does not entrench upon the buskin  philemon lived to the extraordinary age of one hundred and one years in which time he composed ninety comedies a competent collection it must be owned though not to be compared to the bulk of menanders productions who in half the time wrote more in number and with a rapidity for which we have his own word for when i have once determined upon the plot says he i consider the work as finished the longevity of philemon was the result of great temperance and a placid frame of mind frugal to a degree that subjected him to the charge of avarice he never weakened his faculties and constitution by excess and as he summed up all his wishes in one rational and moderate petition to heaven which throws a most favorable light upon his character it is with pleasure i record it  i pray for health in the first place in the next for success in my undertakings thirdly for a cheerful heart and lastly to be out of debt to all mankind  this temperate petition seems to have been granted in all particulars he was blessed with a long and healthful life he was successful in his undertakings to a degree which posterity seems to think above his merits and he triumphed over all his competitors more perhaps through the suavity of his manners than from any actual superiority of his talents that he was of a gay and happy spirit there is every reason to believe and his economy secured to him that independent competency which put him in possession of the final object of his wishes as he lived in constant serenity of mind so he died without pain of body for having called together a number of his friends to the reading of a play which he had newly finished and sitting as was the custom in that serene climate under the open canopy of heaven an unforeseen fall of rain broke up the company just when the old man had got into his third act in the very warmest interests of his fable his hearers disappointed by this unlucky check to their entertainment interceded with him for the remainder on the day following to which he readily assented and a great company being then assembled whom the fame of the rehearsal had brought together they sat a considerable time in eager expectation of the poet till wearied out with waiting and unable to account for his impunctuality some of his intimates were dispatched in quest of him who having entered his house and made their way to his chamber found the old man dead on his couch in his usual meditating posture his features placid and composed and with every symptom that indicated a death without pain or struggle  this is apuleiuss account but oelian embellishes the story with a vision in which he pretends that nine fair damsels appeared to philemon and upon his accosting them as they were going out of the door demanding why they would leave him they told him it was because it was not permitted to man to hold converse with the immortals upon waking from this trance or vision philemon related it to his page and then getting up returned to his studies and put the last hand to the comedy he was employed upon that done says oelian he stretched himself on his couch and quietly expired from this silly anecdote he draws an inference which without his help the world had probaby discovered viz that philemon truly was in favor with the muses  valerius maximus varies from both these authors in his account of the death of this aged poet he tells us philemon was suffocated by a sudden fit of laughter upon seeing an ass who had found his way into the house devour a plate of figs which his page had provided for him that he called out to the boy to drive away the ass but when this order was not executed before the animal had emptied the plate he bade his page pour out a goblet of wine and present it to the plunderer to complete his entertainment tickled with the pleasantry of this conceit and no less with the grotesque attitude and adventure of the animal philemon was seized with a fit of laughing and in that fit expired  the fragments of philemon are in general of a sentimental tender cast and though they enforce found and strict morality yet no one instance occurs of that gloomy misanthropy that harsh and dogmatizing spirit which too often marks the maxims of his more illustrious rival the following specimen will illustrate what i assert  it is clear that our poet has aeschylus in his eye all are not just because they do no wrong but he who will not wrong me when he may he is the truly just i praise not them who in their petty dealings pilfer not but him whose conscience spurns a secret fraud when he might plunder and defy surprise his be the praise who looking down with scorn on the false judgment of the partial herd consults his own clear heart and boldly dares to be not to be thought an honest man i flatter myself the reader will be pleased with the following animated apostrophe which is a fragment of the ignifer  now by the gods it is not in the power of painting or of sculpture to express aught so divine as the fair form of truth the creatures of their art may catch the eye but her sweet nature captivates the soul i shall next produce a passage from the pyrrhus which breathes so soft and placid a spirit and so perfectly harmonizes with the amiable character of the poet i am reviewing that it is with pleasure i present it to my readers  philosophers consume much time and pains to seek the sovereign good nor is there one who yet has struck upon it virtue some and prudence some contend for whilst the knot grows harder by their struggles to untye it i a mere clown in turning up the soil have dug the secret forth  allgracious jove it is peace most lovely and of all beloved peace is the bounteous goddess who bestows weddings and holidays and joyous feasts relations friends health plenty social comforts and pleasures which alone make life a blessing stobaeus has preserved a fragment of the ephebus which is of a mild and plaintive character though it speaks the language of the deepest sorrow it speaks at the same time the language of humanity there is no turbulence no invective it is calculated to move our pity not excite our horror  it is not on them alone who tempt the sea that the storm breaks it whelms even us o laches whether we pace the open colonnade or to the inmost shelter of our house shrink from its rage the sailor for a day a night perhaps is bandied up and down and then anon reposes when the wind veers to the wishtfor point and wafts him home but i know no repose not one day only but every day to the last hour of life deeper and deeper i am plunged in woe in all the remains of this engaging author there seems a characteristic gentleness of manners where he gives advice it is recommended rather than imposed his reproofs are softened with such an air of good humor as gives a grace to instruction and smiles whilst it corrects can experience tutor indiscretion in milder terms than these  o cleon cease to trifle thus with life a mind so barren of experience can hoard up naught but misery believe me the shipwreckt mariner must sink outright who makes no effort to regain the shore the needy wretch who never learnt a trade and will not work must starve  what then you cry my riches  frail security  my farms my houses my estate  alas my friend fortune makes quick dispatch and in a day can strip you bare as beggary itself grant that you now had piloted your bark into good fortunes haven anchored there and moored her safe as caution could devise yet if the headstrong passions seize the helm and turn her out to sea the stormy gusts shall rise and blow you out of sight of port never to reach prosperity again  what tell you me have i not friends to fly to i have and will not those kind friends protect me  better it were you shall not need their service and so not make the trial much i fear your sinking hand would only grasp a shade many of his maxims and remarks are neatly expressed and ingeniously conceived they have all a tincture of pleasantry which without impairing the morality or good sense they convey takes off the gloom and solemnity which the same thoughts otherwise expressed might have two words of nonsense are two words too much whole volumes of good sense will never tire what multitudes of lines has homer wrote who ever thought he wrote one line too much again  if what we have we use not and still covet what we have not we are cajoled by fortune of present bliss of future by ourselves still to be rich is still to be unhappy still to be envied hated and abused still to commence new law suits new vexations still to be carking still to be collecting only to make your funeral a feast and hoard up riches for a thriftless heir let me be light in purse and light in heart give me small means but give content withal only preserve me from the law kind gods and i will thank you for my poverty extremes of fortune are true wisdoms test and he is of men most wise who bears them best   no cxl the poet diphilus was a native of sinope a city of pontus and contemporary with menander clemens alexandrinus applauds him for his comic wit and humor eusebius says the same and adds a further encomium in respect of the sententious and moral character of his drama the poet plautus speaks of him in his prologue to the casina and acknowledges the excellence of the original upon which he had formed his comedy he died at smyrna a city of ionia and was author of one hundred comedies of which we have a list of two and thirty titles and no inconsiderable collection of fragments out of these i have selected the following example  we have a notable good law at corinth where if an idle fellow outruns reason feasting and junketing at furious cost the sumptuary proctor calls upon him and thus begins to sift him  you live well but have you well to live you squander freely have you the wherewithal have you the fund for these outgoings if you have go on if you have not well stop you in good time before you outrun honesty for he who lives we know not how must live by plunder either he picks a purse or robs a house or is accomplice with some knavish gang or thrusts himself in crowds to play the informer and put his perjured evidence to sale this a wellordered city will not suffer such vermin we expel  and you do wisely but what is this to me  why this it is here we behold you every day at work living forsooth not as your neighbors live but richly royally ye gods  why man we cannot get a fish for love or money you swallow the whole produce of the sea you have driven our citizens to browze on cabbage a sprig of parsley sets them all afighting as at the isthmian games if hare or partridge or but a simple thrush comes to the market quick at a word you snap him by the gods hunt athens through you shall not find a feather but in your kitchen and for wine it is gold  not to be purchased  we may drink the ditches apollodorus gelous in the same period with the poets abovementioned was a writer high in fame and author of many comedies of all which the titles of eight only and some few fragments now remain it is generally understood that the phormio and hecyra of terence are copied from this poet very little has been preserved from the wreck of this authors writings that can tempt me to a translation a few short specimens however according to custom are submitted  how sweet were life how placid and serene were others but as gentle as ourselves but if we must consort with apes and monkies we must be brutes like them  o life of sorrow what do you trust to father to your money fortune indeed to those who have it not will sometimes give it but it is done in malice merely that she may take it back again athenaeus has rescued a little stroke of raillery which is ludicrous enough  go to make fast your gates with bars and bolts but never chamber door was shut so close but cats and cuckoldmakers would creep through it the following has some point in it but comes ill into translation or more properly speaking is ill translated  youth and old age have their respective humors and son by privilege can say to father were you not once as young as i am now not so the father he cannot demand were you not once as old as i am now there is something pleasing in the following natural description of a friendly welcome  there is a certain hospitable air in a friends house that tells me i am welcome the porter opens to me with a smile the yard dog wags his tail the servant runs beats up the cushion spreads the couch and says  sit down good sir ever i can say i am weary philippidas the son of philocles was another of this illustrious band of contemporary and rival authors his extreme sensibility was the cause of his death for the sudden transport occasioned by the unexpected success of one of his comedies put a period to his life the poet however was at this time very aged donatus informs us that philippidas was in the highest favor with lysimachus to whom he recommended himself not by the common modes of flattery but by his amiable and virtuous qualities the interest he had with lysimachus he ever employed to the most honorable purposes and thereby disposed him to confer many great and useful favors upon the people of athens so highly did his princely patron esteem this venerable man that whenever he set out upon any expedition and chanced upon philippidas is his way he accounted it as the happiest prognostic of good fortune  what is there said lysimachus to him upon a certain occasion which philippidas would wish i should impart to him  any thing replied the poet but your secrets  posidippus with whom i shall conclude was a macedonian born at cassandria and the son of cyniscus abundant testimonies are to be found in the old grammarians of the celebrity of this poet few fragments of his comedies have descended to us and the titles only of twelve he may be reckoned the last of the comic poets as it was not till three years after the death of menander that he began to write for the athenian stage and posterior to him i know of no author who has bequeathed even his name to posterity here then concludes the history of the greek stage below this period it is in vain to search for genius worth recording grecian literature and grecian liberty expired together a succession of sophists paedagogues and grammarians filled the posts of those illustrious wits whose spirit fostered by freedom soared to such heights as left the roman poets little else except the secondary fame of imitation  i have now fulfilled what i may be allowed to call my literary engagements in the course of which i have expended no small pains and attention in dragging from obscurity relics buried in the rubbish of the darker ages when the whole world seemed to conspire against genius when learning had degenerated into sophism and religion was made a theme of metaphysical subtelty serving as it should seem no other purpose but to puzzle and confound to inflame the passions and to perplex the head then it was the fathers of the church in whose hands these authors were held it a point of conscience to destroy the idols of the stage as they had already destroyed the idols of the temple and to bury heathen wit in the same grave with heathen superstition their poets and their gods were to be exterminated alike to the more enlightened taste or rather perhaps to the lucky partiality of chrysostom alone we owe the preservation of aristophanes continually engaged in argumentative and controversial writings there were some who occasionally condescended to quote a passage as it served their purpose from these proscribed comedies either to help out their wits or illustrate their meaning and these scraps and splinters being swept together by some few patient collectors who had charity enough to work upon the wreck posterity has been put into possession of these gleanings of the comic stage of athens in addition to the more entire and inestimable remains of aristophanes it has been my task and i believe it is the first of the sort attempted in our language to avail myself of these friendly guides for making something like a regular detail of the names characters and productions of these lost but once illustrious poets and to give to the public such as i conceived to be the best of their fragments in an english translation this part of my general undertaking being heavier than all the rest to myself i was much afraid it would have proved so to my readers also but their candid reception of these papers in particular and the encouraging voice of my professed reviewers have banished that anxiety from my mind and enabled me to proceed with cheerfulness to the end  there is one part however of these papers in which i conceive i have been misunderstood as having carried my attack against the moral doctrines of socrates and of this i am interested to exculpate myself my subject led me to refer to certain anecdotes unfavourable to his private character but i studiously marked those passages by observing that there was no design to glance at his moral doctrines and at the same time quoted the authorities upon which those anecdotes rest when any scholar will convince me these were futile and malicious tales i will retract all credit in them and thank him for the conviction as for the purity of socratess doctrine i never attempted to impeach it of the purity of his character i must continue to think there is much cause to doubt the learned bishop sherlock in his fourth discourse may be referred to upon this subject he there says that the corrupt example of socrates was a dead weight upon the purity of his doctrine and tended to perpetuate superstition in the world  though i am aware that the corrupt example here alluded to respects his religious practice yet surely if the preacher of christianity was interested to show the corrupt example of socrates in this light the friend of christianity may be allowed to represent it in another point of view and by fair authorities to exhibit what the heathens themselves have reported of this famous philosopher whose moral purity is by some taken merely upon trust by others designedly extolled to the skies for the sake of opposing character to character and by an audacious comparison with christ disparaging the divinity of the worlds redeemer i should expect then that as far as truth and good authorities warrant i am as free to discuss the private vices and impurities of socrates as those of mahomet which the learned prelate abovementioned most eloquently displays in his parallel between christ and that impostor the deist will perhaps be much interested to support his favorite philosopher and will care little for the prophet the modern platonist who is ingenious to erect a new system of natural religion out of the ruins of heathen idolatry may be zealous to defend the founder of his faith and his anger i must submit to incur but it is not quite so easy to bear the reproof of friends from whom i have not deserved it and in whose service i have drawn that anger upon myself  as for my defense of aristophanes against the groundless charge of having taken bribes from the enemies of socrates to attack him for the purpose of paving the way to his public trial that i observe has been on all hands admitted for in truth the facts and dates on which it turns cannot be contested they are decisive for his exculpation  no cxli nunc quam rem vitio dent quaeso animum advertite terent easy as it has been to clear aristophanes from the charge of conspiring against the life of socrates he would be a hardy advocate who should attempt to defend his personal attack upon that philosopher in his comedy of the clouds the outcry has been kept up for so many ages that now to combat it would be a task indeed there are so many who join in it without having examined into the merits of the case and an appeal to the practice of the stage in those times as likewise to the comedy itself would affect so few amongst the many who pretend to pronounce upon the offense that the man who undertook to soften general prejudices must undertake to translate the clouds and to transfuse the original spirit of such a composition into a modern language would be no easy work  an attempt however to give my english readers some idea of the opening scenes of this famous comedy so far as goes to the introduction of the philosopher upon the stage and the obnoxious incident of the basket will i hope be neither thought presumptuous or displeasing it will at least disclose something of the character and design of the piece and may in future tempt an abler hand to execute the whole and give it to the public  at the opening of this comedy strepsiades the father of the prodigal is discovered sitting at his desk with a number of bills and papers before him in deep meditation whilst phidippides his son is sleeping on his bed in the same chamber  the time before break of day  strepsiades starting from his seat breaks forth into the following exclamation  strepsiades ah me ah me what an eternal night o kingly jove shall the day never dawn and yet the cock sung out long long ago i heard him i  but my slaves lie and snore snore in defiance for the rascals know it is their privilege in time of war which with its other plagues bring this upon us that we may not rouse these vermin with a cudgel there is my young hopeful too  he sleeps it through snug under five fat blankets at the least would i could sleep as sound but my poor eyes have no sleep in them what with debts and duns and stable keepers bills which this fine spark heaps on my back i lie awake all night and what cares he but to coil up his locks ride drive his horses dream of em all night whilst i poor devil may go hang  for now the settling day of term comes on apace and my usurious creditors are gaping   what hoa a light there boy bring me my tablets boy enters that i may set down all and sum them up debts creditors and interest upon interest  boy gives him the tablets let me see where i am and what the total  put down twelve pounds twelve standard pounds to pasias  out on it and for what a horse a horse right noble by the mark  curse on such marks would i had given this eye from out this head ever i had paid the purchase of this jennet  phiddippides talking in his sleep phidon for shame keep keep the ring   strepsiades there it is that is it  my bane he is on his horses back he is racing in his sleep  phidippides as before a heat a heat  how many turns to a heat  strepsiades more than enough you have given me heats in plenty i am jaded  but to my list  what name stands next to pasias amynias  three good pounds  still for the race a chariot for the race of the first rank  phidippides as before dismount unharness and away  strepsiades i thank you you have unharnessd me i am dismounted and with a vengeance all my goods in pawn fines forfeitures and penalties in plenty  phidippides my father  why so restless who has vexed you  strepsiades the sheriff vexes me he breaks my rest  phidippides peace peace and let me sleep awhile  strepsiades sleep on but take this with you all these debts of mine will double on your head a plague confound my evil genius when the crotchet took me to wed forsooth that precious dam of thine i lived at ease in the country coarsely clad rough free and full withal as oil and honey and store of stock could make me till i took clown as i was this limb of quality this vain extravagant highblooded dame rare bedfellows and dainty were we not i smelling of the winevat figs and fleeces the produce of my farm  all essence she saffron and harlots kisses feast and frolic a pampered wanton  idle i will not call her for she takes pains enough to spend my money which made me tell her pointing to this cloak now threadbare on my shoulders  see good wife this is your work in troth you labor hard  boy reenters master the lamp has drank up all its oil  strepsiades aye it is a drunken lamp  the more fault yours whelp you shall howl for this  boy why for what fault  strepsiades for cramming such a greedy wick with oil exit boy well in good time this hopeful heir was born then i and my beloved fell to wrangling about the naming of the brat  my wife would dub her colt xanthippus or charippus or it might be callipedes she cared not so twere a horse which owned the name  but i stuck for his grandfather phidonides at last when neither could prevail the matter was compromisd by calling him phidippides when she began to fondle the sweet babe and taking him by the hand  lambkin she cried when thou art some years older thou shall drive thy chariot to the city robbed in state like thy great ancestor megacles  no not so quoth i but thou shall drive thy goats when thou art able from the fields of phelle clad in a woolly jacket like thy father but he is deaf to all these frugal rules and drives me on the gallop to my ruin therefore all night i call my thoughts to council and after long debate find one chance left to which if i can lead him all is safe if not  but soft it is time that i should wake him but how to soothe him is the task  phidippides precious phidippides   phidippides what now my father  strepsiades kiss me my boy reach me thine hand  phidippides ah me what would you  strepsiades tell me sirrah do thou love me  phidippides aye be content by neptunes self i swear it neptune the patron of the equestrian race  strepsiades ah name not him name not that chariotteer that god who is my bane but oh my son if thou indeed do love hear and obey me  phidippides in what must i obey  strepsiades reform your habits and what i dictate do  phidippides what do you dictate  strepsiades but will you do it  phidippides i will so help me bacchus  strepsiades it is well get up come hither boy look out  yon little wicket and the hut hard by  do thou not see them  phidippides yes i do what then  strepsiades why that is the council chamger of all wisdom there the great sophists meet and teach the world that heavens high firmament is one vast oven and men it is burning embers these are they who can teach pleaders how to twist a cause so you will but pay them for it right or wrong  phidippides but how do you call em  strepsiades troth i know not that but they are men who take a world of pains wondrous good men and able  phidippides out upon em poor rogues i know em now you mean those scabs those squalid barefoot beggarly enthusiasts the mighty cacodaemons of whose sect are socrates and chaeriphon  away  strepsiades hush hush be still dont vent such foolish prattle but if you will take my counsel join their college and quit your ridingschool  phidippides not i by bacchus no not for all leogarass stud  strepsiades come my dear boy my darling lad consent i prithee do and learn  phidippides what shall i learn  strepsiades they have a choice of logic this for justice that for injustice  learn this useful art and all these creditors that now beset me shall never touch a dram that i owe them  phidippides i will learn of no such masters nor be made an object of contempt to all my colleagues  strepsiades out of my doors then you and your fine cattle shall feed no more at my cost so begone to the crows i bequeath you   phidippides do your worst i will to my uncle to my noble uncle he will scorn to see his nephew walk on foot to him i go i will trouble you no more exit strepsiades alone he has thrown me to the ground but i will not there i will up and with permission of the gods try if i cannot learn these arts myself but being old sluggish and dull of wit how am i sure these subtilties will not pose me well i will attempt it what avails complaint why dont i knock and enter  hoa within there knocks violently at socratess door a disciple calls out from within disciple go hang yourself and give the crows a dinner what noisy fellow art thou at the door  strepsiades strepsiades of cicynna son of phidon  disciple youre mad methinks to kick up such a riot battering the door you have battered out my brains just in the very crisis of projection comes from the house strepsiades excuse my ignorance i am countrybred but tell me what rare thought your brains were hatching  disciple that were not lawful to reveal to strangers  strepsiades speak boldly then as to a fellow student for therefore am i come  disciple then i will speak but set it down amongst our mysteries  it is a question put to chaerephon by our great master socrates to answer  how many of his own lengths at one spring a flea can hop  for we did see one vault from chaerephons black eyebrow to the head of the philosopher  strepsiades and how did the other contrive to measure this  disciple most accurately he dipped the insects feet in melted wax which hardening into sandals as it cooled gave him the space by rule infallible  strepsiades o jupiter what subtilty of thought  disciple but there is a greater question yet behind  what would you say to that  strepsiades tell it i pray you  disciple twas put to socrates if he could say when a gnat hummd whether the sound did issue from mouth or tail   strepsiades aye marry what said he  disciple he said your gnat does blow his trumpet backwards from a sonorous cavity within him which being filled with breath and forced along the narrow pipe or rectum of his body does vent itself in a loud hum behind  strepsiades hah then i see the podex of your gnat is trumpet fashioned  oh the blessings on him for this discovery well may he escape the laws strict scrutiny who thus developes the anatomy of a gnat  disciple nor is this all another great experiment was marred by a cursed cat   strepsiades as how good sir discuss  disciple one night as he was gazing at the moon curious and all intent upon it is motions a cat on the houseridge was at her needs and squirted in his face  strepsiades beshrew her for it yet i must laugh no less  disciple sir you shall know we had no supper yesternight   strepsiades how so what was your master doing  disciple sifting ashes upon the board then with a little broach crookd for the nonce pretending to describe a circle neatly filchd away a cloak  strepsiades why talk we then of thales open to me open the school and let me see your master i am on fire to enter  come unbar the school is opened o hercules defend me who are these what kind of cattle have we here in view  disciple where is the wonder what do they resemble  strepsiades methinks they are like our spartan prisoners capturd at pylos what are they in search of why are their eyes so rooted in the ground  disciple their studies lie that way  strepsiades oh it is for onions they are in quest  come lads give over your search i will show you what you want a noble plat all round and sound  but soft what mean those gentry who dip their heads so low  disciple marry because their studies lie so deep they are now diving to the dark realms of tartarus and night  strepsiades and why are all their cruppers mounted up  disciple to practice them in stargazing and teach them their proper elevations  but no more come fellow students let us hence or ever the master comes   strepsiades nay prithee let them stay and be of council with me in my business  disciple impossible they cannot give the time  strepsiades now for the love of heaven what have we here explain their uses to me observing the apparatus disciple this machine is for astronomy   strepsiades and this   disciple for geometry  strepsiades as how  disciple for measuring the earth  strepsiades indeed what by the lot  disciple no faith sir by the lump even the whole world at once  strepsiades well said in troth a quaint device and made for general use  disciple look now this line marks the circumference of the whole globe do you see  this spot is athens  strepsiades athens go to i see no courts of law therefore i will not believe you  disciple nay in truth this very spot is attica  strepsiades and where where is my own cicynna  disciple here it lies and this euboea mark how far it runs   strepsiades how far it runs yes pericles has made it  far enough from us where is lacedaemon  disciple here close to athens  strepsiades ah how much too close prithee good friends take that had neighbor from us  disciple that is not for us to do  strepsiades then woe betide you but look who is this suspended in a basket socrates is discovered disciple this this is he  strepsiades what he  disciple why socrates  strepsiades hah socrates  make up to him and roar bid him come down roar lustily  disciple not i do it yourself i have other things to mind exit strepsiades hoa socrates  what hoa my little socrates  socrates mortal how now thou insect of a day what would thou  strepsiades i would know what thou art doing  socrates treading the air contemplating the sun  strepsiades ah then i see youre basketed so high that you look down upon the gods on earth good hope you will lower a peg  socrates sublime in air sublime in thought i carry my mind with me it is cogitations all assimilated to the pure atmosphere in which i float lower me to earth and my minds subtle powers seized by contagious dullness lose their spirit for the dry earth drinks up the generous sap the vegetating vigor of philosophy and leaves it a mere husk  strepsiades what do you say philosophy has sapt your vigor  fie upon it but come my precious fellow come down quickly and teach me those fine things i am here in quest of  socrates and what fine things are they socrates descends on the stage strepsiades a new receipt for fending off my creditors and foiling them by the art logical for you shall know by debts pawns pledges usuries executions i am rackt and rent in tatters  socrates why permit it what strange infatuation seized your senses  strepsiades the horseconsumption a voracious plague but so you will enter me amongst your scholars and tutor me like them to bilk my creditors name your own price and by the gods i swear i will pay you the last dram  socrates by what gods answer that first for your gods are not mine  strepsiades how swear you then as the byzantians swear by your base iron coin  socrates will you have patience whilst i expound to you the mysteries of these celestial matters  strepsiades yea by jove and so i will  but let them be celestial  socrates what if i bring you to a conference with my own proper goddesses the clouds  strepsiades by all means and most welcome  socrates come sit down sit down upon this dinnercouch

little being who followed the trades of shaver surgeon and manmidwife in the town of madrid mounted his mule at the door of his shop in the plazuela de los affligidos and pushed through the gate of san bernardino being called to a patient in the neighboring village of foncarral upon a pressing occasion every body knows that the ladies in spain in certain cases do not give long warning to practitioners of a certain description and no body knew it better than nicolas who was resolved not to lose an inch of his way nor of his mules best speed by the way if cudgelling could beat it out of her it was plain to nicolass conviction as plain could be that his road laid strait forward to the little convent in front the mule was of opinion that the turning on the left down the hill toward the prado was the road of all roads most familiar and agreeable to herself and accordingly began to dispute the point of topography with nicolas by fixing her fore feet resolutely in the ground dipping her head at the same time between them and launching heels and crupper furiously into the air in the way of argument little pedrosa who was armed at heel with one massy silver spur of stout though ancient workmanship resolutely applied the rusty rowel to the shoulder of his beast driving it with all the good will in the world to the very butt and at the same time adroitly tucking his blue cloth capa under his right arm and flinging the skirt over the left shoulder en cavalier began to lay about him with a stout ashen sapling upon the ears pole and cheeks of the recreant mule the fire now flashed from a pair of andalusian eyes as black as charcoal and not less inflammable and taking the segara from his mouth with which he had vainly hoped to have regaled his nostrils in a sharp winters evening by the way raised such a thundering troop of angels saints and martyrs from st michael downwards not forgetting his own namesake saint nicolas de tolentino by the way that if curses could have made the mule to go the dispute would have been soon ended but not a saint could make her stir any other ways than upwards and downwards at a stand a small troop of mendicant friars were at this moment conducting the host to a dying man  nicolas pedrosa says an old friar be patient with your beast and spare your blasphemies remember balaam  ah father replied pedrosa balaam cudgelled his beast till she spoke so will i mine till she roars  fie fie profane fellow cries another of the fraternity go about your work friend quoth nicolas and let me go about mine i warrant it is the more pressing of the two your patient is going out of the world mine is coming into it  hear him cries a third hear the vile wretch how he blasphemes the body of god  and then the troop passed slowly on to the tinkling of the bell  a man must know nothing of a mules ears who does not know what a passion they have for the tinkling of a bell and no sooner had the jingling chords vibrated in the sympathetic organs of pedrosas beast than boulting forward with a sudden spring she ran roaring into the throng of friars trampling on some and shouldering others at a most profane rate when nicolas availing himself of the impetus and perhaps not able to control it broke away and was out of sight in a moment all the devils in hell blow fire into thy tail thou beast of babylon muttered nicolas to himself as he scampered along never once looking behind him or stopping to apologize for the mischief he had done to the bare feet and shirtless ribs of the holy brotherhood  whether nicolas saved his distance as likewise if he did whether it was a male or female castilian he ushered into the world we shall not just now enquire contented to await his return in the first of the morning next day when he had no sooner dismounted at his shop and delivered his mule to a sturdy arragonese wench when don ignacio de santos aparicio alguazil mayor of the supreme and general inquisition put an order into his hand signed and sealed by the inquisidor general for the conveyance of his body to the casa whose formidable door presents itself in the street adjoining to the square in which nicolass brazen basin hung forth the emblem of his trade  the poor little fellow trembling in every joint and with a face as yellow as saffron dropped a knee to the altar which fronts the entrance and crossed himself most devoutly as soon as he had ascended the first flight of stairs a porter habited in black opened the tremendous barricade and nicolas with horror heard the grating of the heavy bolts that shut him in he was led through passages and vaults and melancholy cells till he was delivered into the dungeon where he was finally left to his solitary meditations hapless being what a scene of horror  nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition but being an andalusian and like his countrymen of a lively imagination he began to turn over all the resources of his invention for some happy fetch if any such might occur for helping him out of the dismal limbo he was in he was not long to seek for the cause of his misfortune his adventure with the barefooted friars was a ready solution of all difficulties of that nature had there been any there was however another thing which might have troubled a stouter heart than nicolass  he was a jew  this of a certain would have been a staggering item in a poor devils confession but then it was a secret to all the world but nicolas and nicolass conscience did not just then urge him to reveal it he now began to overhaul the inventory of his personals about him and with some satisfaction counted three little medals of the blessed virgin two agnus deis a saint nicolas de tolentino and a formidable string of beads all pendant from his neck and within his shirt in his pockets he had had a paper of dried figs a small bundle of segaras a case of lancets squirt and forceps and two old razors in a leathern envelope these he had delivered one by one to the alguazil who first arrested him  and let him make the most of them said he to himself they can never prove me an israelite by a case of razors  upon a closer rummage however he discovered in a secret pocket a letter which the alguazil had overlooked and which his patient donna leonora de casafonda had given him in charge to deliver as directed  well well cried he let it pass there can be no mystery in this harmless scrawl a letter of advice to some friend or relation i will not break the seal let the fathers read it if they like twill prove the truth of my deposition and help out my excuse for the hurry of my errand and the unfortunate adventure of my damned refractory mule  and now no sooner had the recollection of the wayward mule crossed the brain of poor nicolas pedrosa than he began to blast her at a furious rate  the scratches and the scab to boot confound thy scurvy hide quoth he thou assbegotten bastard whom noah never let into his ark the vengeance take thee for an uncreated barren beast of promiscuous generation what devils crotcht got into thy capricious noddle that thou should fall in love with that nazaritish bell and run bellowing like lucifer into the midst of those barefooted vermin who are more malicious and more greedy than the locusts of egypt oh that i had the art of simon magus to conjure thee into this dungeon in my stead but i warrant thou art chewing thy barley straw without any pity for thy wretched master whom thy jades tricks have delivered bodily to the tormentors to be sport of these uncircumcised sons of dagon and now the cell door opened when a savage figure entered carrying a huge parcel of clanking fetters with a collar of iron which he put round the neck of poor pedrosa telling him with a truly diabolic grin whilst he was rivetting it on that it was a proper cravat for the throat of a blasphemer  jesumaria quoth pedrosa is all this fallen upon me for only cudgelling a restive mule aye cried the demon and this is only a taste of what is to come at the same time slipping his pincers from the screw he was forcing to the head he caught a piece of flesh in the forceps and wrenched it out of his cheek laughing at poor nicolas whilst he roared aloud with the pain telling him it was a just reward for the torture he had put him to awhile ago when he tugged at a tooth till he broke it in his jaw ah for the love of heaven cried pedrosa have more pity on me for the sake of saint nicolas de tolentino my holy patron be not so unmerciful to a poor barbersurgeon and i will shave your worships beard for nothing as long as i have life one of the messengers of the auditory now came in and bade the fellow strike off the prisoners fetters for that the holy fathers were in council and demanded him for examination this is something extraordinary quoth the tormentor i should not have expected it this twelvemonth to come pedrosas fetters were struck off some brandy was applied to staunch the bleeding of his cheeks his hands and face were washed and a short jacket of coarse ticking thrown over him and the messenger with an assistant taking him each under an arm led him into a spacious chamber where at the head of a long table sat his excellency the inquisidor general with six of his assessors three on each side the chair of state the alguazil mayor a secretary and two notaries with other officers of the holy council were attending in their places  the prisoner was placed behind a bar at the foot of the table between the messengers who brought him in and having made his obeisance to the awful presence in the most supplicating manner he was called upon according to the usual form of questions by one of the junior judges to declare his name parentage profession age place of abode and to answer various interrogatories of the like trifling nature his excellency the inquisidor general now opened his reverend lips and in a solemn tone of voice that penetrated to the heart of the poor trembling prisoner interrogated him as follows   nicolas pedrosa we have listened to the account you give of yourself your business and connections now tell us for what offense or offenses you are here standing a prisoner before us examine your own heart and speak the truth from your conscience without prevarication or disguise may it please your excellency replied pedrosa with all due submission to your holiness and this reverend assembly my most equitable judges i conceive i stand here before you for no worse a crime than that of cudgelling a refractory mule an animal so restive in its nature under correction of your holiness be it spoken that although i were blessed with the forbearance of holy job for like him too i am married and my patience has been exercised by a wife yet could i not forbear to smite my beast for her obstinacy and the rather because i was summoned in the way of my profession as i have already made known to your most merciful ears upon a certain crying occasion which would not admit of a moments delay  recollect yourself nicolas said his excellency the inquisidor general was there nothing else you did save smiting your beast  i take saint nicolas de tolentino to witness replied he that i know of no other crime for which i can be responsible at this righteous tribunal save smiting my unruly beast  take notice brethren exclaimed the inquisidor this unholy wretch holds trampling over friars to be no crime  pardon me holy father replied nicolas i hold it for the worst of crimes and therefore willingly surrender my refractory mule to be dealt with as you see fit and if you impale her alive it will not be more than she deserves  your wits are too nimble nicolas cried the judge have a care they do not run away with your discretion recollect the blasphemies you uttered in the hearing of those pious people  i humbly pray your excellency answered the prisoner to recollect that anger is a short madness and i hope allowances will be made by your holy council for words spoke in haste to a rebellious mule the prophet balaam was thrown off his guard with a simple ass and what is an ass compared to a mule if your excellency had seen the lovely creature that was screaming in agony till i came to her relief and how fine a boy i ushered into the world which would have been lost but for my assistance i am sure i should not be condemned for a few hasty words spoke in passion  sirrah cried one of the puisny judges respect the decency of the court  produce the contents of this fellows pockets before the court said the president lay them on the table  monster resumed the aforesaid puisny judge taking up the forceps what is the use of this diabolical machine  please your reverence replied pedrosa  aptum est ad extrahendos foetus  unnatural wretch again exclaimed the judge you have murdered the mother  the mother of god forbid exclaimed pedrosa i believe i have a proof in my pocket that will acquit me of that charge and so saying he tendered the letter we have before made mention of the secretary took it and by command of the court read as follows senor don manuel de herrera  when this letter which i send by nicolas pedrosa shall reach your hands you shall know that i am safely delivered of a lovely boy after a dangerous labor in consideration of which i pray you to pay to the said nicolas pedrosa the sum of twenty gold pistoles which sum his excellency     hold cried the inquisidor general starting hastily from his seat and snatching away the letter there is more in this than meets the eye break up the court i must take an examination of this prisoner in private  no cxliii as soon as the room was cleared the inquisidor general beckoning to the prisoner to follow him retired into a private closet where throwing himself carelessly into an arm chair he turned a gracious countenance upon the poor affrighted accoucheur and bidding him sit down upon a low stool by his side thus accosted him  take heart senor pedrosa your imprisonment is not likely to be very tedious for i have a commission you must execute without loss of time you have too much consideration for yourself to betray a trust the violation of which must involve you in inevitable ruin and can in no degree attaint my character which is far enough beyond the reach of malice be attentive therefore to my orders execute them punctually and keep my secret as you tender your own life do thou know the name and condition of the lady whom thou have delivered nicolas assured him he did not and his excellency proceeded as follows  then i tell thee nicolas it is the illustrious donna leonora de casafonda her husband is the president of quito and daily expected with the next arrivals from the south seas now though measures have been taken for detaining him at the port wherever he shall land till he shall receive further orders yet you must be sensible donna leonoras situation is somewhat delicate it will be your business to take the speediest measures for her recovery but as it seems she has had a dangerous and painful labor this may be a work of more time than could be wished unless some medicines more efficacious than common are administered art thou acquainted with any such friend nicolas  so please your excellency quoth nicolas my processes have been tolerably successful i have bandages and cataplasms with oils and conserves that i have no cause to complain of they will restore nature to it is proper state in all decent time  thou talkest like a fool friend nicolas interrupting him said the inquisidor what tellest thou me of thy swathings and swadlings quick work must be wrought by quick medicines have thou none such in thy botica i will answer for it thou have not therefore look you sirrah here is a little vial compounded by a famous chemist see that you mix it in the next apozem you administer to donna leonora it is the most capital sedative in nature give her the whole of it and let her husband return when he will depend upon it he will make no discoveries from her  humph quoth nicolas within himself well said inquisidor he took the vial with all possible respect and was not wanting in professions of the most inviolable fidelity and secrecy  no more words friend nicolas quoth the inquisidor upon that score i do not believe thee one jot the more for all thy promises my dependence is upon thy fears and not thy faith i fancy thou have seen enough of this place not to be willing to return to it once for all  having so said he rang a bell and ordered nicolas to be forthwith liberated bidding the messenger return his clothes instantly to him with all that belonged to him and having slipped a purse into his hand well filled with doubloons he bade him be gone about his business and not see his face again till he had executed his commands  nicolas boulted out of the porch without taking leave of the altar and never checked his speed till he found himself fairly housed under shelter of his own beloved brass basin  aha quoth nicolas my lord inquisidor i see the king is not likely to gain a subject more by your intrigues a pretty job you have set me about and so when i have put the poor lady to rest with your damned sedative my tongue must be stopped next to prevent its blabbing but i will show you i was not born in andalusia for nothing nicolas now opened a secret drawer and took out a few pieces of money which in fact was his whole stock of cash in the world he loaded and primed his pistols and carefully lodged them in the housers of his saddle he buckled to his side his trusty spada and hastened to caparison his mule ah thou imp of the old one quoth he as he entered the stable art not ashamed to look me in the face but come hussy thou owe me a good turn methinks stand by me this once and be friends for ever thou art in good case and if thou will put thy best foot foremost like a faithful beast thou shall not want for barley by the way the bargain was soon struck between nicolas and his mule he mounted her in the happy moment and pointing his course toward the bridge of toledo which proudly strides with half a dozen lofty arches over a stream scarce three feet wide he found himself as completely in a desert in half a miles riding as if he had been dropped in the center of arabia petraea as nicolass journey was not a tour of curiosity he did not amuse himself with a peep at toledo or talavera or even merida by the way for the same reason he took a circumbendibus round the frontier town of badajoz and crossing a little brook refreshed his mule with the last draught of spanish water and instantly congratulated himself upon entering the territory of portugal brava quoth he patting the neck of his mule thou shall have a supper this night of the best sievemeat that estremadura can furnish we are now in a country where the scattered flock of israel fold thick and fare well he now began to chaunt the song of solomon and gently ambled on in the joy of his heart  when nicolas at length reached the city of lisbon he hugged himself in his good fortune still he recollected that the inquisition has long arms and he was yet in a place of no perfect security our adventurer had in early life acted as assistant surgeon in a spanish frigate bound to buenos airs and being captured by a british man of war and carried into jamaica had very quietly passed some years in that place as journeyman apothecary in which time he had acquired a tolerable acquaintance with the english language no sooner then did he discover the british ensign flying on the poop of an english frigate then lying in the tagus than he eagerly caught the opportunity of paying a visit to the surgeon and finding he was in want of a mate offered himself and was entered in that capacity for a cruize against the french and spaniards with whom great britain was then at war in this secure asylum nicolas enjoyed the first happy moments he had experienced for a long time past and being a lively goodhumoured little fellow and one that touched the guitar and sung sequidillas with a tolerable grace he soon recommended himself to his shipmates and grew in favor with every body on board from the captain to the cooks mate  when they were out upon their cruize hovering on the spanish coast it occurred to nicolas that the inquisidor general at madrid had told him of the expected arrival of the president of quito and having imparted this to one of the lieutenants he reported it to the captain and as the intelligence seemed of importance he availed himself of it by hawling into the track of the homewardbound galleons and great was the joy when at the break of the morning the man at the masthead announced a squarerigged vessel in view the ardor of a chase now set all hands at work and a few hours brought them near enough to discern that she was a spanish frigate and seemingly from a long voyage little pedrosa as alert as the rest stripped himself for his work and repaired to his post in the cockpit whilst the thunder of the guns rolled incessantly overhead three cheers from the whole crew at length announced the moment of victory and a few more minutes ascertained the good news that the prize was a frigate richly laden from the south seas with the governor of quito and his suite on board  pedrosa was now called upon deck and sent on board the prize as interpreter to the first lieutenant who was to take possession of her he found every thing in confusion a deck covered with the slain and the whole crew in consternation at an event they were in no degree prepared for not having received any intimation of a war he found the officers in general and the passengers without exception under the most horrid impressions of the english and expecting to be plundered and perhaps butchered without mercy don manuel de casafonda the governor whose countenance bespoke a constitution far gone in a decline had thrown himself on a sopha in the last state of despair and given way to an effusion of tears when the lieutenant entered the cabin he rose trembling from his couch and with the most supplicating action presented to him his sword and with it a casket which he carried in his other hand as he tendered these spoils to his conqueror whether through weakness or of his own will he made a motion of bending his knee the generous briton shocked at the unmanly overture caught him suddenly with both hands and turning to pedrosa said aloud  convince this gentleman he is fallen into the hands of an honorable enemy  is it possible cried don manuel and lifting up his streaming eyes to the countenance of the british officer saw humanity valor and generous pity so strongly charactered in his youthful features that the conviction was irresistible will he not accept my sword cried the spaniard he desires you to wear it till he has the honor of presenting you to his captain  ah then he has a captain exclaimed don manuel his superior will be of another way of thinking tell him this casket contains my jewels they are valuable let him present them as a lawful prize which will enrich the captor his superior will not hesitate to take them from me  if they are your excellencys private property replied pedrosa i am ordered to assure you that if your ship was loaded with jewels no british officer in the service of his king will take them at your hands the ship and effects of his catholic majesty are the only prize of the captors the personals of the passengers are inviolate  generous nation exclaimed don manuel how greatly have i wronged thee  the boats of the british frigate now came alongside and part of the crew were shifted out of the prize taking their clothes and trunks along with them in which they were very cordially assisted by their conquerors the barge soon after came aboard with an officer in the sternsheets and the crew in their white shirts and velvet caps to escort the governor and the ships captain on board the frigate which lay with her sails to the mast awaiting their arrival the accommodation ladder was slung over the side and manned for the prisoners who were received on the gangway by the second lieutenant whilst perfect silence and the strictest discipline reigned in the ship where all were under the decks and no inquisitive curious eyes were suffered to wound the feelings of the conquered even with a glance in the door of his cabin stood the captain who received them with that modest complaisance which does not revolt the unfortunate by an overstrained politeness he was a man of high birth and elegant manners with a heart as benevolent as it was brave such an address set off with a person finely formed and perfectly engaging could not fail to impress the prisoners with the most favorable ideas and as don manuel spoke french fluently he could converse with the british captain without the help of an interpreter as he expressed an impatient desire of being admitted to his parole that he might revisit friends and connections from which he had been long separated he was overjoyed to hear that the english ship would carry her prize into lisbon and that he would there be set on shore and permitted to make the best of his way from thence to madrid he talked of his wife with all the ardor of the most impassioned lover and apologized for his tears by imputing them to the agony of his mind and the infirmity of his health under the dread of being longer separated from an object so dear to his heart and on whom he doated with the fondest affection the generous captor indulged him in these conversations and being a husband himself knew how to allow for all the tenderness of his sensations ah sir cried don manuel would to heaven it were in my power to have the honor of presenting my beloved leonora to you on our landing at lisbon  perhaps added he turning to pedrosa who at that moment entered the cabin this gentleman whom i take to be a spaniard may have heard the name of donna leonora de casafonda if he has been at madrid it is possible he may have seen her should that be the case he can testify to her external charms i alone can witness to the exquisite perfection of her mind  senor don manuel replied pedrosa i have seen donna leonora and your excellency is warranted in all you can say in her praise she is of incomparable beauty these words threw the uxorious spaniard into raptures his eyes sparkled with delight the blood rushed into his emaciated cheeks and every feature glowed with unutterable joy he pressed pedrosa with a variety of rapid enquiries all which he evaded by pleading ignorance saying that he had only had a casual glance of her as she passed along the pardo the embarassment however which accompanied these answers did not escape the english captain who shortly after drawing pedrosa aside into the surgeons cabin was by him made acquainted with the melancholy situation of that unfortunate lady and every particular of the story as before related nay the very vial was produced with it is contents as put into the hands of pedrosa by the inquisidor  no cxliv can there be such villainy in man cried the british captain when pedrosa had concluded his detail alas my heart bleeds for this unhappy husband assuredly that monster has destroyed leonora as for thee pedrosa whilst the british flag flies over thy head neither spain nor portugal nor inquisitors nor devils shall annoy thee under it is protection but if thou ever venturest over the side of this ship and rashly set one foot upon catholic soil when we arrive at lisbon thou art a lost man  i were worse than a madman replied nicolas should i attempt it  keep close in this asylum then resumed the captain and fear nothing had it been our fate to have been captured by the spaniard what would have become of thee  in the worst of extremities replied nicolas i should have applied to the inquisidors vial but i confess i had no fears of that sort a ship so commanded and so manned is in little danger of being carried into a spanish port  i hope not said the captain and i promise thee thou shall take thy chance in her so long as she is afloat under my command and if we live to conduct her to england thou shall have thy proper share of prize money which if the galleon breaks up according to her entries will be something toward enabling thee to shift and if thou art as diligent in thy duty as i am persuaded thou will be whilst i live thou shall never want a seamans friend  at these chearing words little nicolas threw himself at the feet of his generous preserver and with streaming eyes poured out his thanks from a heart animated with joy and gratitude  the captain raising him by the hand forbade him as he prized his friendship ever to address him in that posture any more thank me if you will added he but thank me as one man should another let no knees bend in this ship but to the name of god  but now continued he let us turn our thoughts to the situation of our unhappy casafonda we are now drawing near to lisbon where he will look to be liberated on his parole  by no means let him venture into spain said pedrosa i am well assured there are orders to arrest him in every port or frontier town where he may present himself  i can well believe it replied the captain his piteous case will require further deliberation in the mean time let nothing transpire on your part and keep yourself out of his sight as carefully as you can  this said the captain left the cabin and both parties repaired to their several occupations  as soon as the frigate and her prize cast anchor in the tagus don manuel de casafonda impatiently reminded our captain of his promised parole the painful moment was now come when an explanation of some sort became unavoidable the generous englishman with a countenance expressive of the tenderest pity took the spaniards hand in his and seating him on a couch beside him ordered the sentinel to keep the cabin private and delivered himself as follows   senor don manuel i must now impart to you an anxiety which i labor under on your account i have strong reason to suspect you have enemies in your own country who are upon the watch to arrest you on your landing when i have told you this i expect you will repose such trust in my honor and the sincerity of my regard for you as not to demand a further explanation of the particulars on which my intelligence is founded  heaven and earth cried the astonished spaniard who can be those enemies i have to fear and what can i have done to deserve them  so far i will open myself to you answered the captain as to point out the principal to you the inquisidor general  the best friend i have in spain exclaimed the governor my sworn protector the patron of my fortune he my enemy impossible  well sir replied the captain if my advice does not meet belief i must so far exert my authority for your sake as to make this ship your prison till i have waited on our minister at lisbon and made the enquiries necessary for your safety suspend your judgment upon the seeming harshness of this measure till i return to you again and at the same time rising from his seat he gave orders for the barge and leaving strict injunctions with the first lieutenant not to allow of the governors quitting the frigate he put off for the shore and left the melancholy spaniard buried in profound and silent meditation  the emissaries of the inquisition having at last traced pedrosa to lisbon and there gained intelligence of his having entered on board the frigate our captain had no sooner turned into the porch of the hotel at buenosayres than he was accosted by a messenger of state with a requisition from the prime ministers office for the surrender of one nicolas pedrosa a subject of spain and a criminal who had escaped out of the prison of the inquisition in madrid where he stood charged of high crimes and misdemeanors  as soon as this requisition was explained to our worthy captain without condescending to a word in reply he called for pen and ink and writing a short order to the officer commanding on board instantly dispatched the midshipman who attended him to the barge with directions to make the best of his way back to the frigate and deliver it to the lieutenant then turning to the messenger he said to him in a resolute tone  that spaniard is now borne on my books and before you shall take him out of the service of my king you must sink his ship  not waiting for a reply he immediately proceeded without stop to the house of the british minister at the further end of the city here he found pedrosas intelligence with regard to the governor of quito expressly verified for the order had come down even to lisbon upon the chance of the spanish frigates taking shelter in that port to this minister he related the horrid tale which pedrosa had delivered to him and with his concurrence it was determined to forward letters into spain which don manuel should be advised to write to his lady and friends at madrid and to wait their answer before any further discoveries were imparted to him respecting the blacker circumstances of the case in the mean time it was resolved to keep the prisoner safe in his asylum  the generous captain lost no time in returning to his frigate where he immediately imparted to don manuel the intelligence he had obtained at the british ministers  this indeed cried the afflicted spaniard is a stroke i was in no respect prepared for i had fondly persuaded myself there was not in the whole empire of spain a more friendly heart than that of the inquisidors to my beloved leonora he had ever shown the tenderness of a paternal affection from her very childhood by him our hands were joined his lips pronounced the nuptial benediction and through his favor i was promoted to my government grant heaven no misfortune has befallen my leonora surely she cannot have offended him and forfeited his favor  as i know him not replied the captain i can form no judgment of his motives but this i know that if a mans heart is capable of cruelty the fittest school to learn it in must be the inquisition the proposal was now suggested of sending letters into spain and the governor retired to his desk for the purpose of writing them in the afternoon of the same day the minister paid a visit to the captain and receiving a packet from the hands of don manuel promised to get it forwarded by a safe conveyance according to direction  in due course of time this fatal letter from leonora opened all the horrible transaction to the wretched husband   the guilty hand of an expiring wife under the agonizing operation of a mortal poison traces these few trembling lines to an injured wretched husband if thou have any pity for my parting spirit fly the ruin that awaits thee and avoid this scene of villainy and horror when i tell thee i have borne a child to the monster whose poison runs in my veins thou will abhor thy faithless leonora had i strength to relate to thee the subtle machinations which betrayed me to disgrace thou would pity and perhaps forgive me oh agony can i write his name  the inquisidor is my murderer  my pen falls from my hand  farewell for ever  had a shot passed through the heart of don manuel it could not more effectually have stopped its motions than the perusal of this fatal writing he dropped lifeless on the couch and but for the care and assistance of the captain and pedrosa in that posture he had probably expired grief like his will not be described by words for to words it gave no utterance twas suffocating silent woe  let us drop the curtain over this melancholy pause in our narration and attend upon the mournful widower now landing upon english ground and conveyed by his humane and generous preserver to the house of a noble earl the father of our amiable captain and a man by his virtues still more conspicuous than by his rank here amidst the gentle solicitudes of a benevolent family in one of the most enchanting spots on earth in a climate most salubrious and restorative to a constitution exhausted by heat and a heart near broken with sorrow the reviving spirits of the unfortunate don manuel gave the first symptoms of a possible recovery at the period of a few tranquillizing weeks here passed in the bosom of humanity letters came to hand from the british minister at lisbon in answer to a memorial that i should have stated to have been drawn up by the friendly captain before his departure from that port with a detail of facts deposed and sworn to by nicolas pedrosa which memorial with the documents attached to it was forwarded to the spanish court by special express from the portuguese premier by these letters it appeared that the high dignity of the person impeached by this statement of facts had not been sufficient to screen him from a very serious and complete investigation in the course of which facts had been so clearly brought home to him by the confession of his several agents and the testimony of the deceased leonoras attendants together with her own written declarations whilst the poison was in operation that though no public sentence had been executed upon the criminal it was generally understood he was either no longer in existence or in a situation never to be heard of any more till roused by the awakening trump he shall be summoned to his tremendous last account as for the unhappy widower it was fully signified to him from authority that his return to spain whether upon exchange or parole would be no longer opposed nor had he any thing to apprehend on the part of government when he should there arrive the same was signified in fewer words to the exculpated pedrosa  whether don manuel de casafonda will in time to come avail himself of these overtures time alone can prove as for little nicolas whose prize money has set him up in a comfortable little shop in dukes place where he breathes the veins and cleanses the bowels of his israelitish brethren in a land of freedom and toleration his merry heart is at rest save only when with fire in his eyes and vengeance on his tongue he anathematizes the inquisition and struts into the synagogue every sabbath with as bold a step and as erect a look as if he was himself high priest of the temple going to perform sacrifice upon the reassembling of the scattered tribes  no cxlv i would wish no man to deceive himself with opinions which he has not thoroughly reflected upon in his solitary hours till he has communed with his own heart in his chamber it will be dangerous to commit himself to its impulses amidst the distractions of society in solitude he will hear another voice than he has been used to hear in the colloquial scenes of life for conscience though mute as the ancient chorus in the bustle of the drama will be found a powerful speaker in soliloquy if i could believe that any man in these times had seriously and deliberately reasoned himself into an absolute contempt of things sacred i should expect that such a being should uniformly act up to his principles in all situations and having thrown aside all the restraints of religion should discharge from his mind all those fears apprehensions and solicitudes that have any connection with the dread of a futurity but without knowing what passes in the private thoughts of men who profess these daring notions i cannot help observing that if noisy clamor be a mark of cowardice they also have the symptoms strongly upon them of belying their own conscience they are bold in the crowd and loudest in the revels of the feast there they can echo the insult dash the ridicule in the very face of heaven and stun their consciences in the roar of the carousal  let me picture to myself a man of this description surprised into unexpected solitude after the revels of an evening where he has been the wit of the company at the expense of decency and religion here his triumphs are over the plaudits of his comrades no longer encourage him the lights of the feast are extinguished and he is surrendered to darkness and reflection place him in the midst of a desert heath a lonesome traveller in some dark tempestuous night and let the elements subscribe their terrors to encounter this redoubted champion  who durst defy the omnipotent  if consistency be the test of a mans sincerity he ought now to hold the same language of defiance and with undaunted spirit cry out to the elements  do your worst ye blind tools of chance since there can be neither intelligence nor direction in your rage i set you at naught you may indeed subject me to some bodily inconvenience but you can raise no terrors in my mind for i have said you have no master there is no hand to point the lightning and the stroke of its flash is directed to no aim if it smites the oak it perishes if it penetrates my breast it annihilates my existence and there is no soul within me to resume it what have i to fear the worst you threaten is a momentary extinction without pain or struggle and as i only wait on earth till i am weary of life the most you can do is to forestall me in the natural rights of suicide i have lived in this world as the only world i have to live in and have done all things therein as a man who acts without account to an hereafter the moral offices as they are called i have sometimes regarded as a system of worldly wisdom and where they have not crossed my purposes or thwarted my pleasures i have occasionally thought fit to comply with them my proper pride in some instances and selfinterest in others have dissuaded me from the open violation of a trust for it is inconvenient to be detected and though i acknowledge no remonstrances from within upon the score of infamy i do not like the clamours of the crowd as for those mercenary inducements which a pretended revelation holds forth as lures for patience under wrongs and tame resignation to misfortune i regard them as derogatory to my nature they sink the very character of virtue by meanly tendering a reversionary happiness as the bribe for practicing it the doctrine therefore of a future life in which the obedient are to expect rewards and the disobedient are threatened with punishments confutes itself by its own internal weakness and is a system so sordid in its principle that it can only be calculated to dupe us into mental slavery and frighten us out of that generous privilege which is our universal birthright the privilege of dismissing ourselves out of existence when we are tired with its conditions  had i fabricated this language for infidelity with the purpose of stamping greater deteslation upon its audacity i had rather bear the blame of having overcharged the character than to be able as i now am to point out a recent publication which openly avows this shameless doctrine but as i do not wish to help any anonymous blasphemer into notice let the toleration of the times be his shelter and their contempt his answer in the mean time i will take leave to oppose to it a short passage from a tract lately translated into english entitled philosophical and critical enquiries concerning christianity by mr bonnet of geneva a work well deserving an attentive perusal  here i invite that reader who can elevate his mind to the contemplation of the ways of providence to meditate with me on the admirable methods of divine wisdom in the establishment of christianity a religion the universality of which was to comprehend all ages all places nations ranks and situations in life a religion which made no distinction between the crowned head and that of the lowest subject formed to disengage the heart from terrestrial things to ennoble to refine to sublime the thoughts and affections of man to render him conscious of the dignity of his nature the importance of his end to carry his hopes even to eternity and thus associate him with superior intelligences a religion which gave every thing to the spirit and nothing to the flesh which called its disciples to the greatest sacrifices because men who are taught to fear god alone can undergo the severest trials a religion in short to conclude my weak conceptions on so sublime a subject which was the perfection or completion of natural law the science of the truly wise the refuge of the humble the consolation of the wretched so majesty in its simplicity so sublime in its doctrine so great in its object so astonishing in its effects  i have endeavored says this excellent author in his conclusion to explore the inmost recesses of my heart and having discovered no secret motive there which should induce me to reject a religion so well calculated to supply the defects of my reason to comfort me under affliction and to advance the perfection of my nature i receive this religion as the greatest blessing heaven in its goodness could conser upon mankind and i should still receive it with gratitude were i to consider it only as the very best and most perfect system of practical philosophy bonnet that man hurried away by the impetuosity of his passions is capable of strange and monstrous irregularities i am not to learn even vanity and the mean ambition of being eccentric may draw out very wild expressions from him in his unguarded hours but that any creature should be deliberately blasphemous and reason himself if i may so express it into irrationality surpasses my conception and is a species of desperation for which i have no name  if the voice of universal nature the experience of all ages the light of reason and the immediate evidence of my senses cannot awaken me to a dependence upon my god a reverence for his religion and an humble opinion of myself what a lost creature am i  where can we meet a more touching description of gods omnipresence and providence than in the    th psalm and how can i better conclude this paper than by the following humble attempt at a translation of that most beautiful address to the creator of mankind  psalm cxxxix o lord who by thy mighty power have searched me out in every part thou know each thought at every hour or ever it rises to my heart in whatsoever path i stray wherever i make my bed at night no maze can so conceal my way but i stand open to thy sight nor can my tongue pronounce a word how secretly soever twere said but in thine ear it shall be heard and by thy judgment shall be weighed in every particle i see the fashion of thy plastic hand knowledge too excellent for me me wretched man to understand whither ah whither then can i from thine allpresent spirit go to heaven it is there you are throned on high to hell it is there thou rulst below lend me o morning lend me wings on the first beam of opening day to the last wave that ocean flings on the worlds shore i will flit away ah fool if there i meant to hide for thou my god shall reach me there even there thy hand shall be my guide thy right hand hold me in its care again if calling out for night i bid it shroud me from thine eyes thy presence makes a burst of light and darkness to the center hies nay darkness cannot intervene betwixt the universe and thee light or no light there is naught i ween god selfillumind cannot see thine is each atom of my frame thy fingers strung my inmost reins even in the womb or ever i came to life and caused a mothers pains oh what a fearful work is man a wonder of creative art my god how mavelous thy plan it is charactered upon my heart my very bones though deep concealed and buried in this living clay are to thy searching sight revealed as clear as in the face of day that eye which through creation darts my substance yet imperfect scanned and in thy book my embryo parts were written and their uses pland ere time to shape and fashion drew these ductile members one by one into mans image ere they grew thy great prospective work was done o god how gracious how divine how dear thy counsels to my soul myriads to myriads could i join they would fail to number up the whole i might as well go tell the sand and count it over grain by grain no in thy presence let me stand and waking with my god remain will thou not lord avenge the good shall not blasphemers be destroyed depart from me ye men of blood hence murderers and my sight avoid loud are their hostile voices heard to take thy sacred name in vain am i not grieved does not each word wring my afflicted heart with pain does not my zealous soul return hatred for hatred to thy foes yea lord i feel my bosom burn as though against my peace they rose try me dread power and search my heart lay all its movements in thy view explore it to its inmost part nor spare it if it is found untrue if devious from thy paths i stray and wickedness be found with me oh lead me back the better way to everlasting life and thee no cxlvi est genus hominum qui esse primos se omnium rerum volunt nec sunt terent eun what a delightful thing it is to find ones self in a company where tempers harmonize and hearts are open where wit flows without any checks but what decency and goodnature impose and humor indulges itself in those harmless freaks and caprices that raise a laugh by which no mans feelings are offended  this can only happen to us in a land of freedom it is in vain to hope for it in those arbitrary countries where men must lock the doors against spies and informers and must entrust their lives whilst they impart their sentiments to each other in such circumstances a mind enlightened by education is no longer a blessing what is the advantage of discernment and how is a man profited by his capacity of separating truth from error if he dare not exercise that faculty it were safer to be the blind dupe of superstition than the intuitive philosopher if born within the jurisdiction of an inquisitorial tribunal can a man felicitate himself in the glow of genius and the gayety of wit when breathing the air of a country where so dire an instrument is in force as a lettre de cachet but experience has shown us that if arbitrary monarchs cannot keep their people in ignorance they cannot retain them in slavery if men read they will meditate if they travel they will compare and their minds must be as dark as the dungeons which imprison their persons if they do not rise with indignation against such monstrous maxims as imprisonment at pleasure for undefined offenses selfaccusations extorted by torments and secret trials where the prisoner has neither voice nor advocate let those princes whose government is so administered make darkness their pavilion and draw their very mountains down upon them to shut out the light or expect the period of their despotism illuminated minds will not be kept in slavery  with a nation so free so highly enlightened and so eminent in letters as the english we may well expect to find the social qualities in their best state and it is but justice to the age we live in to confess those expectations may be fully gratified there are some perhaps who will not subscribe to this assertion but probably those very people make the disappointments they complain of if a man takes no pains to please his company he is little likely to be pleased by his company liberty though essential to good society may in some of it is effects operate against it for as it makes men independent independance will occasionally be found to make them arrogant and none such can be good companions yet let me say for the contemporaries i am living with that within the period of my own acquaintance with the world the reform in it is social manners and habits has been gradual and increasing the feudal haughtiness of our nobility has totally disappeared and in place of a proud distant reserve a pleasing suavity and companionable ease have almost universally obtained amongst the higher orders the pedantry of office is gone and even the animosity of party is so far in the wain that it serves rather to whet our wits than our swords against each other the agitation of political opinions is no longer a subject fatal to the peace of the table but takes it is turn with other topics without any breach of goodmanners or good fellowship  it were too much to say that there are no general causes still subsisting which annoy our social comforts and disgrace our tempers they are still too many and it is amongst the duties of an observer to set a mark upon them though by so doing i may run into repetition for i am not conscious of having any thing to say upon the subject which i have not said before but if a beggar who asks charity because of his importunity shall at length be relieved an author perhaps who enforces his advice shall in the end be listened to  i must therefore again and again insist upon it that there are two sides to every argument and that it is the natural and unalienable right of man to be heard in support of his opinion he having first lent a patient ear to the speaker who maintains sentiments which oppose that opinion i do humbly apprehend that an overbearing voice and noisy volubility of tongue are proofs of a very underbred fellow and it is with regret i see society too frequently disturbed in it is most delectable enjoyments by this odious character i do not see that any man has a right by obligation or otherwise to lay me under a necessity of thinking exactly as he thinks though i admit that from the fullness of the heart the tongue speaks i do not admit any superior pretensions it has to be sir oracle from the fullness of the pocket in the name of freedom what claim has any man to be the tyrant of the table as well he may avail himself of the greater force of his fists as of his lungs does sense consist in sound or is truth only to be measured by the noise it makes can it be a disgrace to be convinced or does any one lose by the exchange who resigns his own opinion for a better when i reflect upon the advantages of our public schools where puerile tempers are corrected by collision upon the mathematical studies and scholastic exercises of our universities i am no less grieved than astonished to discover so few proficients in wellmannered controversy so very few who seem to make truth the object of their investigation or will spare a few patient moments from the eternal repetition of their own deafening jargon to the temperate reply of men probably better qualified to speak than themselves  there is another grievance not unfrequent though inferior to this abovementioned which proceeds jointly from the mixed nature of society and the ebullitions of freedom in this happy country i mean that roar of mirth and uncontrouled flow of spirits which has more vulgarity in it than ease more noise than gayety the stream of elegant festivity will never overflow it is banks the delicacy of sex the dignity of rank and the decorum of certain professions should never be so overlooked as to alarm the feelings of any person present interested for their preservation when the softer sex entrust themselves to our society we should never forget the tender respect due to them even in our gayest hours when the higher orders by descending and the lower by ascending out of their sphere meet upon the level of good fellowship let not our superiors be revolted by a rusticity however jovial nor driven back into their fastnesses by our overstepping the partition line and making saucy inroads into their proper quarters who questions a minister about news or politics who talks ribaldry before a bishop once in seven years is often enough for the levelling familiarity of electioneering manners  there is another remark which i cannot excuse myself from making if it were only for the sake of those luckless beings who being born with duller faculties or stamped by the hand of nature with oddities either of humor or of person seem to be set up in society as butts for the arrows of raillery and ridicule if the object thus made the victim of the company feels the shaft who but must suffer with him if he feels it not we blush for human nature whose dignity is sacrificed in his person and as for the professed buffoon i take him to have as little pretensions to true humor as a punster has to true wit there is scope enough for all the eccentricities of character without turning cruelty into sport let satire take it is share but let vice only shrink before it let it silence the tongue that wantonly violates truth or defames reputation let it batter the insulting towers of pride but let the airbuilt castles of vanity much more the humble roof of the indigent and infirm never provoke it is spleen  it happened to me not long ago to fall into company with some very respectable persons chiefly of the mercantile order where a country gentleman who was a stranger to most of the party took upon him to entertain the company with a tedious string of stories of no sort of importance to any soul present and all tending to display his own consequence fortune and independance such conversation was ill calculated for the company present the majority of whom had i dare say been the founders of their own fortunes and i should doubt if there was any quarter of the globe accessible to commerce which had not been resorted to by some one or other then sitting at the table this uninteresting egotist therefore was the more unpardonable as he shut out every topic of curious and amusing information which could no where meet a happier opportunity for discussion  he was endured for a considerable time with that patience which is natural to men of good manners and experience in the world this encouragement only rendered him more insupportable when at last an elderly gentleman seized the opportunity of a short pause in his discourse to address the following reproof to this eternal talker  we have listened to you sir a long time with attention and it does not appear that any body present is disposed to question either your independance or the comforts that are annexed to it we rejoice that you possess them in so full a degree and we wish every landed gentleman in the kingdom was in the same happy predicament with yourself but we are traders sir and are beholden to our industry and fairdealing for what you inherit from your ancestors and yourself never toiled for might it not be altogether as amusing to you to be told of our adventures in foreign climes and countries of our dangers difficulties and escapes our remarks upon the manners and customs of other nations as to enclose the whole conversation within the hedge of your own estate and shut up intelligence wide as the world itself within the narrow limits of your parish pound believe me sir we are glad to hear you and we respect your order in the state but we are willing to hear each other also in our turns for let me observe to you in the style of the comptinghouse that conversation like trade abhors a monopoly and that a man can derive no benefit from society unless he hears others talk as well as himself  no cxlvii desunctus jam sum nihil est quod dicat mihi terent in all ages of the world men have been in habits of praising the time past at the expense of the time present this was done even in the augustan era and in that witty and celebrated period the laudator temporis acti must have been either a very splenetic or a very silly character  our present grumblers may perhaps be better warranted but though there may not be the same injustice in their cavilling complaints there is more than equal impolicy in them for if by discouraging their contemporaries they mean to mend them they take a very certain method of counteracting their own designs and if they have any other meaning it must be something worse than impolitic and they have more to answer for than a mere mistake  who but the meanest of mankind would wish to damp the spirit and degrade the genius of the country he belongs to is any man lowered by the dignity of his own nation by the talents of his contemporaries who would not prefer to live in an enlightened and a rising age rather than in a dark and declining one it is natural to take a pride in the excellence of our free constitution in the virtues of our sovereign is it not as natural to sympathize in the prosperity of our arts and sciences in the reputation of our countrymen but these splenetic dampers are for ever sighing over the decline of wit the decline of genius the decline of literature when if there is any one thing that has declined rather than another it is the wretched state of criticism so far as they have to do with it  as i was passing from the city the other day i turned into a coffeehouse and took my seat at a table next to which some gentlemen had assembled and were conversing over their coffee a dispute was carried on between a little prattling volatile fellow and an old gentleman of a sullen morose aspect who in a dictatorial tone of voice was declaiming against the times and treating them and their puisny advocate with more contempt than either one or the other seemed to deserve still the little fellow who had abundance of zeal and no want of words kept battling with might and main for the world as it goes against the world as it had gone by and i could perceive he had an interest with the junior part of his hearers whilst the sullen orator was no less popular amongst the elders of the party the little fellow who seemed to think it no good reason why any work should be decried only because the author of it was living had been descanting upon the merit of a recent publication and had now shifted his ground from the sciences to the fine arts where he seemed to have taken a strong post and stood resolutely to it his opponent who was not a man to be tickled out of his spleen by a few fine dashes of arts merely elegant did not relish this kind of skirmishing argument and tauntingly cried out  what tell you me of a parcel of gewgaw artists fit only to pick the pockets of a dissipated trifling age you talk of your painters and pourtraitmongers what use are they of where are the philosophers and the poets whose countenances might interest posterity to sit to them will they paint me a bacon a newton or a lock i defy them there are not three heads upon living shoulders in the kingdom worth the oil that would be wasted upon them will they or you find me a shakespeare a milton a dryden a pope an addison you cannot find a limb a feature or even the shadow of the least of them these were men worthy to be recorded poets who reached the very topmost summits of parnassus our moderns are but pismires crawling at its lowest root  this lofty defiance brought our little advocate to a nonplus the moment was embarrassing the champion of time past was echoed by his party with a cry of  no no there are no such men as these now living  i believe not he replied i believe not i could give you a score of names more but those are enough honest tom durfey would be more than a match for any poetaster now breathing  in this style he went on crowing and clapping his wings over a beaten cock for our poor little champion seemed dead upon the pit he muttered something between his teeth as if struggling to pronounce some name that stuck in his throat but either there was in fact no contemporary whom he thought it safe to oppose to these goliahs in the lists or none were present to his mind at this moment  alas thought i your cause my beloved contemporaries is desperate vae victis you are but dust in the scale while this brennus directs the beam all that i have admired and applauded in my zeal for those with whom i have lived and still live all that has hitherto made my heart expand with pride and reverence for the age and nation i belong to will be immolated to the manes of these departed worthies whom though i revere i cannot love and cherish with that sympathy of soul which i feel toward you my dear but degenerate contemporaries  there was a young man sitting at the elbow of the little crestfallen fellow with a round clerical curl which tokened him to be a son of the church having silently awaited the full time for a rally if any spirit of resurrection had been left in the fallen hero and none such appearing he addressed himself to the challenger with an air so modest but withal so impressive that it was impossible not to be prejudiced in his favor before he opened his cause  i cannot wonder said he if the gentleman who has challenged us to produce a parallel to any one of the great names he has enumerated finds us unprepared with any living rival to those illustrious characters their fame though the age in which they lived did not always appreciate it as it ought has yet been rising day by day in the esteem of posterity till time has stamped a kind of sacredness upon it which it would now be a literary impiety to blaspheme there are some amongst those whom their advocate has named i cannot speak or think of but with a reverence only short of idolatry not this nation only but all europe has been enlightened by their labors the great principle of nature the very law upon which the whole system of the universe moves and gravitates has been developed and demonstrated by the penetrating i had almost said the praeternatural powers of our immortal newton the present race of philosophers can only be considered as his disciples but they are disciples who do honor to their master if the principle of gravitation be the grand desideratum of philosophy the discovery is with him the application inferences and advantages of that discovery are with those who succeed him and can we accuse the present age of being idle or unable to avail themselves of the ground he gave them let me remind you that our present solar system is furnished with more planets than newton knew that our late observations upon the transit of the planet venus were decisive for the proof and confirmation of his system that we have circumnavigated the globe again and again that we can boast the researches and discoveries of a captain cook who though he did not invent the compass employed it as no man ever did and left a map behind him compared to which sir isaac newtons was a sheet of nakedness and error it is with gravitation therefore as with the loadstone their powers have been discovered by our predecessors but we have put them to their noblest uses  the venerable names of bacon and lock were if i mistake not mentioned in the same class with newton and though the learned gentleman could no doubt have made his selection more numerous i doubt if he could have made it stronger or more to the purpose of his own assertions  i have always regarded bacon as the father of philosophy in this country yet it is no breach of candor to observe that the darkness of the age which he enlightened affords a favorable contrast to set off the splendour of his talents but do we who applaud him read him yet if such is our veneration for times long since gone by why do we not the fact is intermediate writers have disseminated his original matter through more pleasing vehicles and we concur whether commendably or not to put his volumes upon the superannuated list allowing him however an unalienable compensation upon our praise and reserving to ourselves a right of taking him from the shelf whenever we are disposed to sink the merit of a more recent author by a comparison with him i will not therefore disturb his venerable dust but turn without further delay to the author of the essay upon the human understanding  this essay which professes to define every thing as it arises or passes in the mind must ultimately be compiled from observations of it is author upon himself and within himself before i compare the merit of this work therefore with the merit of any other mans work of our own immediate times i must compare what it advances as general to mankind with what i perceive within my particular self and upon this reference speaking only for an humble individual i must own to my shame that my understanding and the authors do by no means coincide either in definitions or ideas i may have reason to lament the inaccuracy or the sluggishness of my own senses and perceptions but i cannot submit to any mans doctrine against their conviction i will only say that mr lockes metaphysics are not my metaphysics and as it would be an ill compliment to any one of our contemporaries to compare him with a writer who to me is unintelligible so will i hope it can never be considered as a reflection upon so great a name as mr lockes not to be understood by so insignificant a man as myself  well sir cried the sullen gentleman with a sneer i think you have contrived to dispatch our philosophers you have now only a few obscure poets to dismiss in like manner and you will have a clear field for yourself and your friends  no cxlviii ingeniis non ille savet plauditque sepultis nostra sed impugnat nos nostraque lividus odit horat the sarcastic speech of the old snarler with which we concluded the last paper being undeserved on the part of the person to whom it was applied was very properly disregarded and the clergyman proceeded as follows   the poets you have named will never be mentioned by me but with a degree of enthusiasm which i should rather expect to be accused of carrying to excess than of erring in the opposite extreme had you not put me on my guard against partiality by charging me with it beforehand i shall therefore without further apology or preface begin with shakespeare first named by you and first in fame as well as time it would be madness in me to think of bringing any poet now living into competition with shakespeare but i hope it will not be thought madness or any thing resembling it to observe to you that it is not in the nature of things possible for any poet to appear in an age so polished as this of ours who can be brought into any critical comparison with that extraordinary and eccentric genius  for let us consider the two great striking features of his drama sublimity and character now sublimity involves sentiment and expression the first of these is in the soul of the poet it is that portion of inspiration which we personify when we call it the muse so far i am free to acknowledge there is no immediate reason to be given why her visits should be confined to any age nation or person she may fire the heart of the poet on the shores of ionia three thousand years ago or on the banks of the came or isis at the present moment but so far as language is concerned i may venture to say that modern diction will never strike modern ears with that awful kind of magic which antiquity gives to words and phrases no longer in familiar use in this respect our great dramatic poet has an advantage over his distant descendants which he owes to time and which of course is one more than he is indebted for to his own preeminent genius as for character which i suggested as one of the two most striking features of shakespeares drama or in other words the true and perfect delineation of nature in this our poet is indeed a master unrivalled yet who will not allow the happy coincidence of time for this perfection in a writer of the drama the different orders of men which shakespeare saw and copied are in many instances extinct and such must have the charms of novelty at least in our eyes and has the modern dramatist the same rich and various field of character the level manners of a polished age furnish little choice to an author who now enters on the task in which such numbers have gone before him and so exhausted the materials that it is justly to be wondered at when any thing like variety can be struck out dramatic characters are pourtraits drawn from nature and if all the sitters have a family likeness the artist must either depart from the truth or preserve the resemblance in like manner the poet must either invent characters of which there is no counterpart in existence or expose himself to the danger of an insipid and tiresome repetition to add to his difficulties it so happens that the present age whilst it furnishes less variety to his choice requires more than ever for it is own amusement the dignity of the stage must of course be prostituted to the unnatural resources of a wild imagination and it is propriety disturbed music will supply those resources for a time and accordingly we find the french and english theaters in the dearth of character feeding upon the airy diet of sound but this with all the support that spectacle can give is but a flimsy substitute whilst the public whose taste in the mean time becomes vitiated   media inter carmina poscunt aut ursum aut pugiles  the latter of which monstrous prostitutions we have lately seen our national stage most shamefully exposed to  by comparing the different ages of poetry in our own country with those of greece we shall find the effects agree in each for as the refinement of manners took place the language of poetry became also more refined and with greater correctness had less energy and force the style of the poet like the characters of the people takes a brighter polish which whilst it smooths away it is former asperities and protuberances weakens the staple of it is fabric and what it gives to the elegance and delicacy of it is complexion takes away from the strength and sturdiness of it is constitution whoever will compare aeschylus with euripides and aristophanes with menander will need no other illustration of this remark  consider only the inequalities of shakespeares dramas examine not only one with another but compare even scene with scene in the same play did ever the imagination of man run riot into such wild and opposite extremes could this be done or being done would it be suffered in the present age how many of these plays if acted as they were originally written would now be permitted to pass can we have a stronger proof of the barbarous taste of those times in which titus andronicus first appeared than the favor which that horrid spectacle was received with yet of this we are assured by ben johnson if this play was shakespeares it was his first production and some of his best commentators are of opinion it was actually written by him whilst he resided at stratford upon avon had this production been followed by the three parts of henry the sixth by loves labor lost the two gentlemen of verona the comedy of errors or some few others which our stage does not attempt to reform that critic must have had a very singular degree of intuition who had discovered in those dramas a genius capable of producing the macbeth how would a young author be received in the present time who was to make his first essay before the public with such a piece as titus andronicus now if we are warranted in saying there are several of shakespeares dramas which could not live upon our present stage at any rate and few if any that would pass without just censure in many parts were they represented in their original state we must acknowledge it is with reason that our living authors standing in awe of their audiences dare not aim at those bold and irregular flights of imagination which carried our bard to such a height of fame and therefore it was that i ventured awhile ago to say there can be no poet in a polished and critical age like this who can be brought into any fair comparison with so bold and eccentric a genius as shakespeare of whom we may say with horace  tentavit quoque rem si digne vertere posset et placuit sibi natura sublimis et acer nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet sed turpem putat in scriptis metuitque lituram when i bring to my recollection the several periods of our english drama since the age of shakespeare i could name many dates when it has been in hands far inferior to the present and were it my purpose to enter into particulars i should not scruple to appeal to several dramatic productions within the compass of our own times but as the task of separating and selecting one from another amongst our own contemporaries can never be a pleasant task nor one i would willingly engage in i will content myself with referring to our stock of modern acting plays many of which having passed the ordeal of critics who speak the same language with what i have just now heard and are continually crying down those they live with may perhaps take their turn with posterity and be hereafter as partially overrated upon a comparison with the productions of the age to come as they are now undervalued when compared with those of the ages past  with regard to milton if we could not name any one epic poet of our nation since his time it would be saying no more of us than may be said of the world in general from the era of homer to that of virgil greece had one standard epic poet rome had no more england has her milton if dryden pronounced that the force of nature could no further go he was at once a good authority and a strong example of the truth of the assertion if his genius shrunk from the undertaking can we wonder that so few have taken it up yet we will not forget leonidas nor speak slightly of it is merit and as death has removed the worthy author where he cannot hear our praises the world may now as in the case of milton heretofore be so much the more forward to bestow them if the sampson agonistes is nearer to the simplicity of it is grecian original than either our own elfrida or caractacus those dramas have a tender interest a pathetic delicacy which in that are wanting and though comus has every charm of language it has a vein of allegory that impoverishes the mine  the variety of drydens genius was such as to preclude comparison were i disposed to attempt it of his dramatic productions he himself declares that he never wrote any thing in that way to please himself but his all for love for ever under arms he lived in a continual state of poetic warfare with his contemporaries galling and galled by turns he subsisted also by expedients and necessity which forced his genius into quicker growth than was natural to it made a rich harvest but slovenly husbandry it drove him also into a duplicity of character that is painful to reflect upon it put him ill at ease within himself and verified the fable of the nightingale singing with a thorn at it is breast  popes versification gave the last and finishing polish to our english poetry his lyre more sweet than drydens was less sonorous his touch more correct but not so bold his strain more musical in it is tones but not so striking in it is effect review him as a critic and review him throughout you will pronounce him the most perfect poet in our language read him as an enthusiast and examine him in detail you cannot refuse him your approbation but your rapture you will reserve for dryden  but you will tell me this does not apply to the question in dispute and that instead of settling precedence between your poets it is time for me to produce my own for this i shall beg your excuse my zeal for my contemporaries shall not hurry them into comparisons which their own modesty would revolt from it has prompted me to intrude upon your patience whilst i submitted a few mitigating considerations in their behalf not as an answer to your challenge but as an effort to soften your contempt i confess to you i have sometimes flattered myself i have found the strength of dryden in our late churchill and the sweetness of pope in our lamented goldsmith enraptured as i am with the lyre of timotheus in the feast of alexander i contemplate with awful delight grays enthusiastic bard  on a rock whose haughty brow frowns over old conways foaming flood robbed in the sable garb of woe with haggard eyes the poet stood loose his beard and hoary hair streamed like a meteor to the troubled air and with a masters hand and prophets fire struck the deep sorrows of his lyre let the living muses speak for themselves i have all the warmth of a friend but not the presumption of a champion the poets you now so loudly praise when dead found the world as loud in defamation when living you are now paying the debts of your predecessors and atoning for their injustice posterity will in like manner atone for yours  you mentioned the name of addison in your list not altogether as a poet i presume but rather as the man of morals the reformer of manners and the friend of religion with affection i subscribe my tribute to his literary fame to his amiable character in sweetness and simplicity of style in purity and perspicuity of sentiment he is a model to all essayists at the same time i feel the honest pride of a contemporary in recalling to your memory the name of samuel johnson who as a moral and religious essayist as an acute and penetrating critic as a nervous and elaborate poet an excellent grammarian and a general scholar ranks with the first names in literature  not having named an historian in your list of illustrious men you have precluded me from adverting to the histories of hume robertson lyttelton henry gibbon and others who are a host of writers which all antiquity cannot equal  here the clergyman concluded the conversation now grew desultory and uninteresting and i returned home  no cxlix quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae tempora dii superi horat tomorrow is the day which procrastination always promises to employ and never overtakes my correspondent tom tortoise whose letter i shall now lay before the public seems to have made these promises and broken them as often as most men  to the observer i have been resolving to write to thee every morning for these two months but something or other has always come athwart my resolution to put it by in the first place i should have told thee that aunt gertrude was taken grievously sick and had a mighty desire to see thee upon affairs of consequence but as i was in daily hopes she would mend and be able to write to thee herself for every body you know understands their own business best i thought i would wait till she got well enough to tell her own story but alas she dwindled and dwindled away till she died so if she had any secrets they are buried with her and there is and end of that matter  another thing i would fain have written to thee about was to enquire into the character of a fellow one john jenkyns who had served a friend of thine sir theodore thimble as his house steward and offered himself to me in the same capacity but this was only my own affair do you see so i put it by from day to day and in the mean time took the rascal upon his word without a character but if he ever had one he would have lost it in my service for he plundered me without mercy and at last made off with a pretty round sum of my money which i have never been able to get any wind of probably because i never took the trouble to make any enquiry  i now sit down to let you know son tom is come from oxford and a strapping fine fellow he is grown of his age he has a mighty longing to set out upon his travels to foreign parts which you must know seems to me a very foolish conceit in a young lad who has only kept his first term and not completed his nineteenth year so i opposed his whim manfully which i think you will approve of for i recollected the opinion you gave upon this subject when last here and quoted it against him to do him justice he fairly offered to be ruled by your advice and willed me to write to you on the matter but one thing or other always stood in the way and in the mean time came lord ramble in his way to dover and being a great crony of toms and very eager for his company and no letter coming from you which indeed i acquit you of not having written to you on the subject away the youngsters went together and probably before this are upon french ground pray tell me what you think of this trip which appears to me but a wildgoose kind of a chase and if i live till tomorrow i intend to write tom a piece of my mind to that purpose and give him a few wholesome hints which i had put together for our parting but had not time just then to communicate to him  i intend very shortly to brush up your quarters in town as my solicitor writes me word every thing is at a stand for want of my appearance what dilatory doings must we experience who have to do with the law putting off from month to month and year to year i wonder men of business are not ashamed of themselves as for me i should have been up and amongst them long enough ago if it had not been for one thing or another that hampered me about my journey horses are for ever falling lame and farriers are such lazy rascals that before one can be cured another cries out and now i am in daily expectation of my favorite broodmare dropping a foal which i am in great hopes will prove a colt and therefore i cannot be absent at the time for a masters eye you know is every thing in those cases besides i should be sorry to come up in this dripping season and as the parson has begun praying for fair weather i hope it will set in ere long in good earnest and that it will please god to make it pleasant traveling  you will be pleased to hear that i mean soon to make a job of draining the marsh in front of my house every body allows that as soon as there is a channel cut to the river it will be as dry as a bowlinggreen and as fine meadow land as any on my estate it will also add considerably to the health as well as beauty of our situation for at present it is a grievous eyesore and fills us with fogs and foul air at such a rate that i have had my whole family down with the ague all this spring here is a fellow ready to undertake the job at a very easy expense and will complete it in a week so that it will soon be done when once begun therefore you see i need not hurry myself for setting about it but wait till leisure and opportunity suit  i am sorry i can send you no better news of your old friend the vicar he is sadly out of sorts you must know the incumbent of slowinthewilds died some time ago and as the living lies so handy to my own parish i had always intended it for our friend and had promised him again and again when behold time slipped away unperceived and in came my lord bishop of the diocese with a parson of his own ready cut and dried and claimed it as a lapsed living when it has been mine and my ancestors any time these five hundred years for aught i know if these are not nimble doings i know not what are egad a man need have all his eyes about him that has to do with these bishops if i had been aware of such a trick being played me i would have hoisted the honest vicar into the pulpit before the old parson who is dead and gone had been nailed in his coffin for no man loves less to be taken napping as they call it than i do and as for the poor vicar it is surprising to see how he takes to heart the disappointment whereas i tell him he has nothing for it but to outlive the young fellow who has jumped into his shoes and then let us see if any bishop shall jockey us with the like jades trick for the future  i have now only to request you will send me down a new almanac for the year wears out apace and i am terribly puzzled for want of knowing how it goes and i love to be regular if there is any thing i can do for you in these parts pray employ me for i flatter myself you believe no man living would go further or more readily fly to do you service than yours to command  thomas tortoise   alas though the wise men in all ages have been calling out as it were with one voice for us to know ourselves it is a voice that has not yet reached the ears or understanding of my correspondent tom tortoise somebody or other has left us another good maxim never to put off till tomorrow what we can do today  whether he was indeed a wise man who first broached this maxim i will not take on myself to pronounce but i am apt to think he would be no fool who observed it  if all the resolutions promises and engagements of today that lie over for tomorrow were to be summed up and posted by items what a cumbrous load of procrastinations would be transferred in the midnight crisis of a moment something perhaps like the following might be the outline of the deed by which today might will and devise the aforesaid contingencies to its heir and successor  conscious that my existence is drawing to its close i hereby devise and make over to my natural heir and successor all my right and title in those many vows promises and obligations which have been so liberally made to me by sundry persons in my life time but which still remain unfulfilled on their part and stand out against them but at the same time that i am heartily desirous all engagements fair and lawful in their nature may be punctually complied with i do most willingly cancel all such as are of a contrary description hereby releasing and discharging all manner of persons who have bound themselves to me under rash and inconsiderate resolutions from the performance of which evil might ensue to themselves and wrong or violence be done to society  in the first place i desire my said heir and successor will call in all those debts of conscience which have been incurred by and are due from certain defaulters who stand pledged to repentance and atonement of all which immediate payment ought in justice and discretion to be rigorously exacted from the several parties forasmuch as every hour by which they outrun their debt weakens their security  it is my further will and desire that all those free livers and professed voluptuaries who have wasted the hours of my existence in riot and debauchery may be made to pay down their lawful quota of sick stomachs and aching heads to be levied upon them severally by poll at the discretion of my heir and successor  whereas i am apprized of many dark dealings and malicious designs now in actual execution to the great annoyance of society and goodfellowship i earnestly recommend the detection of all such evilminded persons with tomorrows light heartily hoping they will meet their due shame punishment and disappointment and i sincerely wish that every honest man who has this night gone to rest with a good reputation may not be deprived of tomorrows repose by any base efforts which slander who works in the dark may conjure up to take it from him  it is with singular satisfaction i have been made privy to sundry kind and charitable benevolences that have been privately bestowed upon the indigent and distressed without any ostentation or parade on the part of the givers and i do thereupon strictly enjoin and require a fair and impartial account to be taken of the same by my lawful heir and successor be the amount what it may that interest for the same may be put into immediate course of payment whereby the parties so entitled may enjoy as in justice they ought to do all those comforts blessings and rewards which talents so employed are calculated to produce  all promises made by men of power to their dependants and all verbal engagements to tradesmen on the score of bills that lie over for tomorrow i hereby cancel and acquit well assured they were not meant by those who made them nor expected by any who received them then to be made good and fulfilled  to all gamesters rakes and revellers who shall be found out of bed at my decease i bequeath rotten constitutions restless thoughts and squalid complexions but to all such regular and industrious people who rise with the sun and carefully resume their honest occupations i give the greatest of all human blessings  health of body peace of mind and length of days  given under my hand etc etc today  no cl homo extra est corpus suum cum irascitur p syrus it is wonderful to me that any man will surrender himself to be the slave of peevish and irascible humors that annoy his peace impair his health and hurt his reputation who does not love to be greeted in society with a smile who lives that is insensible to the frowns the sneers the curses of his neighbors what can be more delightful than to enter our own doors  amidst the congratulations of a whole family and to bring a cheerful heart into a cheerful house foolish contemptible selftormentors ye are whom every little accident irritates every slight omission piques surely we should guard our passions as we would any other combustibles and not spread open the inflammable magazine to catch the first spark that may blow it and ourselves into the air  tom tinder is one of these touchy blockheads whom no body can endure the fellow has not a single plea in life for his ill temper he does not want money is not married has a great deal of health to spare and never once felt the slightest twinge of the gout his eyes no sooner open to the morning light than he begins to quarrel with the weather it rains and he wanted to ride it is sunshine and he meant to go a fishing he would hunt only when it is a frost and never thinks of skaiting but in open weather in short the wind is never in the right quarter with this testy fellow and though i could excuse a man for being a little out of humor with an easterly wind tom tinder shall box the whole compass and never set his needle to a single point of good humor upon the face of it  he now rings his bell for his servant to begin the operation of dressing him a task more ticklish than to wait upon the toilette of a monkey as tom shifts his servants about as regularly as he does his shirt it is all the world to nothing if the poor devil does not stumble at starting or if by happy inspiration he should begin with the right foot foremost tom has another inspiration ready at command to quarrel with him for not setting forward with the left to a certainty then the razor wants strapping the shaving water is smoaked and the devils in the fellow for a dunce booby and blockhead  tom now comes down to breakfast and though the savage has the stomach of an ostrich there is not a morsel passes down his blaspheming throat without a damn to digest it twould be a less dangerous task to serve in the morning mess to a fasting bear he then walks forth into his garden there he does not meet a plant which his illhumour does not engraft with the bitter fruit of cursing the wasps have pierced his nectarines the caterpillars have raised contributions upon his cabbages and the infernal blackbirds have eaten up all his cherries toms soul is not large enough to allow the denizens of creation a taste of natures gifts though he surfeits with the superabundance of her bounty  he next takes a turn about his farm there vexation upon vexation crosses him at every corner the fly a plague upon it has got amongst his turnips the smut has seized his wheat and his sheep are falling down with the rot all this is the fault of his bailiff and at his door the blame lies with a proportionable quantity of blessings to recommend it he finds a few dry sticks picked out of his hedges and he blasts all the poor in his neighborhood for a set of thieves pilferers and vagabonds he meets one of his tenants by the way and he has a petition for a new gate to his farmyard or some repairs to his dovehouse or it may be a new threshingfloor to his barn  hell and fury there is no end to the demands of these cursed farmers  his stomach rises at the request and he turns aside speechless with rage and in this humor pays a visit to his masons and carpenters who are at work upon a building he is adding to his offices here his choler instead of subsiding only flames more furiously for the idle rascals have done nothing some have been making holiday others have gone to the fair at the next town and the master workman has fallen from the scaffold and keeps his bed with the bruises every devil is conjured up from the bottomless pit to come on earth and confound these dilatory miscreants and now let him go to his dinner with what stomach he may if an humble parson or dependant cousin expects a peaceful meal at his table he may as well sit down to feed with thyestes or the centaurs after a meal of misery and a glass of wine which ten to one but the infernal butler has clouded in the decanting he is summoned to a game at backgammon the parson throws sizeace and in a few more casts covers all his points the devils in the dice tom makes a blot and the parson hits it he takes up man after man all his points are full and tom is gammoned past redemption  can flesh and blood bear this was ever such a run of luck the dicebox is slapt down with a vengeance the tables ring with the deafening crash the parson stands aghast and tom stamps the floor in the phrenzy of passion  despicable passion miserable dependant   where is his next resource the parson has fled the pit the backgammon table is closed no cheerful neighbor knocks at his unsocial gate silence and night and solitude are his melancholy inmates his boiling bosom labors like a turbid sea after the winds are lulled shame stares him in the face conscience plucks at his heart and to divert his own tormenting thoughts he calls in those of another person no matter whom  the first idle author that stands next to his hand he takes up a book it is a volume of comedies he opens it at random it is all alike to him where he begins all our poets put together are not worth a halter he stumbles by mere chance upon the choleric man twas one to a thousand he should strike upon that blasted play  what an infernal title what execrable nonsense what a canting preaching puppy of an author  away goes the poet with his play and half a dozen better poets than himself bound up in the same luckless volume the innocent sufferers for his offense  tom now sits forlorn disgusted without a friend living or dead to cheer him gnawing his own heart for want of other diet to feed his spleen upon at length he slinks into a comfortless bed damns his servant as he draws the curtains round him drops asleep and dreams of the devil  major manlove is a near neighbor but no intimate of tom tinders with the enjoyments that result from health the major is but rarely blessed for a bodywound which he received in battle is apt upon certain changes of the climate to visit him with acute pains he is married to one of the best of women but she too has impaired her health by nursing him when he was wounded and is subject to severe rheumatic attacks love however has an opiate for all her pains and domestic peace pours a balsam into the husbands wound it is only by the scrutinizing eye of affection that either can discover when the other suffers for religion has endued both hearts with patience and neither will permit a complaint to escape which might invite the sympathizing friend to share it is anguish disabled for service major manlove has retired upon halfpay and as he plundered neither the enemys country nor his own during the war he is not burdened with the superfluities of fortune happily for him these are not amongst his regrets and a prudent economy keeps him strait with the world and independent  one brave youth trained under his own eye in the same regiment with himself is all the offspring heaven has bestowed upon this worthy father and in him the hearts of the fond parents are centered yet not so centered as to shut them against the general calls of philanthropy for in the village where they live they are beloved and blessed by every creature the garden furnishes amusement to mrs manlove and when the sharp north east does not blow pain into the majors wound he is occupied with his farm his trees his crop his cattle are his nurselings and the poor that labor in his service are his children and friends to his superiors major manlove deports himself with that graceful respect that puts them in mind of their own dignity without diminishing his to his inferiors he is ever kind and condescending to all men he maintains a natural sincerity with a countenance so expressive of the benevolence glowing in his heart that he is beloved as soon as known and known as soon as seen with a soul formed for society and a lively flow of spirits this amiable man no sooner enters into company than his presence diffuses joy and gladness over the whole circle every voice bids him welcome every hand is reached out to greet him with a cordial shake he sits down with a complacent smile chimes in with the conversation as it is going hears all overbears none damps nobodys jest if it is harmless cuts no mans story if it is only tedious and is the very life and soul of the table  according to annual custom i passed some days with him last autumn there is a tranquillity which transpires from the master and mistress of this family through every member belonging to it the servants are few but so assiduous in their respective stations that you can no where be better waited on the table is plain but elegant and though the major himself is no sportsman and has done carrying a gun the kindness of his neighbors keeps him well supplied with game and every sort of rural luxury that their farms and gardens can furnish nothing can be more delightful than the face of the country about him and i was charmed with his little ornamented farm in particular the disposition of the garden and the abundance of it is fruits and flowers bespeak mrs manlove no common adept in that sweet and captivating science  one day as my friend and i were riding through his fields to enjoy the western breeze of a fine september morning our ears were saluted with the full chorus of the hounds from a neighboring copse and as we were crossing one of the pastures toward them we heard two men at high words behind a thick hedge that concealed them from our fight and soon after the sound of blows which seemed to be heavily laid on accompanied with oaths and cries that made us push to the next gate with all the speed we could muster one of the combatants was lying on the ground roaring for mercy under the cudgel of his conqueror who was belaboring him at a furious rate the person of the victor was unknown to major manlove the vanquished soon made him recognize the ruesul features of tom tinder who called upon the major by name to interpose and save him from being murdered  this was no sooner done than the cudgeller who was a sturdy clown gave us to understand that he had been doing no more than every englishman has a right to do returning the loan of a blow with proper interest to the lender this the prostrate hero did not deny but asserted that the rascal had headed the hare as she was breaking cover and turned her into the wood again by which means he had spoilt the days sport  and did you this designedly said the major  not i master replied the countryman as heaven shall judge me i love the sport too well to spoil it wilfully but if i was traveling along the road just as puss was popping through the hedge could i help it am i in the fault and should this gentleman if he be a gentleman ride up to me as if he would have trampled me like a dog under his horses feet and lay the butt of his whip upon my scull i think no man can bear that so i pulled him out of the saddle and banged him well and i think no good man as you appear to be will say otherwise than that he well deserved it  if this be so answered the major i can say nothing to the contrary  how sir exclaimed the squire who was now upon his legs is a rascal like this to return blow for blow and does major manlove abet him in such insolence  i am sorry sir replied the major calmly you should put such a question to me but when gentlemen lose their temper  sir quoth tom interrupting him i have lost my horse and that is the worse loss of the two  it is what you are least used to replied the major and without more words quietly trotted homewards  as we jogged along my friend began to comment with much pleasantry upon this ridiculous incident interlarding his discourse every now and then with remarks of a more serious sort upon the ill effects of a hasty temper and giving me some traits of his neighbors habits of life which though not so uncommon as i could wish were nevertheless such as when contrasted with his benevolent character may perhaps serve to furnish out no very unedifying topic for an essay in the observer  no cli musa dedit fidibus divos puerosque deorum et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum et juvenum curas et libera vina refer horat in times of very remote antiquity when men were not so lavish of their wit as they have since been poetry could not furnish employment for more than three muses but as business grew upon their hands and departments multiplied it became necessary to enlarge the commission and a board was constituted consisting of nine in number who had their several presidencies allotted to them and every branch of the art poetic thenceforth had its peculiar patroness and superintendant  as to the precise time when these three senior goddesses called in their six new assessors it is matter of conjecture only but if the poet hesiod was as we are told the first who had the honor of announcing their names and characters to the world we may reasonably suppose this was done upon the immediate opening of their new commission as they would hardly enter upon their offices without apprising all those whom it might concern of their accession  before this period the three eldest sisters condescended to be maids of all work and if the work became more than they could turn their hands to they have nobody but themselves and their fellow deities to complain of for had they been content to have let the world go on in its natural course mere mortal poets would not probably have overburthened either it or them but when apollo himself who being their president should have had more consideration for their ease begot the poet linus in one of his terrestrial frolics and endowed him with hereditary genius he took a certain method to make work for the muses accordingly we find the chaste calliope herself the eldest of the sisterhood and who should have set a better example to the family could not hold out against this heavenly bastard but in an unguarded moment yielded her virgin honors to linus and produced the poet orpheus such an instance of celestial incontinence could not fail to shake the morals of the most demure and even the cold goddess luna caught the flame and smuggled a bantling into the world whom maliciously enough she named musaeus with a sly design no doubt of laying her child at the door of the parnassian nunnery  three such highblooded bards as linus orpheus and musaeus so fathered and so mothered were enough to people all greece with poets and musicians and in truth they were not idle in their generation but like true patriarchs spread their families over all the shores of ionia and the islands of the archipelago it is not therefore to be wondered at if the three sister muses who had enough to do to nurse their own children and descendants were disposed to call in other helpmates to the task and whilst greece was in its glory it may well be supposed that all the nine sisters were fully employed in bestowing upon every votary a portion of their attention and answering every call made upon them for aid and inspiration much gratitude is due to them from their favored poets and much has been paid for even to the present hour they are invoked and worshipped by the sons of verse whilst all the other deities of olympus have either abdicated their thrones or been dismissed from them with contempt even milton himself in his sacred epic invokes the heavenly muse who inspired moses on the top of horeb or of sinai by which he ascribes great antiquity as well as dignity to the character he addresses  the powers ascribed to orpheus were under the veil of fable emblems of his influence over savage minds and of his wisdom and eloquence in reclaiming them from that barbarous state upon these impressions civilization and society took place the patriarch who founded a family or tribe the legislator who established a state the priest prophet judge or king are characters which if traced to their first sources will be found to branch from that of poet the first prayers the first laws and the earliest prophecies were metrical prose has a later origin and before the art of writing was in existence poetry had reached a very high degree of excellence and some of it is noblest productions were no otherwise preserved than by tradition as to the sacred quality of their first poetry the greeks are agreed and to give their early bards the better title to inspiration they feign them to be descended from the gods orpheus must have profited by his mothers partiality and linus may well be supposed to have had some interest with his father apollo but to dwell no longer on these fabulous legends of the greeks we may refer to the books of moses for the earliest and most authentic examples of sacred poetry every thing that was the immediate effusion of the prophetic spirit seems to have been chaunted forth in dithyrambic measure the valedictory blessings of the patriarchs when dying the songs of triumph and thanksgiving after victory are metrical and high as the antiquity of the sacred poem of job undoubtedly is such nevertheless is its character and construction as to carry strong internal marks of its being written in an advanced state of the art  the poet therefore whether hebrew or greek was in the earliest ages a sacred character and his talent a divine gift a celestial inspiration men regarded him as the ambassador of heaven and the interpreter of it is will it is perfectly in nature and no less agreeable to gods providence to suppose that even in the darkest times some minds of a more enlightened sort should break forth and be engaged in the contemplation of the universe and its author from meditating upon the works of the creator the transition to the act of praise and adoration follows as it were of course these are operations of the mind which naturally inspire it with a certain portion of rapture and enthusiasm rushing upon the lips in warm and glowing language and disdaining to be expressed in ordinary and vulgar phrase the thoughts become inflated the breast labors with a passionate desire to say something worthy of the ear of heaven something in a more elevated tone and cadence something more harmonious and musical this can only be effected by measured periods by some chaunt that can be repeated in the strain again and again grateful at once to the ear and impressive on the memory and what is this but poetry poetry then is the language of prayer an address becoming of the deity it may be remembered it may be repeated in the ears of the people called together for the purposes of worship this is a form that may be fixed upon their minds and in this they may be taught to join  the next step in the progress of poetry from the praise of god is to the praise of men illustrious characters heroic actions are singled out for celebration the inventors of useful arts the reformers of savage countries the benefactors of mankind are extolled in verse they are raised to the skies and the poet having praised them as the first of men whilst on earth deifies them after death and conscious that they merit immortality boldly bestows it and assigns to them a rank and office in heaven appropriate to the character they maintained in life hence it is that the merits of a bacchus a hercules and numbers more are amplified by the poet till they become the attributes of their divinity altars are raised and victims immolated to their worship these are the fanciful effects of poetry in its second stage religion overheated turns into enthusiasm enthusiasm forces the imagination into all the visionary regions of fable and idolatry takes possession of the whole gentile world the egyptians a mysterious dogmatizing race begin the work with symbol and hieroglyphic the greeks a vain ingenious people invent a set of tales and fables for what they do not understand embellish them with all the glittering ornaments of poetry and spread the captivating delusion over all the world  in the succeeding period we review the poet in full possession of this brilliant machinery and with all olympus at his command surrounded by apollo and the muses he commences every poem with an address to them for protection he has a deity at his call for every operation of nature if he would roll the thunder jupiter shakes mount ida to dignify his description neptune attends him in his car if he would allay the ocean if he would let loose the winds to raise it aeolus unbars his cave the spear of mars and the aegis of minerva arm him for the battle the arrows of apollo scatter pestilence through the air mercury flies upon the messages of jupiter juno raves with jealousy and venus leads the loves and graces in her train in this class we contemplate homer and his inferior brethren of the epic order it is their province to form the warrior instruct the politician animate the patriot they delineate the characters and manners they charm us with their descriptions surprise us with their incidents interest us with their dialogue they engage every passion in its turn melt us to pity rouse us to glory strike us with terror fire us with indignation in a word they prepare us for the drama and the drama for us  a new poet now comes upon the stage he stands in person before us he no longer appears as a blind and wandering bard chaunting his rhapsodies to a throng of villagers collected in a group about him but erects a splendid theater gathers together a whole city as his audience prepares a striking spectacle provides a chorus of actors brings music dance and dress to his aid realizes the thunder bursts open the tombs of the dead calls forth their apparitions descends to the very regions of the damned and drags the furies from their flames to present themselves personally to the terrified spectators such are the powers of the drama here the poet reigns and triumphs in his highest glory  the fifth denomination gives us the lyric poet chaunting his ode at the public games and festivals crowned with olive and encompassed by all the wits and nobles of his age and country here we contemplate stesichorus alcaeus pindar callistratus sublime abrupt impetuous they strike us with the shock of their electric genius they dart from earth to heaven there is no following them in their flights we stand gazing with surprise their boldness awes us their brevity confounds us their sudden transitions and ellipses escape our apprehension we are charmed we know not why we are pleased with being puzzled and applaud although we cannot comprehend in the lighter lyric we meet anacreon sappho and the votaries of bacchus and venus in the grave didactic solemn class we have the venerable names of a solon a tyrtaeus and those who may be styled the demagogues in poetry is liberty to be asserted licentiousness to be repressed is the spirit of a nation to be roused it is the poet not the orator must give the soul its energy and spring is salamis to be recovered it is the elegy of solon must found the march to it is attack are the lacedaemonians to be awakened from their lethargy it is tyrtaeus who must sing the warsong and revive their languid courage  poetry next appears in its pastoral character it affects the garb of shepherds and the language of the rustic it represents to our view the rural landscape and the peaceful cottage it records the labors the amusements the loves of the village nymphs and swains and exhibits nature in its simplest state it is no longer the harp or the lyre but the pipe of the poet which now invites our attention theocritus leaning on his crook in his russet mantle and clouted brogues appears more perfectly in character than the courtly maro who seems more the shepherd of the theater than of the field i have yet one other class in reserve for the epigrammatist but i will shut up my list without him not being willing that poetry which commences with a prayer should conclude with a pun  no clii neque lex est justior ulla quam necis artifices art perire sua  we have heard so much of the tragical effects of jealousy that i was not a little pleased with an account lately given me of a gentleman who has been happily cured of his jealousy without any of those melancholy circumstances which too frequently result from that fatal passion even when it is groundless as this gentlemans jealousy was of that description i am the rather tempted to relate the story under proper caution as to names and persons because there is a moral justice in its catastrophe which is pleasing even in fiction but more particularly so when we meet it in the real occurrences of life  sir paul testy in his fortyeighth year married the beautiful louisa in her eighteenth there are some parents who seem to think a good settlement can atone for any disparity of age and louisas were of this sort sir paul had a maiden sister several years younger than himself who had kept his house for some time before his marriage with louisa and as this lady was in fact an admirable oeconomist and also in possession of a very considerable independent fortune the prudent baronet took his measures for her continuance in his family where under pretense of assisting the inexperience of his young bride she still maintained her government in as absolute authority as ever as miss rachel would have been better pleased with her brother had he chosen a wife with less beauty and more fortune than louisa brought into the family it may well be doubted if she would have remained with him after his marriage had she not been pretty far advanced in an affair of the heart with a certain young gentleman whose attentions though in fact directed to her purse she was willing to believe had been honorably addressed to her person this young gentleman whom i shall call lionel was undoubtedly an object well deserving the regards of any lady in miss rachels predicament with a fine person and engaging address he had the recommendation of high birth being a younger son of the lord mortimer a venerable old peer who resided at his family mansion within a few miles of sir paul and lived upon the most friendly terms with him in a frequent intercourse of visits lionel had given this worthy father great uneasiness from his early dissipation and extravagance considerable sums had been paid for him to clear his debts but the old lords estate being a moderate one and entailed upon his eldest son lionel had been obliged to sell out of the army and was now living at home upon the bounty of his father on a reduced and slender allowance  it is not to be wondered at that lionel who felt his own embarassments too sensibly to neglect any fair means of getting rid of them should be willing to repair his shattered fortunes by an advantageous match and though miss rachel was not exactly the lady he would have chosen yet he very justly considered that his circumstances did not entitle him to choose for himself he was also strongly urged to the measure by his father to whose wishes he held himself bound to conform not only on the score of duty but of atonement likewise at this time the affair was in so promising a train that there is little doubt but it would have been brought to a conclusion between the parties had not sir pauls marriage taken place as it did but as miss rachel for reasons which are sufficiently explained determined upon remaining with her brother the intercourse between the lovers was renewed as soon as sir peter had brought home his bride and was sufficiently settled to receive the visits of his friends and neighbors on the occasion  now it was that the unhappy rachel became a victim to the most tormenting of all human passions her sisterinlaw had a thousand charms and she soon discovered or fancied she discovered that lionels attentions were directed toward a fairer object than herself she had now the strongest of all motives for keeping a watchful eye upon louisas behavior and it is the property of jealousy to magnify and discolor every thing it looks upon for some time however she kept herself under prudent restraint a hint now and then cautiously introduced in the way of advice was all she ventured upon but these hints were so little attended to by louisa whose innocent gayety lent no ear to such remonstrances that they were occasionally repeated in a graver tone as these grew more and more peevish louisa began to take a little mischievous pleasure in teazing and was piqued into a behavior which probably she would never have indulged herself in toward lionel had not rachels jealousy provoked her to it still it was innocent but so far imprudent as it gave a handle to rachels malice who now began to sow the seeds of discontent in her brothers irritable bosom  in one of those sparring dialogues which now frequently passed between the sisters rachel after descanting upon the old topic with some degree of asperity concluded her lecture with many professions of zeal for louisas happiness and observed to her as an apology for the freedom of her advice that she had a right to some little experience of the world more than had yet fallen to the others lot to which louisa replied with some tartness  true for you have lived more years in it than i have  a few perhaps answered rachel  as few or as many as you choose to acknowledge added louisa it is one amongst a variety of advantages over me which you are too generous to boast of and i too humble to repine at  be that as it may said the elder damsel you will give me leave to observe that you have a double call upon you for discretion you are a married woman  perhaps that very circumstance may be a proof of my indiscretion  how so madam i may venture to say my brother sir paul was no unseasonable match for your ladyship at least i can witness some pains were employed on your part to obtain him  well my dear sister replied louisa with an affected nonchalance after so much pains is it not natural i should wish to repose myself a little  indiscretion admits of no repose health honor happiness are sacrificed by it is effects it saps the reputation of a wife it shakes the affections of a husband  be content cried louisa if you will give no cause for disturbing the affections of the husband i will take care none shall be given for attainting the reputation of the wife  at this moment sir paul entered the room and perceiving by the countenances of the ladies that they were not perfectly in good humor with each other eagerly demanded of louisa why she looked so grave  i would look grave if i could she replied out of compliment to my company but i have so light a conscience and so gay a heart that i cannot look gravity in the face without laughing at it  this was delivered with so pointed a glance at rachel that it was not possible to mistake the application and she had no sooner left the room than an explanation took place between the brother and sister in the course of which rachel artfully contrived to infuse such a copious portion of her own poisonous jealousy into the bosom of sir paul that upon the arrival of lord mortimer which was at this crisis announced to him he took a sudden determination to give him to understand how necessary it was become to his domestic happiness that lionel should be induced to discontinue his visits in his family  under these impressions and in a very awkward state of mind sir paul repaired to his library where lord mortimer was expecting him in a situation of no less embarassment having conned over a speech for the purpose of introducing a proposal for an alliance between the families and with a view to sound how sir paul might stand affected toward a match between his son lionel and miss rachel  as soon as the first ceremonies were over which were not very speedily dismissed as both parties were strict observers of the old rules of breeding his lordship began after his manner to wind about by way of reconnoitring his ground and having composed his features with much gravity and deliberation began to open his honorable trenches as follows  in very truth sir paul i protest to you there are few things in life can give me more pleasure than to find my son lionel so assiduous in his visits to this family  the baronet whose mind at this moment was not capable of adverting to any other idea but what had reference to his own jealousy stared with amazement at this unexpected address and was staggered how to reply to it at last with much hesitation in a tone of illcounterfeited raillery he replied that he truly believed there was one person in his family to whom mr lionels visits were particularly acceptable and as this was a subject very near his heart nay that alone upon which the honor and happiness of him and his family depended he assured his lordship that it was with avidity he embraced the opportunity of coming to an explanation which he hoped would be as confidential on his lordships part as it should be on his own there was something in the manner of sir pauls delivery as well as in the matter of the speech itself which alarmed the hereditary pride of the old peer who drawing himself up with great dignity observed to sir paul that for his son lionel he had this to say that want of honor was never amongst his failings nay it was never to be charged with impunity against any member of his family and that to prevent any imputation of this sort from being grounded upon his sons assiduities to a certain lady he had now sought this interview and explanation with his good friend and neighbor  this was so kind a lift in sir pauls conception toward his favorite point that he immediately exclaimed  i see your lordship is not unapprised of what is too conspicuous to be overlooked by any body who is familiar in this house but as i know your lordship is a man of the nicest honor in your own person i should hold myself essentially bound to you if you would prevail upon your son to adopt the like principles toward a certain lady under this roof and caution him to desist from those assiduities which you yourself have noticed and which to confess the truth to you i cannot be a witness to without very great uneasiness and discontent  upon these words the peer started from his seat as nimbly as age would permit him and with great firmness replied  sir paul testy if this be your wish and desire let me assure you it shall be mine also my sons visits in this family will never be repeated set your heart at rest lionel mortimer will give you and yours no further disturbance  my lord answered the baronet i am penetrated with the sense of your very honorable proceedings and the warmth with which you have expressed yourself on a subject so closely interwoven with my peace of mind you have eased my heart of it is burden and i shall ever be most grateful to you for it  sir replied the peer there is more than enough said on the subject i dare say my son will survive his disappointment  i dare say he will said sir paul i cannot doubt the success of mr lionels attentions i have only to hope he will direct them to some other object  lord mortimer now muttered something which sir paul did not hear nor perhaps attend to and took a hasty leave when it is explained to the reader that miss rachel had never even in the most distant manner hinted the situation of her heart to her brother on the contrary had industriously concealed it from him this malentendu will not appear out of nature and probability lionel whose little gallantries with louisa had not gone far enough seriously to engage his heart was sufficiently tired of his mercenary attachment to miss rachel so that he patiently submitted to his dismission and readily obeyed his fathers commands by a total discontinuance of his visits to sir paul to the ladies of the family this behavior appeared altogether mysterious sir paul kept the secret to himself and watched louisa very narrowly when he found she took no other notice of lionels neglect than by slightly remarking that she supposed he was more agreeably engaged he began to dismiss his jealousy and regain his spirits  it was far otherwise with the unhappy rachel her heart was on the rack for though she naturally suspected her brothers jealousy of being the cause of lionels absence yet she could not account for his silence toward herself in any other way than by supposing that louisa had totally drawn off his affections from her and this was agony not to be supported day after day passed in anxious expectation of a letter to explain this cruel neglect but none came all communication with the whole family of lord mortimer was at a stop no intelligence could be obtained from that quarter and to all such enquiries as she ventured to try upon her brother he answered so drily that she could gather nothing from him in the mean time as he became hourly better reconciled to louisa so he grew more and more cool to the miserable rachel who now too late discovered the fatal consequences of interfering between husband and wife and heartily reproached herself for her officiousness in aggravating his jealousy  whilst she was tormenting herself with these reflections and when louisa seemed to have forgotten that ever such a person as lionel existed a report was circulated that he was about to be married to a certain lady of great rank and fortune and that he had gone up with lord mortimer to town for that purpose there wanted only this blow to make rachels agonies complete in a state of mind little short of phrensy she betook herself to her chamber and there shutting herself up she gave vent to her passion in a letter fully charged with complaints and reproaches which she committed to a trusty messenger with strict injunctions to deliver it into lionels own hand and return with his answer this commission was faithfully performed and the following is the answer she received in return   madam i am no less astonished than affected by your letter if your brother has not long since informed you of his conference with my father and the result of it he has acted as unjustly by you as he has by lord mortimer and myself when my father waited upon sir paul for the express purpose of making known to him the hopes i had the ambition to entertain of rendering myself acceptable to you upon a proposal of marriage he received at once so short and peremptory a dismission on my behalf that painful as it was to my feelings i had no part to act but silently to submit and withdraw myself from a family where i was so unacceptable an intruder  when i confirm the truth of the report you have heard and inform you that my marriage took place this very morning you will pardon me if i add no more than that i have the honor to be  madam your most obedient and most humble servant lionel mortimer   every hope being extinguished by the receipt of this letter the disconsolate rachel became henceforth one of the most miserable of human beings after venting a torrent of rage against her brother she turned her back upon his house for ever and undetermined where to six whilst at intervals she can scarce be said to be in possession of her senses she is still wandering from place to place in search of that repose which is not to be found and wherever she goes exhibits a melancholy spectacle of disappointed envy and selftormenting spleen  no cliii a delisa possessed of beauty fortune rank and every elegant accomplishment that genius and education could bestow was withal so unsupportably capricious that she seemed born to be the torment of every heart which suffered itself to be attracted by her charms though her coquetry was notorious to a proverb such were her allurements that very few upon whom she thought fit to practice them had ever found resolution to resist their power of all the victims of her vanity leander seemed to be that over whom she threw her chains with the greatest air of triumph he was indeed a conquest to boast of for he had long and obstinately defended his heart and for a time made as many reprisals upon the tender passions of her sex as she raised contributions upon his her better star at length prevailed she beheld leander at her feet and though her victory was accomplished at the expense of more tender glances than she had ever bestowed upon the whole sex collectively yet it was a victory which only piqued adelisa to render his slavery the more intolerable for the trouble it had cost her to reduce him to it after she had trifled with him and tortured him in every way that her ingenious malice could devise and made such public display of her tyranny as subjected him to the ridicule and contempt of all the men who had envied his success and every woman who resented his neglect adelisa avowedly dismissed him as an object which could no longer furnish sport to her cruelty and turned to other pursuits with a kind of indifference as to the choice of them which seemed to have no other guide but mere caprice  leander was not wanting to himself in the efforts he now made to free himself from her chains but it was in vain the hand of beauty had wrapped them too closely about his heart and love had rivetted them too securely for reason pride or even the strongest struggles of resentment to throw them off he continued to love to hate to execrate and adore her his first resolution was to exile himself from her sight this was a measure of absolute necessity for he was not yet recovered enough to abide the chance of meeting her and he had neither spirits nor inclination to start a fresh attachment by way of experiment upon her jealousy fortune however befriended him in the very moment of despair for no sooner was he out of her sight than the coquettish adelisa found something wanting which had been so familiar to her that leander though despised when possessed when lost was regretted in vain she culled her numerous admirers for some one to replace him continually peevish and discontented adelisa became so intolerable to her lovers that there seemed to be a spirit conjuring up amongst them which threatened her with a general desertion what was to be done her danger was alarming it was imminent she determined to recall leander she informed herself of his haunts and threw herself in the way of a rencontre but he avoided her chance brought them to an interview and she began by rallying him for his apostasy there was an anxiety under all this affected pleasantry that she could not thoroughly conceal and he did not fail to discover he instantly determined upon the very wisest measure which deliberation could have formed he combated her with her own weapons he put himself apparently so much at his ease and counterfeited his part so well as effectually to deceive her she had now a new task upon her hands and the hardest as well as the most hazardous she had ever undertaken she attempted to throw him off his guard by a pretended pity for his past sufferings and a promise of kinder usage for the future he denied that he had suffered any thing and assured her that he never failed to be amused by her humors which were perfectly agreeable to him at all times  then it is plain replied she that you never thought of me as a wife for such humors must be insupportable to a husband  pardon me cried leander if ever i should be betrayed into the idle act of marriage i must be in one of those very humors myself defend me from the dull uniformity of domestic life what can be so insipid as the tame strain of nuptial harmony everlastingly repeated whatever other varieties i may then debar myself of let me at least find a variety of whim in the woman i am to be fettered to  upon my word exclaimed adelisa you would almost persuade me that we were destined for each other  this she accompanied with one of those looks in which she was most expert and which was calculated at once to inspire and to betray sensibility leander not yet so certain of his observations as to confide in them seemed to receive this ouverture as a raillery and affecting a laugh replied  i do not think it is in the power of destiny herself to determine either of us for if you was for one moment in the humor to promise yourself to me i am certain in the next you would retract it and if i was fool enough to believe you i should well deserve to be punished for my credulity hymen will never yoke us to each other nor to any body else but if you are in the mind to make a very harmless experiment of the little faith i put in all such promises here is my hand it is fit the proposal should spring from my quarter and not yours close with it as soon as you please and laugh at me as much as you please if i vent one murmur when you break the bargain  well then said adelisa to punish you for the sauciness of your provoking challenge and to convince you that i do not credit you for this pretended indifference to my treatment of you here is my hand and with it my promise and now i give you warning that if ever i do keep it twill be only from the conviction that i shall torment you more by fulfilling it than by flying from it  fairly declared cried leander and since my word is passed i will stand to it but take notice if i was not perfectly secure of being jilted i should think myself in a fair way to be the most egregious dupe in nature  in this strain of mutual raillery they proceeded to settle the most serious business of their lives and whilst neither would venture upon a confession of their passion each seemed to rely upon the other for a discovery of it they now broke up their conference in the gayest spirits imaginable and leander upon parting offered to make a bett of half his fortune with adelisa that she did not stand to her engagement at the same time naming a certain day as the period of its taking place  and what shall i gain said she in that case by half your fortune when i shall have a joint share in possession of the whole  talk not of fortune cried leander giving loose to the rapture which he could no longer restrain my heart my happiness my life itself is yours  so saying he caught her in his arms pressed her eagerly in his embrace and hastily departed  no sooner was he out of her sight than he began to expostulate with himself upon his indiscretion in the ecstacy of one unguarded moment he had blasted all his schemes and by exposing his weakness armed her with fresh engines to torment him in these reflections he passed the remainder of the night in vain he strove to find some justification for his folly he could not form his mind to believe that the tender looks she had bestowed upon him were any other than an experiment upon his heart to throw him from his guard and reestablish her tyranny with these impressions he presented himself at her door next morning and was immediately admitted adelisa was alone and leander immediately began by saying to her  i am now come to receive at your hands the punishment which a man who cannot keep his own secret richly deserves i surrender myself to you and i expect you will exert your utmost ingenuity in tormenting me only remember that you cannot give a stab to my heart without wounding your own image which envelopes every part and is too deeply impressed for even your cruelty totally to extirpate  at the conclusion of this speech adelisas countenance became serious she fixed her eyes upon the floor and after a pause without taking any notice of leander and as if she had been talking to herself in soliloquy repeated in a murmuring tone  well well it is all over but no matter  for the love of heaven cried leander in alarm what is all over  all that is most delightful to woman she replied all the luxury which the vanity of my sex enjoys in tormenting yours oh leander what charming projects of revenge had i contrived to punish your pretended indifference and depend upon it i would have executed them to the utmost rigor of the law of retaliation had you not in one moment disarmed me of my malice by a fair confession of your love believe me leander i never was a coquette but in selfdefence sincerity is my natural character but how should a woman of any attractions be safe in such a character when the whole circle of fashion abounds with artificial coxcombs pretenders to sentiment and professors of seduction when the whole world is in arms against innocence what is to become of the naked children of nature if experience does not teach them the art of defense if i have employed this art more particularly against you than others why have i so done but because i had more to apprehend from your insincerity than any other persons and proportioned my defenses to my danger between you and me leander it has been more a contest of cunning than an affair of honor and if you will call your own conduct into fair review trust me you will find little reason to complain of mine naturally disposed to favor your attentions more than any other mans it particularly behoved me to guard myself against propensities at once so pleasing and so suspicious let this suffice in justification of what is past it now remains that i should explain to you the system i have laid down for the time to come if ever i assume the character of a wife i devote myself to all it is duties i bid farewell at once to all the vanities the petulancies the coquetries of what is falsely called a life of pleasure the whole system must undergo a revolution and be administered upon other principles and to other purposes i know the world too well to commit myself to it when i have more than my own conscience to account to when i have not only truths but the similitudes of truths to study suspicions jealousies appearances to provide against when i am no longer singly responsible on the score of error but of example also it is not therefore in the public display of an affluent fortune in dress equipage entertainments nor even in the fame of splendid charities my pleasures will be found they will center in domestic occupations in cultivating nature and the sons of nature in benefiting the tenants and laborers of the soil that supplies us with the means of being useful in living happily with my neighbors in availing myself of those numberless opportunities which a residence in the country affords of relieving the untold distresses of those who suffer in secret and are too humble or perhaps too proud to ask  here the enraptured leander could no longer keep silence but breaking forth into transports of love and admiration gave a turn to the conversation which it is no otherwise interesting to relate than as it proved the prelude to an union which speedily took place and has made leander and adelisa the fondest and the worthiest couple in england  from adelisas example i would willingly establish this conclusion that the characters of young unmarried women who are objects of admiration are not to be decided upon by the appearances which they are oftentimes tempted to assume upon the plea of selfdefence i would not be understood by this to recommend disguise in any shape or to justify those who resort to artifice upon the pretended necessity of the measure but i am thoroughly disposed to believe that the triflings and dissemblings of the young and fair do not so often flow from the real levity of their natures as they are thought to do those in particular whose situation throws them into the vortex of the fashion have much that might be said in palliation of appearances many coquettes besides adelisa have become admirable wives and mothers and how very many more might have approved themselves such had they fallen into the hands of men of worth and good sense is a conjecture which leads to the most melancholy reflections there is so little honorable love in the men of high life before marriage and so much infidelity after it that the husband is almost in every instance the corrupter of his wife a woman as she is called of the world is in many peoples notions a proscribed animal a silly idea prevails that she is to lead a husband into certain ruin and disgrace parents in general seem agreed in exerting all their influence and authority for keeping her out of their families in place of whom they frequently obtrude upon their sons some raw and inexperienced thing whom they figure to themselves as a creature of perfect innocence and simplicity a wife who may be modelled to the wishes of her husband whose manners are untainted by the vices of the age and on whose purity fidelity and affection he may repose his happiness for the rest of his days alas how grossly they misjudge their own true interests in the case how dangerous is the situation of these children of the nursery at their first introduction into the world those only who are unacquainted with the deceitfulness of pleasure can be thoroughly intoxicated by it it is the novelty which makes the danger and surely it requires infinitely more judgment stronger resolutions and closer attentions to steer the conduct of a young wife without experience than would serve to detach the woman of the world from frivolities she is surfeited with and by fixing her to your interests convert what you have thought a dissipated character into a domestic one  the same remark applies to young men of private education you keep them in absolute subjection till they marry and then in a moment make them their own masters from mere infancy you expect them to step at once into perfect manhood the motives for the experiment may be virtuous but the effects of it will be fatal  i am now approaching to the conclusion of this my fifth volume and according to my present purpose shall dismiss the observers from any further duty the reader and i are here to part a few words therefore on such an occasion i may be permitted to subjoin i have done my best to merit his protection and as i have been favorably heard whilst yet talking with him i hope i shall not be unkindly remembered when i can speak no more i have passed a life of many labors and now being near it is end have little to boast but of an inherent good will toward mankind which disappointments injuries and age itself have not been able to diminish it has been the chief aim of all my attempts to reconcile and endear man to man i love my country and contemporaries to a degree of enthusiasm that i am not sure is perfectly defensible though to do them justice each in their turns have taken some pains to cure me of my partiality it is however one of those stubborn habits which people are apt to excuse in themselves by calling it a second nature there is a certain amiable lady in the world in whose interests i have the tenderest concern and whose virtues i contemplate with paternal pride to her i have always wished to dedicate these volumes but when i consider that such a tribute cannot add an atom to her reputation and that no form of words which i can invent for the occasion would do justice to what passes in my heart i drop the undertaking and am silent  finis
