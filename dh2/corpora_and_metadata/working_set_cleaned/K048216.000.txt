a day in turkey or the russian slaves  a comedy as acted at the theater royal in covent garden  by mrs cowley  the second edition  london printed for g g j and j robinson in paternoster row mdccxcii  advertisement hints have been thrown out and the idea industriously circulated that the following comedy is tainted with politics i protest i know nothing about politics  will miss wolstonecraft forgive me  whose book contains such a body of mind as i hardly ever met with  if i say that politics are unfeminine i never in my life could attend to their discussion  true comedy has always been defined to be a picture of life  a record of passing manners  a mirror to reflect to succeeding times the characters and follies of the present how then could i pretending to be a comic poet bring an emigrant frenchman before the public at this day and not make him hint at the events which had just passed or were then passing in his native country a character so written would have been anomalous  the critics ought to have had no mercy on me it is a la greque who speaks not i nor can i be accountable for his sentiments such is my idea of tracing character and were i to continue to write for the stage i should always govern myself by it  the illiberal and false suggestions concerning the politics of the comedy i could frankly forgive had they not deprived it of the honor of a command the passages on which those misrepresentations were built were on the second night omitted but immediately afterward restored and the day in turkey leaves the press exactly as it has continued to be performed amidst the most vivid and uninterrupted plaudits  or interrupted only by the glitter of soft tears a species of applause not less flattering than the spontaneous laugh or the voluntary collision of hands  some of the performers in this comedy have played so transcendently well that their names deserve to be recorded but to particularise any when all have aimed at perfection would be invidious  h cowley feb         prologue spoken by mr harley not from the present moment springs our play the events which gave it birth are past away  five glowing moons have chased nights shades from earth since the war fled which gave our drama birth  not smiling peace over russias widespread land  waved gently then her scepter of command  no thousands rushed at red ambitions call  with madning rage to triumph  or to fall  twas then our female bard from britains shore  was led by fancy to the distant roar  twas then she saw sweet virgins captives made twas then she saw the cheek of beauty fade whilst the proud soldier in ignoble chains was from his country dragged to hostile plains thus was her bold imagination fired when battle with its horrid train retired yet sure the story which she then combined should not to drear oblivion be resigned  no  let it still your various passions raise and to have touched them often has been her praise trusting to candor she solicits here your smile of pleasure or your pitys tear for though the time is past the feeling true she dedicates to nature and to you note  the lines distinguished by italics are from the pen of della crusca

back ground a turkish camp several turks are seen at a distance passing and repassing with haste some of them look out from amidst the trees and then retire enter paulina precipitately at the bottom pau where  o where shall we fly looking round wildly brother  father  come we are driven from our cottage we have no longer a home  let us run some where to seek another   enter old man and son son come father lean on me and let us walk faster or we shall be picked up by some of the turband gentry they are out a foraging and they always consider christians as useful cattle let us fly   father fly alas with the load of seventy years upon my shoulders how hard a task we shall never escape them child  thou wilt see thy father murdered and worse luck than that will be thy fate   pau worse luck than to be murdered i should be glad to see the day  what worse can happen   old man thou wilt be made a slave  slave to a turk cries  i shall see thee in a vile turks seraglio no better as it were than the handmaid of a jew   pau well i may outlive such a misfortune as that but i never heard of outliving a throat cut  so dear father cheer up and let us hurry on to the next village peter take care of that bag  for it contains all we have in the world   son aye and if it had not been for some of our own soldiers i had been a lost man  they were so kind as to strip our cottage yesterday and left us no more than i can very conveniently move under   pau yes and more than all that they took away my very best gown and my new fur cap crying yes and he who took them said it was in friendship for that otherwise my very best gown and cap would certainly fall into the hands of the enemy   son yes it was truly a very friendly action and they performed it like gentlemen  no words but their very looks were oaths and the black eyebrows of one of them spoke louder curses than i ever heard between fifty siberian boarhunters clashing of swords without there  there do you hear our friends are coming down upon us and our enemies are at hand come let us run with a look of terror  from friends and enemies holy michael defend us exeunt    clashing of swords a la greque enters running at top then stops looks back and speaks a la gr there it goes  there it goes nothing can save thee my gallant master  this comes of your reconnoitering  had you not better have been in your tent quietly breaking your fast than here breaking the heads of the turks  so now he is disarmed  well nobody bid ye  it is all your own fault  now how comely he looks with his arms folded and his sword in the hands of that beetlebrowd turk pardie i feel now as great a man as my master   enter orloff surrounded by turks muley courageous russian thou art ours could valor have saved thee captivity and you had never met  your empress we trust has not many such soldiers in the neighboring camp  come droop not sir this is the fortune of war   orloff had i been made your prisoner whilst on a post of duty i could have borne my lot  a soldier can support not only death but even slavery when a sense of duty gives dignity to his chains but my chains are base ones for i reconnoiterd without command and have lost my liberty without glory   a la gr then i have lost my liberty too without glory for i attended you without command and now  oh le diable i am valet de chamber to a slave   turk let not that affect thee the fortune of war which has wounded your masters pride ought to elate yours for you are now his equal  both slaves alike   a la gr eagerly are we so and has he no farther right to command me nor threaten me kind sir tell me but that  tell me but that    turk none none   a la gr hum puts his hat on takes out his snuff box takes snuff then goes to his master and offers his box take a pinch dont be shy   orloff scoundrel throws up the box with his arm   a la gr nay no hard names  let us be civil to each other as brother slaves ought to be  and now i think of it  hark ye i suppose your slaves take rank according to their usefulness   turk certainly   a la gr well then my master  i mean that man there who was my master can do no earthly thing but fight whilst i on the contrary am expert at several   muley your qualifications   a la gr they are innumerable  i can sing you pretty little french airs and italian canzonettas  no man in paris sir  for i have the honor to be a frenchman  no man in paris understands the science of the powderpuff better than myself  i can frize you in a taste beyond  oh what you are all crops i see  fore fronts and back fronts  oh those vile turbans my genius will be lost amongst you and a frizeur will be of no more use than an oysterwoman  why you look as though you had all been scalpd and covered your crowns with your pillows   turk christian our turbans are too elevated a subject for your sport   a la gr dear sir pointing to his turban and then to the ground drop the subject it will be a proof of national taste   muley thy speech is licentious and empty but in a frenchman we can pardon it  it is national taste  however if your boasted qualifications end here it is probable you will be a slave as little distinguished as your master   a la gr pardonnez moi i can do things he never thought of  you have heard the story of the basketmaker amongst savages i do not despair of seeing my master my servant yet  courage monsieur ie compte i will treat you with great condescension depend on it and endeavor to make you forget in all things the distance between us   muley he seems too deeply absorbed in melancholy to be roused by thy impertinence   a la gr poor young man times are altered to be sure and at present he is a little down in the mouth but he is fond of music cheer him with a turkish air  helas all the air we have will be turkish now   orloff ah no forbear your music and bring me your chains drag me to your dungeons the intellectual bitterness of this moment cannot be increased by outward circumstance   a la gr chains and dungeons why sure the ghost of our dead bastille has not found its way hither  hey messieurs have you lantern posts too and hanging marquisses in this country   orloff angrily peace   a la gr peace that is a bold demand  your empress cannot find it at the head of a hundred thousand men and the most sublime grand signior is obliged to put on his nightcap without it though he has a million of these pretty gentlemen to assist him  besides england has engrossed the commodity   orloff come sir let us not loiter here  i would have my fate determined and my misery complete alas is it not already so yes my heart has been long the property of sorrow and it will never relinquish its claims   muley i shall lead you to the palace of the bassa ibrahim  it is in the neighborhood of yonder camp which he commands what your fate may then be his humor determines   a la gr then i hope we shall catch him in a good humor and what care i whether a turk or a ruffian has the honor to be my master now you see the misfortune of being born a count had he lost no more than i have he would be as careless as i am  come brother slave  no ceremony no ceremony i beg   exeunt  a la greque pulls back his master and walks out before him scene ii rocks  enter peter  runs across the stage is followed by paulina shrieking  they go off  two turks pursue them and bring them back turk stay stay young ones it is but manners to wait for your father  you see he is hobbling up as fast as he can   pau aye very true  oh peter how could we run away and leave our father   peter why we only took care of number one and we have a right to do that all the world over so we are captives now then and slaves in downright arnest   turk aye   pau look at my poor father if your hearts were not harder than those very rocks you could never make a slave of him   enter the father guarded by two turks father o my dear children those flints which wound my feet are not so sharp as the wounds which gash my heart for you   pau there  do ye hear o the miseries of war i wonder war is ever the fashion  pray sir what made the king of the turks and our old empress agree to go to war together   turk to give brave soldiers an opportunity of running away with such pretty girls as you   pau o fie on them i think if they were now to see my father and brother peter and i in this condition they would be both ashamed of themselves   peter ashamed of themselves dont talk so ignrntly  excuse her gentlemen she knows nothing of the world she thinks kings and empresses are made of the same stuff as other mortals   turk to the father come honesty cheer up at the next village there is a wagon into which you and your family shall be put and carried to the end of your short journey   pau laws a wagon  whose is it   turk it shall be your own for the present   pau our own that is droll enough so we are made slaves in order to ride in our own carriage   exeunt scene the gardens of the bassa decorated with palms fountains etc in the eastern style enter mustapha mus where is she where is she i dont see her here  she is generally leaning on that fountain looking like the nymph of the stream swelling it with her tears   azim without but i say no  do you mark me i say no    entering with two slaves mus then i say yes do ye mark me what a bawling you make  what are you coming here for hey   azim to look for that insolent female slave that russian that i may manage her a little   mus you manage her your ill humor toward her is never to be satisfied  you are as malicious as you are high  dont i know how to manage an obstinate female as well as you   azim ha ha ha all the knowledge that nature could contrive to pack into that little carcass of thine would be insufficient for such a purpose  manage an obstinate female the greatest generals in the world and the greatest tyrants have been foiled at it  leave her to me  i have discretion  she shall be kept on bread and water   mus mark his discretion keep a pretty woman on bread and water to make her contented and kind   azim it is right i will maintain it to her teeth  for first she is a russian and a bear    mus the beautiful alexina a russian bear well secondly   azim she is a christian and those christians are the most unnaturalist creatures in the world  why man they betray their friends and love their enemies ha ha   mus do they so then she is no christian  for as to loving her enemies i have heard her say to thy face that she hates thee  so let her be treated like an honest turk   azim so she shall  an honest turk returns hate for hate and so do you see her feast shall be a fast   goes off at the top mus take care of the orders i gave ye  when our master arrives let no one be over busy to speak of this russian slave  if possible i would have him forget that she is in the haram   slaves we shall be careful exeunt slaves   enter alexina from the top followed by azim alex pursue me not thou inexorable slave you invade my retirement you drive me from solitude though solitude alone can mitigate my sorrows   azim nonsense  solitude and retirement they were made for birds of night owls may rejoice in them but women should seek daylight   alex daylight gives me no joy through eleven weeks have i dragged on a torpid existence  see  going to a tree here is the sad register of my days of infelicity my bodkin on its tender rind has marked the return of each unhallowed sabbath  the wounds now but just discernible will deepen as the tree advances to maturity and speak in another age the miseries of alexina  takes up a folded paper from amongst the shrubs a paper  poetry ah how descriptive of my own sensations  which of my companions has thus melodiously sung her sorrows reads  i a poor captive feel each day that slowly creeps with leaden pace blessed freedom here never lends her ray  her bright steps here we never trace oh that wild on some high mountain i could catch the wandering winds or starting from some desert fountain emulate the bounding hinds the clouds that swim in airs soft ocean seem to scorn my prison towers zephyrs light unfettered motion deeper heavier makes my hours  azim snatching the paper from her hand such a wailing about freedom and liberty why the christians in one of the northern islands have established a slave trade and proved by act of parliament that freedom is no blessing at all   mus no no they have only proved that it does not suit dark complexions to such a pretty creature as this they would think it a blessing to give every freedom  and take every freedom   azim come come be gay and happy like the rest of the slaves how stands your mind today toward a handsome bassa our master is returning from the camp  the cessation of hostilities will give him a short leisure which he will certainly devote to pleasure and his haram   alex mustapha do not let that unfeeling slave talk to me  thou have humanity   mus would i could administer to his disease it is a terrible one the love of talking is in him an absolute frenzy to silence him is impossible  but as i have power over him i can oblige him to retire  go   azim go what shall an insolent christian    mus go go   azim she shall repent exit   alex does your master indeed return today   mus yes and all the women of his haram are preparing for his reception  they half frantic with joy wonder to behold your tears   alex i am not a woman of his haram with disdain   mus but charming alexina can you hope longer to escape today he will see you   alexina stands a moment as though struck then clasps her hands with an action of despair then turns alex oh mustapha behold a lowly suppliant kneels she is of no vulgar rank who thus kneels to you for protection   mus for protection i am myself a slave  rise dear lady   alex rising but thou have power with thy master oh invent some excuse  say something to save me from the interview   mus i will consider  i  music at a distance nay if it must be so conceal yourself at once for i hear the music which announces his approach and he will probably hasten hither   alex o miserable speed i go  mustapha on thy eloquence depends my breath  the moments of my life are numbered by thy success  press fearlessly the cause of virtue and glow with the sainted subject  thus though a slave thy souls high state shall prove its origin divine soar far above thy wretched fate and over thy chains sublimely shine exit  mus why as to chastity and all that which you make an orthodox article of sweet one we turks are a sort of dissenters  a womans virtue with us is to charm and her religion should be love  ah ah here comes ibrahim and his whole haram  his creed is love and there is not a more orthodox man in the country   enter lauretta and fatima hastily laur ah mustapha the bassa is arrived full of triumph full of wishes panting to behold alexina  what will become of her where is she   mus she just now run off on that side and i shall run off on this  for i have not settled what to say about her and bassas and tigers are animals not made to be trifled with exit   fat well let that pretty melancholy slave feel as she pleases  i for my part am half out of my wits to think how happy we shall be now the bassa is come back  we shall have nothing but whim and entertainment  have you been looking at the new pavilion today   laur no   fat o dear it is almost finished  the hangings are gold tissue and when our beautiful sofa which we have been making for him is set up and the bassa sees it all together he will be transported  do you not think so hark here he comes with all the ensigns of war at his heels  o no  they come first i protest  i will stand here and take a view of the whole   a march is played standard bearers advance first they are followed by female slaves who dance down the stage to light music and exit the chorus singers follow female slaves strewing flowers from little baskets succeed the bassa then appears at the top with his principal officers chorus selim laur fat etc hark sound the trumpet breathe the flute and touch the soft melodious lute to heaven let every grateful sound ascend thanks for our prince restored our lover and our friend victorious hero blooming sage the scourge and glory of our age let roseate pleasures round thy footsteps twine and lead thee on to joy and bless thy valiant line vain

a sweeter triumph than your songs can bestow awaits me  where is the lovely russian who though my captive more than two moons i have not yet beheld   azim we rejoice in our lords return that her pride may be humbled  the insolence of her carriage and the perverseness of her temper are intolerable   ibra thou have seen her muley does she justify azims description   muley she is reserved my lord reserved and melancholy  but she is too gentle to be insolent   azim muley knows her not  can thou believe it mighty bassa the idea of surrendring her charms to thee and of being raised to the honor of thy notice has never once softened her ill humor nor abated her melancholy   ibra indeed angrily bring her to me instantly  yes instantly bid her come to my presence and tell her  no  hold  i will receive her in my hall of audience dazzle her with my greatness and astonish her into love   laur ha ha ha ha ha ha   ibra why that laugh lauretta   laur ha ha ha at your new invention of astonishing people into love  if you can contrive to do that you will be the most astonishing bashaw in all turkey   ibra how then   laur grandeur and dignity to inspire love ha ha ha they may inspire your pretty captive with veneration and respect  but veneration and respect is an atmosphere so cold that love starves in it   ibra what then must i do to touch her heart with love   laur affect humility not greatness you must become a suppliant before you can hope to be a victor   ibra do thou speak truth my pretty italian  thy country is the country of love and thou should be an adept in the science   laur yes i know the history of the heart and do assure you that you must become the slave of your captive if you ever mean to taste the sublime excesses of a mutual passion   azim contemptuously mutual passion sir she is your slave command her such baseness may befit an italian but a mussulman is more sensible to his dignity   ibra i will hear you both further on the subject  the iron labor of the war is for a few weeks suspended  and during that cessation pleasure i am thine prepare your banquets compose new delights let every hour teem with fresh invented joys till i forget the toils of the sanguinary field and bathe my wounds with rosyfingerd love exit with part of his train   fat well he is in delightful spirits  but how strange it is that the russian slave should not have presented herself to welcome her master and to give him an impression of her charms   laur stranger if she had when nothing frightens her so much as the idea of inspiring him with a passion  i am interested for her and it is for this reason i shall endeavor to make ibrahim pursue a conduct not usual from a mighty mussulman to his slave exit   fat hark ye azim what makes your lovely countenance look so grim when we are all so gay i declare your glum face suits the day as little as a black patch upon a gold robe  change it man change it and dont be afraid of losing any thing by it for you must look carefully to pick up a worse exit   muley azim since i saw thee last i have trod the paths of glory  i have slumbered amidst the frosts of the night i have toiled amidst the streams of burning day but i return and find thee the same  with me all things have changed but thou art unaltered  thy temper like the deep shadow of the forest is sometimes checkered by the dart of the angry lightning but the serene cheerfulness of the morning dwells not with thee   azim well and what then if you like me not thwart me not there is room enough in turkey for thee and for me  let the crow and the vulture rest on the same tree but may thou and i live as far apart as the streams of ilyssus and the waters of the bosphorus   selim surely thy evil disposition must be a scourge to thy soul  it must be affliction to thee   song selim ah teach thy breast soft pitys throb and harmonize thy rugged mind ah teach thy lid soft pitys tear that gem of sentiment refined could thou once know the tender bliss the sympathizing bosom knows when at meek sorrows sacred touch responsive sadness round it flows  no more thy brow would wear that frown thy glance no more so sternly dart but joys would glitter in thy eye and peace cling gladly to thy heart exeunt   end of the first act act ii scene an apartment in the bassa s palace ibrahim discovered seated under a canopy officers and slaves

country are thou   a la gr oh paris sir paris i traveled into russia to polish the brutes a little and to give them some ideas of the general equality of man but my generosity has been lost  they still continue to believe that a prince is more than a porter and that a lord is a better gentleman than his slave o had they but been with me at versailles when i helped to turn those things topsey turvey there   ibra did you find them equally dull in other respects   a la gr yes finding they would not learn liberty i would have taught them dancing but they seemed as incapable of one blessing as

ibra azim complains that she is an insolent and scornful beauty not gentle nor complaisant in the least   mus i will follow the lead and destroy every wish he may have to behold her aside yes yes as to insolence match me her fellow if you can  bless us to see the difference why my lord our eastern beauties are so gentle so complying they scarcely give you time to wish   ibra thou say right  smiling   mus pretty creatures if a man does but look at them they drop like a ripe cherry from the bough  no coldness no disdain but as to this proud russian it would be easier to march an army to st petersburgh and whip the empress through a keyhole into your baggage wagon than to subdue her petulance   ibra do thou think so oh every word thou utterest gives new ardor to my hopes new impulses to my desires  i adore her   mus alack alack  with surprize   ibra oh mustapha my imagination paints her her till my heart grows sick with love i see the beauteous scorner dart living lightnings from her eye and her cheek glow with chaste disdain i weep in anguish at her feet i implore her compassion  melted with my love yet still rigid and reserved i behold the bewitching conflict in her soul  i triumph in the discovery yet conceal my delight still implore still complain then seize some happy instant when her whole soul is touched and boast a victory indeed   mus what then  what then my lord you are not displeased at her haughtiness   ibra displeased  smiling   mus so so so i have been driving on when i thought i had been pulling back spurring a mettled courser and neglecting the check

fierceness of newly tasted love   mus why as to that  to be sure as to that she is as cold as the alps and all their snowballs  she perfectly makes ones teeth chatter at her  but then    ibra what impatiently then what   mus why if truth must be spoke there is after all something oddish about her   ibra oddish   mus why now my lord look at me  pray look at me  ay my lord bassa examine me well   ibra to what purpose   mus why the ladies of your harem say that this same beautiful russian is exceedingly like me   ibra ridiculous   mus particularly about the nose ibra shows impatience nay there are handsome likenesses my lord  i dont say but that she may be rather handsomer   ibra thou art mad   mus not that ever i saw the likeness myself  except something in the shape indeed  but there i have the advantage for her right shoulder and her right ear have too right an understanding they are always together then her hair to be sure it may suit some people but according to my fancy the color is execrable   ibra wretch were thou a christian i should believe thee intoxicated with wine  but i will this instant seek the charmer and judge how far  going off   enter selim on the opposite
