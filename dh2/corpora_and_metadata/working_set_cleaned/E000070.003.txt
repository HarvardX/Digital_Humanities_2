i chap   chapter i of the nature rise and establishment of miscellanys——the subject of these which follow——intention of the writer peace be with the soul of that charitable and courteous author who for the common benefit of his fellowauthors introducd the ingenious way of miscellaneous shaftesbury        writing—it must be ownd that since this happy method was establishd the harvest of wit has been more plentiful and the labourers more in number than heretofore tis well known to the able practitioners in the writing art that as easy as it is to conceive   wit tis the hardest thing imaginable to be deliverd of it upon certain terms nothing coud be more severe or rigid than the conditions formerly prescribd to writers when criticism took place and regularity and order were thought essential in a treatise the notion of a genuine work a legitimate and just piece has certainly been the occasion of great timidity and backwardness among the adventurers in wit and the imposition of such strict laws and rules of composition has set heavy on the free spirits and forward geniuss of mankind twas a yoke it seems which our forefathers bore but which for our parts we have generously thrown off in effect the invidious distinctions of bastardy and legitimacy being at length removd the natural and lawful issue of the brain comes with like advantage into the world and wit mere wit is well receivd without examination of the kind or censure of the form this the miscellaneous manner of writing it must be ownd has hap shaftesbury       pily effected it has renderd almost every soil productive it has disclosd those various seeds of wit which lay suppressd in many a bosom and has reard numberless conceits and curious fancys which the natural rudeness and asperity of their native soil woud have withheld or at least not have permitted to rise above the ground from every field from every hedge or hillock we now gather as delicious fruits and fragrant flowers as of old from the richest and bestcultivated gardens miserable were those antient planters who understanding not how to conform themselves to the rude taste of unpolishd mankind made it so difficult a task to serve the world with intellectual entertainments and furnish out the repasts of literature and science there was certainly a time when the name of author stood for something considerable in the world to succeed happily in such a labour as that of writing a treatise or a poem was taken as a sure mark of understanding and good sense the task was painful but it seems twas honourable how the case happend in process of time to be so much reversd is hard to say the   primitive authors perhaps being few in number and highly respected for their art fell under the weight of envy being sensible of shaftesbury        their misfortune in this respect and being excited as tis probable by the example of some popular genius they quitted their regular schemes and accurate forms of workmanship in favour of those wits who could not possibly be receivd as authors upon such difficult terms twas necessary it seems that the bottom of wit shoud be enlargd twas advisable that more hands shoud be taken into the work and nothing coud better serve this popular purpose than the way of miscellany or common essay in which the most confusd head if fraught with a little invention and provided with commonplacebook learning might exert itself to as much advantage as the most orderly and wellsettled judgment to explain the better how this revolution in letters has been effected it may not perhaps be indecent shoud we offer to compare our writingartists to the manufacturers in stuff or silk for among these tis esteemd a principal piece of skill to frame a pattern or plan of workmanship in which the several colours are agreeably disposd with such proportionable adjustment of the various figures and devices as may in the whole create a kind of harmony to the eye according to this method each piece must be in reality an original for shaftesbury        to copy what has gone before can be of no use the fraud woud easily be perceivd on the other side to work originally and in a manner create each time anew must be a matter of pressing weight and fitted to the strength and capacity of none besides the choicest workmen a manner therefore is invented to confound this simplicity and conformity of design patchwork is substituted cuttings and shreds of learning with various fragments and points of wit are drawn together and tackd in any fantastick form if they chance to cast a luster and spread a sort of sprightly glare the miscellany is approvd and the complex form and texture of the work admird the eye which before was to be won by regularity and   had kept true to measure and strict proportion is by this means pleasingly drawn aside to commit a kind of debauch and amuse itself in gaudy colours and disfigurd shapes of things custom in the mean while has not only tolerated this licentiousness but renderd it even commendable and brought it into the highest repute the wild and whimsical under the name of the odd and pretty succeed in the room of the graceful and the beautiful justness and accuracy of thought are set aside as too constraining and of too painful an shaftesbury        aspect to be endurd in the agreeable and more easy commerce of gallantry and modern wit now since it has been thought convenient in these latter ages to distinguish the provinces of wit and wisdom and set apart the agreeable from the useful tis evident there coud be nothing devisd more sutable to the distinct and separate interest of the former of these provinces than this complex manner of performance which we call miscellany for whatever is capricious and odd is sure to create diversion to those who look no further and where there is nothing like nature there is no room for the troublesom part of thought or contemplation tis the perfection of certain grotesquepainters to keep as far from nature as possible to find a likeness in their works is to find the greatest fault imaginable a natural connexion is a slur a coherence a design a meaning is against their purpose and destroys the very spirit and genius of their workmanship i remember formerly when i was a spectator in the french theater i found it the custom at the end of every grave and solemn tragedy to introduce a comick farce or miscellany which they calld the little piece we have indeed shaftesbury        a method still more extraordinary upon our own stage for we think it agreeable and just to mix the little piece or farce with the main plot or fable thro every act this perhaps may be the rather chosen because our tragedy is so much deeper and bloodier than that of the french and therefore needs more immediate refreshment from the elegant way of drollery and burlesquewit which being thus closely interwoven   with its opposite makes that most accomplishd kind of theatrical miscellany calld by our poets a tragicomedy i coud go further perhaps and demonstrate from the writings of many of our grave divines the speeches of our senators and other principal models of our national erudition that the miscellaneous manner is at present in the highest esteem but since my chief intention in the following sheets is to descant cursorily upon some late pieces of a british author i will presume that what i have said already on this head is sufficient and that it will not be judgd improper or absurd in me as i proceed to take advantage of this miscellaneous taste which now evidently prevails according to this method whilst i serve as critick or interpreter to this new writer i may the better correct his flegm and give him shaftesbury        more of the fashionable air and manner of the world especially in what relates to the subject and manner of his two last pieces which are containd in his second volume for these being of the more regular and formal kind may easily be oppressive to the airy reader and may therefore with the same assurance as tragedy claim the necessary relief of the little piece or farce abovementiond nor ought the title of a miscellaneous writer to be denyd me on the account that i have grounded my miscellanys upon a certain set of treatises already publishd grounds and foundations are of no moment in a kind of work which according to modern establishment has properly neither top nor bottom beginning nor end besides that i shall noway confine myself to the precise contents of these treatises but like my fellowmiscellanarians shall take occasion to vary often from my proposd subject and make what deviations or excursions i shall think fit as i proceed in my random essays shaftesbury         chap   chapter ii of controversial writings answers replies—polemick divinity or the writing churchmilitant—philosophers and beargarden—authors paird and matchd—the matchmakers—football—a dialogue between our author and his bookseller among the many improvements daily made in the art of writing there is none perhaps which can be said to have attaind a greater height than that of controversy or the method of answer and refutation tis true indeed that antiently the wits of men were for the most part taken up in other employment if authors writ ill they were despisd if well they were by some party or other espousd for partys there woud necessarily be and sects of every kind in learning and philosophy every one sided with whom he likd and having the liberty of hearing each side speak for itself stood in no need of express warningpieces against pretended sophistry or dangerous reasoning par shaftesbury      0 ticular answers to single treatises were thought to be of little use and it was esteemd no compliment to a reader to help him so carefully in the judgment of every piece which came abroad whatever sects there were in those days the zeal of partycauses ran not so high as to give the reader a taste of those personal reproaches which might pass in a debate between the different partymen thus matters stood of old when as yet the method of writing controversy was not raisd into an art nor the feuds of contending authors become the chief amusement of the learned world but we have at present so high a relish of this kind that the writings of the learned are never truly gustful till they are come to what we may properly enough call their due ripeness and have begot a fray when the answer and reply is once formd our curiosity is excited we begin then for the first time to whet our attention and apply our ear for example let a zealous divine and flaming champion of   our faith when inclind to shew himself in print make choice of some tremendous mystery of religion opposd heretofore by some damnable heresiarch whom having vehemently refuted he turns himself towards shaftesbury         the orthodox opinion and supports the true belief with the highest eloquence and profoundest erudition he shall notwithstanding this remain perhaps in deep obscurity to the great affliction of his bookseller and the regret of all who bear a just veneration for churchhistory and the antient purity of the christian faith but let it so happen that in this prosecution of his deceasd adversary our doctor raises up some living antagonist who on the same foot of orthodoxy with himself pretends to arraign his expositions and refute the refuter upon every article he has advancd from this moment the writing gathers life the publick listens the bookseller takes heart and when issue is well joind the repartees grown smart and the contention vigorous between the learned partys a ring is made and readers gather in abundance every one takes party and encourages his own side this shall be my champion—this man for my money—well hit on our side—again a good stroke—there he was even with him—have at him the next bout—excellent sport and when the combatants are for awhile drawn off and each retird with his own companions what praises and congratulations what applauses of the supposd victor and how honourably is he saluted shaftesbury         by his favourers and complimented even to the disturbance of his modesty nay but gentlemen—good gentlemen do you really think thus—are you sincere with me—have i treated my adversary as he deserves never was man so mauld why you have killd him downright o sirs you flatter me he can never rise more think ye so indeed or if he shoud twoud be a pleasure to see how you woud handle him these are the triumphs this what sets sharp this gives the author his edge and excites the readers attention when the trumpets are thus sounded to the croud and a kind of amphitheatrical entertainment exhibited to the multitude by these gladiatorian penmen  0 the author of the preceding treatises being by profession a nice inspector into the ridicule of things must in all probability have raisd to himself some such views as these which hinderd him from engaging in the way of controversy for when by accident the first of these treatises a private letter and in the writers esteem little worthy of the shaftesbury         publicks notice came to be read abroad in copys and afterwards in print the smartest answers which came out against it coud not it seems move our author to form any reply all he was heard to say in return was that he thought whoever had taken upon him to publish a book in answer to that casual piece had certainly made either a very high compliment to the author or a very ill one to the publick it must be ownd that when a writer of any kind is so considerable as to deserve the labour and pains of some shreud heads to refute him in publick he may in the quality of an author be justly congratulated on that occasion tis supposd necessarily that he must have writ with some kind of ability or wit but if his original performance be in truth no better than ordinary his answerers task must certainly be very mean he must be very indifferently imployd who woud take upon him to answer nonsense in form ridicule what is of itself a jest and put it upon the world to read a second book for the sake of the impertinencys of a former taking it however for granted that a sorry treatise may be the foundation of a considerable answer a shaftesbury         reply still must certainly be ridiculous whichever way we take it for either the author in his original piece has been truly refuted or not if refuted why does he defend if not refuted why trouble himself what has the publick to do with his private quarrels or his adversarys impertinence or supposing the world out of curiosity may delight to see a pedant exposd by a man of better wit and a controversy thus unequally carryd on between two such opposite partys how long is this diversion likely to hold good and what will become of these polemick writings a few years hence what is already become    of those mighty controversys with which some of the most eminent authors amusd the world within the memory of the youngest scholar an original work or two may perhaps remain but for the subsequent defenses the answers rejoinders and replications they have been long since paying their attendance to the pastrycooks mankind perhaps were heated at that time when first those matters were debated but they are now cool again they laughd they carryd on the humour they blew the coals they teazd and set on maliciously and to create themselves diversion but the jest is now over noone so much as inquires where the wit was or where possibly the sting shoud lie of those shaftesbury         notable reflections and satirical hints which were once found so pungent and gave the readers such high delight—notable philosophers and divines who can be contented to make sport and write in learned billingsgate to divert the coffeehouse and entertain the assemblys at booksellers shops or the more airy stalls of inferior bookretailers it must be allowd that in this respect controversial writing is not so wholly unprofitable and that for bookmerchants of whatever kind or degree they undoubtedly receive no small advantage from a right improvement of a learned scuffle nothing revives em more or makes a quicker trade than a pair of substantial divines or grave philosophers well matchd and soundly backd till by long worrying one another they are grown out of breath and have almost lost their force of biting—so have i known a crafty glazier in time of frost procure a football to draw into the street the emulous chiefs of the robust youth the tumid bladder bounds at every kick bursts the withstanding casements the chassys lanterns and all the brittle vitrious ware the noise of blows and outcries fills the whole neighbourhood and ruins of glass cover the stony pavements till the bloated battering engine subdud shaftesbury         by force of foot and fist and yielding up its breath at many a fatal cranny becomes lank and harmless sinks in its flight and can no longer uphold the spirit of the contending partys    this our author supposes to have been the occasion of his being so often and zealously complimented by his amanuensis for so he calls his bookseller or printer on the fame of his first piece the obliging craftsman has at times presented him with many a handsom book set off with titles of remarks reflections and the like which as he assurd him were answers to his small treatise here sir says he you have a considerable hand has undertaken you——this sir is a reverend—this a right reverend——this a noted author——will you not reply sir——o my word sir the world is in expectation pity they shoud be disappointed a dozen sheets sir woud be sufficient—you might dispatch it presently think you so i have my paper ready—and a good letter—take my word for it—you shall see sir enough but hark ye mr a a a a my worthy engineer and manager of the war of shaftesbury         letters ere you prepare your artillery or engage me in acts of hostility let me hear i intreat you whether or no my adversary be taken notice of—wait for his second edition and if by next year or year or two after it be known in good company that there is such a book in being i shall then perhaps think it time to consider of a reply chap   chapter iii of the letter concerning enthusiasm—foreign criticks—of letters in general and of the epistolary style—addresses to great men—authors and horsemanship—the modern amble—further explanation of the miscellaneous manner as resolute as our author may have shewn himself in refusing to take notice of the smart writings publishd against him by certain zealots of his own country he coud not it seems    but out of curiosity observe what the foreign and shaftesbury         more impartial criticks might object to his small treatise which he was surprizd to hear had been translated into foreign languages soon after it had been publishd here at home the first censure of this kind which came to our authors sight was that of the paris journal des savans considering how little favourable the author of the letter had shewn himself towards the romish church and policy of france it must be ownd those journalists have treated him with sufficient candor tho they faild not to take what advantages they well coud against the writing and particularly arraignd it for the want †of order and method the protestant writers such as live in a free country and can deliver their sentiments without constraint have certainly ‡done our author more honour than he ever presumd to think he coud deserve his translator indeed who had done him the previous honour of introdu shaftesbury        cing him to the acquaintance of the foreign world represents particularly by the turn given to the latter end of the letter that the writer of it was as to his condition and rank little better than an inferior dependent on the noble lord to whom he had addressd himself and in reality the original has so much of that air that i wonder not if what the author left ambiguous the translator has determind to the side of clientship and dependency but whatever may have been the circumstance or character of our author himself that of his great friend ought in justice to have been considerd by those former criticks abovementiond so much at least shoud have been taken notice of that there was a real great man characterizd and sutable measures of address and style preservd but they who woud neither observe this nor    apprehend the letter itself to be real were insufficient criticks and unqualifyd to judg of the turn or humour of a piece which they had never considerd in a proper light tis become indeed so common a practice among authors to feign a correspondency and give the title of a private letter to a piece addressd solely to the shaftesbury      0  publick that it woud not be strange to see other journalists and criticks as well as the gentlemen of paris pass over such particularitys as things of form this prejudice however coud not misguide a chief critick of the protestant side when mentioning this letter concerning enthusiasm he speaks of it as a real letter such as in truth it was not a precise and formal †treatise designd for publick view it will be ownd surely by those who have learnt to judg of elegancy and wit by the help merely of modern languages that we coud have little relish of the best letters of a balsac or voiture were we wholly ignorant of the characters of the principal persons to whom those letters were actually written but much less coud we find pleasure in this reading shoud we take it into our heads that both the personages and correspondency itself were merely fictitious let the best of tullys epistles be read in such a narrow view as this and they will cer shaftesbury        tainly prove very insipid if a real brutus a real atticus be not supposd there will be no real cicero the elegant writer will disappear as will the vast labour and art with which this eloquent roman writ those letters to his illustrious friends there was no kind of composition in which this great author prided or pleasd himself more than in this where he endeavourd to throw off the mein of the philosopher    and orator whilst in effect he employd both his rhetorick and philosophy with the greatest force they who can read an epistle or satir of horace in somewhat better than a mere scholastick relish will comprehend that the concealment of order and method in this manner of writing makes the chief beauty of the work they will own that unless a reader be in some measure apprizd of the characters of an augustus a maecenas a florus or a trebatius there will be little relish in those satirs or epistles addressd in particular to the courtiers ministers and great men of the times even the satirick or miscellaneous manner of the polite antients requird as much order as the most regular pieces but the art was to destroy every such token or appearance give an extemporary air to what was writ and make the effect of art be felt without discover shaftesbury        ing the artifice there needs no further explanation on this head our author himself has said enough in his advice to an author particularly where he treats of the simple style in contradistinction to the learned the formal or methodick tis a different case indeed when the title of epistle is improperly given to such works as were never writ in any other view than that of being made publick or to serve as exercises or specimens of the wit of their composer such were those infinite numbers of greek and latin epistles writ by the antient sophists grammarians or rhetoricians where we find the real character of the epistle the genuine style and manners of the corresponding partys sometimes imitated but at other times not so much as aimd at nor any measures of historical truth preservd such perhaps we may esteem even the letters of a †seneca to his friend lucilius    or supposing that shaftesbury         philosophical courtier had really such a correspondency and at several times had sent so many fair epistles honestly signd and seald to his countryfriend at shaftesbury         a distance it    appears however by the epistles themselves in their proper order if they may be said to have any that after a few attempts at the beginning the author by degrees loses sight of his correspondent and takes the world in general for his reader or disciple he falls into the random way of miscellaneous writing says everywhere great and noble things in and out of the way accidentally as words led him for with these he plays perpetually with infinite wit but with little or no coherence without a shape or body to his work without shaftesbury         a real beginning a middle or an end of a hundred and twenty four epistles you may if you please make five hundred or half a score a greatone for instance you may divide into five or six a littleone you may tack to another and that to another and so on the unity of the writing will be the same the life and spirit full as well preservd tis not only whole letters or pages you may change and manage thus at pleasure every period every sentence almost is independent and may be taken asunder transposd postpond anticipated or set in any new order as you fansy this is the manner of writing so much admird and imitated in our age that we have scarce the idea of any other model we know little indeed of the difference between one model or character of writing and another all runs to the same tune and beats exactly one and the same measure nothing one woud think coud be more tedious than this uniform pace the common amble or canterbury is not i am persuaded more tiresom to a good rider than this seesaw of essaywriters is to an able reader the shaftesbury         just composer of a legitimate piece is like an able traveller who    exactly measures his journey considers his ground premeditates his stages and intervals of relaxation and intention to the very conclusion of his undertaking that he happily arrives where he first proposd when he set out he is not presently upon the spur or in his full career but walks his steed leisurely out of his stable settles himself in his stirrups and when fair road and season offer puts on perhaps to a round trot thence into a gallop and after a while takes up as down or meadow or shady lane present themselves he accordingly sutes his pace favours his palfry and is sure not to bring him puffing and in a heat into his last inn but the postway is become highly fashionable with modern authors the very same stroke sets you out and brings you in nothing stays or interrupts hill or valley rough or smooth thick or thin no difference no variation when an author sits down to write he knows no other business he has than to be witty and take care that his periods be well turnd or as they commonly say run smooth in this manner he doubts not to gain the character of bright when he has writ as many pages as he likes or as his run of fancy woud permit he then perhaps considers what name shaftesbury         he had best give to his new writing whether he shoud call it letter essay miscellany or aught else the bookseller perhaps is to determine this at last when all besides the preface epistle dedicatory and titlepage is dispatchd   —incertus scamnum faceretne priapum   ——deus inde ego hesitating whether he should make a bench or a priapus    so i am a god horat sat   lib i ver   shaftesbury           miscellany ii

endeavour to solve the appearances of this kind by the natural operation of our passions and the common course of outward things for my own part i cannot but at this present apprehend a kind of enchantment or magick in that which we call enthusiasm since i find that having touchd slightly on this subject i cannot so easily part with it at pleasure after having made some cursory reflections on our authors letter i thought i might have sufficiently acquitted myself on this head till passing to his next treatise i found myself still further ingagd i perceivd plainly that i had as yet scarce enterd into our authors humour or felt any thing of that passion which as he informs us is so easily communicable and naturally engaging but what i had passd over in my first reflections i found naturally rising in me upon second thoughts so that by experience i provd it true what our author says† that we all of us know something  0 of this principle and now that i find i have in reality so much of it imparted to me i may with better reason shaftesbury      0  be pardond if after our authors example i am led to write on such subjects as these with caution at different reprises and not singly in one breath i have heard indeed that the very reading of treatises and accounts of melancholy has been apt to generate that passion in the overdiligent and attentive reader and this perhaps may have been the reason why our author himself as he seems to intimate towards the conclusion of his first letter card not in reality to grapple closely with his subject or give us at once the precise definition of enthusiasm this however we may with our author presume to infer from the coolest of all studys even from criticism itself of which we have been lately treating †that there is a power in numbers harmony proportion and beauty of every kind which naturally captivates the heart and raises the imagination to an opinion or conceit of something majestick and divine whatever this subject may be in itself we cannot help being transported with the thought of it it inspires us with something more than ordinary and shaftesbury         raises us above ourselves without this imagination or conceit the world woud be but a dull circumstance and life a sorry passtime scarce coud we be said to live the animal functions might in their course be carryd on but nothing further sought for or regarded the gallant sentiments the elegant fancys the bellepassions which have all of them this beauty in view woud be set aside and leave us probably no other employment than that of satisfying our coarsest appetites at the cheapest rate in order to the attainment of a supine state of indolence and inactivity slender woud be the enjoyments of the lover the ambitious man the warrior or the virtuoso as our author has ‡elsewhere    intimated if in the beautys which they admire and passionately pursue there were no reference or regard to any higher majesty or grandure than what simply results from the particular objects of their pursuit i know not in reality what we shoud do to find a seasoning to most of our pleasures in life were it not for the taste or relish which is owing to this particular passion and the conceit or imagination which supports it without this we coud not so much as shaftesbury         admire a poem or a picture a garden or a palace a charming shape or a fair face love itself woud appear the lowest thing in nature when thus anticipated and treated according to the antienthusiastick poets method and to indulge lust with whoever is at hand how heroism or magnanimity must stand in this hypothesis is easy to imagine the muses themselves must make a very indifferent figure in this philosophical draught even the prince of †poets woud prove a most insipid writer if he were thus reducd nor coud there according to this scheme be yet a place of honour left even for our ‡latin poet the great disciple of this unpolite philosophy who dares with so little equity employ the muses art in favour of such a system but in spite of his philosophy he everywhere gives way to admiration and rapturous views of nature he is transported with the several beautys of the world even whilst he arraigns the order of it and destroys the principle of shaftesbury         beauty from whence in antient languages the world itself was namd    this is what our author advances when in behalf of enthusiasm he quotes its formal enemys and shews that they are as capable of it as its greatest confessors and assertors so far is he from degrading enthusiasm or disclaiming it in himself that he looks on this passion simply considerd as the most natural and its object as the justest in the world even virtue itself he takes to be no other than a noble enthusiasm justly directed and regulated by that high standard which he supposes in the nature of things he seems to assert that there are certain moral species or appearances so striking and of such force over our natures that when they present themselves they bear down all contrary opinion or conceit all opposite passion sensation or mere bodily affection of this kind he makes virtue itself to be the chief since of all views or contemplations this in his account is the most na shaftesbury        turally and strongly affecting the exalted part of love is only borrowd hence that of pure friendship is its immediate self he who yields his life a sacrifice to his prince or country the lover who for his paramour performs as much the heroick the amorous the religious martyrs who draw their views whether visionary or real from this pattern and exemplar of divinity all these according to our authors sentiment are alike actuated by this passion and prove themselves in effect so many different enthusiasts nor is thorow honesty in his hypothesis any other than this zeal or passion moving strongly upon the species or view of the decorum and sublime of actions others may pursue †different forms and fix their eye on different species as all men do on one or other the real honest man however plain or simple he appears has that highest species ‡honesty itself in view and    instead of outward forms or symmetrys is struck with that of inward character the harmony and numbers of the heart and beauty of the affections which form the manners and conduct of a truly social life shaftesbury        tis indeed peculiar to the genius of that cool philosophy above describd that as it denies the order or harmony of things in general so by a just consequence and truth of reasoning it rejects the habit of admiring or being charmd with whatever is calld beautiful in particular according to the regimen prescribd by this philosophy it must be acknowledgd that the evils of love ambition vanity luxury with other disturbances derivd from the florid high and elegant ideas of things must in appearance be set in a fair way of being radically curd it need not be thought surprizing that religion itself shoud in the account of these philosophers be reckond among those vices and disturbances which it concerns us after this manner to extirpate if the idea of majesty and beauty in other inferior subjects be in reality distracting it must chiefly prove so in that principal subject the basis and foundation of this conceit now if the subject itself be not in nature neither the idea nor the passion grounded on it can be properly esteemd natural and thus all admiration ceases and enthusiasm is at an end but shaftesbury         if there be naturally such a passion tis evident that religion itself is of the kind and must be therefore natural to man we can admire nothing profoundly without a certain religious veneration and because this borders so much on fear and raises a certain tremor or horror of like appearance tis easy to give that turn to the affection and represent all enthusiasm and religious extasy as the product or mere effect of fear the first fear fashioned the gods on earth  but the original passion as appears plainly is of another kind and in effect is so confessd by those who are the greatest opposers    of religion and who as our author observes have shewn themselves sufficiently convincd that altho these ideas of divinity and beauty were vain they were yet in a manner innate or such as men were really born to and coud hardly by any means avoid now as all affections have their excess and require judgment and discretion to moderate and govern them so this high and noble affection which raises shaftesbury         man to action and is his guide in business as well as pleasure requires a steddy rein and strict hand over it all moralists worthy of any name have recognizd the passion tho among these the wisest have prescribd restraint pressd moderation and to all tyros in philosophy forbid the forward use of admiration rapture or extasy even in the subjects they esteemd the highest and most divine they knew very well that the first motion appetite and ardour of the youth in general towards †philosophy and knowledg depended chiefly on this turn of temper yet were they well apprizd withal that in the progress of this study as well as in the affairs of life the florid ideas and exalted fancy of this kind became the fuel of many incendiary passions and that in religious concerns particularly the habit of admiration and contemplative delight woud by overindulgence too easily mount into high fanaticism or degenerate into abject superstition upon the whole therefore according to our author enthusiasm is in itself a very natural honest passion and has shaftesbury         properly nothing for its object but what is ‡good and honest tis apt indeed he confesses to run astray and by modern example we know perhaps yet better than by any antient that in religion the enthusiasm which works by love is subject to many strange irregularitys and that which works by fear to many monstrous    and horrible superstitions mysticks and fanaticks are known to abound as well in our reformd as in the romish churches the pretended floods of grace pourd into the bosoms of the quietists pietists and those who favour the extatick way of devotion raise such transports as by their own proselytes are confessd to have something strangely agreeable and in common with what ordinary lovers are usd to feel and it has been remarkd by many that the female saints have been the greatest improvers of this soft part of religion what truth there may be in the related operations of this pretended grace and amorous zeal or in the accounts of what has usually past between the saints of each sex in these devout extasys i shall leave the reader to examine supposing he will find credible accounts sufficient to convince him of the dangerous progress of enthusiasm in this amorous lineage shaftesbury        there are many branches indeed more vulgar as that of fear melancholy consternation suspicion despair and when the passion turns more towards the astonishing and frightful than the amiable and delightful side it creates rather what we call superstition than enthusiasm i must confess withal that what we commonly style zeal in matters of religion is seldom without a mixture of both these extravagancys the extatick motions of love and admiration are seldom unaccompanyd with the horrors and consternations of a lower sort of devotion these paroxysms of zeal are in reality as the hot and cold fits of an ague and depend on the different and occasional views or aspects of the divinity according as the worshiper is guided from without or affected from within by his particular constitution seldom are those aspects so determinate and fixd as to excite constantly one and the same spirit of devotion in religions therefore which hold most of love there is generally room left for terrors of the deepest kind nor is there any religion so diabolical as in its representation of divinity to leave no room for admiration and esteem whatever personage or shaftesbury      0  specter of divinity is worshipd a    certain esteem and love is generally affected by his worshipers or if in the devotion paid him there be in truth no real or absolute esteem there is however a certain astonishing delight or ravishment excited this passion is experiencd in common by every worshiper of the zealotkind the motion when unguided and left wholly to itself is in its nature turbulent and incentive it disjoints the natural frame and relaxes the ordinary tone or tenor of the mind in this disposition the reins are let loose to all passion which arises and the mind as far as it is able to act or think in such a state approves the riot and justifies the wild effects by the supposd sacredness of the cause every dream and frenzy is made inspiration every affection zeal and in this persuasion the zealots no longer selfgovernd but set adrift to the wide sea of passion can in one and the same spirit of devotion exert the opposite passions of love and hatred unite affectionately and abhor furiously curse bless sing mourn exult tremble caress assassinate inflict and suffer martyrdom with shaftesbury         a thousand other the most vehement efforts of variable and contrary affection the common heathen religion especially in its latter age when adornd with the most beautiful temples and renderd more illustrious by the munificence of the roman senate and succeeding    emperors ran wholly into pomp and was supported chiefly by that sort of enthusiasm which is raisd from the external objects of grandure majesty and what we call august on the other side the egyptian or syrian religions which lay more in mystery and conceald rites having less dependence on the magistrate and less of that decorum of art shaftesbury         politeness and magnificence ran into a more pusillanimous frivolous and mean kind of superstition the observation of days the forbearance of meats and the contention about traditions seniority of laws and †priority of godships hence a raging madness is abroad on both sides because each place hates its neighbours deities since it believes that only its own objects of worship are gods  history withal informs us of a certain establishment in egypt which was very extraordinary and must needs have had a very uncommon effect no way advantageous to that nation in particular or to the general society of mankind we know very well that nothing is more injurious to the police or municipal constitution of any city or colony than the forcing of a particular trade nothing more dangerous than the overpeopling any manufacture or multiplying the traders or dealers of whatever vocation beyond their natural proportion and the publick demand now it happend of old in this motherland of superstition shaftesbury         that ‡the sons of    certain artists were by law obligd always to follow the same calling with their fathers thus the son of a priest was always a priest by birth as was the whole lineage after him without interruption nor was it a custom with this nation as with others to have only one single priest or priestess to a temple but as the number of gods and temples was infinite so was that of the shaftesbury         priests the religious foundations were without restriction and to one single worship or temple as many of the holy order might be retainers as coud raise a maintenance from the office    whatever happend to other races or professions that of the priest in all likelihood must by this regulation have propagated the most of any tis a tempting circumstance to have so easy a mastery over the world to subdue by wit instead of force to practise on the passions and triumph over the judgment of mankind to influence private familys and publick councils conquer conquerors controul the magistrate himself and govern without the envy which attends all other government or superiority no wonder if such a profession was apt to multiply especially when we consider the easy living and security of the professors their exemption from all labour and hazard the supposd sacredness of their character and their free possession of wealth grandure estates and women there was no need to invest such a body as this with rich lands and ample territorys as it happend in egypt the generation or tribe being once set apart as sacred woud without further encouragement be able no doubt in shaftesbury         process of time to establish themselves a plentiful and growing fund or religious landbank twas a sufficient donative to have had only that single privilege from the law that they might retain what they coud get and that it might be lawful for their order to receive such estates by voluntary contribution as coud never afterwards be converted to other uses now if besides the method of propagation by descent other methods of increase were allowd in this order of men if volunteers were also admitted at pleasure without any stint or confinement to a certain number tis not difficult to imagine how enormous the growth woud be of such a science or profession thus recognizd by the magistrate thus invested with lands and power and thus intitled to whatever extent of riches or possession coud be acquird by practice and influence over the superstitious part of mankind there were besides in egypt some natural causes of superstition  0 beyond those which were common to other regions this nation might well abound in prodigys when even their country and soil itself was a kind of prodigy in nature their solitary idle life whilst shut shaftesbury         up in their houses by the regular inundations of the nile the unwholesom vapours arising from the new mud and slimy relicts of their river exposd to the hot suns their various meteors and phaenomena with the long vacancy they had to observe and comment on them the necessity withal which on the account of their navigation and the measure of their yearly drowned lands compelld them to promote the studys of astronomy and other sciences of which their priesthood coud make good advantages all these may be reckond perhaps as additional causes of the immense growth of superstition and the enormous increase of the priesthood in this fertile land twill however as i conceive be found unquestionably true according to political arithmetick in every nation whatsoever that the quantity of superstition if i may so speak will in proportion nearly answer the number of priests diviners soothsayers prophets or such who gain their livelihood or receive advantages by officiating in religious affairs for if these dealers are numerous they will force a trade and as the liberal hand of the magistrate can easily raise swarms of this kind where they are already but in a moderate proportion so where thro shaftesbury         any other cause the number of these increasing still by degrees is sufferd to grow beyond a certain measure they will soon raise such a ferment in mens minds as will at least compel the magistrate however sensible of the grievance to be cautious in proceeding to a reform we may observe in other necessary professions raisd on the infirmitys and defects of mankind as for instance in law and physick that with the least help from the bounty or beneficence of the magistrate the number of the professors and the subjectmatter of the profession is found over and above increasing new difficultys are started new subjects of contention deeds and instruments of law grow more numerous and prolix hypotheses    methods regimens more various and the materia medica more extensive and abundant what in process of time must therefore naturally have happend in the case of religion among the egyptians may easily be gatherd nor is it strange that we shoud find the property and power of the egyptian shaftesbury         priesthood in antient days arrivd to such a height as in a manner to have swallowd up the state and monarchy a worse accident befel the persian crown of which the hierarchy having got absolute possession had once a fair chance for universal empire now that the persian or babylonian hierarchy was much after the model of the egyptian tho different perhaps in rites and ceremonys we may well judg not only from the history of the †magi but from what is recorded of antient colonys sent long before by the egyptians into ‡chaldea and the adjacent countrys and whether the ethiopian model was from that of egypt or the egyptian from that of ethiopia for each nation had its pretence we know by remarkable †effects that the ethiopian empire    was once in the same shaftesbury         condition the state having been wholly swallowd in the exorbitant power of their landed hierarchy so true it is that dominion must naturally follow property nor is it possible as i conceive for any state or monarchy to withstand the encroachments of a growing hierarchy founded on the model of these egyptian and asiatick priesthoods no superstition will ever be wanting among the ignorant and vulgar whilst the able and crafty have a power to gain inheritances and possessions by working on this human weakness this is a fund which by these allowances will prove inexhaustible new modes of worship new miracles new heroes saints divinitys which serve as new occasions for sacred donatives will be easily supplyd on the part of the reli shaftesbury      0 gious orders whilst the civil magistrate authorizes the accumulative donation and neither restrains the number or possessions of the sacred body we find withal that in the early days of this antient priestly nation of whom we have been speaking twas thought expedient also for the increase of devotion to enlarge their system of deity and either by mystical genealogy consecration or canonization    to multiply their reveald objects of worship and raise new personages of divinity in their religion they proceeded it seems in process of time to increase the number of their gods so far that at last they became in a manner numberless what odd shapes species and forms of deity were in latter times exhibited is well known scarce an animal or plant but was adopted into some share of divinity †o pious nation for whom gods like these grow in the garden no wonder if by a nation so abounding in religious orders spiritual conquests shaftesbury         were sought in foreign countrys ‡colonys led abroad and missionarys detachd on expeditions in this prosperous service twas thus a zealotpeople influencd of old by their very region and climate and who thro a long tract of time under a peculiar policy had been raisd both by art and nature to an immense growth in religious science and mystery came by degrees to spread their variety of rites and ceremonys their distinguishing marks of separate worships and secrete communitys thro the distant world but chiefly thro their neighbouring and dependent countrys    we understand from history that even when the egyptian state was least powerful in arms it was still respected for its religion and mysterys it drew strangers from all parts to behold its wonders and the fertility of its soil forcd the adjacent people and wandring nations who livd dispersd in single tribes to visit them court their alliance and sollicit a trade and commerce with them on whatsoever terms the strangers no doubt might well receive religious rites shaftesbury         and doctrines from those to whom they owd their maintenance and bread before the time that israel was constraind to go down to egypt and sue for maintenance to these powerful dynastys or lowland states the holy patriarch abraham himself had been necessitated to this compliance on the same account he applyd in the same manner to the egyptian court he was at first well receivd and handsomly presented but afterwards ill usd and out of favour with the prince yet sufferd to depart the kingdom and retire with his effects without any attempt of recalling him again by force as it happend in the case of his posterity tis certain that if this holy patriarch who first instituted the sacred rite of circumcision within his own family or tribe had no regard to any policy or religion of the egyptians yet he had formerly been a guest and inhabitant in egypt where †historians mention this to have    been a national shaftesbury         rite long ere he had receivd any divine notice or revelation concerning this affair nor was it in religion merely that this reverend guest was said to have derivd knowledg and learning from the egyptians twas from this parentcountry of occult sciences that he was presumd together with other wisdom to have learnt that of †judicial astrology as his successors did afterwards other prophetical and miraculous arts proper to the magi or priesthood of this land one cannot indeed but observe in after times the strange adherence and servile dependency of the whole hebrew race on the egyptian nation it appears that tho they were of old abusd in the person of their grand patriarch tho afterwards held in bondage and treated as the most abject slaves tho twice expeld or necessitated to save themselves by flight out of this oppressive region yet in the very instant of their last retreat shaftesbury         whilst they were yet on their march conducted by visible divinity supplyd and fed from heaven and supported by continual miracles they notwithstanding inclind so strongly to the manners the religion rites diet customs laws and constitutions of their tyrannical masters that it was with the utmost difficulty they could be withheld from ‡returning again into the same subjection nor could    their great captains and legislators prevent their re shaftesbury        lapsing perpetually into the same worship to which they had been so long accustomd how far the divine providence might have indulgd the stubborn habit and stupid humour of this people by giving them laws as the †prophet says which shaftesbury         he himself approvd not i have no intention    to examine this only i pretend to infer from what has been advancd that the manners opinions rites and customs of the egyptians had in the earliest times and from generation to generation    strongly influencd the hebrew people their guests and subjects and had undoubtedly gaind a powerful ascendency over their natures how extravagant soever the multitude of the egyptian superstitions may appear tis certain that their doctrine and wisdom were in high repute since it is taken notice of in holy scripture as no small advantage even to mo shaftesbury        ses himself that he had imbibd the wisdom of this nation which as is well known lay chiefly among their priests and magi before the time that the great hebrew legislator receivd his education among these sages a †hebrew slave who came a youth into the egyptian court had already grown so powerful in this kind of wisdom as to outdo the chief diviners prognosticators and interpreters of egypt he raisd himself to be chief minister to a prince who following his advice obtaind in a manner the whole property and consequently the absolute dominion of that land but to what height of power the establishd priesthood was arrivd even at that time may be conjecturd hence that the crown to speak in a modern style offerd not to meddle with    the churchlands and that in this great revolution nothing was shaftesbury         attempted so much as by way of purchase or exchange in prejudice of this landed clergy the prime minister himself having joind his interest with theirs and enterd †by marriage into their alliance and in this he was followd by the great founder of the hebrewstate for he also ‡matchd himself with the priesthood of some of the neighbouring nations and traders into egypt long ere his establishment of the hebrew religion and commonwealth nor had he perfected his model till he consulted the foreign priest his ††fatherinlaw to whose advice he paid such remarkable deference but to resume the subject of our speculation concerning the wide diffusion of the priestly science or function it appears from what has been said that notwithstanding the egyptian priesthood was by antient establishment hereditary the skill of divining soothsaying and magick was communicated to others besides their national sacred body and that the wisdom of the magicians the power shaftesbury         of miracles their interpretation of dreams and visions and their art of administring in divine affairs were entrusted even to foreigners who resided amongst them it appears withal from these considerations how apt the religious profession was to spread itself widely in this region of the world and what efforts woud naturally be made by the more necessitous of these unlimited professors towards a fortune or maintenance for themselves and their successors common arithmetick will in this case demonstrate to us that as the proportion of so many laymen to each priest grew every day less and less so the wants and necessitys of each priest must grow more and more the magistrate too who according to this egyptian regulation had resignd his title or share of right  0 in sacred things coud no longer govern as he pleasd in these affairs or check the growing number of these professors the spiritual generations were left to prey on others and like fish of prey even on themselves when destitute of other capture and confind within too narrow limits what method therefore was there left to heighten the zeal of worshipers and augment their liberality but to foment their emula shaftesbury      0 tion prefer worship to worship faith to faith and turn the spirit of enthusiasm to the side of sacred horror religious antipathy and mutual discord between worshipers thus provinces and nations were divided by the most contrary rites and customs which coud be devisd in order to create the strongest aversion possible between creatures of a like species for when all other animositys are allayd and anger of the fiercest kind appeasd the religious hatred we find continues still as it began without provocation or voluntary offence the presumd misbeliever and blasphemer as one rejected and abhord of god is thro a pious imitation abhord by the adverse worshiper whose enmity must naturally increase as his religious zeal increases from hence the opposition rose of temple against temple proselyte against proselyte the most zealous worship of one god was best expressd as they conceivd by the open defiance of another sirnames and titles of divinity passd as watchwords he who had not the symbol nor coud give the word receivd the knock shaftesbury        down with him kill him merit heaven thereby as our poet has it in his american tragedy nor did †philosophy when introducd into religion extinguish but rather inflame this zeal as we may shew perhaps in our following chapter more particularly if we return again as is likely to this subject for this we perceive is of a kind apt enough to grow upon our hands we shall here therefore observe only what is    obvious to every student in sacred antiquitys that from the contentious learning and sophistry of the antient schools when true science philosophy and arts were already deep in their decline religious problems of a like contentious form sprang up and certain doctrinal tests were framd by which religious partys were ingagd and lifted against one another with more animosity than in any other cause or quarrel had been ever known thus religious massacres began and were carryd on temples were demolishd holy uten shaftesbury        sils destroyd the sacred pomp trodden underfoot insulted and the insulters in their turn exposd to the same treatment in their persons as well as in their worship thus madness and confusion were brought upon the world like that chaos which the poet miraculously describes in the mouth of his mad hero when even in celestial places disorder and blindness reignd—no dawn of light   — †no glimpse or starry spark   but gods met gods and jostled in the

enthusiasm i have thus dispatchd what others have remarkd on the same subject i may as an apologist to another author be allowd to cite especially if i take notice only of what has been    dropt very naturally by some of our most approvd authors and ablest divines it has been thought an odd kind of temerity in our author to assert that even atheism itself was not whol shaftesbury        ly exempt from enthusiasm that there have been in reality enthusiastical atheists and that even the spirit of martyrdom coud upon occasion exert itself as well in this cause as in any other now besides what has been intimated in the preceding chapter and what in fact may be demonstrated from the examples of vaninus and other martyrs of a like principle we may hear an †excellent and learned divine of highest authority at home and fame abroad who after having describd an enthusiastical atheist and one atheistically inspird says of this very sort of men that they are fanaticks too however that word seem to have a more peculiar respect to something of a deity all atheists being that blind goddessnatures fanaticks and again all atheists says he are possessd with a certain kind of madness that may be calld ‡pneumatophobia that makes    them have an irra shaftesbury        tional but desperate abhorrence from spirits or incorporal substances they being acted also at the same time with an hylomania whereby they madly dote upon matter and devoutly worship it as the only numen what the power of extasy is whether thro melancholy wine love or other natural causes another learned divine of our church in a discourse upon enthusiasm sets forth bringing an example from aristotle of a syracusean poet who never versifyd so well as when he was in his distracted fits but as to poets in general compard with the shaftesbury         religious enthusiasts he says there is this difference that a poet is an enthusiast in jest and an enthusiast is a poet in good earnest tis a strong temptation †says the doctor with a melancholist when he feels a storm of devotion and zeal come upon him like a mighty wind his heart being full of affection his head pregnant with clear and sensible representations and his mouth flowing and streaming with fit and powerful expressions such as would astonish an ordinary ‡auditory tis i say a shreud temptation to him to think it the very spirit of god that then moves supernaturally in him whenas all that excess of zeal and affection and fluency of words is most palpably to be resolvd into the power of melancholy which is a kind of natural inebriation the learned doctor with much pains afterwards and by help of the peripatetick shaftesbury         philosophy explains this enthusiastick inebriation and shews in particular how the vapours and fumes of melancholy partake of the nature of wine one might conjecture from hence that the malicious opposers    of early christianity were not unversd in this philosophy when they sophistically objected against the apparent force of the divine spirit speaking in divers languages and attributed it to the power of new wine but our devout and zealous doctor seems to go yet further for besides what he says of the †enthusiastick power of fancy in atheists he calls melancholy ‡a pertinacious and religious complexion and asserts that there is not any true spiritual grace from god but this mere natural constitution according to the several tempers and workings of it will not only resemble but sometimes seem to outstrip and after speaking of prophetical enthusiasm and establishing as our author ††does a legitimate and a bastardsort he asserts and justifies the ‡‡devotional enthusiasm as he calls shaftesbury         it of holy and sincere souls and ascribes this also to melancholy he allows that the soul may sink so far into phantasms as not to recover the use of her free facultys and that this enormous strength of imagination does not only beget the belief of mad internal apprehensions but is able to assure us of the presence of external objects which are not he adds that what custom and education do by degrees distemperd fancy may do in a shorter time and speaking aof extasy and the power of melancholy in extatick fancys he says that what the imagination then puts forth of herself is as clear as broad day and the perception of the soul at least as strong and vigorous as at any time in beholding things awake from whence the doctor infers that the strength of perception is no sure ground of truth    had any other than a reverend father of our church expressd himself in this manner he must have been contented perhaps to bear a sufficient charge of scepticism shaftesbury        twas good fortune in my lord bacons case that he shoud have escapd being calld an atheist or a sceptick when speaking in a solemn manner of the religious passion the ground of superstition or enthusiasm which he also terms a panick he derives it from an imperfection in the creation make or natural constitution of man how far the author of the †letter differs from this author in his opinion both of the end and foundation of this passion may appear from what has been said above and in general from what we read in the other succeeding treatises shaftesbury      0  of our author we may venture to say of him with assurance that he is as little a sceptick according to the vulgar sense of that word as he is epicurean or atheist this may be provd sufficiently from his philosophy and for any thing higher tis what he    nowhere presumes to treat having forborn in particular to mention any holy mysterys of our religion or sacred article of our belief as for what relates to revelation in general if i mistake not our authors meaning he professes to believe as far as is possible for any one who himself had never experiencd any divine communication whether by dream vision apparition or other supernatural operation nor was ever present as eyewitness of any sign prodigy or miracle whatsoever many of these †he observes are at this day pretendedly exhibited in the world with an endeavour of giving them the perfect air and exact resemblance of those recorded in holy writ he speaks indeed with contempt of the mockery of modern miracles and inspiration and as to all pretences to things of this kind in our shaftesbury         present age he seems inclind to look upon em as no better than mere imposture or delusion but for what is recorded of ages heretofore he seems to resign his judgment with intire condescension to his superiors he pretends not to frame any certain or positive opinion of his own notwithstanding his best searches into antiquity and the nature of religious record and tradition but on all occasions submits most willingly and with full confidence and trust to the ‡opinions by law establishd and if this be not sufficient to free him from the reproach of scepticism he must for ought i see be content to undergo it to say truth i have often wonderd to find such a disturbance raisd about the simple name of sceptick tis certain that in its original and plain signification the word imports no more than barely that state or frame of mind in which every one remains on every subject of which he is not certain he who is certain or presumes to say he knows is in that particular whether he be mistaken    or in the right a dogmatist between these two states or situations of shaftesbury         mind there can be no medium for he who says that he believes for certain or is assurd of what he believes either speaks ridiculously or says in effect that he believes strongly but is not sure so that whoever is not conscious of revelation nor has certain knowledg of any miracle or sign can be no more than sceptick in the case and the best christian in the world who being destitute of the means of certainty depends only on history and tradition for his belief in these particulars is at best but a sceptickchristian he has no more than a nicely critical historical faith subject to various speculations and a thousand different criticisms of languages and literature this he will naturally find to be the case if he attempts to search into originals in order to be his own judg and proceed on the bottom of his own discernment and understanding if on the other hand he is no critick nor competently learned in these originals tis plain he can have no original judgment of his own but must rely still on the opinion of those who have opportunity to examine such matters and whom he takes to be the unbiasd and disinterested judges shaftesbury         of these religious narratives his faith is not in antient facts or persons nor in the antient writ or primitive recorders nor in the successive collators or conservators of these records for of these he is unable to take cognizance but his confidence and trust must be in those modern men or societys of men to whom the publick or he himself ascribes the right to judg of these records and commits the determination of sacred writ and genuine story let the person seem ever so positive or dogmatical in these high points of learning he is yet in reality no dogmatist nor can any way free himself from a certain kind of scepticism he must know himself still capable of doubting or if for fear of it he strives to banish every opposite thought and resolves not so much as to deliberate on the case this still will not acquit him so far    are we from being able to be sure when we have a mind that indeed we can never be thorowly sure but then only when we cant help it and find of necessity we must be so whether we will or not even the highest implicit faith is in reality no more than a kind of passive scepticism a resolution to examine recollect consider or hear as little as possible to the prejudice of that belief shaftesbury         which having once espousd we are ever afterwards afraid to lose if i might be allowd to imitate our author in daring to touch now and then upon the characters of our divine worthys i shoud upon this subject of belief observe how fair and generous the great christian convert and learned apostle has shewn himself in his sacred writings notwithstanding he had himself an original testimony and revelation from heaven on which he grounded his conversion notwithstanding he had in his own person the experience of outward miracles and inward communications he condescended still on many occasions to speak sceptically and with some hesitation and reserve as to the certainty of these divine exhibitions in his account of some transactions of this kind himself being the witness and speaking as we may presume of his own person and proper vision he says only that he knew a man whether in the body or out of it he cannot tell but such a one caught up to the third heaven he knew formerly he says above fourteen years before his then writing and when in another capacity the same inspird writer giving precepts to his disciples distinguishes shaftesbury         what †he writes by divine commission from what he delivers as his own judgment and private opinion he condescends nevertheless to speak as one no way positive or master of any absolute criterion in the case and in several subsequent ‡passages he expresses himself as under some kind of doubt how to judg or determine certainly whether he writes by inspiration or otherwise he only thinks he has the spirit he is not sure nor woud have us to depend on him as positive or certain in a matter of so nice discernment    the holy founders and inspird authors of our religion requird not it seems so strict an assent or such implicit faith in behalf of their original writings and revelations as later uninspird doctors without the help of divine testimony or any miracle on their side have requird in behalf of their own comments and interpretations the earliest and worst of hereticks tis said were those calld gnosticks who took their name from an audacious pretence to certain knowledg and comprehension of the greatest mysterys of faith if the most dangerous state of opinion was this dogmatical and presump shaftesbury        tuous sort the safest in all likelihood must be the sceptical and modest there is nothing more evident than that our holy religion in its original constitution was set so far apart from all philosophy or refind speculation that it seemd in a manner diametrically opposd to it a man might have been not only a sceptick in all the controverted points of the academys or schools of learning but even a perfect stranger to all of this kind and yet compleat in his religion faith and worship among the polite heathens of the antient world these different provinces of religion and philosophy were upheld we know without the least interfering with each other if in some barbarous nations the philosopher and priest were joind in one tis observable that the mysterys whatever they were which sprang from this extraordinary conjunction were kept secret and undivulgd twas satisfaction enough to the priestphilosopher if the initiated party preservd his respect and veneration for the tradition and worship of the temple by complying in every respect with the requisite performances and rites of worship no account was afterwards taken of the philosophick faith of the proselyte or worshiper his opi shaftesbury        nions were left to himself and he might philosophize according to what foreign school or sect he fansyd even amongst the jews themselves the sadducee a materialist and denyer of the souls immortality was as well admitted as the pharisee who from the schools of pythagoras plato or other latter philosophers of greece had learnt to reason upon immaterial substances and the natural immortality of souls  0 tis no astonishing reflection to observe how fast the world declind in wit and sense in manhood reason science and in every art when once the roman empire had prevaild and spread an universal tyranny and oppression over mankind even the romans themselves after the early sweets of one peaceful and long reign began to groan under that yoke of which they had been themselves the imposers how much more must other nations and mighty citys at a far distance have abhord this tyranny and detested their common servitude under a people who were themselves no better than mere slaves it may be lookd upon no doubt as providential that at this time and in shaftesbury         these circumstances of the world there shoud arise so high an expectation of a divine deliverer and that from the eastern parts and confines of judea the opinion shoud spread itself of such a deliverer to come with strength from heaven sufficient to break that empire which no earthly power remaining coud be thought sufficient to encounter nothing coud have better disposd the generality of mankind to receive the evangelical advice whilst they mistook the news as many of the first christians plainly did and understood the promises of a messias in this temporal sense with respect to his second coming and sudden reign here upon earth †superstition in the mean while coud not but naturally prevail as misery and ignorance increasd the roman emperors as they grew more barbarous grew so much the more superstitious the lands and revenues as well as the numbers of the heathen priests grew daily and when the season came that by means of a convertemperor the heathen ‡churchlands with an increase    of shaftesbury         power became transferd to the christian clergy twas no wonder if by such riches and authority they were in no small measure influencd and corrupted as may be gatherd even from the accounts given us of these matters by themselves when together with this the schools of the antient philosophers which had been long in their decline came now to be dissolvd and their sophistick teachers shaftesbury      0  became ecclesiastical instructors the unnatural union of religion and philosophy was compleated and the monstrous product of this match appeard soon in the world the odd exterior shapes of deitys temples and holy utensils which by the †egyptian sects had been formerly set in battel against each other were now metamorphosd into philosophical forms and phantoms and like flags and banners displayd in hostile manner and borne offensively by one party against another in former times those barbarous nations above mentiond were the sole warriors in these religious causes but now the whole world became engagd when instead of storks and crocodiles other ensigns were erected when sophistical chimeras crabbed notions bombastick phrases solecisms absurditys and a thousand monsters of a scholastick brood were set on foot and made the subject of vulgar animosity and dispute here first began that spirit of bigotry which broke out in a    more raging manner than had been ever known before and was less capable of temper or moderation than any species form or mixture of religion in the antient world shaftesbury         mysterys which were heretofore treated with profound respect and lay unexposd to vulgar eyes became publick and prostitute being enforcd with terrors and urgd with compulsion and violence on the unfitted capacitys and apprehensions of mankind the very jewish traditions and cabalistick learning underwent this fate that which was naturally the subject of profound speculation and inquiry was made the necessary subject of a strict and absolute assent the allegorical mythological account of sacred things was wholly inverted liberty of judgment and exposition taken away no ground left for inquiry search or meditation no refuge from the dogmatical spirit let loose every quarter was taken up every portion prepossessd all was reducd to article and proposition thus a sort of philosophical enthusiasm overspread the world and bigotry a †species of superstition hardly known before took place in mens affections and armd em with a new jealousy against each other barbarous shaftesbury         terms and idioms were every day introducd monstrous definitions invented and imposd new schemes of faith erected from time to time and hostilitys the fiercest imaginable exercisd on these occasions so that the enthusiasm or zeal which was usually shewn by mankind in behalf of their particular worships and which for the most part had been hitherto defensive only grew now to be universally of the offensive kind it may be expected of me perhaps that being fallen thus from remote antiquity to later periods i shoud speak on this occasion with more than ordinary exactness and regularity it may    be urgd against me that i talk here as at random and withoutbook neglecting to produce my authoritys or continue my quotations according to the professd style and manner in which i began this present chapter but as there are many greater privileges by way of variation interruption and digression allowd to us writers of miscellany and especially to such as are commentators upon other authors i shall be content to remain mysterious in this respect and explain myself no further than by a noted story which seems to sute our authors purpose and the present argument shaftesbury        tis observable from holy writ that the antient ephesian worshipers however zealous or enthusiastick they appeard had only a defensive kind of zeal in behalf of their temple whenever they thought in earnest it was brought in danger in the †tumult which happend in that city near the time of the holy apostles retreat we have a remarkable instance of what our author calls a religious panick as little bigots as the people were and as far from any offensive zeal yet when their establishd church came to be calld in question we see in what a manner their zeal began to operate ‡all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out saying shaftesbury         great is diana of the ephesians at the same time this assembly    was so confusd that the greater part knew not wherefore they were come together and consequently coud not understand why their church was in any danger but the enthusiasm was got up and a panick fear for the church had struck the multitude it ran into a popular rage or epidemical phrenzy and was communicated as our †author expresses it by aspect or as it were by contact or sympathy it must be confessd that there was besides these motives a secret spring which forwarded this enthusiasm for certain partys concernd men of craft and strictly united in interest had been secretly calld together and told gentlemen ‡or sirs ye know that by this mystery or craft we have our wealth ye see withal and have heard that not only here at ephesus but almost throout all asia this paul has persuaded and turnd away many people by telling them they are no real gods who are figurd or wrought with hands so that shaftesbury         not only this our craft is in danger but also the temple itself nothing coud be more moderate and wise nothing more agreeable to that magisterial science or policy which our author recommends than the behaviour of the townclerk or recorder of the city as he is represented on this occasion in holy writ i must confess indeed he went pretty far in the use of this moderating art he venturd to assure the people that every one acquiescd in their antient worship of the great goddess and in their tradition of the image which fell down from jupiter that these were facts undeniable and that the new sect neither meant the pulling down of their church nor so much as offerd to blaspheme or speak amiss of their goddess this no doubt was stretching the point sufficiently as may be understood by the event in after time one might perhaps have    suspected this recorder to have been himself a dissenter or at least an occasional conformist who coud answer so roundly for the new sect and warrant the church in being secure of damage and out of all danger for the future mean shaftesbury         while the tumult was appeasd no harm befel the temple for that time the new sect acquiescd in what had been spoken on their behalf they allowd the apology of the recorder accordingly the zeal of the heathen church which was only defensive gave way and the new religionists were prosecuted no further hitherto it seems the face of persecution had not openly shewn itself in the wide world twas sufficient security for every man that he gave no disturbance to what was publickly establishd but when offensive zeal came to be discoverd in one party the rest became in a manner necessitated to be aggressors in their turn they who observd or had once experiencd this intolerating spirit coud no longer tolerate on their part and they who    had shaftesbury         once exerted it over others coud expect no better quarter for themselves so that nothing less than mutual extirpation became the aim and almost open profession of each religious society shaftesbury           in this extremity it might well perhaps have been esteemd the happiest wish for mankind that one of these contending partys of incompatible religionists shaftesbury         shoud at last prevail over the rest so as by an universal and absolute power to determine orthodoxy and make that opinion effectually catholick which in their particular judgment had the best right to that denomination and thus by force of massacre and desolation peace in wor shaftesbury      0 ship and civil unity by help of the spiritual might be presumd in a fair way of being restord to mankind i shall conclude with observing how ably the romanchristian and once catholick church by the assistance of their converted    emperors proceeded in the establishment of their growing hierarchy they considerd wisely the various superstitions and enthusiasms of mankind and provd the different kinds and force of each all these seeming contrarietys of human passion they knew how to comprehend in their political model and subservient system of divinity they knew how to make advantage both from the high speculations of philosophy and the grossest ideas of vulgar ignorance they saw there was nothing more different than that enthusiasm which ran upon spirituals according to the †simpler views of the divine existence and that which ran upon ‡external proportions magnificence of structures ceremonys processions quires and those other harmonys which captivate the eye and ear on this account they even added to this latter kind and displayd religion in a yet more gorgeous habit of temples statues paint shaftesbury        ings vestments copes miters purple and the cathedral pomp with these arms they coud subdue the victorious goths and secure themselves an attila when their caesars faild them the truth is tis but a vulgar species of enthusiasm which is movd chiefly by shew and ceremony and wrought upon by chalices and candles robes and figurd dances yet this we may believe was lookt upon as no slight ingredient of devotion in those days since at this hour the manner is found to be of considerable efficacy with some of the devout amongst ourselves who pass the least for superstitious and are reckond in the number of the polite    world this the wise hierarchy duly preponderating but being satisfyd withal that there were other tempers and hearts which coud not so easily be captivated by this exterior allurement they assignd another part of religion to proselytes of another character shaftesbury         and complexion who were allowd to proceed on a quite different bottom by the inward way of contemplation and divine love they are indeed so far from being jealous of mere enthusiasm or the extatick manner of devotion that they allow their mysticks to write and preach in the most rapturous and seraphick strains they suffer them in a manner to supersede all external worship and triumph over outward forms till the refind religionists proceed so far as either expresly or seemingly to dissuade the practice of the vulgar and establishd ceremonial dutys and then indeed they check the supposd exorbitant enthusiasm which woud prove dangerous to their hierarchal state if modern visions prophecys and dreams charms miracles exorcisms and the rest of this kind be comprehended in that which we call fanaticism or superstition to this spirit they allow a full career whilst to ingenuous writers they afford the liberty on the other side in a civil manner to call in shaftesbury         question these spiritual feats performd in monasterys or up and down by their mendicant or itinerant priests and ghostly missionarys this is that antient hierarchy which in respect of its first foundation its policy and the consistency of its whole frame and constitution cannot but appear in some respect august and venerable even in such as we do not usually esteem weak eyes these are the spiritual conquerors who like the first caesars from small beginnings establishd the foundations of an almost universal monarchy no wonder if at this day the immediate view of this hierarchal residence the city and court of rome be found to have an extraordinary effect on foreigners of other latter churches no wonder if the amazd surveyors are for the future  0 so apt either to conceive the horridest aversion to all priestly government or on the contrary to admire it so far as even to wish a coalescence or reunion with this antient motherchurch in reality the exercise of power however arbitrary or despotick seems less intolerable under such a spiritual sovereignty so extensive antient and of such a long succession than under the petty tyrannys and mimical politys of some new preten shaftesbury        ders the former may even persecute with a tolerable grace the latter who woud willingly derive their authority from the former and graft on their successive right must necessarily make a very aukard figure and whilst they strive to give themselves the same air of independency on the civil magistrate whilst they affect the same authority in government the same grandure magnificence and pomp in worship they raise the highest ridicule in the eyes of those who have real discernment and can distinguish originals from copys †o imitators a slavish herd shaftesbury        chap   chapter iii of the force of humour in religion—support of our authors argument in his essay on the freedom of wit and raillery—zeal discussd spiritual surgeons executioners carvers—original of human sacrifice—exhilaration of religion—various aspects from outward causes the celebrated wits of the miscellanarian race the essaywriters casual discoursers reflectioncoiners meditationfounders and others of the irregular kind of writers may plead it as their peculiar advantage that they follow the variety of    nature and in such a climate as ours their plea no doubt may be very just we islanders famd for other mutabilitys are particularly noted for the variableness and inconstancy of our weather and if our taste in letters be found answerable to this temperature of our climate tis cer shaftesbury        tain a writer must in our account be the more valuable in his kind as he can agreeably surprize his reader by sudden changes and transports from one extreme to another were it not for the known prevalency of this relish and the apparent deference paid to those geniuss who are said to elevate and surprize the author of these miscellanys might in all probability be afraid to entertain his reader with this multifarious complex and desultory kind of reading tis certain that if we consider the beginning and process of our present work we shall find sufficient variation in it from a professd levity we are lapsd into a sort of gravity unsutable to our manner of setting out we have steerd an adventurous course and seem newly come out of a stormy and rough sea tis time indeed we shoud enjoy a calm and instead of expanding our sails before the swelling gusts it befits us to retire under the leeshore and ply our oars in a smooth water tis the philosopher the orator or the poet whom we may compare to some firstrate vessel which launches out into the wide sea and with a proud motion insults the encountering surges we shaftesbury         essaywriters are of the smallcraft or galleykind we move chiefly by starts and bounds according as our motion is by frequent intervals renewd we have no great adventure in view nor can tell certainly whither we are bound we undertake no mighty voyage by help of stars or compass but row from creek to creek keep up a coasting trade and are fitted only for fair weather and the summer season happy therefore it is for us in particular that having finishd our course of enthusiasm and pursud our author into his second    treatise we are now at last obligd to turn towards pleasanter reflections and have such subjects in view as must naturally reduce us to a more familiar style wit and humour the professd subject of the treatise now before us will hardly bear to be examind in ponderous sentences and poisd discourse we might now perhaps do best to lay aside the gravity of strict argument and resume the way of chat which thro aversion to a contrary formal manner is generally relishd with more than ordinary satisfaction for excess of physick we know has often made men hate the name of wholesom and an abundancy of forcd shaftesbury         instruction and solemn counsel may have made men full as averse to any thing deliverd with an air of high wisdom and science especially if it be so high as to be set above all human art of reasoning and even above reason itself in the account of its sublime dispensers however since it may be objected to us by certain formalists of this sort that we can prove nothing duly without proving it in form we may for once condescend to their demand state our case formally and divide our subject into parts after the precise manner and according to just rule and method our purpose therefore being to defend an author who has been chargd as too presumptuous for introducing the way of wit and humour into religious searches we shall endeavour to make appear  st that wit and humour are corroborative of religion and promotive of true faith  ly that they are usd as proper means of this kind by the holy founders of religion  ly that notwithstanding the dark complexion and sour humour of some re shaftesbury        ligious teachers we may be justly said to have in the main a witty and goodhumourd religion among the earliest acquaintance of my youth i remember in particular a club of three or four merry gentlemen who had long kept company with one another and were seldom separate in any party of pleasure or diversion they happend once to be upon a travelling adventure and came to a country where they were told    for certain they should find the worst entertainment as well as the worst roads imaginable one of the gentlemen who seemd the least concernd for this disaster said slightly and without any seeming design that the best expedient for them in this extremity woud be to keep themselves in high humour and endeavour to commend every thing which the place afforded the other gentlemen immediately took the hint but as it happend kept silence passd the subject over and took no further notice of what had been proposd being enterd into the dismal country in which they proceeded without the least complaint twas remarkable that if by great chance they came to any tolerable bit of road or any ordinary pros shaftesbury      00 pect they faild not to say something or other in its praise and woud light often on such pleasant fancys and representations as made the objects in reality agreeable when the greatest part of the day was thus spent and our gentlemen arrivd where they intended to take their quarters the first of em who made trial of the fare or tasted either glass or dish recommended it with such an air of assurance and in such lively expressions of approbation that the others came instantly over to his opinion and confirmd his relish with many additional encomiums of their own many ingenious reasons were given for the several odd tastes and looks of things which were presented to em at table some meats were wholesom others of a high taste others according to the manner of eating in this or that foreign country every dish had the flavour of some celebrated receit in cookery and the wine and other liquors had in their turn the advantage of being treated in the same elegant strain in short our gentlemen eat and drank heartily and took up with their indifferent fare so well that twas apparent they had wrought upon themselves to believe they were tolerably well servd shaftesbury      0  their servants in the mean time having laid no such plot as this against themselves kept to their senses and stood it out that their masters had certainly lost theirs for how else coud they    swallow so contentedly and take all for good which was set before em— had i to deal with a malicious reader he might perhaps pretend to infer from this story of my travelling friends that i intended to represent it as an easy matter for people to persuade themselves into what opinion or belief they pleasd but it can never surely be thought that men of true judgment and understanding shoud set about such a task as that of perverting their own judgment and giving a wrong bias to their reason they must easily foresee that an attempt of this kind shoud it have the least success woud prove of far worse consequence to them than any perversion of their taste appetite or ordinary senses i must confess it however to be my imagination that where fit circumstances concur and many inviting occasions offer from the side of mens interest their humour or their passion tis no extraordinary case to see em enter into such a plot as this against their own understand shaftesbury      0  ings and endeavour by all possible means to persuade both themselves and others of what they think convenient and useful to believe if in many particular cases where favour and affection prevail it be found so easy a thing with us to impose upon ourselves it cannot surely be very hard to do it where we take for granted our highest interest is concernd now it is certainly no small interest or concern with men to believe what is by authority establishd since in the case of disbelief there can be no choice left but either to live a hypocrite or be esteemd profane even where men are left to themselves and allowd the freedom of their choice they are still forward enough in believing and can officiously endeavour to persuade themselves of the truth of any flattering imposture nor is it unusual to find men successful in this endeavour as among other instances may appear by the many religious faiths or opinions however preposterous or contradictory which age after age we know to have been raisd on the foundation of miracles and pretended commissions from heaven these have been as generally espousd and passionately cherishd as the greatest truths    and most cer shaftesbury      0  tain revelations tis hardly to be supposd that such combinations shoud be formd and forgerys erected with such success and prevalency over the understandings of men did not they themselves cooperate of their own accord towards the imposture and shew that by a goodwill and hearty desire of believing they had in reality a considerable hand in the deceit tis certain that in a country where faith has for a long time gone by inheritance and opinions are entaild by law there is little room left for the vulgar to alter their persuasion or deliberate on the choice of their religious belief whensoever a government thinks fit to concern itself with mens opinions and by its absolute authority impose any particular belief there is none perhaps ever so ridiculous or monstrous in which it needs doubt of having good success this we may see thorowly effected in certain countrys by a steddy policy and sound application of punishment and reward with the assistance of particular courts erected to this end peculiar methods of justice peculiar magistrates and officers proper inquests and certain wholesom severitys not slightly administerd and playd with as certain triflers propose but duly and properly inforcd as is absolutely requisite to this end shaftesbury      0   of strict conformity and unity in one and the same profession and manner of worship but shoud it happen to be the truth itself which was thus effectually propagated by the means we have describd the very nature of such means can however allow but little honour to the propagators and little merit to the disciples and believers tis certain that mahometism paganism judaism or any other belief may stand as well as the truest upon this foundation he who is now an orthodox christian woud by virtue of such a discipline have been infallibly as true a mussulman or as errant a heretick had his birth happend in another place for this reason there can be no rational belief but where comparison is allowd examination permitted and a sincere toleration establishd and in this case i will presume to say that whatever belief is once espousd or countenancd by the magistrate    it will have a sufficient advantage without any help from force or menaces on one hand or extraordinary favour and partial treatment on the other if the belief be in any measure consonant to truth and reason it will find as much favour in the eyes of mankind as truth and reason need desire shaftesbury      0   whatever difficultys there may be in any particular speculations or mysterys belonging to it the better sort of men will endeavour to pass em over they will believe as our author says to the full stretch of their reason and add spurs to their faith in order to be the more sociable and conform the better with what their interest in conjunction with their goodhumour inclines them to receive as credible and observe as their religious duty and devotional task here it is that good humour will naturally take place and the hospitable disposition of our travelling friends aboverecited will easily transfer itself into religion and operate in the same manner with respect to the establishd faith however miraculous or incomprehensible under a tolerating mild and gentle government every one knows indeed that by heresy is understood a stubbornness in the will not a defect merely in the understanding on this account tis impossible that an honest and goodhumourd man shoud be a schismatick or heretick and affect to separate from his national worship on slight reason or without severe provocation shaftesbury      0  to be pursud by petty inquisitors to be threatned with punishment or penal laws to be markd out as dangerous and suspected to be raild at in high places with all the studyd wit and art of calumny are indeed sufficient provocations to ill humour and may force people to divide who at first had never any such intention but the virtue of goodhumour in religion is such that it can even reconcile persons to a belief in which they were never bred or to which they had conceivd a former prejudice from these considerations we cannot but of course conclude    that there is nothing so ridiculous in respect of policy or so wrong and odious in respect of common humanity as a moderate and halfway persecution it only frets the sore it raises the illhumour of mankind excites the keener spirits moves indignation in beholders and sows the very seeds of schism in mens bosoms a resolute and boldfacd persecution leaves no time or scope for these engendring distempers or gathering illhumours it does the work at once by extirpation banishment or massacre and like a bold stroke in surgery dispatches by one short amputation what a bungling hand woud make worse and worse to shaftesbury      0   the perpetual sufferance and misery of the patient if there be on earth a proper way to render the most sacred truth suspected tis by supporting it with threats and pretending to terrify people into the belief of it this is a sort of daring mankind in a cause where they know themselves superior and out of reach the weakest mortal finds within himself that tho he may be outwitted and deluded he can never be forcd in what relates to his opinion or assent and there are few men so ignorant of human nature and of what they hold in common with their kind as not to comprehend that where great vehemence is expressd by anyone in what relates solely to another tis seldom without some private interest of his own in common matters of dispute the angry disputant makes the best cause to appear the worst a clown once took a fancy to hear the latin disputes of doctors at a university he was askd what pleasure he could take in viewing such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the partys had the better for that matter replyd the clown i ant such a fool neither but i can see whos the first that puts tother shaftesbury      0   into a passion nature herself dictated this lesson to the clown that he who had the better of the argument woud be easy and wellhumourd but he who was unable to support his cause by reason woud naturally lose his temper and grow violent were two travellers agreed to tell their story separate in publick the one being a man of sincerity but positive and dogmatical the    other less sincere but easy and goodhumourd tho it happend that the accounts of this latter gentleman were of the more miraculous sort they woud yet sooner gain belief and be more favourably receivd by mankind than the strongly asserted relations and vehement narratives of the other fierce defender of the truth that good humour is a chief cause of compliance or acquiescence in matters of faith may be provd from the very spirit of those whom we commonly call criticks tis a known prevention against the gentlemen of this character that they are generally illhumourd and splenetick the world will needs have it that their spleen disturbs em and i must confess i think the world in general to be so far right in this conceit that tho all criticks perhaps shaftesbury      0   are not necessarily splenetick all splenetick people whether naturally such or made so by ill usage have a necessary propensity to criticism and satir when men are easy in themselves they let others remain so and can readily comply with what seems plausible and is thought conducing to the quiet or good correspondence of mankind they study to raise no difficultys or doubts and in religious affairs tis seldom that they are known forward to entertain ill thoughts or surmises whilst they are unmolested but if disturbd by groundless arraignments and suspicions by unnecessary invectives and bitter declamations and by a contentious quarrelsom aspect of religion they naturally turn criticks and begin to question every thing the spirit of satir rises with the ill mood and the chief passion of men thus diseasd and thrown out of good humour is to find fault censure unravel confound and leave nothing without exception and controversy these are the scepticks or scrupulists against whom there is such a clamor raisd tis evident in the mean while that the very clamor itself joind with the usual menaces and shew of force is that which chiefly raises this sceptical spirit and helps to multiply the number of these inquisitive and illhumourd cri shaftesbury       0 ticks mere threats without power of execution are only exasperating and provocative they who are masters of the carnal as well as    spiritual weapon may apply each at their pleasure and in what proportion they think necessary but where the magistrate resolves steddily to reserve his fasces for his own proper province and keep the edgtools and deadly instruments out of other hands tis in vain for spiritual pretenders to take such magisterial airs it can then only become them to brandish such arms when they have strength enough to make the magistrate resign his office and become provost or executioner in their service— shoud any one who happens to read these lines perceive in himself a rising animosity against the author for asserting thus zealously the notion of a religious liberty and mutual toleration tis wishd that he woud maturely deliberate on the cause of his disturbance and illhumour woud he deign to look narrowly into himself he woud undoubtedly find that it is not zeal for religion or the truth which moves him on this occasion for had he happend to be in a nation where he was no conformist nor had any hope or expectation of obtaining the prece shaftesbury         dency for his own manner of worship he woud have found nothing preposterous in this our doctrine of indulgence tis a fact indisputable that whatever sect or religion is undermost tho it may have persecuted at any time before yet as soon as it begins to suffer persecution in its turn it recurs instantly to the principles of moderation and maintains this our plea for complacency sociableness and good humour in religion the mystery therefore of this animosity or rising indignation of my devout and zealous reader is only this that being devoted to the interest of a party already in possession or expectation of the temporal advantages annexd to a particular belief he fails not as a zealous partyman to look with jealousy on every unconformable opinion and is sure to justify those means which he thinks proper to prevent its growth he knows that if in matters of religion any one believes amiss tis at his own peril if opinion damns vice certainly does as much yet will our gentleman easily find if he inquires the least into himself that he has no such furious concern for the security of mens morals nor any such violent resentment of their vices when they are such as noway incommode him and from hence it will be easy for him to infer  0 that the passion shaftesbury          he feels on this occasion is not from pure zeal but private interest and worldly emulation come we now as authentick rhetoricians express themselves to our second head which we shoud again subdivide into firsts and seconds but that this manner of carving is of late days grown much out of fashion twas the custom of our ancestors perhaps as long since as the days of our hospitable king arthur to have nothing servd at table but what was intire and substantial twas a whole boar or solid ox which made the feast the figure of the animal was preservd intire and the dissection made in form by the appointed carver a man of might as well as profound craft and notable dexterity who was seen erect with goodly mein and action displaying heads and members dividing according to art and distributing his subjectmatter into proper parts sutable to the stomachs of those he servd in latter days tis become the fashion to eat with less ceremony and method everyone chuses to carve for himself the learned manner of dissection is out of request and a certain method of cookery has been introducd by shaftesbury          which the anatomical science of the table is intirely set aside ragouts and fricassees are the reigning dishes in which every thing is so dismemberd and thrown out of all order and form that no part of the mass can properly be divided or distinguishd from another fashion is indeed a powerful mistress and by her single authority has so far degraded the carving method and use of solids even in discourse and writing that our religious pastors themselves have many of em changd their manner of distributing to us their spiritual food they have quitted their substantial service and uniform division into parts and underparts and in order to become fashionable they have run into the more savoury way of learned ragout and medley tis the unbred rustick orator alone who presents his clownish audience with a divisible discourse the elegant courtdivine exhorts in miscellany and is ashamd to bring his twos and threes before a fashionable assembly    shoud i therefore as a mere miscellanarian or essaywriter forgetting what i had premisd be found to drop a head and lose the connecting thred of my present discourse the case perhaps woud not be so preposterous for fear however shaftesbury          lest i shoud be chargd for being worse than my word i shall endeavour to satisfy my reader by pursuing my method proposd if peradventure he can call to mind what that method was or if he cannot the matter is not so very important but he may safely pursue his reading without further trouble to proceed therefore whatever means or methods may be employd at any time in maintaining or propagating a religious belief already current and establishd tis evident that the first beginnings must have been founded in that natural complacency and good humour which inclines to trust and confidence in mankind terrors alone tho accompanyd with miracles and prodigys of whatever kind are not capable of raising that sincere faith and absolute reliance which is requird in favour of the divinely authorizd instructor and spiritual chief the affection and love which procures a true adherence to the new religious foundation must depend either on a real or counterfeit goodness in the religious founder whatever ambitious spirit may inspire him whatever savage zeal or persecuting principle may lie in reserve ready to disclose itself when authority and shaftesbury          power is once obtaind the first scene of doctrine however fails not to present us with the agreeable views of joy love meekness gentleness and moderation in this respect religion according to the common practice in many sects may be compard to that sort of courtship of which the fair sex are known often to complain in the beginning of an amour when these innocent charmers are first accosted they hear of nothing but tender vows submission service love but soon afterwards when won by this appearance of gentleness and humility they have resignd themselves and are no longer their own they hear a different note and are taught to understand submission    and service in a sense they little expected charity and brotherly love are very engaging sounds but who woud dream that out of abundant charity and brotherly love shoud come steel fire gibbets rods and such a sound and hearty application of these remedys as shoud at once advance the worldly greatness of religious pastors and the particular interest of private souls for which they are so charitably concernd it has been observd by our author that the jews were naturally a very shaftesbury          cloudy people that they had certainly in religion as in every thing else the least goodhumour of any people in the world is very apparent had it been otherwise their holy legislator and deliverer who was declard †the meekest man on earth and who for many years together had by the most popular and kind acts endeavourd to gain their love and affection woud in all probability have treated them afterwards with more sweetness and been able with ‡less blood and massacre to retain them in their religious duty this however we may observe that if the first jewish princes and celebrated kings acted in reality according to the institutions of their great founder not only musick but even play and dance were of holy appointment and divine right the first monarch of this nation tho of a melancholy complexion joind musick with his spiritual exercises and even usd it as a remedy under that dark enthusiasm or evil spirit which how far it might resemble that of prophecy experiencd by him ††even after his shaftesbury          apostacy our ‡‡author pretends not to determine tis certain that the successor of this prince was a hearty espouser of the merry devotion and by his example has shewn it to have been fundamental in the religious constitution of his people athe    famous entry or high dance performd by him after so conspicuous a manner in the procession of the sacred coffer shews that he was not ashamd of expressing any extasy of joy or playsom humour which was practisd by the †meanest of the priests or people on such an occasion shaftesbury         besides the many songs and hymns dispersd in holy writ the book of psalms itself job proverbs canticles and other intire volumes of the sacred collection which are plainly poetry and full of humorous images and jocular wit may sufficiently shew how readily the inspird authors had recourse to humour and diversion as a proper means to promote religion and strengthen the establishd faith when the affairs of the jewish nation grew desperate and every thing seemd tending to a total conquest and captivity the style of their holy writers and prophets might well vary from that of earlier days in the rise and vigor of their commonwealth or during the first splendor of their monarchy when the princes themselves prophesyd and potent kings were of the number of the sacred penmen this still we may be assurd of that however melancholy or illhumourd any of the prophets may appear at any time was not that kind of spirit which god was wont to encourage in them witness the case of the prophet jonah whose character is so naturally describd in holy writ shaftesbury            pettish as this prophet was unlike a man and resembling rather some refractory boyish pupil it may be said that god as a kind tutor was pleasd to humour him bear with his anger and in a lusory manner expose his childish frowardness and shew him to himself arise said his gracious lord and go to ninive no such matter says our prophet to himself but away oversea for tarshish he fairly plays the truant like an arch schoolboy hoping to hide out of the way but his tutor had good eyes and a long reach he overtook him at sea where a storm was ready prepard for his exercise and a fishs belly for his lodging the renegade found himself in harder durance than any at land he was sufficiently mortifyd he grew good prayd moralizd and spoke mightily against †lying vanitys again ‡the prophet is taken into favour and bid go to ninive to foretel destruction he foretels it ninive repents god pardons and the prophet is angry shaftesbury       0 lord—did i not foresee what this woud come to was not this my saying when i was safe and quiet at home—what else shoud i have run away for—as if i knew not how little dependence there was on the resolution of those who are always so ready to forgive and repent of what they have determind—no—strike me dead—take my life this moment tis better for me—if ever i prophesy again       ††and dost thou well then to be thus angry jonah consider with thyself—come—since thou wilt needs retire out of the city to see at a distance what will come of it here take a better fence than thy own booth against the hot sun which incommodes thee take this tall plant as a shady covering for thy head cool thyself and be deliverd from thy grief    when the almighty had shown this indulgence to the prophet he grew betterhumourd and passd a tolerable night but the next morning the worm came shaftesbury          and an eastwind the arbor was nipd the sun shone vehemently and the prophets head was heated as before presently the ill mood returns and the prophet is at the old pass better die than live at this rate—death death alone can satisfy me let me hear no longer of living—no—tis in vain to talk of it— again †god expostulates but is taken up short and answerd churlishly by the testy prophet angry he is angry he ought to be and angry he will be to his death but the almighty with the utmost pity towards him in this melancholy and froward temper lays open the folly of it and exhorts to mildness and good humour in the most tender manner and under the most familiar and pleasant images whilst he shews ‡expressly more regard and tenderness to the very cattel and brutebeasts than the prophet to his own human kind and to those very disciples whom by his preaching he had converted in the antienter parts of sacred story where the beginning of things and origin of human race are represented to us shaftesbury          there are sufficient instances of this familiarity of style this popular pleasant intercourse and manner of dialogue between god and man i might add even between ††man and beast and what is still more extraordinary between god and ‡‡satan whatsoever of this kind may be allegorically understood or in the way of parable or fable this i am sure of that the accounts descriptions narrations expressions and phrases are in themselves many times exceedingly pleasant entertaining and facetious but    fearing lest i might be misinterpreted shoud i offer to set these passages in their proper light which however has been performd by undoubted good christians and most learned and eminent divines of our own church i forbear to go any further into the examination or criticism of this sort as for our saviours style tis not more vehement and majestick in his gravest animadversions or declamatory discourses than it is sharp humorous and witty in shaftesbury          his repartees reflections fabulous narrations or parables similes comparisons and other methods of milder censure and reproof his exhortations to his disciples his particular designation of their manners the pleasant images under which he often couches his morals and prudential rules even his miracles themselves especially the †first he ever wrought carry with them a certain festivity alacrity and good humour so remarkable that i shoud look upon it as impossible not to be movd in a pleasant manner at their recital now if what i have here asserted in behalf of pleasantry and humour be found just and real in respect of the jewish and christian religions i doubt not it will be yielded to me in respect of the antient heathen establishments that the highest care was taken by their original founders and following reformers to exhilarate religion and correct that melancholy and gloominess to which it is subject according to those different modifications of ‡enthusiasm above specifyd shaftesbury         our author as i take it has elsewhere shewn that these founders were real musicians and improvers of poetry musick and the entertaining arts which they in a manner incorporated with religion not without good reason as i am apt to imagine for to me it plainly appears that in the early times of all religions when nations were yet barbarous and savage there was ever an aptness or tendency towards the dark part of superstition which among    many other horrors producd that of human sacrifice something of this nature might possibly be deducd even from holy writ and shaftesbury          in other historys we are informd of it more at large every one knows how great a part of the old heathen worship consisted in play poetry and dance and tho some of the more melancholy and superstitious votarys might approach the shrines of their divinitys with mean grimaces crouchings and other fawning actions betraying the low thoughts they had of the divine nature yet tis well known that in those times the illiberal †sycophantick manner of devotion was by the wiser sort contemnd and oft suspected ‡as knavish and indirect shaftesbury            how different an air and aspect the good and virtuous were presumd to carry with them to the temple let plutarch singly instead of many others witness in his excellent treatise of su shaftesbury         perstition    and in another against the epicurean atheism where it will plainly shaftesbury          enough appear what a share good humour had in that which the politer antients esteemd as piety and true religion shaftesbury          0 but now methinks i have been sufficiently grave and serious in defense of what is directly contrary to seriousness and gravity i have very solemnly pleaded for gaity and good humour i have declaimd against pedantry in learned language and opposd formality in form i now find myself somewhat impatient to get loose from the constraint of method and i pretend lawfully to exercise the privilege which i have asserted of rambling from subject to subject from style to style in my miscellaneous manner according to my present profession and character i may in the mean while be censurd probably for passing over my third head but the methodical reader if he be scrupulous about it may content himself with looking back and if possibly he can pick it out of my second he will forgive this anticipation in a writing which is governd less by form than humour i had indeed resolvd with myself to make a large collection of passages from our most eminent and learned divines in order to have set forth this latter head of my chapter and by better authority than my own to have evincd that we had in the main a goodhumourd reli shaftesbury       0 gion but after considering a little while i came to this short issue with myself that it was better not to cite at all than to cite partially now if i cited fairly what was said as well on the melancholy as the chearful side of our religion the matter i found woud be pretty doubtfully balancd and the result at last woud be this that generally speaking as oft as a divine    was in good humour we shoud find religion the sweetest and besthumourd thing in nature but at other times and that pretty often we shoud find a very different face of matters thus are we alternately exalted and humbled cheard and dejected according as our spiritual director is himself influencd and this peradventure for our edification and advantage that by these contrarietys and changes we may be renderd more supple and compliant if we are very low and down we are taken up if we are up and high we are taken down—this is discipline this is authority and command—did religion carry constantly one and the same face and were it always represented to us alike in every respect we might perhaps be overbold and make acquaintance with it in shaftesbury          too familiar a manner we might think ourselves fully knowing in it and assurd of its true character and genius from whence perhaps we might become more refractory towards the ghostly teachers of it and be apt to submit ourselves the less to those who by appointment and authority represent it to us in such lights as they esteem most proper and convenient i shall therefore not only conclude abruptly but even sceptically on this my last head referring my reader to what has been said already on my preceding heads for the bare probability of our having in the main a witty and goodhumourd religion this however i may presume to assert that there are undoubtedly some countenances or aspects of our religion which are humorous and pleasant in themselves and that the sadder representations of it are many times so oversad and dismal that they are apt to excite a very contrary passion to what is intended by the representers shaftesbury            miscellany iii chap   chapter i further remarks on the author of the treatises—his order and design—his remarks on the succession of wit and progress of letters and philosophy—of words relations affections—countrymen and country—old england—patriots of the soil—virtuosi and philosophers—a taste having already asserted my privilege as a miscellaneous or essaywriter of the modern establishment to write on every subject and in every method as i fansy to use order or lay it aside as i think fit and to treat of order and method in other works tho free perhaps and unconfind as to my own i shall presume in this place shaftesbury          to consider the present method and order of my authors treatises as in this jointedition they are rangd notwithstanding the high airs of scepticism which our author assumes in his first piece i cannot after all but imagine that even there he proves himself at the bottom a real dogmatist and shews plainly that he has his private opinion belief or faith as strong as any devotee or religionist of em all tho he affects perhaps to strike at other hypotheses and schemes he has something of his own still in reserve and holds a certain plan or system peculiar to himself or such at least in which he has at present but few companions or followers on this account i look upon his management to have been much after the rate of some ambitious architect who being calld perhaps to prop a roof redress a leaning wall or add to some particular apartment is not contented with this small specimen    of his mastership but pretending to demonstrate the unserviceableness and inconvenience of the old fabrick forms the design of a new building and longs to shew his skill in the principal parts of architecture and mechanicks shaftesbury         tis certain that in matters of learning and philosophy the practice of pulling down is far pleasanter and affords more entertainment than that of building and setting up many have succeeded to a miracle in the first who have miserably faild in the latter of these attempts we may find a thousand engineers who can sap undermine and blow up with admirable dexterity for one singleone who can build a fort or lay the platform of a citadel and tho compassion in real war may make the ruinous practice less delightful tis certain that in the literate warringworld the springing of mines the blowing up of towers bastions and ramparts of philosophy with systems hypotheses opinions and doctrines into the air is a spectacle of all other the most naturally rejoicing our author we suppose might have done well to consider this we have fairly conducted him thro his first and second letter and have brought him as we see here into his third piece he has hitherto methinks kept up his sapping method and unravelling humour with tolerable good grace he has given only some few and very slender hints of going fur shaftesbury         ther or attempting to erect any scheme or model which may discover his pretence to a real architectcapacity even in this his third piece he carrys with him the same sceptical mein and what he offers by way of project or hypothesis is very faint hardly spoken aloud but mutterd to himself    in a kind of dubious whisper or feignd soliloquy what he discovers of form and method is indeed so accompanyd with the random miscellaneous air that it may pass for raillery rather than good earnest tis in his following treatise that he discovers himself openly as a plain dogmatist a formalist and man of method with his hypotheses tackd to him and his opinions so closesticking as woud force one to call to mind the figure of some precise and straitlacd professor in a university what may be justly pleaded in his behalf when we come in company with shaftesbury          him to inquire into such solemn and profound subjects seems very doubtful mean while as his affairs stand hitherto in this his treatise of advice i shall be contented to yoke with him and proceed in my miscellaneous manner to give my advice also to men of note whether they are authors or politicians virtuosi or finegentlemen comprehending him the said author as one of the number of the advisd and myself too if occasion be after his own example of selfadmonition and private address but first as to our authors dissertation in this †third treatise where his reflections upon authors in general and the rise and progress of arts make the inlet or introduction to his philosophy we may observe that it is not without some appearance of reason that he has advancd this method it must be acknowledgd that tho in the earliest times there may have been divine men of a transcending genius who have given laws both in religion and government to the great advantage and improvement of mankind yet philosophy itself as a science and known profession worthy of that name cannot with any probability be supposd to have risen as our author shews till other shaftesbury          arts had been raisd and in a certain proportion advancd before it as this was of the greatest dignity and weight so it came last into form it was long    clearing itself from the affected dress of sophists or enthusiastick air of poets and appeard late in its genuine simple and just beauty the reader perhaps may justly excuse our author for having in this place so overloaded his margin with those weighty authoritys and antient citations when he knows that there are many grave professors in humanity and letters among the moderns who are puzzled in this search and write both repugnantly to one another and to the plain and natural evidence of the case the real lineage and succession of wit is indeed plainly founded in nature as our author has endeavourd to make appear both from history and fact the greek nation as it is original to us in respect to these polite arts and sciences so it was in reality original to itself for whether the egyptians phenicians thracians or barbarians of any kind may have hit fortunately on this or that particular invention either in agriculture building navigation or letters whichever may have introducd this rite of worship this title of a deity this or that instrument of mu shaftesbury         sick this or that festival game or dance for on this matter there are high debates among the learned tis evident beyond a doubt that the arts and sciences were formd in greece itself twas there that musick poetry and the rest came to receive some kind of shape and be distinguishd into their several orders and degrees whatever flourishd or was raisd to any degree of correctness or real perfection in the kind was by means of greece alone and in the hand of that sole polite most civilizd and accomplishd nation nor can this appear strange when we consider the fortunate constitution of that people for tho composd of different nations distinct in laws and governments divided by seas and continents dispersd in distant islands yet being originally of the same extract united by one single language and animated by that social publick and free spirit which notwithstanding the animosity of their several warring states inducd them to erect such    heroick congresses and powers as those which constituted the amphictonian councils the olympick isthmian and other games they coud not but naturally polish and refine each other twas thus they brought their beautiful and comprehensive language to a just standard shaftesbury          leaving only such variety in the dialects as renderd their poetry in particular so much the more agreeable the standard was in the same proportion carryd into other arts the secretion was made the several species found and set apart the performers and masters in every kind honourd and admird and last of all even criticks themselves acknowledgd and receivd as masters over all the rest from musick poetry rhetorick down to the simple prose of history thro all the plastick arts of sculpture statuary painting architecture and the rest every thing muselike graceful and exquisite was rewarded with the highest honours and carryd on with the utmost ardor and emulation thus greece tho she exported arts to other nations had properly for her own share no import of the kind the utmost which coud be namd woud amount to no more than raw materials of a rude and barbarous form and thus the nation was evidently original in art and with them every noble study and science was as the great master so often cited by our author says of certain kinds of poetry self shaftesbury       0 formd wrought out of nature and drawn from the necessary operation and course of things working as it were of their own accord and proper inclination now according to this natural growth of arts peculiar to greece it woud necessarily happen that at the beginning when the force of language came to be first provd when the admiring world    made their first judgment and essayd their taste in the elegancys of this sort the lofty the sublime the astonishing and amazing woud be the most in fashion and preferd metaphorical speech multiplicity of figures and highsounding words woud naturally prevail tho in the commonwealth itself and in the affairs of government men were usd originally to plain and direct speech yet when speaking became an art and was taught by sophists and other pretended masters the highpoetick and the figurative way began to prevail even at the bar and in the publick assemblys insomuch that the grandmaster in the abovecited part of his rhetoricks where he extols the tragick poet euripides upbraids the rhetoricians of his own age who retaind that very bombastick style which even poets and those too of the tragick kind had already thrown off or at least considerably shaftesbury          mitigated but the taste of greece was now polishing a better judgment was soon formd when a demosthenes was heard and had found success the people themselves as our author has shewn came now to reform their comedy and familiar manner after tragedy and the higher style had been brought to its perfection under the last hand of an euripides and now in all the principal works of ingenuity and art simplicity and nature began chiefly to be sought and this was the taste which lasted thro so many ages till the ruin of all things under a universal monarchy if the reader shoud peradventure be led by his curiosity to seek some kind of comparison between this antient growth of taste and that which we have experiencd in modern days and within our own nation he may look back to the speeches of our ancestors in parliament he will find em generally speaking to have been very short and plain but coarse and what we properly call homespun till learning came in vogue and science was known amongst us when our princes and senators became scholars they spoke scholastically and the pedantick style was prevalent from the first dawn of letters about the age of the reformation till shaftesbury          long afterwards    witness the best written discourses the admird speeches orations or sermons thro several reigns down to these latter which we compute within the present age twill undoubtedly be found that till very late days the fashion of speaking and the turn of wit was after the figurative and florid manner nothing was so acceptable as the highsounding phrase the farfetchd comparison the capricious point and play of words and nothing so despicable as what was merely of the plain or natural kind so that it must either be confessd that in respect of the preceding age we are fallen very low in taste or that if we are in reality improvd the natural and simple manner which conceals and covers art is the most truly artful and of the genteelest truest and beststudyd taste as has above been treated more at large now therefore as to our authors philosophy itself as it lies conceald in †this treatise but more professd and formal in his ‡next we shall proceed gradually according to his own method since it becomes not one who shaftesbury          has undertaken the part of his airy assistant and humorous paraphrast to enter suddenly without good preparation into his dry reasonings and moral researches about the social passions and natural affections of which he is such a punctilious examiner of all human affections the noblest and most becoming human nature is that of love to ones country this perhaps will easily be allowd by all men who have really a country and are of the number of those who may be calld a people as enjoying the happiness of a real constitution and polity by which they    are free and independent there are few such countrymen or freemen so degenerate as directly to discountenance or condemn this passion of love to their community and national brotherhood the indirect manner of opposing this principle is the most usual we hear it commonly as a complaint that there is little of this love extant in the world from whence tis hastily concluded that there is little or nothing of friendly or social shaftesbury          affection inherent in our nature or proper to our species tis however apparent that there is scarce a creature of human kind who is not possessd at least with some inferior degree or meaner sort of this natural affection to a country our own country charms and draws us with a certain sweetness tis a wretched aspect of humanity which we figure to ourselves when we woud endeavour to resolve the very essence and foundation of this generous passion into a relation to mere clay and dust exclusively of any thing sensible intelligent or moral tis i must own on certain †relations or respective proportions that all natural affection does in some measure depend and in this view it cannot i confess be denyd that we have each of us a certain relation to the mere earth itself the very mould or surface of that planet in which with other animals of various sorts we poor reptiles were also bred and nourishd but had it happend to one of us britishmen to have been born at sea coud we not therefore properly be calld britishmen coud we be allowd countrymen of no sort as having no dis shaftesbury         tinct relation to any certain soil or region no original neighbourhood but with the watry inhabitants and seamonsters surely if we were born of lawful parents lawfully employd and under the protection of law  0 wherever they might be then detaind to whatever colonys sent or whithersoever driven by any accident or in expeditions or adventures in the publick service or that of mankind we shoud still find we had a home and country ready to lay claim to us we shoud be obligd still to consider ourselves as fellowcitizens and might be allowd to love our country or nation as honestly and heartily as the most inland inhabitant or native of the soil our political and social capacity woud undoubtedly come in view and be acknowledgd full as natural and essential in our species as the parental and filial kind which gives rise to what we peculiarly call natural affection or supposing that both our birth and parents had been unknown and that in this respect we were in a manner younger brothers in society to the rest of mankind yet from our nurture and education we shoud surely espouse some country or other and joyfully embracing the protection of a magistracy shoud of necessity and by force of nature join ourselves to the general society of mankind and those in particular with whom we had enterd into a shaftesbury          nearer communication of benefits and closer sympathy of affections it may therefore be esteemd no better than a mean subterfuge of narrow minds to assign this natural passion for society and a country to such a relation as that of a mere fungus or common excrescence to its parentmould or nursing dunghill the relation of countryman if it be allowd any thing at all must imply something moral and social the notion itself presupposes a naturally civil and political state of mankind and has reference to that particular part of society to which we owe our chief advantages as men and rational creatures such as are naturally and necessarily united for each others happiness and support and for the highest of all happiness and enjoyments the intercourse of minds the free use of our reason and the exercise of mutual love and friendship an ingenious physician among the moderns having in view the natural    dependency of the vegetable and animal kinds on their common motherearth and observing that both the one and the other draw from her their continual sustenance some rooted and fixd down to their first shaftesbury          abodes others unconfind and wandring from place to place to suck their nourishment he accordingly as i remember styles this latter animalrace her releasd sons filios terrae emancipatos now if this be our only way of reckoning for mankind we may call ourselves indeed the sons of earth at large but not of any particular soil or district the division of climates and regions is fantastick and artificial much more the limits of particular countrys citys or provinces our natale solum or motherearth must by this account be the real globe itself which bears us and in respect of which we must allow the common animals and even the plants of all degrees to claim an equal brotherhood with us under this common parent according to this calculation we must of necessity carry our relation as far as to the whole material world or universe where alone it can prove compleat but for the particular district or tract of earth which in a vulgar sense we call our country however bounded or geographically divided we can never at this rate frame any accountable relation to it nor consequently assign any natural or proper affection towards it if unhappily a man had been born either at an inn or in some dirty village he shaftesbury          woud hardly i think circumscribe himself so narrowly as to accept a denomination or character from those nearest appendices or local circumstances of his nativity so far shoud one be from making the hamlet or parish to be characteristical in the case that hardly woud the shire itself or county however rich or flourishing be taken into the honorary term or appellation of ones country what then shall we presume to call our country is it england itself but what of scotland is it therefore britain but what of the other islands the northern orcades and the southern jersey and guernsey what of the plantations and poor ireland—behold here a very dubious circumscription    but what after all if there be a conquest or captivity in the case a migration a national secession or abandonment of our native seats for some other soil or climate this has happend we know to our forefathers and as great and powerful a people as we have been of late and have ever shewn ourselves under the influence of free councils and a tolerable ministry shoud we relapse again into slavish principles or be administerd long under such heads as having shaftesbury          no thought of liberty for themselves can have much less for europe or their neighbours we may at last feel a war at home become the seat of it and in the end a conquest we might then gladly embrace the hard condition of our predecessors and exchange our beloved native soil for that of some remote and uninhabited part of the world now shoud this possibly be our fate shoud some considerable colony or body be formd afterwards out of our remains or meet as it were by miracle in some distant climate woud there be for the future no englishman remaining no common bond of alliance and friendship by which we coud still call countrymen as before how came we i pray by our antient name of englishmen did it not travel with us over land and sea did we not indeed bring it with us heretofore from as far as the remoter parts of germany to this island i must confess i have been apt sometimes to be very angry with our language for having denyd us the use of the word patria and afforded us no other name to express our native community than that of country which already bore two different significations abstracted shaftesbury       0  from mankind or society reigning words are many times of such force as to influence us considerably in our apprehension of things whether it be from any such cause as this i know not but certain it is that in the idea of a civil state or nation we englishmen are apt to mix somewhat more than ordinary gross and earthy no people who owd so much to a constitution and so little to a soil or climate were ever known so indifferent towards one and so passionately fond    of the other one woud imagine from the common discourse of our countrymen that the finest lands near the euphrates the babylonian or persian paradises the rich plains of egypt the grecian tempe the roman campania lombardy provence the spanish andalusia or the most delicious tracts in the eastern or western indies were contemptible countrys in respect of old england now by the good leave of these worthy patriots of the soil i must take the liberty to say i think old england to have been in every respect a very indifferent country and that late england of an age or two old even since queen besss days is indeed very much mended for the better we were in the beginning of her grandfathers reign un shaftesbury         der a sort of polish nobility and had no other libertys than what were in common to us with the then fashionable monarchys and gothick lordships of europe for religion indeed we were highly famd above all nations by being the most subject to our ecclesiasticks at home and the best tributarys and servants to the holy see abroad i must go further yet and own that i think late england since the revolution to be better still than old england by many degrees and that in the main we make somewhat a better figure in europe than we did a few reigns before but however our people may of late have flourishd our name or credit have risen our trade and navigation our manufactures or our husbandry been improvd tis certain that our region climate and soil is in its own nature still one and the same and to whatever politeness we may suppose ourselves already arrivd we must confess that we are the latest barbarous the last civilizd or polishd people of europe we must allow that our first conquest by the romans brought us out of a state hardly equal to the indian tribes and that our last conquest by the normans brought us only into the capacity of receiving arts and civil accomplishments shaftesbury          from abroad they came to us by degrees from remote distances at second or third hand from other courts states academys and foreign nurserys of wit and manners notwithstanding this we have as overweaning an opinion of    ourselves as if we had a claim to be original and earthborn as oft as we have changd masters and mixd races with our several successive conquerors we still pretend to be as legitimate and genuine possessors of our soil as the antient athenians accounted themselves to have been of theirs tis remarkable however in that truly antient wise and witty people that as fine territorys and noble countrys as they possessd as indisputable masters and superiors as they were in all science wit politeness and manners they were yet so far from a conceited selfish and ridiculous contempt of others that they were even in a contrary extreme admirers of whatever was in the least degree ingenious or curious in foreign nations their great men were constant travellers their legislators and philosophers made their voyages into egypt passd into chaldea and persia and faild not to visit most of the dispersd grecian governments and colonys thro the islands of the aegean in italy and on the shaftesbury          coasts of asia and africa twas mentiond as a prodigy in the case of a great philosopher tho known to have been always poor that he shoud never have traveld nor had ever gone out of athens for his improvement how modest a reflection in those who were themselves athenians for our part we neither care that foreigners shoud travel to    us nor any of ours shoud travel into foreign countrys our best policy and breeding is it shaftesbury          seems to look abroad as little as possible contract our views within the narrowest compass and despise all knowledg learning or manners which are not of a home growth for hardly will the antients themselves be regarded by those who have so resolute a contempt of what the politest moderns of any nation besides their own may have advancd in the way of literature politeness or philosophy this disposition of our countrymen from whatever causes it may possibly be derivd is i fear a very prepossessing circumstance against our author whose design is to advance something new or at least something different from what is commonly current in philosophy and morals to support this design of his he seems intent chiefly on this single point to discover how we may to best advantage form within ourselves what in the polite world is calld a relish or good taste shaftesbury         he begins its true as near home as possible and sends us to the narrowest of all conversations that of soliloquy or selfdiscourse but this correspondence according to his computation    is wholly impracticable without a previous commerce with the world and the larger this commerce is the more practicable and improving the other he thinks is likely to prove the sources of this improving art of selfcorrespondence he derives from the highest politeness and elegance of antient dialogue and debate in matters of wit knowledg and ingenuity and nothing according to our author can so well revive this selfcorresponding practice as the same search and study of the highest politeness in modern conversation for this we must necessarily be at the pains of going further abroad than the province we call home and by this account it appears that our author has little hopes of being either relishd or comprehended by any other of his countrymen than those who delight in the open and free commerce of the world and are rejoicd to gather views and receive light from every quarter in order to judg the best of what is perfect and according to a just standard and true taste in every kind shaftesbury         it may be proper for us to remark in favour of our author that the sort of ridicule or raillery which is apt to fall upon philosophers is of the same kind with that which falls commonly on the virtuosi or refind wits of the age in this latter general denomination we include the real fine gentlemen the lovers of art and ingenuity such as have seen the world and informd themselves of the manners and customs of the several nations of europe searchd into their antiquitys and records considerd their police laws and constitutions observd the situation strength and ornaments of their citys their principal arts studys and amusements their architecture sculpture painting musick and their taste in poetry learning language and conversation hitherto there can lie no ridicule nor the least scope for satirick wit or raillery but when we push this virtuosocharacter a little further and lead our polishd gentleman into more nice researches when from the view of mankind and their affairs our speculative genius and minute examiner of natures works proceeds with equal or perhaps superior zeal in the contemplation    of the insectlife the conveniencys ha shaftesbury         bitations and oeconomy of a race of shellfish when he has erected a cabinet in due form and made it the real pattern of his mind replete with the same trash and trumpery of correspondent empty notions and chimerical conceits he then indeed becomes the subject of sufficient raillery and is made the jest of common conversations a worse thing than this happens commonly to these inferior virtuosi in seeking so earnestly for raritys they fall in love with rarity for rarenesssake now the greatest raritys in the world are monsters so that the study and relish of these gentlemen thus assiduously imployd becomes at last in reality monstrous and their whole delight is found to consist in selecting and contemplating whatever is most monstrous disagreeing out of the way and to the least purpose of any thing in nature in philosophy matters answer exactly to this virtuososcheme let us suppose a man who having this resolution merely how to employ his understanding to the best purpose considers who or what he is whence he arose or had his being to what end he was designd and to what course of action he is by his natural frame and constitution de shaftesbury         stind shoud he descend on this account into himself and examine his inward powers and facultys or shoud he ascend beyond his own immediate species city or community to discover and recognize his higher polity or community that common and universalone of which he is born a member nothing surely of this kind coud reasonably draw upon him the least contempt or mockery on the contrary the finest gentleman must after all be considerd but as an idiot who talking much of the knowledg of the world and mankind has never so much as thought of the study or knowledg of himself or of the nature and government of that real publick and world from whence he holds his being what are we and for what kind of life are we born    where are we under what roof or on board what vessel whither bound on what business under whose pilotship government or protection are questions which every sensible man woud naturally ask if he were on a sudden transported into a new scene of life tis admirable indeed to consider that a man shoud have been long come into a shaftesbury          world carryd his reason and sense about with him and yet have never seriously askd himself this single question where am i or what but on the contrary shoud proceed regularly to every other study and inquiry postponing this alone as the least considerable or leaving the examination of it to others commissiond as he supposes to understand and think for him upon this head to be bubbled or put upon by any shamadvices in this affair is it seems of no consequence we take care to examine accurately by our own judgment the affairs of other people and the concerns of the world which least belong to us but what relates more immediately to ourselves and is our chief selfinterest we charitably leave to others to examine for us and readily take up with the first comers on whose honesty and good faith tis presumd we may safely rely here methinks the ridicule turns more against the philosophyhaters than the virtuosi or philosophers whilst philosophy is taken as in its prime sense it ought for mastership in life and manners tis like to make no ill figure in the world whatever impertinencys may reign or however extravagant the times may prove but let us view philoso shaftesbury       0 phy like mere virtuosoship in its usual career and we shall find the ridicule rising full as strongly against the professors of the higher as the lower kind cockleshell abounds with each many things exterior and without ourselves of no relation to our real interests or to those of society and mankind are diligently investigated natures remotest operations deepest mysterys and most difficult phaenomena discussd and whimsically explaind hypotheses and fantastick systems erected a universe anatomizd and by some notable scheme so solvd and reducd as to appear an easy knack or secret to those who have    the clew creation itself can upon occasion be exhibited transmutations projections and other philosophical arcana such as in the corporeal world can accomplish all things whilst in the intellectual a set frame of metaphysical phrases and distinctions can serve to solve whatever difficultys may be propounded either in logicks ethicks or any real science of whatever kind it appears from hence that the defects of philosophy and those of virtuosoship are of the same nature nothing can be more dangerous than a wrong choice or misapplication in these affairs shaftesbury          but as ridiculous as these studys are renderd by their sensless managers it appears however that each of em are in their nature essential to the character of a fine gentleman and man of sense to philosophize in a just signification is but to carry goodbreeding a step higher for the accomplishment of breeding is to learn whatever is decent in company or beautiful in arts and the sum of philosophy is to learn what is just in society and beautiful in nature and the order of the world tis not wit merely but a temper which must form the wellbred man in the same manner tis not a head merely but a heart and resolution which must compleat the real philosopher both characters aim at what is excellent aspire to a just taste and carry in view the model of what is beautiful and becoming accordingly the respective conduct and distinct manners of each party are regulated the one according to the perfectest ease and good entertainment of company the other according to the strictest interest of mankind and society the one according to a mans rank and quality in his private nation the other according to his rank and dignity in nature shaftesbury         whether each of these offices of social parts are in themselves as convenient as becoming is the great question which must someway be decided the wellbred man has already decided this in his own case and declard on the side of what is handsom for whatever he practises in this kind he accounts no more than what he owes purely to himself without regard to any further advantage  00 the pretender to philosophy who either knows not how to determine this affair or if he has determind knows not how to pursue his point with constancy and firmness remains in respect of philosophy what a clown or coxcomb is in respect of breeding and behaviour thus according to our author the taste of beauty and the relish of what is decent just and amiable perfects the character of the gentleman and the philosopher and the study of such a taste or relish will as we suppose be ever the great employment and concern of him who covets as well to be wise and good as agreeable and polite i care about and i ask what is true and fitting and i am completely occupied in this shaftesbury         chap   chapter ii explanation of a taste continud—ridiculers of it—their wit and sincerity—application of the taste to affairs of government and politicks—imaginary characters in the state—young nobility and gentry—pursuit of beauty—preparation for philosophy by this time surely i must have provd myself sufficiently engagd in the project and design of our selfdiscoursing author whose defence i have undertaken his pretension as plainly appears in this third treatise is to †recommend morals on the same foot with what in a lower sense is calld manners and to advance philosophy as harsh a subject as it may appear on the very foundation of what is calld agreeable and polite and tis in this method and management that as his interpreter or paraphrast  0  i have proposd to imi shaftesbury         tate and accompany him as far as my miscellaneous character will permit our joint endeavour therefore must appear this to shew that nothing which is found charming or delightful in the polite world nothing which is adopted as pleasure or entertainment of whatever kind can any way be accounted for supported or establishd without the preestablishment or supposition of a certain taste now a taste or judgment tis supposd can hardly come ready formd with us into the world whatever principles or materials of this kind we may possibly bring with us whatever good facultys senses or anticipating sensations and imaginations may be of natures growth and arise properly of themselves without our art promotion or assistance the general idea which is formd of all this management and the clear notion we attain of what is preferable and principal in all these subjects of choice and estimation will not as i imagine by any person be taken for innate use practice and culture must precede the understanding and wit of such an advancd size and growth as this a legitimate and just taste can neither be begotten made conceivd shaftesbury          or producd without the antecedent labour and pains of criticism for this reason we presume not only to defend the cause of criticks but to declare open war against those indolent supine authors performers readers auditors actors or spectators who making their humour alone the rule of what is beautiful and agreeable and having no account to give of such their humour or odd fancy reject the criticizing or examining art by which alone they are able to discover the true beauty and worth of every object according to that affected ridicule which these insipid remarkers pretend to throw upon just criticks the enjoyment of all real arts or natural beautys woud be intirely lost even in behaviour and manners we shoud at this rate become in time as  0  barbarous as in our pleasures and diversions i woud presume it however of these critickhaters that they are not yet so uncivilizd or void of all social sense as to maintain that the most barbarous life or brutish pleasure is as desirable as the most polishd or refind for my own part when i have sometimes heard men of reputed ability join in shaftesbury          with that effeminate plantive tone of invective against criticks i have really thought they had it in their fancy to keep down the growing geniuss of the youth their rivals by turning them aside from that examination and search on which all good performance as well as good judgment depends i have seen many a time a wellbred man who had himself a real good taste give way with a malicious complaisance to the humour of a company where in favour chiefly of the tender sex this soft languishing contempt of criticks and their labours has been the subject set afoot wretched creatures says one impertinent things these criticks as ye call em—as if one coudnt know what was agreeable or pretty without their help—tis fine indeed that one shoudnt be allowd to fansy for onesself—now shoud a thousand criticks tell me that mr a——s new play want the wittiest in the world i woudnt mind em one bit this our real man of wit hears patiently and adds perhaps of his own that he thinks it truly somewhat hard in what relates to peoples diversion and entertainment that they shoud be obligd to chuse what pleasd others and not themselves soon after this shaftesbury          he goes himself to the play finds one of his effeminate companions commending or admiring at a wrong place he turns to the next person who sits by him and asks privately what he thinks of his companions relish such is the malice of the world they who by pains and industry have acquird a real taste in arts rejoice in their advantage over others who have either none at all or such as renders em ridiculous at an auction of books or pictures you shall hear these gentlemen persuading every one to bid for what he fansys but at the same time they woud be soundly mortifyd themselves if  0  by such as they esteemd good judges they shoud be found to have purchasd by a wrong fancy or ill taste the same gentleman who commends his neighbour for ordering his garden or apartment as his humour leads him takes care his own shoud be so orderd as the best judgments woud advise being once a judg himself or but tolerably knowing in these affairs his aim is not to change the being of things and bring truth and nature to his humour but leaving nature and truth just as he found em to accommodate his humour and fancy to their standard woud he do this shaftesbury          in a yet higher case he might in reality become as wise and great a man as he is already a refind and polishd gentleman by one of these tastes he understands how to lay out his garden model his house fansy his equipage appoint his table by the other he learns of what value these amusements are in life and of what importance to a mans freedom happiness and selfenjoyment for if he woud try effectually to acquire the real science or taste of life he woud certainly discover that a right mind and generous affection had more beauty and charm than all other symmetrys in the world besides and that a grain of honesty and native worth was of more value than all the adventitious ornaments estates or preferments for the sake of which some of the better sort so oft turn knaves forsaking their principles and quitting their honour and freedom for a mean timorous shifting state of gaudy servitude a little better taste were it a very little in the affair of life itself woud if i mistake not mend the manners and secure the happiness of some of our noble countrymen who come with high advantage and a worthy cha shaftesbury         racter into the publick but ere they have long engagd in it their worth unhappily becomes venal equipages titles precedencys staffs ribbons and other such glittering ware are taken in exchange for inward merit honour and a character this they may account perhaps a shreud bargain but there will be found very untoward abatements in it when the matter comes  0  to be experiencd they may have descended in reality from ever so glorious ancestors patriots and sufferers for their countrys liberty and welfare they may have made their entrance into the world upon this bottom of anticipated fame and honour they may have been advancd on this account to dignitys which they were thought to have deservd but when inducd to change their honest measures and sacrifice their cause and friends to an imaginary private interest they will soon find by experience that they have lost the relish and taste of life and for insipid wretched honours of a deceitful kind have unhappily exchangd an amiable and sweet honour of a sincere and lasting relish and good savour they may after this act farces as they think fit and hear qualitys and virtues assignd to em under the titles of graces excellencys ho shaftesbury       0 nours and the rest of this mockpraise and mimical appellation they may even with serious looks be told of honour and worth their principle and their country but they know better within themselves and have occasion to find that after all the world too knows better and that their few friends and admirers have either a very shallow wit or a very profound hypocrisy tis not in one party alone that these purchases and sales of honour are carryd on i can represent to myself a noted patriot and reputed pillar of the religious part of our constitution who having by many and long services and a steddy conduct gaind the reputation of thorow zeal with his own party and of sincerity and honour with his very enemys on a sudden the time being come that the fulness of his reward was set before him submits complacently to the proposd bargain and sells himself for what he is worth in a vile detestable oldage to which he has reservd the infamy of betraying both his friends and country i can imagine on the other side one of a contrary party a noted friend to liberty in church and state an abhorrer of the slavish dependency on courts and of the narrow principles of bigots shaftesbury          such a one after many publick services of note i can see wrought upon by degrees to seek courtpreferment and this too under a patriotcharacter but having perhaps tryd this way with less success  0  he is obligd to change his character and become a royal flatterer a courtier against his nature submitting himself and suing in so much the meaner degree as his inherent principles are well known at court and to his newadopted party to whom he feigns himself a proselyte the greater the genius or character is of such a person the greater is his slavery and heavier his load better had it been that he had never discoverd such a zeal for publick good or signalizd himself in that party which can with least grace make sacrifices of national interests to a crown or to the private will appetite or pleasure of a prince for supposing such a genius as this had been to act his part of courtship in some foreign and absolute court how much less infamous woud his part have provd how much less slavish admist a people who were all slaves had he peradventure been one of that forlorn begging troop of gentry extant in denmark or sweden since the time that those nations lost their libertys had he livd out of a free nation and happilybalancd constitution had shaftesbury          he been either conscious of no talent in the affairs of government or of no opportunity to exert any such to the advantage of mankind where had been the mighty shame if perhaps he had employd some of his abilitys in flattering like others and paying the necessary homage requird for safetys sake and selfpreservation in absolute and despotick governments the taste perhaps in strictness might still be wrong even in this hard circumstance but how inexcusable in a quite contrary one for let us suppose our courtier not only an englishman but of the rank and stem of those old english patriots who were wont to curb the licentiousness of our court arraign its flatterers and purge away those poisons from the ear of princes let us suppose him of a competent fortune and moderate appetites without any apparent luxury or lavishment in his manners what shall we after this bring in excuse or as an apology for such a choice as his how shall we explain this preposterous relish this odd preference of subtlety and indirectness to true wisdom open honesty and uprightness tis easier i confess to give account of this corruption of taste  0  in some noble youth of a more sumptuous gay fancy supposing him born truly great and shaftesbury          of honourable descent with a generous free mind as well as ample fortune even these circumstances themselves may be the very causes perhaps of his being thus ensnard the elegance of his fancy in outward things may have made him overlook the worth of inward character and proportion and the love of grandure and magnificence wrong turnd may have possessd his imagination overstrongly with such things as frontispieces parterres equipages trim valets in partycolourd clothes and others in gentlemens apparel—magnanimous exhibitions of honour and generosity—in town a palace and sutable furniture in the country the same with the addition of such edifices and gardens as were unknown to our ancestors and are unnatural to such a climate as great britain mean while the year runs on but the years income answers not its expence for which of these articles can be retrenchd which way take up after having thus set out a princely fancy has begot all this and a princely slavery and courtdependence must maintain it shaftesbury         the young gentleman is now led into a chace in which he will have slender capture tho toil sufficient he is himself taken nor will he so easily get out of that labyrinth to which he chose to commit his steps rather than to the more direct and plainer paths in which he trod before farewel that generous proud spirit which was wont to speak only what it approvd commend only whom it thought worthy and act only what it thought right favourites must be now observd little engines of power attended on and loathsomly caressd an honest man dreaded and every free tongue or pen abhord as dangerous and reproachful for till our gentleman is become wholly prostitute and shameless till he is brought to laugh at publick virtue and the very notion of common good till he has openly renouncd all principles of honour and honesty he must in good policy avoid those to whom he lies  0  so much exposd and shun that commerce and familiarity which was once his chief delight such is the sacrifice made to a wrong pride and ignorant selfesteem by one whose inward character must necessarily after this manner become as mean and shaftesbury          abject as his outward behaviour insolent and intolerable there are another sort of suitors to power and traffickers of inward worth and liberty for outward gain whom one woud be naturally drawn to compassionate they are themselves of a humane compassionate and friendly nature wellwishers to their country and mankind they coud perhaps even embrace poverty contentedly rather than submit to any thing diminutive either of their inward freedom or national liberty but what they can bear in their own persons they cannot bring themselves to bear in the persons of such as are to come after them here the best and noblest of affections are borne down by the excess of the next best those of tenderness for relations and near friends such captives as these woud disdain however to devote themselves to any prince or ministry whose ends were wholly tyrannical and irreconcilable with the true interest of their nation in other cases of a less degeneracy they may bow down perhaps in the temple of rimmon support the weight of their supine lords and prop the steps and ruining credit of their corrupt patrons shaftesbury         this is drudgery sufficient for such honest natures such as by hard fate alone coud have been made dishonest but as for pride or insolence on the account of their outward advancement and seeming elevation they are so far from any thing resembling it that one may often observe what is very contrary in these fairer characters of men for tho perhaps they were known somewhat rigid and severe before you see em now grown in reality submissive and obliging tho in conversation formerly dogmatical and overbearing on the points of state and government they are now the patientest to hear the least forward to dictate and the readiest to embrace any entertaining subject of discourse rather than that of the publick and their own personal advancement  0  nothing is so near virtue as this behaviour and nothing so remote from it nothing so sure a token of the most profligate manners as the contrary in a free government tis so much the interest of every one in place who profits by the publick to demean himself with modesty and submission that to appear immediately the more insolent and haughty on such an advancement is the mark only of a contemptible genius and of a want of shaftesbury          true understanding even in the narrow sense of interest and private good thus we see after all that tis not merely what we call principle but a taste which governs men they may think for certain this is right or that wrong they may believe this a crime or that a sin this punishable by man or that by god yet if the savor of things lies cross to honesty if the fancy be florid and the appetite high towards the subaltern beautys and lower order of worldly symmetrys and proportions the conduct will infallibly turn this latter way even conscience i fear such as is owing to religious discipline will make but a slight figure where this taste is set amiss among the vulgar perhaps it may do wonders a devil and a hell may prevail where a jail and gallows are thought insufficient but such is the nature of the liberal polishd and refind part of mankind so far are they from the mere simplicity of babes and sucklings that instead of applying the notion of a future reward or punishment to their immediate behaviour in society they are apt much rather thro the whole course of their lives to shew evidently that they look on the pious narrations to be shaftesbury          indeed no better than childrens tales or the amusement of the mere vulgar that our ghosts exist and realms below the earth    not even children believe except those who are too young to pay at the baths  0  something therefore shoud methinks be further thought of in behalf of our generous youths towards the correcting of their taste or relish in the concerns of life for this at last is what will influence and in this respect the youth alone are to be regarded some hopes there may be still conceivd of these the rest are confirmd and hardend in their way a middleagd knave however devout or orthodox is but a common wonder an oldone is no wonder at all but a youngone is still thank heaven somewhat extraordinary and i can never enough admire what was said once by a worthy man at the first appearance of one of these young able prostitutes that he even trembled at the sight to find nature capable of being turnd so soon and that he boded greater calamity to his country from this single example of young villany than from shaftesbury          the practices and arts of all the old knaves in being let us therefore proceed in this view addressing ourselves to the grown youth of our polite world let the appeal be to these whose relish is retrievable and whose taste may yet be formd in morals as it seems to be already in exterior manners and behaviour that there is really a standard of this latter kind will immediately and on the first view be acknowledgd the contest is only which is right—which the unaffected carriage and just demeanour and which the affected and false scarce is there anyone who pretends not to know and to decide what is wellbred and handsom there are few so affectedly clownish as absolutely to disown goodbreeding and renounce the notion of a beauty in outward manners and deportment with such as these wherever they shoud be found i must confess i coud scarce be tempted to bestow the least pains or labour towards convincing em of a beauty in inward sentiments and principles whoever has any impression of what we call gentility or politeness is already shaftesbury       0  so acquainted with the decorum and grace of things that he will readily confess a pleasure and enjoyment in the very survey and contemplation of this kind now if in the way   0 of polite pleasure the study and love of beauty be essential the study and love of symmetry and order on which beauty depends must also be essential in the same respect tis impossible we can advance the least in any relish or taste of outward symmetry and order without acknowledging that the proportionate and regular state is the truly prosperous and natural in every subject the same features which make deformity create incommodiousness and disease and the same shapes and proportions which make beauty afford advantage by adapting to activity and use even in the imitative or designing arts to which our author so often refers the truth or beauty of every figure or statue is measurd from the perfection of nature in her just adapting of every limb and proportion to the activity strength dexterity life and vigor of the particular species or animal designd thus beauty and truth are plainly joind with the notion of utility and shaftesbury          convenience even in the apprehension of every ingenious artist the †architect the statuary or the painter tis the same in the physicians way natural health is the just proportion     truth and regular course of things in a constitution tis the inward beauty of the body and when the harmony and just measures of the rising pulses the circulating humours and the moving airs or spirits are disturbd or lost deformity enters and with it calamity and ruin shoud not this one woud imagine be still the same case and hold equally as to the mind is there nothing there which tends to disturbance and dissolution is there no natural tenour tone or order of the passions or affections no beauty or deformity in this moral kind shaftesbury          or allowing that there really is must it not of consequence in the same manner imply health or sickliness prosperity or disaster will it not be found in this respect above all that what is beau shaftesbury         tiful is harmonious and proportionable what     is harmonious and proportionable is true and what is at once both beautiful and true is of consequence agreeable and good shaftesbury         where then is this beauty or harmony to be found how is this     symmetry to be discoverd and applyd is it any other art than that of philosophy or the study of inward numbers and shaftesbury          proportions which can exhibit this in life if no other who then     can possibly have a taste of this kind without being beholden to philosophy who can admire the outward beautys and not recur instantly to the inward which are the most real and essential the most naturally affecting and of the highest pleasure as well as profit and advantage shaftesbury         in so short a compass does that learning and knowledge lie on which manners and life depend tis we ourselves create and form our taste if we resolve to have it just tis in our power we may esteem and value approve and disapprove as we woud wish for who woud not rejoice to be always equal and consonant to himself and have constantly that opinion of things which is natural and proportionable but who dares search opinion to the bottom or call in question his early and prepossessing taste who is so just to himself as to recal his fancy from the power of fashion and education to that of reason coud we however be thus courageous we shoud soon settle in ourselves such an opinion of good as woud secure to us an invari shaftesbury         able agreeable and just taste in life and manners thus have i endeavourd to tread in my authors steps and prepare the reader for the serious and downright philosophy which even in this last commented treatise our author keeps still as a mystery and dares not formally profess his pretence has been to advise authors and polish styles but his aim has been to correct manners and regulate lives he has affected soliloquy as pretending only to censure himself but he has taken occasion to bring others into his company and make bold with personages and characters of no inferior rank he has given scope enough to raillery and humour and has intrenchd very largely on the province of us miscellanarian writers but the reader is †now about to see     him in a new aspect a formal and professd philosopher a systemwriter a dogmatist and expounder—habes consitentem reum so to his philosophy i commit him tho according as my genius and shaftesbury          present disposition will permit i intend still to accompany him at a distance keep him in sight and convoy him the best i am able thro the dangerous seas he is about to pass shaftesbury             miscellany iv chap   chapter i connexion and union of the subjecttreatises—philosophy in form—metaphysicks—egoity identity—moral footing—proof and discipline of the fancys settlement of opinion—anatomy of the mind—a fable we have already in the beginning of our preceding miscellany taken notice of our authors plan and the connection and dependency of his jointtracts comprehended in two preceding volumes we are now in our commentatorcapacity arrivd at length to his second volume to which the three pieces of his first appear preparatory that they were really so shaftesbury       0  designd the advertisement to the first edition of his soliloquy is a sufficient proof he took occasion there in a line or two under the name of his printer or as he otherwise calls him his amanuensis to prepare us for a more elaborate and methodical piece which was to follow we have this system now before us nor need we wonder such as it is that it came so hardly into the world and that our author has been deliverd of it with so much difficulty and after so long a time his amanuensis and he were not it seems heretofore upon such good terms of correspondence otherwise such an unshapen foetus or false birth as that of which our author in his †titlepage complains had not formerly appeard abroad nor had it ever risen again in its more decent form but for the accidental publication of our authors first ‡letter which by a necessary     train of consequences occasiond the revival of this abortive piece and gave usherance to its companions it will appear therefore in this jointedition of our authors five treatises that the three former are preparatory to the fourth on which we are now enterd shaftesbury          and the fifth with which he concludes a kind of apology for this revivd treatise concerning virtue and religion as for his apology particularly in what relates to reveald religion and a world to come i commit the reader to the disputant divines and gentlemen whom our author has introducd in that concluding piece of dialoguewriting or rhapsodical philosophy mean while we have here no other part left us than to enter into the dry philosophy and rigid manner of our author without any excursions into various literature without help from the comick or tragick muse or from the flowers of poetry or rhetorick such is our present pattern and strict moral task which our more humorous reader foreknowing may immediately if he pleases turn over skipping as is usual in many grave works a chapter or two as he proceeds we shall to make amends endeavour afterwards in our following miscellany to entertain him again with more chearful fare and afford him a dessert to rectify his palat and leave his mouth at last in good relish to the patient and grave reader therefore who in order to moralize can shaftesbury          afford to retire into his closet as to some religious or devout exercise we presume thus to offer a few reflections in the support of our authors profound inquiry and accordingly we are to imagine our author speaking as follows how little regard soever may be shewn to that moral speculation or inquiry which we call the study of ourselves it must in strictness be yielded that all knowledg whatsoever depends upon this previousone and that we can in reality be assurd of nothing till we are first assurd of what we are ourselves for by this alone we can know what certainty and assurance is that there is something undoubtedly which thinks our very     doubt itself and scrupulous thought evinces but in what subject that thought resides and how that subject is continud one and the same so as to answer constantly to the supposd train of thoughts or reflections which seem to run so harmoniously thro a long course of life with the same relation still to one single and selfsame person this is not a matter so easily or hastily decided by those who are nice selfexaminers or searchers after truth and certainty shaftesbury         twill not in this respect be sufficient for us to use the seeming logick of a famous modern and say we think therefore we are which is a notably invented saying after the model of that like philosophical proposition that what is is—miraculously argud if i am i am—nothing more certain for the ego or i being establishd in the first part of the proposition the ergo no doubt must hold it good in the latter but the question is what constitutes the we or i and whether the i of this instant be the same with that of any instant preceding or to come for we have nothing but memory to warrant us and memory may be false we may believe we have thought and reflected thus or thus but we may be mistaken we may be conscious of that as truth which perhaps was no more than dream and we may be conscious of that as a past dream which perhaps was never before so much as dreamt of this is what metaphysicians mean when they say that identity can be provd only by consciousness but that consciousness withal may be as well shaftesbury          false as real in respect of what is past so that the same successional we or i must remain still on this account undecided to the force of this reasoning i confess i must so far submit as to declare that for my own part i take my being upon trust let others philosophize as they are able i shall admire their strength when upon this topick they have refuted what able metaphysicians object and pyrrhonists plead in their own behalf     mean while there is no impediment hinderance or suspension of action on account of these wonderfully refind speculations argument and debate go on still conduct is settled rules and measures are given out and receivd nor do we scruple to act as resolutely upon the mere supposition that we are as if we had effectually provd it a thousand times to the full satisfaction of our metaphysical or pyrrhonean antagonist this to me appears sufficient ground for a moralist nor do i ask more when i undertake to prove the reality of virtue and morals if it be certain that i am tis certain and demonstrable who and what shaftesbury          i ought to be even on my own account and for the sake of my own private happiness and success for thus i take the liberty to proceed the affections of which i am conscious are either grief or joy desire or aversion for whatever mere sensation i may experience if it amounts to neither of these tis indifferent and no way affects me that which causes joy and satisfaction when present causes grief and disturbance when absent and that which causes grief and disturbance when present does when absent by the same necessity occasion joy and satisfaction thus love which implies desire with hope of good must afford occasion to grief and disturbance when it acquires not what it earnestly seeks and hatred which implies aversion and fear of ill must in the same manner occasion grief and calamity when that which it earnestly shund or woud have escapd remains present or is altogether unavoidable that which being present can never leave the mind at rest but must of necessity cause aversion is its ill but that which can be sustaind without any neces shaftesbury         sary abhorrence or aversion is not its ill but remains indifferent in its own nature the ill being in the affection only which wants redress in the same manner that which being absent can never leave the mind at rest or without disturbance and regret is of necessity its   0 good but that which can be absent without any present or future disturbance to the mind is not its good but remains indifferent in its own nature from whence it must follow that the affection towards it as supposd good is an ill affection and creative only of disturbance and disease so that the affections of love and hatred liking and dislike on which the happiness or prosperity of the person so much depends being influencd and governd by opinion the highest good or happiness must depend on right opinion and the highest misery be derivd from wrong to explain this i consider for instance the fancy or imagination i have of death according as i find this subject naturally passing in my mind to this fancy perhaps i find united an opinion or apprehension of evil and calamity now the more my apprehension of this evil increases the greater i find my disturbance proves not only at the shaftesbury          approach of the supposd evil but at the very distant thought of it besides that the thought itself will of necessity so much the oftner recur as the aversion or fear is violent and increasing from this supposd evil i must however fly with so much the more earnestness as the opinion of the evil increases now if the increase of the aversion can be no cause of the decrease or diminution of the evil itself but rather the contrary then the increase of the aversion must necessarily prove the increase of disappointment and disturbance and so on the other hand the diminution or decrease of the aversion if this may any way be effected must of necessity prove the diminution of inward disturbance and the better establishment of inward quiet and satisfaction again i consider with myself that i have the imagination of something beautiful great and becoming in things this     imagination i apply perhaps shaftesbury          to such subjects as plate jewels apartments coronets patents of honour titles or precedencys i must therefore naturally seek these not as mere conveniencys means or helps in life for as such my passion coud not be so excessive towards em but as excellent in themselves necessarily attractive of my admiration and directly and immediately causing my happiness and giving me satisfaction now if the passion raisd on this opinion call it avarice pride vanity or ambition be indeed incapable of any real satisfaction even under the most successful course of fortune and then too attended with perpetual fears of disappointment and loss how can the mind be other than miserable when possessd by it but if instead of forming thus the opinion of good if instead of placing worth or excellence in these outward subjects we place it where it is truest in the affections or sentiments in the governing part and inward character we have then the full enjoyment of it within our power the imagination or opinion remains steddy and irreversible and the love desire and appetite is answerd without apprehension of loss or disappointment here therefore arises work and employment for us within to regulate shaftesbury          fancy and rectify opinion on which all depends for if our loves desires hatreds and aversions are left to themselves     we are necessarily exposd to endless vexation and calamity but if these are found capable of amendment or in any measure flexible or variable by opinion we ought methinks to make trial at least how far we might by this means acquire felicity and content accordingly if we find it evident on one hand that by indulging any wrong appetite as either debauch malice or revenge the opinion of the false good increases and the appetite which is a real ill grows so much the stronger we may be as fully assurd on the other hand that by restraining this affection and nourishing a contrary sort in opposition to it we cannot fail to diminish what is ill and increase what is properly our happiness and good shaftesbury      00 on this account a man may reasonably conclude that it becomes him by working upon his own mind to withdraw the fancy or opinion of good or ill from that to which justly and by necessity it is not joind and apply it with the strongest resolution to that with which it naturally agrees for if the fancy or opinion of good be joind to what is not durable nor in my power either to acquire or to retain the more such an opinion prevails the more i must be subject to disappointment and distress but if there be that to which whenever i apply the opinion or fancy of good i find the fancy more consistent and the good more durable solid and within my power and command then the more such an opinion prevails in me the more satisfaction and happiness i must experience now if i join the opinion of good to the possessions of the mind if it be in the affections themselves that i place my highest joy and in those objects whatever they are of inward worth and beauty such as honesty faith integrity friendship honour tis evident i can never possibly in this respect rejoice amiss or indulge myself too far in the enjoyment the greater my indulgence is the less i have reason to fear either reverse or disappointment shaftesbury      0  this i know is far contrary in another regimen of life the tutorage of fancy and pleasure and the easy philosophy of taking that for good which pleases me or which i fansy merely     will in time give me uneasiness sufficient tis plain from what has been debated that the less fanciful i am in what relates to my content and happiness the more powerful and absolute i must be in selfenjoyment and the possession of my good and since tis fancy merely which gives the force of good or power of passing as such to things of chance and outward dependency tis evident that the more i take from fancy in this respect the more i confer upon myself as i am less led or betrayd by fancy to an esteem of what depends on others i am the more fixd in the esteem of what depends on myself alone and if i have once gaind the taste of liberty i shall easily understand the force of this reasoning and know both my true self and interest the method therefore requird in this my inward oeconomy is to make those fancys themselves the objects of my aversion which justly deserve it by being the cause of a wrong estimation and measure shaftesbury      0   of good and ill and consequently the cause of my unhappiness and disturbance accordingly as the learned masters in this science advise we are to begin rather †by the averse than by the prone and forward     disposition we are to work rather by the weaning than the ingaging passions since if we give way chiefly to inclination by loving applauding and admiring what is great and good we may possibly it seems in some high objects of that kind be so amusd and extasyd as to shaftesbury      0   lose ourselves and miss our proper mark for want of a steddy and settled aim but being more sure and infallible in what relates to our ill we shoud begin they tell us by applying our aversion on that side and raising our indignation against those meannesses of opinion and sentiment which are the causes of our subjection and perplexity thus the covetous fancy if considerd as the cause of misery and consequently detested as a real ill must of necessity abate and the ambitious fancy if opposd in the same manner with resolution by better thought must resign itself and leave the mind free and disincumberd in the pursuit of its better objects nor is the case different in the passion of cowardice or fear of shaftesbury      0   death for if we leave this passion to itself or to certain     tutors to manage for us it may lead us to the most anxious and tormenting state of life but if it be opposd by sounder opinion and a just estimation of things it must diminish of course and the natural result of such a practice must be the rescue of the mind from numberless fears and miserys of other kinds thus at last a mind by knowing itself and its own proper powers and virtues becomes free and independent it sees its hindrances and obstructions and finds they are wholly from itself and from opinions wrongconceivd the more it conquers in this respect be it in the least particular the more it is its own master feels its own natural liberty and congratulates with itself on its own advancement and prosperity whether some who are calld philosophers have so applyd their meditations as to understand any thing of this language i know not but well i am assurd that many an honest and freehearted fellow among the vulgar rank of people has naturally some kind of feeling or apprehension of this selfenjoyment when refusing to act for lucre or outward profit the thing which from his soul he abhors and thinks below him he goes on with harder shaftesbury      0   labour but more content in his direct plain path he is secure within free of what the world calls policy or design and sings according to the old ballad my mind to me a kingdom is c which in latin we may translate   ——et meâ   virtute me involvo probamque   pauperiem sine dote quaero but i forget it seems that i am now speaking in the person of our grave inquirer i shoud consider i have no right to vary from the pattern he has set and that whilst i accompany him in this particular treatise i ought not to make the least escape out     of the high road of demonstration into the diverting paths of poetry or humour as grave however as morals are presumd in their own nature i look upon it as an essential matter in their delivery to take now and then the natural air of pleasantry the first morals which were ever deliverd in the world were in parables tales or fables and the latter and most consummate distributers shaftesbury      0   of morals in the very politest times were great taletellers and retainers to honest aesop after all the regular demonstrations and deductions of our grave author i dare say twoud be a high relief and satisfaction to his reader to hear an apologue or fable well told and with such humour as to need no sententious moral at the end to make the application as an experiment in this case let us at this instant imagine our grave inquirer taking pains to shew us at full length the unnatural and unhappy excursions rovings or expeditions of our ungovernd fancys and opinions over a world of riches honours and other ebbing and flowing goods he performs this we will suppose with great sagacity to the full measure and scope of our attention mean while as full or satiated as we might find ourselves of serious and solid demonstration tis odds but we might find vacancy still sufficient to receive instruction by another method and i dare answer for success shoud a merrier moralist of the aesopaeanschool present himself and hearing of this chace describd by our philosopher beg leave to represent it to the life by a homely cur or two of his masters ordinary breed shaftesbury      0  two of this race he woud tell us having been daintily bred and in high thoughts of what they calld pleasure and good living traveld once in quest of game and raritys till they came by accident to the seaside they saw there at a distance from the shore some floating pieces of a wreck which they took a fancy to believe some wonderful rich dainty richer than ambergreese or the richest product of the ocean they coud prove it by their appetite and longing to be no less than quintessence of the main ambrosial substance the repast of marine deitys surpassing     all which earth afforded—by these rhetorical arguments after long reasoning with one another in this florid vein they proceeded from one extravagance of fancy to another till they came at last to this issue being unaccustomd to swimming they woud not it seems in prudence venture so far out of their depth as was necessary to reach their imagind prize but being stout drinkers they thought with themselves they might compass to drink all which lay in their way even the sea itself and that by this method they might shortly bring their goods safe to dry land to work shaftesbury      0   therefore they went and drank till they were both burst for my own part i am fully satisfyd that there are more seadrinkers than one or two to be found among the principal personages of mankind and that if these dogs of ours were silly curs many who pass for wise in our own race are little wiser and may properly enough be said to have the sea to drink tis pretty evident that they who live in the highest sphere of human affairs have a very uncertain view of the thing calld happiness or good it lies out at sea far distant in the offin where those gentlemen ken it but very imperfectly and the means they employ in order to come up with it are very wide of the matter and far short of their proposd end—first a general acquaintance—visits levees—attendance upon the great and little—popularity—a place in parliament—then another at court—then intrigue corruption prostitution—then a higher place—then a title—then a remove—a new minister—fractions at court—shipwreck of ministrys—the new the old—engage with one piece up with tother— shaftesbury      0  bargains losses aftergames retrievals—is not this the sea to drink but if riches could make you wise if they could make you less lustful less easily frightened of course you would blush to have any one alive more avaricious than you     but lest i shoud be tempted to fall into a manner i have been obligd to disclaim in this part of my miscellaneous performance i shall here set a period to this discourse and renew my attempt of serious reflection and grave thought by taking up my clew in a fresh chapter shaftesbury       0 chap   chapter ii passage from terra incognita to the visible world—mistressship of nature—animalconfederacy degrees subordination—masteranimal man privilege of his birth—serious countenance of the author as heavily as it went with us in the deep philosophical part of our preceding chapter and as necessarily engagd as we still are to prosecute the same serious inquiry and search into those dark sources tis hopd that our remaining philosophy may flow in a more easy vein and the second running be found somewhat clearer than the first however it be we may at least congratulate with ourselves for having thus briefly passd over that metaphysical part to which we have paid sufficient deference nor shall we scruple to declare our opinion that it is in a manner necessary for one who woud usefully philosophize to have a knowledg in this part of philosophy sufficient to satisfy him that shaftesbury          there is no knowledg or wisdom to be learnt from it for of this truth nothing besides experience and study will be able fully to convince him when we are even past these empty regions and shadows of philosophy twill still perhaps appear an uncomfortable kind of travelling thro those other invisible ideal worlds such as the study of morals we see engages us to visit men must acquire a very peculiar and strong habit of turning their eye inwards in order to explore the interior regions and recesses of the mind the hollow caverns of deep thought the private seats of fancy and the     wastes and wildernesses as well as the more fruitful and cultivated tracts of this obscure climate but what can one do or how dispense with these darker disquisitions and moonlight voyages when we have to deal with a sort of moonblind wits who tho very acute and able in their kind may be said to renounce daylight and extinguish in a manner the bright visible outward world by allowing us to know nothing beside what we can prove by strict and formal demonstration tis therefore to satisfy such rigid inquirers as these that we have been necessi shaftesbury         tated to proceed by the inward way and that in our preceding chapter we have built only on such foundations as are taken from our very perceptions fancys appearances affections and opinions themselves without regard to any thing of an exterior world and even on the supposition that there is no such world in being such has been our late dry task no wonder if it carrys indeed a meagre and raw appearance it may be lookd on in philosophy as worse than a mere egyptian imposition for to make brick without straw or stubble is perhaps an easier labour than to prove morals without a world and establish a conduct of life without the supposition of any thing living or extant besides our immediate fancy and world of imagination but having finished this mysterious work we come now to open day and sunshine and as a poet perhaps might express himself we are now ready to quit   the dubious labyrinths and pyrrhonean cells   of a cimmerian darkness—— we are henceforward to trust our eyes and take for real the whole creation and shaftesbury          the fair forms which lie before us we are to believe the anatomy of our own body and in proportionable order the shapes forms habits and constitutions of other animalraces without demurring on the profound modern hypothesis of animal insensibility we are to believe firmly and resolutely that other creatures have their sense and feeling their mere passions   0 and affections as well as ourselves and in this manner we proceed accordingly on our authors scheme to inquire what is truly natural to each creature and whether that which is natural to each and is its perfection be not withal its happiness or good to deny there is any thing properly natural after the concessions already made woud be undoubtedly very preposterous and absurd nature and the outward world being ownd existent the rest must of necessity follow the anatomy of bodys the order of the spheres the proper mechanisms of a thousand kinds and the infinite ends and sutable means establishd in the general constitution and order of things all this being once admitted and allowd to pass as certain and unquestionable tis as vain afterwards to except against the phrase of natural and unnatural and question the propriety shaftesbury          of this speech applyd to the particular forms and beings in the world as it woud be to except against the common appellations of vigour and decay in plants health or sickness in bodys sobriety or distraction in minds prosperity or degeneracy in any variable part of the known creation we may perhaps for humour sake or after the known way of disputant hostility in the support of any odd hypothesis pretend to deny this natural and unnatural in things tis evident however that tho our humour or taste be by such affectation ever so much depravd we cannot resist our natural anticipation     in behalf of shaftesbury          nature according to whose supposd standard we perpetually approve and disapprove and to whom in all natural appearances all moral actions whatever     we contemplate whatever we have in de shaftesbury         bate we inevitably appeal and pay our constant homage with the most apparent zeal and passion tis here above all other places that we say with strict justice you may turn out nature with a pitchfork yet back she will keep coming the airy gentlemen who have never had it in their thoughts to study nature in their own species but being taken with other loves have applyd their parts and genius to the same study in a horse a dog a gamecock a hawk or any other †animal of that degree know very well that to each species there belongs a several humour temper and turn of inward disposition as real and peculiar as the figure and outward shape which is with so much curiosity beheld and admird if there be any thing ever so little amiss or wrong in the inward frame the humour or temper of the creature tis readily calld vicious and when more than ordinarily wrong unnatural the humours of the creatures in order to their redress are attentively observd sometimes indulgd and flatterd shaftesbury          at other times contrould and checkd with proper severitys in short their affections passions appetites and antipathys are as duly regarded as those in human kind under the strictest discipline of education such is the sense of inward proportion and regularity of affections even in our noble youths themselves who in this respect are often known expert and able masters of education tho not so susceptible of discipline and culture in their own case after those early indulgences to which their greatness has intitled em as little favourable however as these sportly gentlemen are presumd     to show themselves towards the care or culture of their own species as remote as their contemplations are thought to lie from nature and philosophy they confirm plainly and establish our philosophical foundation of the natural ranks orders interior and exterior proportions of the several distinct species and forms of animal beings ask one of these gentlemen unawares when sollicitously careful and busyd in the great concerns of his stable or kennel whether his hound or greyhoundbitch who eats her puppys is as natural as the other who nurses em and he will think you frantick ask him again whether he shaftesbury          thinks the unnatural creature who acts thus or the naturalone who does otherwise is best in its kind and enjoys itself the most and he will be inclind to think still as strangely of you or if perhaps he esteems you worthy of better information he will tell you that his bestbred creatures and of the truest race are ever the noblest and most generous in their natures that it is this chiefly which makes the difference between the horse of good blood and the errant jade of a base breed between the gamecock and the dunghilcraven between the true hawk and the mere kite or buzzard and between the right mastiff hound or spaniel and the very mungrel he might withal tell you perhaps with a masterly air in this brutescience that the timorous poorspirited lazy and gluttonous of his dogs were those whom he either suspected to be of a spurious race or who had been by some accident spoild in their nursing and management for that this was not natural to em that in every kind they were still the miserablest creatures who were thus spoild and that having each of em their proper chace or business if they lay resty and out of their game chamberd and idle they were the same as if taken out of their element that the saddest curs shaftesbury          in the world were those who took the kitchinchimney and drippingpan for their delight and that the only happy dog were one to be a dog onesself was he who in his proper sport and exercise his natural pursuit and game endurd all hardships and had so much delight in exercise and in the field as to forget home and his reward     thus the natural habits and affections of the inferior creatures are known and their unnatural and degenerate part discoverd depravity and corruption is acknowledgd as real in their affections as when any thing is mishapen wrong or monstrous in their outward make and notwithstanding much of this inward depravity is discoverable in the creatures tamd by man and for his service or pleasure merely turnd from their natural course into a contrary life and habit notwithstanding that by this means the creatures who naturally herd with one another lose their associating humour and they who naturally pair and are constant to each other lose their kind of conjugal alliance and affection yet when releasd from human servitude and returnd again to their natural wilds and rural liberty they instantly resume their natural and regular habits such as are conducing shaftesbury       0  to the increase and prosperity of their own species well it is perhaps for mankind that tho there are so many animals who naturally herd for companys sake and mutual affection there are so few who for conveniency and by necessity are obligd to a strict union and kind of confederate state the creatures who according to the oeconomy of their kind are obligd to make themselves habitations of defense against the seasons and other incidents they who in some parts of the year are deprivd of all subsistence and are therefore necessitated to accumulate in another and to provide withal for the safety of their collected stores are by their nature indeed as strictly joind and with as proper affections towards their publick and community as the looser kind of a more easy subsistence and support are united in what relates merely to their offspring and the propagation of their species of these thorowly associating and confederateanimals there are none i have ever heard of who in bulk or strength exceed the beaver the major part of these political animals and creatures of a joint stock are as inconsiderable as the race of ants or bees but had nature assignd such an oeconomy as this to so puissant an animal for instance as the elephant shaftesbury          and made him withal as prolifick as those smaller     creatures commonly are it might have gone hard perhaps with mankind and a single animal who by his proper might and prowess has often decided the fate of the greatest battels which have been fought by human race shoud he have grown up into a society with a genius for architecture and mechanicks proportionable to what we observe in those smaller creatures we shoud with all our invented machines have found it hard to dispute with him the dominion of the continent were we in a disinterested view or with somewhat less selfishness than ordinary to consider the oeconomys parts interests conditions and terms of life which nature has distributed and assignd to the several species of creatures round us we shoud not be apt to think ourselves so hardly dealt with but whether our lot in this respect be just or equal is not the question with us at present tis enough that we know there is certainly an assignment and distribution that each oeconomy or part so distributed is in itself uniform fixd and invariable and that if any thing in the creature be accidentally impaird if any thing in the inward form the disposition temper or affections be shaftesbury          contrary or unsutable to the distinct oeconomy or part the creature is wretched and unnatural the social or natural affections which our author considers as essential to the health wholeness or integrity of the particular creature are such as contribute to the welfare and prosperity of that whole or species to which he is by nature joind all the affections of this kind our author comprehends in that single name of natural but as the design or end of nature in each animalsystem is exhibited chiefly in the support and propagation of the particular species it happens of consequence that those affections of earliest alliance and mutual kindness between the parent and the offspring are known more particularly by the name of natural affection however since it is evident that all defect or     depravity of affection which counterworks or opposes the original constitution and oeconomy of the creature is unnatural it follows that in creatures who by their particular oeconomy are fitted to the strictest society and rule of common good the most unnatural of all affections are those which separate from this community and the most shaftesbury          truly natural generous and noble are those which tend towards publick service and the interest of the society at large this is the main problem which our author in more philosophical terms demonstrates in this treatise that for a creature whose natural end is society to operate as is by nature appointed him towards the good of such his society or whole is in reality to pursue his own natural and proper good and that to operate contrarywise or by such affections as sever from that common good or publick interest is in reality to work towards his own natural and proper ill now if man as has been provd be justly rankd in the number of those creatures whose oeconomy is according to a jointstock and publickweal if it be understood withal that the only state of his affections which answers rightly to this publickweal is the regular orderly or virtuous state it necessarily follows that virtue is his natural good and vice his misery and ill as for that further consideration whether nature has orderly and justly distributed the several oeconomys shaftesbury          or parts and whether the defects failures or calamitys of particular systems are to the advantage of all in general and contribute to the perfection of the one common and universal system we must refer to our authors profounder speculations in this his inquiry and in his following philosophick dialogue but if what he advances in this respect be real or at least the most probable by far of any scheme or representation which can be made of the universal nature and cause of things it will follow that since man has     been so constituted by means of his rational part as to be conscious of this his more immediate relation to the universal system and principle of order and intelligence he is not only by nature sociable within the limits of his own species or kind but in a yet more generous and extensive manner he is not only born to virtue friendship honesty and faith but to religion piety adoration and a generous surrender of his mind to whatever happens from that supreme cause or order of things which he acknowledges intirely just and perfect shaftesbury         these are our authors formal and grave sentiments which if they were not truly his and sincerely espousd by him as the real result of his best judgment and understanding he woud be guilty of a more than common degree of imposture for according to his own †rule an affected gravity and feignd seriousness carryd on thro any subject in such a manner as to leave no insight into the fiction or intended raillery is in truth no raillery or wit at all but a gross immoral and illiberal way of abuse foreign to the character of a good writer a gentleman or man of worth but since we have thus acquitted ourselves of that serious part of which our reader was beforehand well apprizd let him now expect us again in our original miscellaneous manner and capacity tis here as has been explaind to him that raillery and humour are permitted and flights sallys and excursions of every kind are found agreeable and requisite without this there might be less safety found perhaps in thinking every light reflection might run us up to the dangerous state of meditation shaftesbury          and in reality profound thinking is many times the cause of shallow thought to prevent this contemplative habit and character of which we see so little good effect in the world we have reason     perhaps to be fond of the diverting manner in writing and discourse especially if the subject be of a solemn kind there is more need in this case to interrupt the longspun thred of reasoning and bring into the mind by many different glances and broken views what cannot so easily be introducd by one steddy bent or continud stretch of sight shaftesbury             miscellany v chap   chapter i ceremonial adjusted between author and reader—affectation of precedency in the former—various claim to inspiration—bards prophets sibylline scripture—written oracles in verse and prose—common interest of antient letters and christianity—state of wit elegance and correctness—poetick truth—preparation for criticism on our author in his concluding treatise of all the artificial relations formd between mankind the most capricious and variable is that of author and reader our author for his part has declard his opinion of this shaftesbury          where he gives his advice to modern authors and tho he supposes that every author in form is in respect of the particular matter he explains superior in understanding to his reader yet he allows not that any author shoud assume the upper hand or pretend to withdraw himself from that necessary subjection to foreign judgment and criticism which must determine the place of honour on the readers side tis evident that an authors art and labour are for his readers sake alone tis to his reader he makes his application if not openly and avowedly yet at least with implicit courtship poets indeed and especially those of a modern kind have a peculiar manner of treating this affair with a high hand they pretend to set themselves above mankind their pens are sacred their style and utterance divine they write often as in a language foreign   0 to human kind and woud disdain to be reminded of those poor elements of speech their alphabet and grammar but here inferior mortals presume often to intercept their flight and remind them of their fallible and human part shaftesbury          had those first poets who began this pretence to inspiration been taught a manner of communicating their rapturous thoughts and high ideas by some other medium than that of style and language the case might have stood otherwise but the inspiring divinity or muse having in the explanation of herself submitted her wit and sense to the mechanick rules of human arbitrary composition she must in consequence and by necessity submit herself to human arbitration and the judgment of the literate world and thus the reader is still superior and keeps the upper hand tis indeed no small absurdity to assert a work or treatise written in human language to be above human criticism or censure for if the art of writing be from the grammatical rules of human invention and determination if even these rules are formd on casual practice and various use there can be no scripture but what must of necessity be subject to the readers narrow scrutiny and strict judgment unless a language and grammar different from any of human structure were deliverd down from heaven and miraculously accommodated to human service and capacity shaftesbury       0 tis no otherwise in the grammatical art of characters and painted speech than in the art of painting itself i have seen in certain christian churches an antient piece or two affirmd on the solemn faith of priestly tradition to have been angelically and divinely wrought by a supernatural hand and sacred pencil had the piece happend to be of a hand like raphaels i coud have found nothing certain to oppose to this tradition but having observd the whole style and manner of the pretended heavenly workmanship to be so indifferent as to vary in many particulars from the truth of art i presumd within myself to beg pardon of the tradition and assert confidently that if the pencil had been heavenguided it coud never have been so lame in its performance     it being a mere contradiction to all divine and moral truth that a celestial hand submitting itself to the rudiments of a human art shoud sin against the art itself and express falshood and error instead of justness and proportion it may be alledgd perhaps that there are however certain authors in the world who tho of themselves they neither boldly claim the privilege shaftesbury          of divine inspiration nor carry indeed the least resemblance of perfection in their style or composition yet they subdue the reader gain the ascendent over his thought and judgment and force from him a certain implicit veneration and esteem to this i can only answer that if there be neither spell nor inchantment in the case this can plainly be no other than mere enthusiasm except perhaps where the supreme powers have given their sanction to any religious record or pious writ and in this case indeed it becomes immoral and profane in any one to deny absolutely or dispute the sacred authority of the least line or syllable containd in it but shoud the record instead of being single short and uniform appear to be multifarious voluminous and of the most difficult interpretation it woud be somewhat hard if not wholly impracticable in the magistrate to suffer this record to be universally current and at the same time prevent its being variously apprehended and descanted on by the several differing geniuss and contrary judgments of mankind tis remarkable that in the politest of all nations the writings lookd upon as most sacred were those of their great poets whose works indeed were truly divine in respect of art and the per shaftesbury         fection of their frame and composition but there was yet more divinity ascribd to them than what is comprehended in this latter sense the notions of vulgar religion were built on their miraculous narrations the wiser and better sort themselves paid a regard to them in this respect tho they interpreted them indeed more allegorically even the philosophers who criticizd em with most severity     were not their least admirers when they ascribd to em that divine inspiration or sublime enthusiasm of which our author has largely treated †elsewhere it woud indeed ill become any pretender to divine writing to publish his work under a character of divinity if after all his endeavours he came short of a consummate and just performance in this respect the cumean sibyl was not so indiscreet or frantick as she might appear perhaps by writing her prophetick warnings and pretended inspirations upon jointleaves which immediately after their elaborate superscription were torn in pieces and scatterd by the wind shaftesbury         ‡you will see an inspired prophetess who chants destiny at the foot of her rock and entrusts her marks and words to leaves whatever lines the maid has written on the leaves she sorts into order and shuts them within her cave there they remain unmoved nor shift from their order yet when the hinge turns and a breath of wind has stirred them and the door has disordered the light leaves never thereafter does she trouble to capture them as they flutter in her cavern or to restore their order or join the leaves away men go without advice and hate the sibyls home twas impossible to disprove the divinity of such writings whilst they coud be perusd only in fragments had the sisterpriestess of delphos who deliverd herself in audible plain metre been     found at any time to have transgressd the rule of verse it woud have been difficult in those days to father the lame poetry upon apollo himself but where the invention of the leaves prevented the reading of a single line intire whatever in shaftesbury         terpretations might have been made of this fragil and volatil scripture no imperfection coud be chargd on the original text itself what those volumes may have been which the disdainful sibyl or prophetess committed to the flames or what the remainder was which the roman prince receivd and consecrated i will not pretend to judg tho it has been admitted for truth by the antient christian fathers that these writings were so far sacred and divine as to have prophesyd of the birth of our religious founder and bore testimony to that holy writ which has preservd his memory and is justly held in the highest degree sacred among christians the policy however of old rome was such as not absolutely to rest the authority of their religion on any composition of literature the sibylline volumes were kept safely lockd and inspected only by such as were ordaind or deputed for that purpose and in this po shaftesbury         licy the new rome has followd their example in scrupling to annex the supreme authority and sacred character of infallibility to scripture itself and in refusing to submit that scripture to publick judgment or to any eye or ear but what they qualify for the inspection of such sacred mysterys the mahometan clergy seem to have a different policy they boldly rest the foundation of their religion on a book such a one as according to their pretension is not only perfect but inimitable were a real man of letters and a just critick permitted to examine this scripture by the known rules of art he woud soon     perhaps refute this plea but so barbarous is the accompanying policy and temper of these eastern religionists that they discourage and in effect extinguish all true learning science and the politer arts in company with the antient authors and languages which they set aside and by this infallible method leave their sacred writ the sole standard of literate performance for being compard to nothing besides itself or what is of an inferior kind it must undoubtedly be thought incomparable twill be yielded surely to the honour of the christian world that their shaftesbury          faith especially that of the protestant churches stands on a more generous foundation they not only allow comparison of authors but are content to derive their proofs of the validity of their sacred record and revelation even from those authors calld profane as being well apprizd according to the maxim of our divine master that in what we bear witness only to ourselves our witness cannot be establishd as a truth so that there being at present no immediate testimony of miracle or sign in behalf of holy writ and there being in its own particular composition or style nothing miraculous or selfconvincing if the collateral testimony of other antient records historians and foreign authors were destroyd or wholly lost there woud be less argument or plea remaining against that natural suspicion of those who are calld sceptical that the holy records themselves were no other than the pure invention or artificial compilement of an interested party in behalf of the richest corporation and most profitable monopoly which coud be erected in the world thus in reality the interest of our pious clergy is necessarily joind with that of antient letters and polite learning shaftesbury          by this they perpetually refute the crafty arguments of those objectors when they abandon this they resign their cause when they strike at it they strike even at the root and foundation of our holy faith and weaken that pillar on which the whole fabrick of our religion depends it belongs to mere enthusiasts and fanaticks to plead the sufficiency     of a reiterate translated text derivd to em thro so many channels and subjected to so many variations of which they are wholly ignorant yet woud they persuade us it seems that from hence alone they can recognize the divine spirit and receive it in themselves unsubject as they imagine to any rule and superior to what they themselves often call the dead letter and unprofitable science—this any one may see is building castles in the air and demolishing them again at pleasure as the exercise of an aerial fancy or heated imagination but the judicious divines of the establishd christian churches have sufficiently condemnd this manner they are far from resting their religion on the common aspect or obvious form of their vulgar bible as it presents itself in the printed copy or modern version neither do they in the original itself represent it to shaftesbury          us as a very masterpiece of writing or as absolutely perfect in the purity and justness either of style or composition they allow the holy authors to have written according to their best facultys and the strength of their natural genius a shepherd like a shepherd and a prince like a prince a man of reading and advancd in letters like a proficient in the kind and a man of meaner capacity and reading like one of the ordinary sort in his own common idiom and imperfect manner of narration tis the substance only of the narrative and the principal facts confirming the authority of the revelation which our divines think themselves concernd to prove according to the best evidence of which the matter itself is capable and whilst the sacred authors themselves allude not only to the annals and historys of the heathen world but even to the philosophical works the regular poems the very plays and †comedys of the learn shaftesbury         ed and polite antients it must be ownd that as those antient writings     are impaird or lost not only the light and clearness of holy writ but even the evidence itself of its main facts must in proportion be diminishd and brought in question so ill advisd were those     devout churchmen heretofore who in the height of shaftesbury       0  zeal did their utmost to destroy all footsteps of heathen literature and consequently all further use of learning or antiquity     but happily the zeal of this kind is now left as proper only to those despisd shaftesbury          and ignorant modern enthusiasts we have describd the roman church itself is so recoverd from this primitive fanaticism that their great men and even their pontiffs are found ready to give their helping hand and confer their bounty liberally towards the advancement of all antient and polite learning they justly observe that their very traditions stand in need of some collateral proof the shaftesbury          conservation of these other antient and disinterested authors they wisely judg essential to the credibility of those principal facts on which the whole religious history and tradition depend twoud indeed be in vain for us to bring a pontius pilate into our creed and recite what happend under him in judea if we knew not under whom he himself governd whose authority he had or what character he bore in that remote country and amidst a foreign people in the same manner twoud be in vain for a roman pontiff to derive his title to spiritual sovereignty from the seat influence power and donation of the roman caesars and their successors if it appeard not by any history or collateral testimony who the first caesars were and how they came possessd of that universal power and long residence of dominion my reader doubtless by this time must begin to wonder thro what labyrinth of speculation and odd texture of capricious reflections i am offering to conduct him but he will not i presume be altogether displeasd with me when i give him to understand that being now come into my last miscellany and shaftesbury          being sensible of the little courtship i have paid him comparatively     with what is practisd in that kind by other modern authors i am willing by way of compensation to express my loyalty or homage towards him and shew by my natural sentiments and principles what particular deference and high respect i think to be his due the issue therefore of this long deduction is in the first place with due compliments in my capacity of author and in the name of all modest workmen willingly joining with me in this representation to congratulate our english reader on the establishment of what is so advantageous to himself i mean that mutual relation between him and ourselves which naturally turns so much to his advantage and makes us to be in reality the subservient party and in this respect tis to be hopd he will long enjoy his just superiority and privilege over his humble servants who compose and labour for his sake the relation in all likelihood must still continue and be improvd our common religion and christianity founded on letters and scripture promises thus much nor is this hope likely to fail us whilst readers are really allowd the liberty to read that is to say to examine construe and remark with un shaftesbury         derstanding learning and science must of necessity flourish whilst the language of the wisest and most learned of nations is acknowledgd to contain the principal and essential part of our holy revelation and criticism examinations judgments literate labours and inquirys must still be in repute and practice whilst antient authors so necessary to the support of the sacred volumes are in request and afford imployment of such infinite extent to us moderns of whatever degree who are desirous to signalize ourselves by any atchievement in letters and be considerd as the investigators of knowledg and politeness i may undoubtedly by virtue of my preceding argument in behalf of criticism be allowd without suspicion of flattery or mere courtship to assert the readers privilege above the author and assign to him as i have done the upper hand and place of honour as to fact we know for certain that the greatest of philosophers the very founder of philosophy itself was no author nor   0 did the divine author and founder of our religion condescend to be an author in this other respect he who coud best have given us the history of his own life with the intire sermons and divine discourses which he made in publick was pleasd to leave it shaftesbury          to others to take in hand as there were many it seems long afterwards who did and undertook accordingly to write in order and as seemd good to them for the better information of particular persons what was then believd among shaftesbury          the initiated or catechizd from tradition and early instruction in their youth or what had been transmitted by report from such as were the presumd auditors and eyewitnesses of those things in former time whether those sacred books ascribd to the divine legislator of     the jews and which treat of his death burial and succession as well as of his life and actions are strictly to be understood as coming from the immediate pen of that holy founder or rather from some other inspird hand guided by the same influencing spirit i will not presume so much as to examine or enquire but in general we find that both as to publick concerns in religion and in philosophy the great and eminent actors were of a rank superior to the writingworthys the great athenian legislator tho noted as a poetical genius cannot be esteemd an author for the sake of some few verses he may occasionally have made nor was the great spartan founder a poet himself tho author or redeemer if i may so express it to the greatest and best of poets who owd in a manner his form and being to the accurate searches and collections of that great shaftesbury          patron the politicians and civil sages who were fitted in all respects for the great scene of business coud not it seems be well taken out of it to attend the slender and minute affairs of letters and scholastick science tis true indeed that without a capacity for action and a knowledg of the world and mankind there can be no author naturally qualifyd to write with dignity or execute any noble or great design but there are many who with the highest capacity for business are by their fortune denyd the privilege of that higher sphere as there are others who having once movd in it have been afterwards by many impediments and obstructions necessitated to retire and exert their genius in this lower degree tis to some catastrophe of this kind that we owe the noblest historians even the two princes and fathers of history as well as the greatest philosophical writers the founder of the academy and others who were also noble in respect of their birth and fitted for the highest stations in the publick but discouragd from engaging in it on account of some misfortunes experiencd either in their own persons or that of their near friends shaftesbury         tis to the early banishment and long retirement of a heroick     youth out of his native country that we owe an original system of works the politest wisest usefullest and to those who can understand the divineness of a just simplicity the most amiable and even the most elevating and exalting of all uninspird and merely human authors to this fortune we owe some of the greatest of the antient poets twas this chance which producd the muse of an exalted grecian †lyrick and of his follower ‡horace whose character tho easy to be gatherd from history and his own works is little observd by any of his commentators the general idea conceivd of him being drawn chiefly from his precarious and low circumstances at court after the forfeiture of his estate under the usurpation and con shaftesbury         quest of an octavius and the ministry of a maecenas not from his better condition and nobler employments in earlier days under the favour and friendship of greater and better men whilst the roman state and liberty subsisted for of this change he himself as great a courtier as he seemd afterwards gives sufficient intimation shaftesbury       0     let authors therefore know themselves and tho conscious of worth virtue and a genius such as may justly place them above flattery or mean courtship to their reader yet let them reflect     that as authors merely they are but of the second rank of men and let the reader withal consider that when he unworthily resigns the place of honour and surrenders his taste or judgment to an author of ever so great a name or venerable antiquity and not to reason and truth at whatever ha shaftesbury         zard he not only betrays himself but withal the common cause of author and reader the interest of letters and knowledg and the chief liberty privilege and prerogative of the rational part of mankind tis related in history of the cappadocians that being offerd their liberty by the romans and permitted to govern themselves by their own laws and constitutions they were much terrifyd at the proposal and as if some sore harm had been intended em humbly made it their request that they might be governd by arbitrary power and that an absolute governour might without delay be appointed over em at the discretion of the romans for such was their disposition towards mere slavery and subjection that they dard not pretend so much as to chuse their own master so essential they thought slavery and so divine a thing the right of mastership that they dard not be so free even as to presume to give themselves that blessing which they chose to     leave rather to providence fortune or a conqueror to bestow upon them they dard not make a king but woud rather take one from their powerful neighbours had they been necessitated to come to an election the horror of such a use of shaftesbury          liberty in government woud perhaps have determind em to chuse blindfold or leave it to the decision of the commonest lot cast of dye cross or pile or whatever it were which might best enable them to clear themselves of the heinous charge of using the least foresight choice or prudence in such an affair i shoud think it a great misfortune were my reader of the number of those who in a kind of cappadocian spirit coud easily be terrifyd with the proposal of giving him his liberty and making him his own judg my endeavour i must confess has been to shew him his just prerogative in this respect and to give him the sharpest eye over his author invite him to criticize honestly without favour or affection and with the utmost bent of his parts and judgment on this account it may be objected to me perhaps that i am not a little vain and presumptuous in my own as well as in my authors behalf who can thus as it were challenge my reader to a trial of his keenest wit but to this i answer that shoud i have the good fortune to raise the masterly spirit of just criticism in my readers and exalt them ever so little above shaftesbury          the lazy timorous overmodest or resignd state in which the generality of them remain tho by this very spirit i myself might possibly meet my doom i shoud however abundantly congratulate with myself on these my low flights be proud of having plumd the arrows of better wits and furnishd artillery or ammunition of any kind to those powers to which i myself had falln a victim i will play the part of a whetstone i coud reconcile my ambition in this respect to what i call my loyalty to the reader and say of his elevation in criticism and     judgment what a roman princess said of her sons advancement to empire let him kill me so long as he comes to the throne had i been a spanish cervantes and with success equal to that comick author had destroyd the reigning taste of gothick or moorish chivalry i coud afterwards contentedly have seen my burlesquework itself despisd and set aside when it had wrought its intended effect and destroyd those giants and monsters of the brain against which it was originally designd without regard therefore to the prevailing relish or taste which in shaftesbury          my own person i may unhappily experience when these my miscellaneous works are leisurely examind i shall proceed still in my endeavour to refine my readers palate whetting and sharpening it the best i can for use and practice in the lower subjects that by this exercise it may acquire the greater keenness and be of so much the better effect in subjects of a higher kind which relate to his chief happiness his liberty and manhood supposing me therefore a mere comick humourist in respect of those inferior subjects which after the manner of my familiar prosesatir i presume to criticize may not i be allowd to ask whether there remains not still among us noble britons something of that original barbarous and gothick relish not wholly purgd away when even at this hour romances and gallantrys of like sort together with works as monstrous of other kinds are current and in vogue even with the people who constitute our reputed polite world need i on this account refer again to our †author where he treats in general of the style and manner of our modern authors from the divine to the comedian what person is there of the shaftesbury          least judgment or understanding who cannot easily and without the help of a divine or rigid moralist observe the lame condition of our english stage which nevertheless is found the rendevouz and chief entertainment of our best company     and from whence in all probability our youth will continue to draw their notion of manners and their taste of life more directly and naturally than from the rehearsals and declamations of a graver theater let those whose business it is advance as they best can the benefit of that sacred oratory which we have lately seen and are still like to see employd to various purposes and further designs than that of instructing us in religion or manners let em in that high scene endeavour to refine our taste and judgment in sacred matters tis the good criticks task to amend our common stage nor ought this dramatick performance to be decryd or sentencd by those criticks of a higher sphere the practice and art is honest in itself our foundations are well laid and in the main our english stage as has been remarkd is capable of the highest improvement as well from the present genius of our nation as from the rich oar shaftesbury          of our early poets in this kind but faults are easier imitated than beautys we find indeed our theater become of late the subject of a growing criticism we hear it openly complaind that in our newer plays as well as in our older in comedy as well as tragedy the stage presents a proper scene of uproar—duels fought swords drawn many of a side wounds given and sometimes dressd too the surgeon calld and the patient probd and tented upon the spot that in our tragedy nothing is so common as wheels racks and gibbets properly adornd executions decently performd headless bodys and bodiless heads exposd to view battels fought murders committed and the dead carryd off in great numbers—such is our politeness nor are these plays on this account the less frequented by either of the sexes which inclines me to favour the conceit our †author has suggested concerning the mutual correspondence and relation between our royal theater and popular circus or beargarden     for in the former of these assemblys tis undeniable that at least the two upper regions or gallerys shaftesbury          contain such spectators as indifferently frequent each place of sport so that tis no wonder we hear such applause resounded on the victorys of an almanzor when the same partys had possibly no later than the day before bestowd their applause as freely on the victorious butcher the hero of another stage where amidst various frays bestial and human blood promiscuous wounds and slaughter one sex are observd as frequent and as pleasd spectators as the other and sometimes not spectators only but actors in the gladiatorian parts—these congregations which we may be apt to call heathenish tho in reality never known among the politer heathens are in our christian nation unconcernedly allowd and tolerated as no way injurious to religious interests whatever effect they may be found to have on national manners humanity and civil life of such indulgencys as these we hear no complaints nor are any assemblys tho of the most barbarous and enormous kind so offensive it seems to men of zeal as religious assemblys of a different fashion or habit from their own i am sorry to say that tho in the many parts of poetry our attempts have been high and noble yet in general the shaftesbury          taste of wit and letters lies much upon a level with what relates to our stage i can readily allow to our british genius what was allowd to the roman heretofore †by nature full of elevation and passion for he has tragic inspiration enough and happy boldness but then i must add too that the excessive indulgence and favour shown to our authors on account of what their mere genius and flowing vein afford has renderd them intolerably supine conceited     and admirers of themselves the publick having once sufferd em to take the ascendent they become like flatterd princes impatient of contradiction or advice they think it a disgrace to be criticizd even by a friend or to reform at his desire what they themselves are fully convincd is negligent and uncorrect       wanted or forgot   the last and greatest art the art to blot the †limae labor is the great grievance with our countrymen an english author woud be all genius he woud shaftesbury          reap the fruits of art but without study pains or application he thinks it necessary indeed lest his learning shoud be calld in question to show the world that he errs knowingly against the rules of art and for this reason whatever piece he publishes at any time he seldom fails in some prefixd apology to speak in such a manner of criticism and art as may confound the ordinary reader and prevent him from taking up a part which shoud he once assume woud prove fatal to the impotent and mean performance twere to be wishd that when once our authors had considerd of a model or plan and attaind the knowledg of a ‡whole and   0 parts when from this shaftesbury       0  beginning they had proceeded to morals and the knowledg of what is calld poetick manners and     truth when they had learnt to reject false thought embarassing and mixd metaphors the ridiculous paint in comedy shaftesbury             and the false sublime and bombast in heroick they woud at last have some regard     to numbers harmony and an shaftesbury          ear and correct as far as possible the harsh sounds of our language in poetry at least if not in prose but so much are our british poets taken up in seeking out that monstrous ornament which we call †rhyme that tis shaftesbury          no wonder     if other ornaments and real graces are unthought of and left unattempted however since in some parts of poetry especially in the dramatick we have been so happy as to triumph over this barbarous taste tis unaccountable that our poets who from this privilege ought to undertake some further refinements shoud remain still upon the same level as before tis a shame to our authors that in their elegant style and metred prose there shoud not be found a peculiar grace and harmony resulting from a more natural and easy disengagement of their periods and from a careful avoiding the encounter of the shocking consonants and jarring sounds to which our language is so unfortunately subject they have of late tis true reformd in some measure the gouty joints and shaftesbury          darningwork of whereuntos wherebys thereofs therewiths and the rest of this kind by which complicated periods are so curiously strung or hookd on one to another after the longspun manner of the bar or pulpit but to take into consideration     no real accent or cadency of words no sound or measure of syllables to put together at one time a set of compounds of the longest greek or latin termination and at another to let whole verses and those too of our heroick and longest sort pass currently in monosyllables is methinks no slender negligence if single verses at the head or in the most emphatical places of the most considerable works can admit of such a structure and pass for truly harmonious and poetical in this negligent form i see no reason why more verses than one or two of the same formation shoud not be as well admitted or why an uninterrupted succession of these wellstrung monosyllables might not be allowd to clatter after one another like the hammers of a papermill without any breach of musick or prejudice to the harmony of our language but if persons who have gone no farther than a smiths anvil to gain an ear are yet likely on fair trial to find a plain defect in these tenmonosyllable heroicks it woud follow methinks that even a proseauthor who attempts to write politely shaftesbury          shoud endeavour to confine himself within those bounds which can never without breach of harmony be exceeded in any just metre or agreeable pronunciation thus have i venturd to arraign the authority of those selfprivilegd writers who woud exempt themselves from criticism and save their illacquird reputation by the decrial of an art on which the cause and interest of wit and letters absolutely depend be it they themselves or their great patrons in their behalf who woud thus arbitrarily support the credit of ill writings the attempt i hope will prove unsuccessful be they moderns or antients foreigners or natives ponderous and austere writers or airy and of the humorous kind whoever takes refuge here or seeks protection hence whoever joins his party or interest to this cause it appears from the very fact and endeavour alone that there is just ground to suspect some insufficiency or imposture at the bottom and on this account the reader if he be wise will     the rather redouble his application and industry to examine the merit of his assuming author if as reader and judg he dares once assert that liberty to which we have shewn him justly intitled he will not easily be threatend or ridiculd out of shaftesbury          the use of his examining capacity and native privilege of criticism twas to this art so well understood and practisd heretofore that the wise antients owd whatever was consummate and perfect in their productions tis to the same art we owe the recovery of letters in these latter ages to this alone we must ascribe the recognition of antient manuscripts the discovery of what is spurious and the discernment of whatever is genuine of those venerable remains which have passd thro such dark periods of ignorance and raisd us to the improvements we now make in every science tis to this art that even the sacred authors themselves owe their highest purity and correctness so sacred ought the art itself to be esteemd when from its supplies alone is formd that judicious and learned strength by which the defenders of our holy religion are able so successfully to refute the heathens jews sectarians hereticks and other enemys or opposers of our primitive and antient faith but having thus after our authors example asserted the use of criticism in all literate works from the main frame or plan of every writing down to the minutest particle we may now proceed to exercise this art upon our author himself shaftesbury          and by his own rules examine him in this his last treatise reserving still to ourselves the same privilege of variation and excursion into other subjects the same episodick liberty and right of wandering which we have maintaind in the preceding chapters shaftesbury             chap   chapter ii generation and succession of our national and modern wit—manners of the proprietors—corporation and jointstock—statute against criticism a coffeehouse committee—mr bays—other bayss in divinity—censure of our authors dialoguepiece and of the manner of dialoguewriting usd by reverend wits according to the common course of practice in our age we seldom see the character of writer and that of critick united in the same person there is i know a certain species of authors who subsist wholly by the criticizing or commenting practice upon others and can appear in no other form besides what this employment authorizes them to assume they have no original character or first part but wait for something which may be calld a work in order to graft upon it and come in for sharers at second hand shaftesbury       0 the penmen of this capacity and degree are from their function and employment distinguishd by the title of answerers for it happens in the world that there are readers of a genius and size just fitted to these answering authors these if they teach em nothing else will teach em they think to criticize and tho the new practising criticks are of a sort unlikely ever to understand any original book or writing they can understand or at least remember and quote the subsequent reflections flouts and jeers which may accidentally be made on such a piece whereever a gentleman of this sort happens at any time to be in company you shall no sooner hear a new book spoken of than twill be askd who has answerd it or when is there an answer to come out—now the answer as our gentleman knows must needs be newer than the book and the newer a thing is the more fashionable still and the genteeler the subject of discourse for this the bookseller knows how to fit our gentleman to a nicety for he has commonly     an answer ready bespoke and perhaps finishd by the time his new book comes abroad and tis odds but our fashionable gentleman who takes both together may read the latter first and drop the other for good and all shaftesbury         but of these answering wits and the manner of rejoinders and reiterate replies we have said what is sufficient in a former miscellany we need only remark in general that tis necessary a writing critick shoud understand how to write and tho every writer is not bound to shew himself in the capacity of critick every writing critick is bound to shew himself capable of being a writer for if he be apparently impotent in this latter kind he is to be denyd all title or character in the other to censure merely what another person writes to twitch snap snub up or banter to torture sentences and phrases turn a few expressions into ridicule or write what is nowadays calld an answer to any piece is not sufficient to constitute what is properly esteemd a writer or author in due form for this reason tho there are many answerers seen abroad there are few or no criticks or satirists but whatever may be the state of controversy in our religion or politick concerns tis certain that in the mere literate world affairs are managd with a better understanding between the shaftesbury          principal partys concernd the writers or authors in possession have an easier time than any ministry or religious party which is uppermost they have found a way by decrying all criticism in general to get rid of their dissenters and prevent all pretences to further reformation in their state the critick is made to appear distinct and of another species wholly different from the writer none who have a genius for writing and can perform with any success are presumd so illnaturd or illiberal as to endeavour to signalize themselves in criticism tis not difficult however to imagine why this practical difference between writer and critick has been so generally establishd     amongst us as to make the provinces seem wholly distinct and irreconcilable the forward wits who without waiting their due time or performing their requisite studys start up in the world as authors having with little pains or judgment and by the strength of fancy merely acquird a name with mankind can on no account afterwards submit to a decrial or disparagement of those raw works to which they owd their early character and distinction ill woud it fare with em indeed if on these tenacious terms they shoud venture upon criti shaftesbury         cism or offer to move that spirit which woud infallibly give such disturbance to their establishd title now we may consider that in our nation and especially in our present age whilst wars debates and publick convulsions turn our minds so wholly upon business and affairs the better geniuss being in a manner necessarily involvd in the active sphere on which the general eye of mankind is so strongly fixt there must remain in the theatre of wit a sufficient vacancy of place and the quality of actor upon that stage must of consequence be very easily attainable and at a low price of ingenuity or understanding the persons therefore who are in possession of the prime parts in this deserted theatre being sufferd to maintain their ranks and stations in full ease have naturally a good agreement and understanding with their fellowwits being indebted to the times for this happiness that with so little industry or capacity they have been able to serve the nation with wit and supply the place of real dispensers and ministers of the muses treasures they must necessarily as they have any love for themselves or fatherly affection for their works conspire with one another to preserve their common interest of in shaftesbury         dolence and justify their remisness uncorrectness insipidness and downright ignorance of all literate art or just poetick beauty great is the unity of the effeminate     for this reason you see em mutually courteous and benevolent gracious and obliging beyond measure complimenting one another interchangeably at the head of their works in recommendatory verses or in separate panegyricks essays and fragments of poetry such as in the miscellaneous collections our yearly retail of wit we see curiously compacted and accommodated to the relish of the world here the tyrocinium of geniuss is annually displayd here if you think fit you may make acquaintance with the young offspring of wits as they come up gradually under the old with due courtship and homage paid to those high predecessors of fame in hope of being one day admitted by turn into the noble order and made wits by patent and authority this is the young fry which you may see busily surrounding the grown poet or chief playhouseauthor at a coffeehouse they are his guards ready to take up shaftesbury          arms for him if by some presumptuous critick he is at any time attackd they are indeed the very shadows of their immediate predecessor and represent the same features with some small alteration perhaps for the worse they are sure to aim at nothing above or beyond their master and woud on no account give him the least jealousy of their aspiring to any degree or order of writing above him from hence that harmony and reciprocal esteem which on such a bottom as this cannot fail of being perfectly well establishd among our poets the age mean while being after this manner hopefully provided and secure of a constant and like succession of meritorious wits in every kind if by chance a man of sense unapprizd of the authority of these high powers shoud venture to accost the gentlemen of this fraternity at some coffeehouse committee whilst they were taken up in mutual admiration and the usual praise of their national and cotemporary wits tis possible he might be treated with some civility whilst he inquird for satisfaction sake into the beautys of those particular works so unanimously extolld but shoud he presume to ask in general why is our epick or dramatick our essay or common prose no shaftesbury          better executed or why in particular   0 does such or such a reputed wit write so incorrectly and with so little regard to justness of thought or language the answer woud presently be given that we englishmen are not tyd up to such rigid rules as those of the antient grecian or modern french criticks be it so gentlemen tis your good pleasure nor ought any one to dispute it with you you are masters no doubt in your own country but gentlemen the question here is not what your authority may be over your own writers you may have them of what fashion or size of wit you please and allow them to entertain you at the rate you think sufficient and satisfactory but can you by your good pleasure or the approbation of your highest patrons make that to be either wit or sense which woud otherwise have been bombast and contradiction if your poets are still mr bayss and your proseauthors sir rogers shaftesbury          without offering at a better manner must it follow that the manner itself is     good or the wit genuine—what say you gentlemen to this new piece—let us examine these lines which you call shining this string of sentences which you call clever this pile of metaphors which you call sublime—are you unwilling gentlemen to stand the test do you despise the examination shaftesbury         sir—since you are pleasd to take this liberty with us may we presume to ask you a question o gentlemen as many as you please i shall be highly honourd why then pray sir inform us whether you have ever writ very often gentlemen especially on a postnight but have you writ for instance sir a play a song an essay or a paper as by way of eminence the current pieces of our weekly wits are generally styld something of this kind i may perhaps gentlemen have attempted tho without publishing my work but pray gentlemen what is my writing or not writing to the question in hand only this sir and you may fairly take our words for it that whenever you publish you will find the town against you your piece will infallibly be condemnd so let it but for what reason gentlemen i am sure you never saw the piece no sir but you are a critick and we know by certain experience that when a critick writes according to rule and method he is sure never to hit the english taste did not mr r—— who criticizd our english tragedy write a sorry one of his own if he did gentlemen shaftesbury          twas his own fault not to know his genius better but is his criticism the less just on this account if a musician performs his part well in the hardest symphonys he must necessarily know the notes and understand the rules of harmony and musick but must a man therefore who has an ear and has studyd the rules of musick of necessity have a voice or hand can no one possibly judg a fiddle but who is himself a fiddler can no one judg a picture but who is himself a layer of colours— thus far our rational gentleman perhaps might venture before his coffeehouse audience had i been at his elbow to prompt him as a friend i shoud hardly have thought fit to remind him of any thing further on the contrary i shoud have rather taken     him aside to inform him of this cabal and establishd corporation of wit of their declard aversion to criticism and of their known laws and statutes in that case made and provided i shoud have told him in short that learned arguments woud be mispent on such as these and that he woud find little success tho he shoud ever so plainly demonstrate to the gentlemen of this size of wit and understanding that the greatest masters of art in every kind of wri shaftesbury       0 ting were eminent in the critical practice but that they really were so witness among the antients their greatest philosophers whose critical pieces lie intermixt with their profound philosophical works and other politer tracts ornamentally writ †for publick use witness in history and rhetorick isocrates dionysius halicarnasseus plutarch and the corrupt lucian himself the only one perhaps of these authors whom our gentlemen may in some modern translation have lookd into with any curiosity or delight to these among the romans we may add cicero varro horace quintilian pliny and many more among the moderns a boileau and a corneille are sufficient precedents in the case before us they applyd their criticism with just severity even to their own works this indeed is a manner hardly practicable with the poets of our own nation it woud be unreasonable to expect of em that they shoud bring such measures in use as being applyd to their works woud disco shaftesbury         ver em to be wholly deformd and disproportionable tis no wonder therefore if we have so little of this critical genius extant to guide us in our taste tis no wonder if what is generally current in this kind lies in a manner buryd and in disguise under burlesque as particularly in the ‡witty comedy of a noble author of this last age to the shame however of our professd wits and enterprizers     in the higher spheres of poetry it may be observd that they have not wanted good advice and instruction of the graver kind from as high a hand in respect of quality and character since one of the justest of our modern poems and so confessd even by our poets themselves is a short criticism an art of poetry by which if they themselves were to be judgd they must in general appear no better than mere bunglers and void of all true sense and knowledg in their art but if in reality both critick and poet confessing the justice of these rules of art can afterwards in practice condemn and approve perform and judg in a quite different manner from what they acknowledg just and true it plainly shews that tho perhaps we are not indigent in wit we want what is of more shaftesbury          consequence and can alone raise wit to any dignity or worth even plain honesty manners and a sense of that moral truth on which as has been often expressd in these volumes poetick truth and beauty must naturally depend †the man who has learned what are his duties to his fatherland or to his friends what affection is due to a father a brother or a guest what is the duty of a senator what of a juryman    he to be sure knows how to find suitable language for each character as for this species of morality which distinguishes the civil offices of life and describes each becoming personage or character in this scene so necessary it is for the poet and polite author to be apprizd of it that even the divine himself may with juster pretence be exempted from the knowledg of this sort the composer     of religious discourses has the advantage of that higher scene of mystery which is above the level of human commerce tis not so much his concern or business to be shaftesbury          agreeable and often when he woud endeavour it he becomes more than ordinarily displeasing his theater and that of the polite world are very different insomuch that in a reverend author or declaimer of this sort we naturally excuse the ignorance of ordinary decorum in what relates to the affairs of our inferior temporal world but for the poet or genteel writer who is of this world merely tis a different case he must be perfect in this moral science we can easily bear the loss of indifferent poetry or essay a good bargain it were coud we get rid of every moderate performance in this kind but were we obligd to hear only excellent sermons and to read nothing in the way of devotion which was not well writ it might possibly go hard with many christian people who are at present such attentive auditors and readers establishd pastors have a right to be indifferent but voluntary discourses and attempters in wit or poetry are as intolerable when they are indifferent as either fiddlers or painters because a dinner could be carried on without them other bayss and poetasters may be lawfully baited tho we patiently submit to our bayss in divinity shaftesbury         had the author of our †subjecttreatises considerd thorowly of these literate affairs and found how the interest of wit stood at present in our nation he woud have had so much regard surely to his own interest as never to have writ unless either in the single capacity of mere critick or that of author in form if he had resolvd never to produce a regular or legitimate piece he might pretty safely have writ on still after the rate of his first volume and mixt manner he might have been as critical as satirical or as full of raillery as he had pleasd but to come afterwards as a grave     actor upon the stage and expose himself to criticism in his turn by giving us a work or two in form after the regular manner of composition as we see in his second volume this i think was no extraordinary proof of his judgment or ability in what related to his own credit and advantage one of these formal pieces the inquiry already examind we have found to be wholly after the manner which in one of his critical pieces he calls the methodick but his next piece the moralists which we have now before us shaftesbury          must according to his own rules be reckond as an undertaking of greater weight tis not only at the bottom as systematical didactick and preceptive as that other piece of formal structure but it assumes withal another garb and more fashionable turn of wit it conceals what is scholastical under the appearance of a polite work it aspires to dialogue and carrys with it not only those poetick features of the pieces antiently calld mimes but it attempts to unite the several personages and characters in one action or story within a determinate compass of time regularly divided and drawn into different and proportiond scenes and this too with variety of style the simple comick rhetorical and even the poetick or sublime such as is the aptest to run into enthusiasm and extravagance so much is our author by virtue of this piece† a poet in due form and by     a shaftesbury          more apparent claim than if he had writ a play or dramatick piece in as regular a manner at least as any known at present on our stage it appears indeed that as high as our author in his critical capacity woud pretend to carry the refind manner and accurate simplicity of the antients shaftesbury          he dares not in his own model and principal performance attempt to unite his philosophy in one solid and uniform body nor carry on his argument in one continud chain or thred here our authors timorousness is visible in the very plan or model of his work he is apparently put to a hard shift to contrive how or with what probability he might introduce men of any note or fashion reasoning expresly and purposely without play or trifling for two or three hours together on mere philosophy and morals he finds these subjects as he confesses so wide of common conversation and by long custom so appropriated to the school the universitychair or pulpit that he thinks it hardly safe or practicable to treat of them elsewhere or in a different tone he is forcd therefore to raise particular machines and constrain his principal characters in order to carry a better face and bear himself out against the appearance of pedantry thus his gentlemanphilosopher theocles before he enters into his real character becomes a feignd preacher and even     when his real character comes on he hardly dares stand it out but to deal the better with his sceptickfriend he falls again to personating and takes up the shaftesbury          humour of the poet and enthusiast palemon the man of quality and who is first introducd as speaker in the piece must for fashionsake appear in love and under a kind of melancholy producd by some misadventures in the world how else shoud he be supposd so serious philocles his friend an airy gentleman of the world and a thorow raillier must have a home charge upon him and feel the anger of his grave friend before he can be supposd grave enough to enter into a philosophical discourse a quarter of an hours reading must serve to represent an hour or twos debate and a new scene presenting it self ever and anon must give refreshment it seems to the faint reader and remind him of the characters and business going on tis in the same view that we miscellanarian authors being fearful of the natural lassitude and satiety of our indolent reader have prudently betaken ourselves to the way of chapters and contents that as the reader proceeds by frequent intervals of repose contrivd on purpose for him he may from time to time be advertisd of what is yet to come and be tempted thus to renew his application thus in our modern plays we see almost in every other leaf descriptions or shaftesbury          illustrations of the action not in the poem itself or in the mouth of the actors but by the poet in his own person in order as appears to help out a defect of the text by a kind of marginal note or comment which renders these pieces of a mixd kind between the narrative and dramatick tis in this fashionable style or manner of dumb shew that the reader finds the action of the piece more amazingly expressd than he possibly coud by the lines of the drama itself where the partys alone are sufferd to be speakers tis out of the same regard to ease both in respect of writer and reader that we see long characters and descriptions at the head of most dramatick pieces to inform us of the relations kindred     interests and designs of the dramatis personae this being of the highest importance to the reader that he may the better understand the plot and find out the principal characters and incidents of the piece which otherways coud not possibly discover themselves as they are read in their due order and to do justice to our playreaders they seldom fail to humour our poets in this respect and read over the characters with strict application as a sort of grammar or key before they enter on the piece itself i know not whether they shaftesbury       0  woud do so much for any philosophical piece in the world our author seems very much to question it and has therefore made that part easy enough which relates to the distinction of his characters by making use of the narrative manner tho he had done as well perhaps not to have gone out of the natural plain way on this account for with those to whom such philosophical subjects are agreeable it coud be thought no laborious task to give the same attention to characters in dialogue as is given at the first entrance by every reader to the easiest play composd of fewest and plainest personages but for those who read these subjects with mere supineness and indifference they will as much begrudg the pains of attending to the characters thus particularly pointed out as if they had only been discernible by inference and deduction from the mouth of the speaking partys themselves more reasons are given by our author himself for his avoiding the direct way of dialogue which at present lies so low and is usd only now and then in our partypamphlets or newfashiond theological essays for of late shaftesbury          it seems the manner has been introducd into churchcontroversy with an attempt of raillery and humour as a more successful method of dealing with heresy and infidelity the burlesquedivinity grows mightily in vogue and the crydup answers to heterodox discourses are generally such as are written in drollery or with resemblance of the facetious and humorous language of conversation     joy to the reverend authors who can afford to be thus gay and condescend to correct us in this laywit the advances they make in behalf of piety and manners by such a popular style are doubtless found upon experience to be very considerable as these reformers are nicely qualifyd to hit the air of breeding and gentility they will in time no doubt refine their manner and improve this jocular method to the edification of the polite world who have been so long seducd by the way of raillery and wit they may do wonders by their comick muse and may thus perhaps find means to laugh gentlemen into their religion who have unfortunately been laughd out of it for what reason is there to suppose that orthodoxy shoud not be able to laugh as agreeably and with as much refinedness as heresy or infidelity shaftesbury         at present it must be ownd the characters or personages employd by our new orthodox dialogists carry with em little proportion or coherence and in this respect may be said to sute perfectly with that figurative metaphorical style and rhetorical manner in which their logick and arguments are generally couchd nothing can be more complex or multiform than their moral draughts or sketches of humanity these indeed are so far from representing any particular man or order of men that they scarce resemble any thing of the kind tis by their names only that these characters are figurd tho they bear different titles and are set up to maintain contrary points they are found at the bottom to be all of the same side and notwithstanding their seeming variance to cooperate in the most officious manner with the author towards the display of his own proper wit and the establishment of his private opinion and maxims they are indeed his very legitimate and obsequious puppets as like real men in voice action and manners as those wooden or wire engines of the lower stage philotheus and philatheus philautus and philalethes are of one and the same order just tallys to one another questioning and answering in shaftesbury          concert and with such a sort of alternative as is known in a vulgar play where one person lies down blindfold and presents himself as fair as may be to   0 another who by favour of the company or the assistance of his goodfortune deals his companion many a sound blow without being once challengd or brought into his turn of lying down there is the same curious mixture of chance and elegant vicissitude in the style of these mockpersonages of our new theological drama with this difference only that after the poor phantom or shadow of an adversary has said as little for his cause as can be imagind and given as many opens and advantages as coud be desird he lies down for good and all and passively submits to the killing strokes of his unmerciful conqueror hardly as i conceive will it be objected to our moralist the author of the philosophick dialogue above that the personages who sustain the sceptical or objecting parts are overtame and tractable in their disposition did i perceive any such foul dealing in his piece i shoud scarce think it worthy of the criticism here bestowd for in this sort of writing where personages are exhibi shaftesbury         ted and natural conversation set in view if characters are neither tolerably preservd nor manners with any just similitude describd there remains nothing but what is too gross and monstrous for criticism or examination twill be alledgd perhaps in answer to what is here advancd that shoud a dialogue be wrought up to the exactness of these rules it ought to be condemnd as the worse piece for affording the infidel or sceptick such good quarter and giving him the full advantage of his argument and wit but to this i reply that either dialogue shoud never be attempted or if it be the partys shoud appear natural and such as they really are if we paint at all we shoud endeavour to paint like life and draw creatures as they are knowable in their proper shapes and better features not in metamorphosis not mangled lame distorted aukard forms and impotent chimeras atheists have their sense and wits as other men or why is atheism so often challengd in those of the better rank why chargd so often to the account of wit and subtle reasoning shaftesbury         were i to advise these authors towards whom i am extremely wellaffected on account of their goodhumourd zeal and the     seeming sociableness of their religion i shoud say to em gentlemen be not so cautious of furnishing your representative sceptick with too good arguments or too shreud a turn of wit or humour be no so fearful of giving quarter allow your adversary his full reason his ingenuity sense and art trust to the chief character or hero of your piece make him as dazling bright as you are able he will undoubtedly overcome the utmost force of his opponent and dispel the darkness or cloud which the adversary may unluckily have raisd but if when you have fairly wrought up your antagonist to his due strength and cognizable proportion your chief character cannot afterwards prove a match for him or shine with a superior brightness whose fault is it—the subjects—this i hope you will never allow—whose therefore beside your own—beware then and consider well your strength and mastership in this manner of writing and in the qualifying practice of the polite world ere you attempt these accurate and refind limnings or portraitures of mankind or offer to bring gentlemen shaftesbury          on the stage for if real gentlemen seducd as you pretend and made erroneous in their religion or philosophy discover not the least feature of their real faces in your lookingglass nor know themselves in the least by your description they will hardly be apt to think they are refuted how wittily soever your comedy may be wrought up they will scarce apprehend any of that wit to fall upon themselves they may laugh indeed at the diversion you are pleasd to give em but the laugh perhaps may be different from what you intend they may smile secretly to see themselves thus encounterd when they find at last your authority laid by and your scholastick weapons quitted in favour of this weak attempt to master them by their own arms and proper ability thus we have performd our critical task and tryd our strength both on our author and those of his order who attempt to write in dialogue after the active dramatick mimical or personating way according to which a writer is properly poetical     what remains we shall examine in our succeeding and last chapter shaftesbury         chap   chapter iii of extent or latitude of thought—freethinkers—their cause and character—dishonesty a halfthought—shortthinking cause of vice and bigotry—agreement of slavery and superstition—liberty civil moral spiritual—freethinking divines—representatives incognito—embassadors from the moon—effectual determination of christian controversy and religious belief being now come to the conclusion of my work after having defended the cause of criticks in general and employd what strength i had in that science upon our adventurous author in particular i may according to equity and with the better grace attempt a line or two in defense of that freedom of thought which our author has usd particularly in one of the personages of his last dialoguetreatise shaftesbury         there is good reason to suppose that however equally framd or near alike the race of mankind may appear in other respects they are not always equal thinkers or of a like ability in the management of this natural talent which we call thought the race on this account may therefore justly be distinguishd as they often are by the appellation of the thinking and the unthinking sort the mere unthinking are such as have not yet arrivd to that happy thought by which they shoud observe how necessary thinking is and how fatal the want of it must prove to em the thinking part of mankind on the other side having discoverd the assiduity and industry requisite to rightthinking and being already commencd thinkers upon this foundation are in the progress of the affair convincd of the necessity of thinking to good purpose     and carrying the work to a thorow issue they know that if they refrain or stop once upon this road they had done as well never to have set out they are not so supine as to be withheld by mere laziness when nothing lies in the way to interrupt the free course and progress of their thought some obstacles tis true may on this occasion be pretended specters may shaftesbury          come across and shadows of reason rise up against reason itself but if men have once heartily espousd the reasoning or thinking habit they will not easily be inducd to lay the practice down they will not at an instant be arrested or made to stand and yield themselves when they come to such a certain boundary landmark post or pillar erected here or there for what reason may probably be guessd with the inscription of a ne plus ultrà tis not indeed any authority on earth as we are well assurd can stop us on this road unless we please to make the arrest or restriction of our own accord tis our own thought which must restrain our thinking and whether the restraining thought be just how shall we ever judge without examining it freely and out of all constraint how shall we be sure that we have justly quitted reason as too high and dangerous too aspiring or presumptive if thro fear of any kind or submitting to mere command we quit our very examining thought and in the moment stop short so as to put an end to further thinking on the matter is there much difference between this case and that of the obedient beasts of burden who stop precisely at their appointed inn or at whatever point the charioteer or shaftesbury      00  governour of the reins thinks fit to give the signal for a halt i cannot but from hence conclude that of all species of creatures said commonly to have brains the most insipid wretched and preposterous are those whom in just propriety of speech we call halfthinkers i have often known pretenders to wit break out into admiration on the sight of some raw heedless unthinking gentleman declaring on this occasion that they esteemd it the happiest case in the world never to think or trouble ones head with study     or consideration this i have always lookd upon as one of the highest airs of distinction which the selfadmiring wits are usd to give themselves in publick company now the echo or antiphony which these elegant exclaimers hope by this reflection to draw necessarily from their audience is that they themselves are overfraighted with this merchandize of thought and have not only enough for ballast but such a cargo over and above as is enough to sink em by its weight i am apt however to imagine of these gentlemen that it was never their overthinking which oppressd them and that if their thought had ever really become oppressive shaftesbury      0   to em they might thank themselves for having underthought or reasond short so as to rest satisfyd with a very superficial search into matters of the first and highest importance if for example they overlookd the chief enjoyments of life which are founded in honesty and a good mind if they presumd mere life to be fully worth what its tenacious lovers are pleasd to rate it at if they thought publick distinction fame power an estate or title to be of the same value as is vulgarly conceivd or as they concluded on a first thought without further scepticism or afterdeliberation tis no wonder if being in time become such mature dogmatists and wellpractisd dealers in the affairs of what they call a settlement or fortune they are so hardly put to it to find ease or rest within themselves these are the deeplyloaded and overpensive gentlemen who esteeming it the truest wit to pursue what they call their interest wonder to find they are still as little at ease when they have succeeded as when they first attempted to advance there can never be less selfenjoyment than in these supposd wise characters these selfish computers of happiness and shaftesbury      0   private good whose pursuits of interest whether for this world or another are attended with the same steddy vein of cunning and low thought sordid deliberations perverse and crooked fancys ill dispositions and false relishes of life and manners the most negligent undesigning thoughtless rake has not only more of sociableness ease tranquillity and freedom from worldly cares     but in reality more of worth virtue and merit than such grave plodders and thoughtful gentlemen as these if it happens therefore that these graver more circumspect and deeply interested gentlemen have for their souls sake and thro a careful provision for hereafter engagd in certain speculations of religion their taste of virtue and relish of life is not the more improvd on this account the thoughts they have on these new subjects of divinity are so biassd and perplexd by those halfthoughts and raw imaginations of interest and worldly affairs that they are still disabled in the rational pursuit of happiness and good and being necessitated thus to remain shortthinkers they have the power to go no further than they are led by those to whom under such disturbances and perplexitys they apply themselves for cure and comfort shaftesbury      0  it has been the main scope and principal end of these volumes to assert the reality of a beauty and charm in moral as well as natural subjects and to demonstrate the reasonableness of a proportionate taste and determinate choice in life and manners the standard of this kind and the noted character of moral truth appear so firmly establishd in nature itself and so widely displayd thro the intelligent world that there is no genius mind or thinking principle which if i may say so is not really conscious in the case even the most refractory and obstinate understandings are by certain reprises or returns of thought on every occasion convincd of this existence and necessitated in common with others to acknowledg the actual right and wrong tis evident that whensoever the mind influencd by passion or humour consents to any action measure or rule of life contrary to this governing standard and primary measure of intelligence it can only be thro a weak thought a scantiness of judgment and a defect in the application of that unavoidable impression and first natural rule of honesty and worth shaftesbury      0   against which whatever is advancd will be of no other moment than to render a     life distracted incoherent full of irresolution repentance and selfdisapprobation thus every immorality and enormity of life can only happen from a partial and narrow view of happiness and good whatever takes from the largeness or freedom of thought must of necessity detract from that first relish or taste on which virtue and worth depend for instance when the eye or appetite is eagerly fixd on treasure and the moneyd bliss of bags and coffers tis plain there is a kind of fascination in the case the sight is instantly diverted from all other views of excellence or worth and here even the vulgar as well as the more liberal part of mankind discover the contracted genius and acknowledg the narrowness of such a mind in luxury and intemperance we easily apprehend how far thought is oppressd and the mind debard from just reflection and from the free examination and censure of its own opinions or maxims on which the conduct of a life is formd even in that complicated good of vulgar kind which we commonly call in shaftesbury      0  terest in which we comprehend both pleasure riches power and other exterior advantages we may discern how a fascinated sight contracts a genius and by shortning the view even of that very interest which it seeks betrays the knave and necessitates the ablest and wittiest proselyte of the kind to expose himself on every emergency and sudden turn but above all other enslaving vices and restrainers of reason and just thought the most evidently ruinous and fatal to the understanding is that of superstition bigotry and vulgar enthusiasm this passion not contented like other vices to deceive and tacitly supplant our reason professes open war holds up the intended chains and fetters and declares its resolution to enslave the artificial managers of this human frailty declaim against freethought and latitude of understanding to go beyond those bounds of thinking which they have prescribd is by them declard a sacrilege to them freedom of mind a mastery of sense and     a liberty in thought and action imply debauch corruption and depravity in consequence of their moral maxims and political establishments they can in shaftesbury      0  deed advance no better notion of human happiness and enjoyment than that which is in every respect the most opposite to liberty tis to them doubtless that we owe the opprobriousness and abuse of those naturally honest appellations of freelivers freethinkers latitudinarians or whatever other character implies a largeness of mind and generous use of understanding fain woud they confound licentiousness in morals with liberty in thought and action and make the libertine who has the least mastery of himself resemble his direct opposite for such indeed is the man of resolute purpose and immovable adherence to reason against every thing which passion prepossession craft or fashion can advance in favour of ought else but here it seems the grievance lies tis thought dangerous for us to be overrational or too much masters of ourselves in what we draw by just conclusions from reason only seldom therefore do these expositors fail of bringing the thought of liberty into disgrace even at the expence of virtue and of that very idea of goodness on which they build the mysterys of their profitable science they derogate from morals and reverse all true philosophy they refine on selfishness and explode generosity promote a slavish obedience in the room of voluntary duty and free ser shaftesbury      0  vice exalt blind ignorance for devotion recommend low thought decry reason extol voluptuousness wilfulness vindicativeness arbitrariness vainglory and even †deify those weak passions which are the disgrace rather than ornament of human nature but so far is it from the nature of ‡liberty to indulge such passions as these that whoever acts at any time under the power of any singleone may be said to have already provided for himself an     absolute master and he who lives under the power of a whole race since tis scarce possible to obey one without the other must of necessity undergo the worst of servitudes under the most capricious and domineering lords that this is no paradox even the writers for entertainment can inform us however others may moralize who discourse or write as they pretend for profit and instruction the poets even of the wanton sort give ample testimony of this slavery and wretchedness of vice they may extol voluptuousness to the skies and point their wit as sharply as they are able against a virtuous state but when they shaftesbury      0   come afterwards to pay the necessary tribute to their commanding pleasures we hear their pathetick moans and find the inward discord and calamity of their lives their example is the best of precepts since they conceal nothing are sincere and speak their passion out aloud and tis in this that the very worst of poets may justly be preferd to the generality of modern philosophers or other formal writers of a yet more specious name the muses pupils never fail to express their passions and write just as they feel tis not indeed in their nature to do otherwise whilst they indulge their vein and are under the power of that natural enthusiasm which leads em to what is highest in their performance they follow nature they move chiefly as she moves in em without thought of disguising her free motions and genuine operations for the sake of any scheme or hypothesis which they have formd at leisure and in particular narrow views on this account tho at one time they quarrel perhaps with virtue for restraining em in their forbidden loves they can at another time make her sufficient amends when with indignation they complain that merit is neglected and their worthless rival preferd before them shaftesbury      0  †to think that the honest heart of a poor man should have no weight against gold     and thus even in common elegiack in song ode or epigram consecrated to pleasure itself we may often read the dolorous confession in behalf of virtue and see at the bottom how the case stands for then and then only are the words of truth drawn from the bottom of a mans heart  the airy poets in these fits can as freely as the tragedian condole with virtue and bemoan the case of suffering merit   th oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely   the insolence of office and the spurns   that patient merit of th unworthy takes the poetick chiefs may give what reason they think fit for their humour of representing our mad appetites especially that of love under the shape of urchins and wanton boys scarce out of their state of infancy the original design and moral of this fiction i am persuaded was to shew us how little there was of great and heroick in the government of these shaftesbury       0  pretenders how truly weak and childish they were in themselves and how much lower than mere children we then became when we submitted ourselves to their blind tutorage there was no fear left in this fiction the boyish nature shoud be misconstrud as innocent and gentle the storms of passion so well known in every kind kept the tyrannick quality of this wanton race sufficiently in view nor coud the poetical description fail to bring to mind their mischievous and malignant play but when the image of imperious threatning and absolute command was joind to that of ignorance puerility and folly the notion was compleated of that wretched slavish state which modern libertines in conjunction with some of a graver character admire and represent as the most eligible of any—happy condition says one happy life that of the indulgd passions might we pursue it—miserable condition   0 miserable life that of reason and virtue which we are bid pursue tis the same it seems with men in morals as in politicks when they have been unhappily born and bred to slavery they are so far from being sensible of their slavish course of life or of that ill shaftesbury          usage indignity and misery they sustain that they even admire their own condition and being usd to think short and carry their views no further than those bounds which were early prescribd to em they look upon tyranny as a natural case and think mankind in a sort of dangerous and degenerate state when under the power of laws and in the possession of a free government we may by these reflections come easily to apprehend what men they were who first brought reason and freethought under disgrace and made the noblest of characters that of a freethinker to become invidious tis no wonder if the same interpreters woud have those also to be esteemd free in their lives and masters of good living who are the least masters of themselves and the most impotent in passion and humour of all their fellowcreatures but far be it and far surely will it ever be from any worthy genius to be consenting to such a treacherous language and abuse of words for my own part i thorowly confide in the good powers of reason that liberty and freedom shall never by any artifice or delusion be made to pass with me as frightful sounds or as reproachful or invidious in any sense shaftesbury         i can no more allow that to be freeliving where unlimited passion and unexamind fancy govern than i can allow that to be a free government where the mere people govern and not the laws for no people in a civil state can possibly be free when they are otherwise governd than by such laws as they themselves have constituted or to which they have freely given consent now to be releasd from these so as to govern themselves by each days will or fancy and to vary on every turn the rule and measure     of government without respect to any antient constitutions or establishments or to the stated and fixd rules of equity and justice is as certain slavery as it is violence distraction and misery such as in the issue must prove the establishment of an irretrievable state of tyranny and absolute dominion in the determinations of life and in the choice and government of actions he alone is free who has within himself no hindrance or controul in acting what he himself by his best judgment and most deliberate choice approves coud vice agree possibly with itself or coud the vicious any way reconcile the various judgments of their inward counsellors they might with justice perhaps assert their liberty and independency but whilst they shaftesbury          are necessitated to follow least what in their sedate hours they most approve whilst they are passively assignd and made over from one possessor to another in contrary extremes and to different ends and purposes of which they are themselves wholly ignorant tis evident that the more they turn †their eyes as many times they are obligd towards virtue and a free life the more they must confess their misery and subjection they discern their own captivity but not with force and resolution sufficient to redeem themselves and become their own such is the real tragick state as the old ‡tragedian represents it      i see and i esteem the better course i follow the worse and thus the highest spirits and most refractory wills contribute to the lowest servitude and most submissive state reason and virtue alone can bestow liberty vice is unworthy and unhappy on shaftesbury          this account only that it is slavish and debasing thus have we pleaded the cause of liberty in general and vindicated withal our authors particular freedom in taking the person of a sceptick as he has done in this last treatise on which we have so largely paraphrasd we may now perhaps in compliance with general cusstom justly presume to add something in defense of the same kind of freedom we ourselves have assumd in these latter miscellaneous comments since it woud doubtless be very unreasonable and unjust for those who had so freely playd the critick to expect any thing less than the same free treatment and thorow criticism in return as for the style or language usd in these comments tis very different we find and varys in proportion with the author commented and with the different characters and persons frequently introducd in the original treatises so that there will undoubtedly be scope sufficient for censure and correction shaftesbury         as for the observations on antiquity we have in most passages except the very common and obvious producd our vouchers and authoritys in our own behalf what may be thought of our judgment or sense in the application of these authoritys and in the deductions and reasonings we have formd from such learned topicks must be submitted to the opinion of the wise and learned in morals of which the very force lies in a love of     discipline and in a willingness to redress and rectify false thought and erring views we cannot but patiently wait redress and amicable censure from the sole competent judges the wise and good whose interest it has been our whole endeavour to advance the only subject on which we are perfectly secure and without fear of any just censure or reproach is that of faith and orthodox belief for in the first place it will appear that thro a profound respect and religious veneration we have forborn so much as to name any of the sacred and solemn mysterys of revelation and in the next place as we can with confidence declare that we have never in any writing publick or private attempted such high researches nor have ever in practice acquitted ourselves otherwise than as just conformists to the lawful church so we shaftesbury          may in a proper sense be said faithfully and dutifully to embrace those holy mysterys even in their minutest particulars and without the least exception on account of their amazing depth and tho we are sensible that it woud be no small hardship to deprive others of a liberty of examining and searching with due modesty and submission into the nature of those subjects yet as for ourselves who have not the least scruple whatsoever we pray not any such grace or favour in our behalf being fully assurd of our own steddy orthodoxy resignation and intire submission to the truly christian and catholick doctrines of our holy church as by law establishd tis true indeed that as to †critical learning and the examination of originals texts glosses various readings styles compositions manuscripts compilements editions publications and other circumstances such as are common to the sacred books with all other writings and literature this we have confidently asserted to be a just and lawful study we have even represented this species of criticism as necessary to the preservation and purity of scripture that sacred scripture which has been so miraculously preservd in its successive copys and transcriptions shaftesbury          under the eye     as we must needs suppose of holy and learned criticks thro so many dark ages of christianity to these latter times in which learning has been happily revivd but if this critical liberty raises any jealousy against us we shall beg leave of our offended reader to lay before him our case at the very worst that if on such a naked exposition it be found criminal we may be absolutely condemnd if otherwise acquitted and with the same favour indulgd as others in the same circumstances have been before us on this occasion therefore we may be allowd to borrow something from the form or manner of our dialogue author and represent a conversation of the same free nature as that recited by him in his nightscene where the supposd sceptick or freethinker delivers his thoughts and reigns in the discourse twas in a more considerable company and before a more numerous audience that not long since a gentleman of some rank one who was generally esteemd to carry a sufficient caution and shaftesbury          reserve in religious subjects of discourse as well as an apparent deference to religion and in particular to the national and establishd church having been provokd by an impertinent attack of a certain violent bigotted party was drawn into an open and free vindication not only of freethinking but freeprofessing and discoursing in matters relating to religion and faith some of the company it seems after having made bold with him as to what they fansyd to be his principle began to urge the necessity of reducing men to one profession and belief and several gentlemen even of those who passd for moderate in their way seemd so far to give into this zealotopinion as to agree that notwithstanding the right method was not yet found twas highly requisite that some way shoud be thought on to reconcile differences in opinion since so long as this variety shoud last religion they thought coud never be successfully advancd     to this our gentleman at first answerd coldly that what was impossible to be done coud not he thought be properly pursud as necessary to be done but the raillery being ill taken he was forcd at last to defend himself the best he shaftesbury          coud upon this point that variety of opinions was not to be curd and that twas impossible all shoud be of one mind i well know said he that many pious men seeing the inconveniences which the disunion of persuasions and opinions accidentally produces have thought themselves obligd to stop this inundation of mischiefs and have made attempts accordingly some have endeavourd to unite these fractions by propounding such a guide as they were all bound to follow hoping that the unity of a guide woud have producd unity of minds but who this guide shoud be after all became such a question that twas made part of that fire itself which was to be extinguishd others thought of a rule—this was to be the effectual means of union this was to do the work or nothing coud—but supposing all the world had been agreed on this rule yet the interpretation of it was so full of variety that this also became part of the disease the company upon this preamble of our gentleman pressd harder upon him than before objecting the authority of holy scripture against him and a shaftesbury       0 ffirming this to be of itself a sufficient guide and rule they urgd again and again that known saying of a famd controversial divine of our church against the divines of another that the scripture the scripture was the religion of protestants to this our gentleman at first replyd only by desiring them to explain their word scripture and by inquiring into the original of this collection of antienter and later tracts which in general they comprehended under that title whether it were the apocryphal scripture or the more canonical the full or the halfauthorizd the doubtful or the certain the controverted or uncontroverted the singlyread or that of various reading the text of these manuscripts or of those the transcripts copys titles catalogues of this church and nation or of that other of this sect     and party or of another of those in one age calld orthodox and in possession of power or of those who in another overthrew their predecessors authority and in their turn also assumd the guardianship and power of holy things for how these sacred records were guarded in those ages might easily he said be imagind by any one who had the least insight into the history of those times shaftesbury          which we calld primitive and the characters of those men whom we styld fathers of the church it must be confessd continud he twas a strange industry and unlucky diligence which was usd in this respect by these ecclesiastical forefathers of all those heresys which gave them imployment we have absolutely no record or monument but what themselves who were adversarys have transmitted to us and we know that adversarys especially such who observe all opportunitys to discredit both the persons and doctrines of their enemys are not always the best recorders or witnesses of such transactions we see it continud he in a very emphatical but somewhat embarassd style we see it now in this very age in the present distemperatures that partys are no good registers of the actions of the adverse side and if we cannot be confident of the truth of a story now now i say that it is possible for any man especially for the interested adversary to discover the imposture it is far more unlikely that afterages shoud know any other truth than such as serves the ends of the representers shaftesbury         our gentleman by these expressions had already given considerable offense to his zealotauditors they plyd him faster with passionate reproaches than with arguments or rational answers this however servd only to animate him the more and made him proceed the more boldly with the same assumd formality and air of declamation in his general criticism of holy literature there are said he innumerable places that contain no doubt great mysterys but so wrapd in clouds or hid in umbrages so heightend with expressions or so coverd with allegorys and garments of rhetorick so profound in the matter or so alterd and     made intricate in the manner that they may seem to have been left as trials of our industry and as occasions and opportunitys for the exercise of mutual charity and toleration rather than as the repositorys of faith and furniture of creeds for when there are found in the explications of these writings so many commentarys so many senses and interpretations so many volumes in all ages and all like mens faces no one exactly like another either this difference is absolutely no fault at all or if it be it is excusable there are be shaftesbury         sides so many thousands of copys that were writ by persons of several interests and persuasions such different understandings and tempers such distinct abilitys and weaknesses that tis no wonder there is so great variety of readings—whole verses in one that are not in another—whole books admitted by one church or communion which are rejected by another and whole storys and relations admitted by some fathers and rejected by others—i consider withal that there have been many designs and views in expounding these writings many senses in which they are expounded and when the grammatical sense is found out we are many times never the nearer now there being such variety of senses in scripture and but few places so markd out as not to be capable of more than one if men will write commentarys by fancy what infallible criterion will be left to judg of the certain sense of such places as have been the matter of question i consider again that there are indeed divers places in these sacred volumes containing in them mysterys and questions of great concernment yet such is the fabrick and constitution of the whole that there is no certain mark to determine whether the sense of these passages shoud be taken as literal or fi shaftesbury         gurative there is nothing in the nature of the thing to determine the sense or meaning but it must be gotten out as it can and therefore tis unreasonably requird that what is of itself ambiguous shoud be understood in its own prime sense and intention under the pain of either a sin or an anathema very wise men even the antient fathers have expounded things allegorically when they shoud have expounded them literally others expound things literally when they     shoud understand them in allegory if such great spirits coud be deceivd in finding out what kind of senses were to be given to scriptures it may well be endurd that we who sit at their feet shoud be subject at least to equal failure if we follow any one translation or any one mans commentary what rule or direction shall we have by which to chuse that one aright or is there any one man that hath translated perfectly or expounded infallibly if we resolve to follow any one as far only as we like or fansy we shall then only do wrong or right by chance if we resolve absolutely to follow anyone whithersoever he leads we shall probably come at last where if we have any eyes left we shall see ourselves become sufficiently ridiculous shaftesbury         the reader may here perhaps by his natural sagacity remark a certain air of studyd discourse and declamation not so very proper or natural in the mouth of a mere gentleman nor sutable to a company where alternate discourse is carryd on in unconcerted measure and unpremeditated language something there was so very emphatical withal in the delivery of these words by the sceptical gentleman that some of the company who were still more incensd against him for these expressions began to charge him as a preacher of pernicious doctrines one who attackd religion in form and carryd his lessons or lectures about with him to repeat by rote at any time to the ignorant and vulgar in order to seduce them     tis true indeed said he gentlemen that what i have here venturd to repeat is addressd chiefly to those you call ignorant such i mean as being otherwise engagd in the world have had little time perhaps to bestow upon inquirys into divinitymatters as for you gentlemen in particular who are so much displeasd with my freedom i am well assurd you are in effect so able and knowing that the truth of every assertion i have advancd is sufficiently understood and acknowledgd by you however it shaftesbury          may happen that in your great wisdom you think it proper to conceal these matters from such persons as you are pleasd to style the vulgar tis true withal gentlemen continud he i will confess to you that the words you have heard repeated are not my own they are no other than what have been publickly and solemnly deliverd even by one of the episcopal order a celebrated churchman and  00 one of the highest sort as appears by his many shaftesbury          devotional works which carry the rites ceremonys and pomp of worship with the honour and dignity of the priestly and episcopal order to the highest degree in effect we see the reverend doctors treatises standing as it were in the front of this order of authors and shaftesbury          as the foremost of those goodbooks usd by the politest and most refind devotees of either sex they maintain the principal place in the study of almost every elegant and high divine they stand in folios and other volumes adornd with variety of pictures gildings and other decorations on the advancd shelves or glasscupboards of the ladys closets they are in use at all seasons and for all places as well for churchservice as closetpreparation and in short may vie with any devotional books in british christendom and for the life and character of the man himself i leave it to you gentlemen you i mean of the zealotkind to except against it if you think proper tis your manner i know and what you never fail to have recourse to when any authority is producd against you personal reflection is always seasonable and at hand on such an occasion no matter what virtue honesty or sanctity may lie in the character of the person cited no matter tho he be ever so much in other respects of your own party and devoted to your interest if he has indiscreetly spoken some hometruth or discoverd some secret which strikes at the temporal interests of certain spiritual societys he is quickly doomd to calumny and defamation shaftesbury         i shall try this experiment however once more continud our gentleman and as a conclusion to this discourse will venture to produce to you a further authority of the same kind you shall have it before you in the exact phrase and words of the great author in his theological capacity since i have now no further occasion to  0  conceal my citations and accommodate them to the more familiar style and language of conversation our excellent archbishop and late father of our church when expresly treating that very subject of a rule in matters of belief in opposition to mr s    and mr r      his romish antagonists shews plainly how great a shame it is for us protestants at least whatever the case may be with romanists to disallow difference of opinions and forbid private examination and search into matters of antient record and scriptural tradition when at the same time we have no pretence to oral or verbal no claim to any absolute superior judg or decisive judgment in the case no polity church or community no particular shaftesbury       0  man or number of men who are not even by our own confession plainly fallible and subject to error and mistake the protestants says his grace speaking in the person of mr s    and the romanists cannot know how many the books of scripture ought to be and which of the many controverted ones may be securely put in that catalogue which not—but i shall tell him replies his grace that we know that just so many ought to be receivd as uncontroverted books concerning which it cannot be shewn there was ever any controversy it was not incumbent perhaps on my lord archbishop to help mr s      so far in his objection as to add that in reality the burning suppressing and interpolating method so early in fashion and so tightly practisd on the epistles comments historys and writings of the orthodox and hereticks of old made it impossible to say with any kind of assurance what books copys or transcripts those were concerning which there was never any controversy at all this indeed woud be a point not so easily to be demonstrated but his grace proceeds in shewing the weakness of the romish pillar tradition for it must either says he acknowledg some books to have been controverted or not if shaftesbury          not why doth he make a supposition of  0  controverted books if oral tradition acknowledges some books to have been controverted then it cannot assure us that they have not been controverted nor consequently that they ought to be receivd as never having been controverted but only as such concerning which those churches who did once raise a controversy about them have been since satisfyd that they are canonical—where is then the infallibility of oral tradition how does the living voice of the present church assure us that what books are now receivd by her were ever receivd by her and if it cannot do this but the matter must come to be tryd by the best records of former ages which the protestants are willing to have the catalogue tryd by then it seems the protestants have a better way to know what books are canonical than is the infallible way shaftesbury          of oral tradition and so long as tis better no matter tho it be not calld infallible— thus the free and generous archbishop for indeed what greater generosity is there than in owning truth frankly and openly even where the greatest advantages may be taken by an adversary accordingly our worthy archbishop speaking again immediately in the person of his adversary the protestants says †he cannot know that the very original or a perfectly true copy of these books hath been preservd nor is it necessary replies the archbishop that they shoud know either of these it is sufficient that they know that those copys which they have are not materially corrupted—but how do the church of rome know that they have perfectly true copys of the scriptures in the original languages they do not pretend to know this the learned men of  0  that church acknowledg the various readings as well as we and do not pretend to know otherwise than by probable conjecture as we also may do which of those readings is the trueone— shaftesbury         and thus continud our laygentleman i have finishd my quotations which i have been necessitated to bring in my own defense to prove to you that i have asserted nothing on this head of religion faith or the sacred mysterys which has not been justifyd and confirmd by the most celebrated churchmen and  0  respected divines you may now proceed in your invectives bestowing as free language of that kind as your charity and breeding will permit and you reverend sirs who have assumd a character which sets shaftesbury          you above that of the mere gentleman and releases you from those decorums and constraining measures of behaviour to which we of an inferior sort are bound you may liberally deal your religious compliments and salutations in what dialect you think fit since for my own part neither the names of heterodox schismatick heretick sceptick nor even infidel or atheist itself will in the least scandalize me whilst the sentence comes only from your mouths on the contrary i rather strive with myself to suppress whatever vanity might naturally arise in me from such favour bestowd for whatever may in the bot shaftesbury         tom be intended me by such a treatment tis impossible for me to term it other than favour since there are certain enmitys which it will be ever esteemd a real honour to have merited if contrary to the rule and measure of conversation i have drawn the companys attention towards me thus long without affording them an intermission during my recital they will i hope excuse me the rather because they heard the other recitals and were witnesses to the heavy charge and personal reflection which without any real provocation was made upon me in publick by these zealotgentlemen to whom i have thus replyd and notwithstanding they may after such breaches of charity as are usual with them presume me equally out of charity on my own side i will take upon me however to give them this good advice at parting that since they have of late been so elated by some seeming advantages and a prosperity which they are ill fitted to bear they woud at least beware of accumulating too hastily those high characters appellations titles and ensigns of power which may be tokens perhaps of what they expect hereafter but which as yet do not answer the real power and authority bestowd on them shaftesbury          the garb and countenance will be more graceful when the thing itself is securd to em and in their actual possession  0  mean while the anticipation of high titles honours and nominal dignitys beyond the common style and antient usage tho it may be highly fashionable at present may not prove beneficial or advantageous in the end i woud in particular advise my elegant antagonists of this zealotkind that among the many titles they assume to themselves they woud be rather more sparing in that highone of embassador till such time as they have just means and foundation to join that of plenipotentiary together with it for as matters stand hitherto in our british world neither their commission from the sovereign nor that which they pretend from heaven amounts to any absolute or determining power the first holy messengers for that i take to be the highest apostolick name brought with them their proper testimonials in their lives their manners and behaviour as well as in powerful works miracles and signs from heaven and tho indeed it might well be esteemd a miracle in the kind shoud our present messengers go about to shaftesbury          represent their predecessors in any part of their demeanour or conversation yet there are further miracles remaining for em to perform ere they can in modesty plead the apostolick or messengerauthority for tho in the torrent of a sublime and figurative style a holy apostle may have made use perhaps of such a phrase as that of embassy or embassador to express the dignity of his errand twere to be wishd that some who were never sent of any errand or message at all from god himself woud use a modester title to express their voluntary negotiation between us and heaven i must confess for my own part that i think the notion of an embassy from thence to be at best somewhat highstraind in the metaphorical way of speech but certain i am that if there be any such residentship or agentship now establishd tis not immediately from god himself but thro the magistrate and by the prince or sovereign power here on earth that these gentlemenagents are appointed distinguishd and set over us they have undoubtedly  0  a legal charter and character legal titles and precedencys legal habits coats of arms colours badges shaftesbury          but they may do well to consider that a thousand badges or liverys bestowd by men merely can never be sufficient to entitle em to the same authority as theirs who bore the immediate testimony and miraculous signs of power from above for in this case there was need only of eyes and ordinary senses to distinguish the commission and acknowledg the embassy or message as divine but allowing it ever so certain a truth that there has been a thousand or near two thousand years succession in this commission of embassy where shall we find this commission to have lain—how has it been supplyd still or renewd—how often dormant—how often divided even in one and the same species of claimants—what party are they among moderns who by virtue of any immediate testimonial from heaven are thus intitled—where are the letterspatent the credentials for these shoud in the nature of the thing be open visible and apparent a certain indian of the train of the embassadorprinces sent to us lately from some of those pagan nations being engagd one sunday in visiting our churches and happening to ask his interpreter shaftesbury          who the eminent persons were whom he observd haranguing so long with such authority from a high place was answerd they were embassadors from the almighty or according to the indian language from the sun whether the indian took this seriously or in raillery did not appear but having afterwards calld in as he went along at the chapels of some of his brotherembassadors of the romish religion and at some other christian dissenting congregations where matters as he perceivd were transacted with greater privacy and inferior state he askd whether these also were embassadors from the same place he was answerd that they had indeed been heretofore of the embassy and had possession of the same chief places he had seen but they were now succeeded there by others if those therefore  0  replyd the indian were embassadors from the sun these i take for granted are from the moon supposing indeed one had been no pagan but a good christian conversant in the original holy scriptures but unacquainted with the rites titles habits and ceremonials of which there is no mention in those writings might one not have inquird with humble submission in shaftesbury       0 to this affair might one not have softly and at a distance applyd for information concerning this high embassy and addressing perhaps to some inferior officer or liveryman of the train askd modestly how and whence they came whose equipage they appeard in at whose charges they were entertaind and by whose suffrage or command appointed and authorizd—is it true pray sirs that their excellencys of the present establishment are the solecommissiond or are there as many real commissioners as there are pretenders if so there can be no great danger for us whichever way we apply ourselves we have ample choice and may adhere to which commission we like best if there be only one single trueone we have then it seems good reason to look about us search narrowly into the affair be scrupulous in our choice and as the current physickbills admonish us beware of counterfeits since there are so many of these abroad with earthly powers and temporal commissions to back their spiritual pretenses— tis to be feard in good earnest that the discernment of this kind will prove pretty difficult especially amidst this universal contention embroil and fury of religious shaftesbury          challengers these high defiances of contrary believers this zealous opposition of commission to commission and this din of hell anathemas and damnations raisd every where by one religious party against another so far are the pretendedly commissiond partys from producing their commission openly or proving it from the original record or courtrolls of heaven that they deny us inspection into these very records they plead and refuse to submit their title to human judgment or examination a poet of our nation insinuates indeed in their behalf that they  0  are fair enough in this respect for when the murmuring people speaking by their chosen orator or spokesman to the priests says to em   with ease you take what we provide with care   and we who your legation must maintain   find all your tribe in the commission are   and none but heavn coud send so large a train the apologist afterwards excusing this boldness of the people and soothing the incensd priests with fairer words shaftesbury          says to em on a foot of moderation which he presumes to be their character   you with such temper their intemperance bear   to shew your solid science does rely   so on itself as you no trial fear   for arts are weak that are of scepticks shy the poet it seems never dreamt of a time when the very countenance of moderation shoud be out of fashion with the gentlemen of this order and the word itself exploded as unworthy of their profession and indeed so far are they at present from bearing with any sceptick or inquirer ever so modest or discreet that to hear an argument on a contrary side to theirs or read whatever may be writ in answer to their particular assertions is made the highest crime whilst they have among themselves such differences and sharp debates about their heavenly commission and are even in one and the same community or establishment divided into different sects and headships they will allow no particular survey or inspection into the foundations of their controverted title they woud have us inferior passive mortals amazd shaftesbury          as we are and beholding with astonishment from afar these tremendous subjects of dispute wait blindfold the event and final  0  decision of the controversy nor is it enough that we are merely passive tis requird of us that in the midst of this irreconcilable debate concerning heavenly authoritys and powers we shoud be as confident of the veracity of some one as of the imposture and cheat of all the other pretenders and that believing firmly there is still a real commission at the bottom we shoud endure the misery of these conflicts and engage on one side or the other as we happen to have our birth or education till by fire and sword execution massacre and a kind of depopulation of this earth it be determind at last amongst us which is the true commission exclusive of all others and superior to the rest here our secular gentleman who in the latter end of his discourse had already made several motions and gestures which betokend a retreat made his final bow in form and quitted the place and company for that time till as he told his auditors he had another op shaftesbury         portunity and fresh leisure to hear in his turn whatever his antagonists might anew object to him in a manner more favourable and moderate or if they so approvd in the same temper and with the same zeal as they had done before shaftesbury           0     treatise vii viz a notion of the historical draught or tablature of the judgment of hercules according to prodicus lib ii xen de mem soc with a letter concerning design find more important herculean tasks hard labors than all the loves the banquets and the featherly comforts of sardanapolus juv sat  0 printed first in the year mdccxiii         the judgment of hercules intro introduction  before we enter on the examination of our historical sketch it may be proper to remark that by the word tablature for which we have yet no name in english besides the general one of picture we denote according to the original word tabula a work not only distinct from a mere portraiture but from all those wilder sorts of painting which shaftesbury          are in a manner absolute and independent such as the paintings in fresco upon the walls the cielings the staircases the cupolos and other remarkable places either of churches or palaces   accordingly we are to understand that it is not merely     the shape or dimension of a cloth or board which denominates the piece or tablature since a work of this kind may be composd of any colourd substance as it may of any form whether square oval or round but tis then that in painting we may give to any particular work the name of tablature when the work is in reality a single piece comprehended in one view and formd according to one single intelligence meaning or design which constitutes a real whole by a mutual and necessary relation of its parts the same as of the members in a natural body so that one may say of a picture composd of any number of figures differently rangd and without any regard to this correspondency or union describd that it is no more a real piece or tablature than a picture woud be a mans picture or proper portraiture which represented on the same cloth in different places the legs arms nose and eyes of such a person without adjusting them according to the true proportion air and character which belongd to him shaftesbury           this regulation has place even in the inferior degrees of painting since the mere flowerpainter is we see obligd to study the form of festons and to make use of a peculiar order or architecture of vases jars cannisters pedestals and other inventions which serve as machines to frame a certain proportionate assemblage or united mass according to the rules of perspective and with regard as well to the different shapes and sizes of his several flowers as to the harmony of colours resulting from the whole this being the only thing capable of rendering his work worthy the name of a composition or real piece   so much the more therefore is this regulation applicable to historypainting where not only men but manners and human passions are represented here the unity of design must with more particular exactness be preservd according to the just rules of poetick art that in the representation of any event or remarkable fact the probability or seeming truth which is the real truth of art may with the highest advantage be supported and advancd as we shall better understand in the argument which follows on the historical tablature of the judgment of hercules who being young and re shaftesbury       0 tird to a solitary place in order to deliberate on     the choice he was to make of the different ways of life was accosted as our historian relates by the two goddesses virtue and pleasure tis on the issue of the controversy between these two that the character of hercules depends so that we may naturally give to this piece and history as well the title of the education as the choice or judgment of hercules chap   chapter i of the general constitution or ordonnance of the tablature this fable or history may be variously represented according to the order of time either in the instant when the two goddesses virtue and pleasure accost hercules or when they are enterd on their dispute or when their dispute is already far advancd and virtue seems to gain her cause   according to the first notion hercules must of necessity seem shaftesbury          surprizd on the first appearance of such miraculous forms he admires he contemplates but is not yet ingagd or interested according to the second notion he is interested divided and in doubt according to the third he is wrought agitated and torn by contrary passions tis the last effort of the vitious one striving for possession over him he agonizes and with all his strength of reason endeavours to overcome himself and the spirit is overwhelmed by reason and it struggles to be conquered    of these different periods of time the latter has been chosen as being the only one of the three which can well serve to express the grand event or consequent resolution of hercules and the choice he actually made of a life full of toil and hardship     under the conduct of virtue for the deliverance of mankind from tyranny and oppression and tis to such a piece or tablature as represents this issue of the balance in our pondering hero that we may justly give the title of the decision or judgment of hercules   the same history may be represented yet according to a fourth date or period as at the time when hercules is intirely won by virtue but then the signs of this resolute determination reign shaftesbury         ing absolutely in the attitude and air of our young hero there woud be no room left to represent his agony or inward conflict which indeed makes the principal action here as it woud do in a poem were this subject to be treated by a good poet nor woud there be any more room left in this case either for the persuasive rhetorick of virtue who must have already ended her discourse or for the insinuating address of pleasure who having lost her cause must necessarily appear displeasd or out of humour a circumstance which woud no way sute her character   in the original story or fable of this adventure of our young hercules tis particularly noted that pleasure advancing hastily before virtue began her plea and was heard with prevention as being first in turn and as this fable is wholly philosophical and moral this circumstance in particular is to be considerd as essential   in this third period therefore of our history dividing it as we have done into four successive dates or points of time hercules being auditor and attentive speaks not pleasure has spoken virtue is still speaking she is about the middle or towards the end of shaftesbury          her discourse in the place where according to just rhetorick the highest tone of voice and strongest action are employd   tis evident that every master in painting when he has made choice of the determinate date or point of time according to which he woud represent his history is afterwards debard the taking advantage from any other action than what is immediately present and belonging to that single instant he describes for if he passes the present only for a moment he may as well     pass it for many years and by this reckoning he may with as good right repeat the same figure several times over and in one and the same picture represent hercules in his cradle struggling with the serpents and the same hercules of full age fighting with the hydra with anteus and with cerberus which woud prove a mere confusd heap or knot of pieces and not a single intire piece or tablature of the historical kind   it may however be allowable on some occasions to make use of certain enigmatical or emblematical devises to represent a future time as when hercules yet a mere boy is seen holding a small club or wearing the skin of a young lion for so we often find him in shaftesbury          the best antiques and tho history had never related of hercules that being yet very young he killd a lion with his own hand this representation of him woud nevertheless be intirely conformable to poetick truth which not only admits but necessarily presupposes prophecy or prognostication with regard to the actions and lives of heroes and great men besides that as to our subject in particular the natural genius of hercules even in his tenderest youth might alone answer for his handling such arms as these and bearing as it were in play these early tokens of the future hero   to preserve therefore a just conformity with historical truth and with the unity of time and action there remains no other way by which we can possibly give a hint of any thing future or call to mind any thing past than by setting in view such passages or events as have actually subsisted or according to nature might well subsist or happen together in one and the same instant and this is what we may properly call the rule of consistency  0 how is it therefore possible says one to express a change of passion in any subject since this change is made by succession and that in this case the passion which is understood as present will re shaftesbury         quire a disposition of body and features wholly different from the passion which is over and past to this we answer that notwithstanding the ascendency or reign of the principal and immediate passion the artist has power to leave still in his subject the tracts or footsteps of its predecessor so as to let us behold not     only a rising passion together with a declining one but what is more a strong and determinate passion with its contrary already dischargd and banishd as for instance when the plain tracts of tears new fallen with other fresh tokens of mourning and dejection remain still in a person newly transported with joy at the sight of a relation or friend who the moment before had been lamented as one deceasd or lost    again by the same means which are employd to call to mind the past we may anticipate the future as woud be seen in the case of an able painter who shoud undertake to paint this history of hercules according to the third date or period of time proposd for our historical tablature for in this momentary turn of action hercules remaining still in a situation expressive of suspense and doubt woud discover nevertheless that the strength of this inward conflict was over and that victory began now to declare herself in favour of virtue this shaftesbury          transition which seems at first so mysterious a performance will be easily comprehended if one considers that the body which moves much slower than the mind is easily outstripd by this latter and that the mind on a sudden turning itself some new way the nearer situated and more sprightly parts of the body such as the eyes and muscles about the mouth and forehead taking the alarm and moving in an instant may leave the heavier and more distant parts to adjust themselves and change their attitude some moments after    this different operation may be distinguishd by the names of anticipation and repeal    if by any other method an artist shoud pretend to introduce into this piece any portion of time future or past he must either sin directly against the law of truth and credibility in representing things contrary and incompatible or against that law of unity and simplicity of design which constitutes the very being of his work this particularly shews itself in a picture when one is necessarily left in doubt and unable to determine readily which of the distinct successive parts of the history or action is that veryone represented in the design for even here the shaftesbury          case is the same as     in the other circumstances of poetry and painting that what is principal or chief shoud immediately shew itself without leaving the mind in any uncertainty    according to this rule of the unity of time if one shoud ask an artist who had painted this history of the judgment of hercules which of these four periods or dates of time above proposd he intended in his picture to represent and it shoud happen that he coud not readily answer twas this or that it woud appear plainly he had never formd a real notion of his workmanship or of the history he intended to represent so that when he had executed even to a miracle all those other beautys requisite in a piece and had faild in this single one he woud from hence shaftesbury          alone be provd to be in truth no historypainter or artist in the kind who understood not so much as how to form the real design of a historical piece chap   chapter ii of the first or principal figure to apply therefore what has been said above to our immediate design or tablature in hand we may observe in the first place with regard to hercules the first or principal figure of our piece that being placd in the middle between the two goddesses he shoud by a skilful master be so drawn as even setting   0 aside the air and features of the face it shoud appear by the very turn or position of the body alone that this young hero had not wholly quitted the balancing or pondering part for in the manner of his turn towards the worthier of these goddesses he shoud by no means appear so averse or separate from the other as not to suffer it to be conceivd of him that he had ever any inclination for her or had ever hearkend to her voice on the contrary there ought to be some hopes yet remaining for this latter goddess pleasure and some regret apparent in her shaftesbury         cules otherwise we shoud pass immediately from the third to the fourth period or at least confound one with the other   hercules in this agony describd may appear either sitting or standing tho it be more according to probability for him to appear standing in regard to the presence of the two goddesses and by reason the case is far from being the same here as in the judgment of paris where the interested goddesses plead their cause before their judg here the interest of hercules himself is at stake tis his own cause which is trying he is in this respect not so much the judg as he is in reality the party judgd   the superior and commanding passion of hercules may be expressd either by a strong admiration or by an admiration which holds chiefly of love excited by an amorous love    if the latter be usd then the reluctant passion which is not yet wholly overcome may shew itself in pity and tenderness movd in our hero by the thought of those pleasures and companions of his youth which he is going for ever to abandon and in this sense hercules may look either on the one or the shaftesbury       0  other of the goddesses with this difference that if he looks on pleasure it shoud be faintly and as turning his eyes back with pity having still his action and gesture turnd the other way towards virtue if on the contrary he looks on virtue it ought to be earnestly     and with extreme attention having some part of the action of his body inclining still towards pleasure and discovering by certain features of concern and pity intermixd with the commanding or conquering passion that the decision he is about to make in favour of virtue cost him not a little   if it be thought fit rather to make use of admiration merely to express the commanding passion of hercules then the reluctantone may discover itself in a kind of horror at the thought of the toil and labour to be sustaind in the rough rocky way apparent on the side of virtue   again hercules may be represented as looking neither towards virtue nor pleasure but as turning his eyes either towards the mountainous rocky way pointed out to him by virtue or towards the flowry way of the vale and meadows recommended to him by pleasure and to these different attitudes may be applyd the same shaftesbury          rules for the expression of the turn or balance of judgment in our pensive hero   whatever may be the manner chosen for the designing of this figure of hercules according to that part of the history in which we have taken him tis certain he shoud be so drawn as neither by the opening of his mouth or by any other sign to leave it in the least dubious whether he is speaking or silent for tis absolutely requisite that silence shoud be distinctly characterizd in hercules not only as the natural effect of his strict attention and the little leisure he has from what passes at this time within his breast but in order withal to give that appearance of majesty and superiority becoming the person and character of pleading virtue who by her eloquence and other charms has ere this made herself mistress of the heart of our enamourd hero and again she hangs on the lips of the storyteller this image of the sublime in the discourse and manner of virtue woud be utterly lost if in the instant that she employd the     greatest force of action she shoud appear to be interrupted by the illtimd speech reply or utterance of her auditor such a design or representation as this woud prove contrary to order shaftesbury          contrary to the history and to the decorum or decency of manners nor can one well avoid taking notice here of that general absurdity committed by many of the esteemd great masters in painting who in one and the same company or assembly of persons jointly employd and united according to the history in one single or common action represent to us not only two or three but several and sometimes all speaking at once which must naturally have the same effect on the eye as such a conversation woud have upon the ear were we in reality to hear it chap   chapter iii of the second figure after what has been said on the subject of hercules it appears plainly what the attitude must be of our second figure virtue who as we have taken her in this particular period of our history must of necessity be speaking with all the force of action such as woud appear in an excellent orator when at the height and in the most affecting part of his discourse   she ought therefore to be drawn standing since tis contrary to all probable shaftesbury          appearance and even to nature itself that in the very heat and highest transport of speech the speaker shoud be seen sitting or in any posture which might express repose   she may be habited either as an amazon with the helmet lance and in the robe or vest of pallas or as any other of the virtues goddesses or heroines with the plain original crown without rays according to genuine antiquity our history makes no mention of a helmet or any other armour of virtue it gives us only to understand that she was dressd neither negligently nor with much study or ornament if we follow this latter method we     need give her only in her hand the imperial or magisterial sword which is her true characteristick mark and woud sufficiently distinguish her without the helmet lance or other military habit and in this manner the opposition between herself and her rival woud be still more beautiful and regular—but this beauty says one woud be discoverable only by the learned—perhaps so but then again there woud be no loss for others since noone woud find this piece the less intelligible on the account of this regulation on the contrary shaftesbury          one who chancd to know little of antiquity in general or of this history in particular woud be still further to seek if upon seeing an armed woman in the piece he shoud represent to himself either a pallas a bellona or any other warlike form or deity of the female kind   as for the shape countenance or person of virtue that which is usually given to pallas may fitly serve as a model for this dame as on the other side that which is given to venus may serve in the same manner for her rival the historian whom we follow represents virtue to us as a lady of a goodly form tall and majestick and by what he relates of her he gives us sufficiently to understand that tho she was neither lean nor of a tannd complexion she must have discoverd however by the substance and colour of her flesh that she was sufficiently accustomd to exercise pleasure on the other hand by an exact opposition is represented in better case and of a softness of complexion which speaks her manners and gives her a middle character between the person of a venus and that of a bacchinal nymph   as for the position or attitude of virtue tho in a historical piece such as ours is designd twoud on no account shaftesbury          be proper to have immediate recourse to the way of emblem one might on this occasion endeavour nevertheless by some artifice to give our figure as much as possible the resemblance of the same goddess as she is seen on medals and other antient emblematick pieces of like nature in this view she shoud be so designd as to stand firm     with her full poise upon one foot having the other a little advancd and raisd on a broken piece of ground or rock instead of the helmet or little globe on which we see her usually setting her foot as triumphant in those pieces of the emblematick kind a particular advantage of this attitude so judiciously assignd to virtue by antient masters is that it expresses as well her aspiring effort or ascent towards the stars and heaven as her victory and superiority over fortune and the world for so the poets have of old describd her   attempts a course by a path denied   †and deserts the path of difficult virtue and in our piece particularly where the arduous and rocky way of virtue requires to be emphatically represented the ascending posture of this figure with one foot advancd in a sort of climbing action over shaftesbury          the rough and thorny ground must of necessity if well executed create a due effect and add to the sublime of this ‡antient poetick work   as for the hands or arms which in real oratory and during the strength of elocution must of necessity be active tis plain in respect of our goddess that the arm in particular which she has free to herself and is neither incumberd with lance or     sword shoud be employd another way and come in to second the discourse and accompany it with a just emphasis and action accordingly virtue woud then be seen with this hand turnd either upwards to the rocky way markd out by her with approbation or to the sky or stars in the same sublime sense or downwards to the flowery way and vale as in a detesting manner and with abhorrence of what passes there or last of all in a disdainful sense and with the same appearance of detestation against pleasure herself each manner woud have its peculiar shaftesbury          advantage and the best profit shoud be made of this arm and hand at liberty to express either the disapprobation or the applause proposd it might prove however a considerable advantage to our figure of virtue if holding the lance or imperial sword slightly with one of her hands stretchd downwards she coud by that very hand and action be made to express the latter meaning opening for that purpose some of the lower fingers of this hand in a refusing or repelling manner whilst with the other arm and hand at liberty she shoud express as well the former meaning and point out to hercules the way which leads to honour and the just glory of heroick actions   from all these circumstances of history and action accompanying this important figure the difficulty of the design will sufficiently appear to those who carry their judgment beyond the mere form and are able to consider the character of the passion to which it is subjected for where a real character is markd and the inward form peculiarly describd tis necessary the outward shoud give place whoever shoud expect to see our figure of virtue in the exact mein of a fine talker curious in her choice of action and forming it according to the usual decorum and regular movement of one of the shaftesbury          fair ladys of our age woud certainly be far wide of the thought and genius of this piece such studyd action and artificial gesture may be allowd to the actors and actrices of the stage but the good painter must come a little nearer to truth and take care that his action be not theatrical or at second hand but original and drawn from nature herself     now altho in the ordinary tenour of discourse the action of the party might be allowd to appear so far governd and composd by art as to retain that regular contraste and nice balance of movement which painters are apt to admire as the chief grace of figures yet in this particular case where the natural eagerness of debate supported by a thorow antipathy and animosity is joind to a sort of enthusiastick agitation incident to our prophetick dame there can be little of that fashionable mein or genteel air admitted the painter who in such a piece as we describe is bound to preserve the heroick style will doubtless beware of representing his heroine as a mere scold yet this is certain that it were better for him to expose himself to the meanness of such a fancy and paint his lady in a high rant according to the common weakness of the sex than to engage in the embelishment of the mere form and forgetting the character of severity and reprimand belonging to the illustrious rival present shaftesbury          her to us a fair specious personage free of emotion and without the least bent or movement which shoud express the real pathetick of the kind chap   chapter iv of the third figure concerning pleasure there needs little to be said after what has been already remarkd in relation to the two preceding figures the truth of appearance that of history and even the decorum itself according to what has been explaind above require evidently that in this period or instant describd pleasure shoud be found silent she can have no other language allowd her than that merely of the eyes and twoud be a happy management for her in the design if in turning her eyes to meet those of hercules she shoud find his head and face already turnd so much on the contrary side as to shew it impossible for her as yet to discover the growing passion of this hero in favour of     her rival by this means she might still with good right retain her fond airs of dalliance and courtship as having yet discoverd no reason she has to be dissatisfyd shaftesbury       0   she may be drawn either standing leaning sitting or lying without a crown or crownd either with roses or with myrtle according to the painters fancy and since in this third figure the painter has so great a liberty left him he may make good advantage of it for the other two to which this latter may be subjected as the last in order and of least consequence   that which makes the greatest difficulty in the disposition or ordonnance of this figure pleasure is that notwithstanding the supine air and character of ease and indolence which shoud be given her she must retain still so much life and action as is sufficient to express her persuasive effort and manner of indication towards her proper paths those of the flowery kind and vale below whither she woud willingly guide our heros steps now shoud this effort be overstrongly expressd not only the supine character and air of indolence woud be lost in this figure of pleasure but what is worse the figure woud seem to speak or at least appear so as to create a double meaning or equivocal sense in painting which woud destroy what we have establishd as fundamental concerning the absolute reign of silence throout the rest of the piece in favour of virtue the shaftesbury          sole speaking party at this instant or third period of our history   according to a computation which in this way of reasoning might be made of the whole motion or action to be given to our figure of pleasure she shoud scarce have one fifth reservd for that which we may properly call active in her and have already termd her persuasive or indicative effort all besides shoud be employd to express if one may say so her inaction her supineness effeminacy and indulgent ease the head and body might intirely favour this latter passion one hand might be absolutely resignd to it serving only to support with much ado the lolling lazy body and if the other hand be requird to express some kind of gesture or action toward the road of pleasures recommended by this     dame the gesture ought however to be slight and negligent in the manner of one who has given over speaking and appears weary and spent   for the shape the person the complexion and what else may be further remarkd as to the air and manner of pleasure all this is naturally comprehended in the opposition as above stated between herself and virtue shaftesbury         chap   chapter v of the ornaments of the piece and chiefly of the drapery and perspective tis sufficiently known how great a liberty painters are usd to take in the colouring of their habits and of other draperys belonging to their historical pieces if they are to paint a roman people they represent em in different dresses tho it be certain the common people among em were habited very near alike and much after the same colour in like manner the egyptians jews and other antient nations as we may well suppose bore in this particular their respective likeness or resemblance one to another as at present the spaniards italians and several other people of europe but such a resemblance as this woud in the way of painting produce a very untoward effect as may easily be conceivd for this reason the painter makes no scruple to introduce philosophers and even apostles in various colours after a very extraordinary manner tis here that the historical truth must of necessity indeed give way to that which we call poetical as being governd not so much by reality as by probability shaftesbury          or plausible appearance so that a painter who uses his privilege or prerogative in this respect ought however to do it cautiously and with discretion and when occasion requires that he shoud present us his philosophers or apostles thus variously colourd he must take care at least so to mortify his colours that these plain poor men may not appear in his piece adornd like so many lords or princes of the modern garb       if on the other hand the painter shoud happen to take for his subject some solemn entry or triumph where according to the truth of fact all manner of magnificence had without doubt been actually displayd and all sorts of bright and dazling colours heapd together and advancd in emulation one against another he ought on this occasion in breach of the historical truth or truth of fact to do his utmost to diminish and reduce the excessive gaiety and splendor of those objects which woud otherwise raise such a confusion oppugnancy and riot of colours as woud to any judicious eye appear absolutely intolerable   it becomes therefore an able painter in this as well as in the other parts of his workmanship to have regard principally and above all to the agreement or shaftesbury          correspondency of things and to that end tis necessary he shoud form in his mind a certain note or character of unity which being happily taken woud out of the many colours of his piece produce if one may say so a particular distinct species of an original kind like those compositions in musick where among the different airs such as sonatas entrys or sarabands there are different and distinct species of which we may say in particular as to each that it has its own proper character or genius peculiar to itself   thus the harmony of painting requires that in whatever key the painter begins his piece he shoud be sure to finish it in the same   this regulation turns on the principal figure or on the two or three which are eminent in a tablature composd of many for if the painter happens to give a certain height or richness of colouring to his principal figure the rest must in proportion necessarily partake this genius but if on the contrary the painter shoud have chancd to give a softer air with more gentleness and simplicity of colouring to his principal figure the rest must bear a character proportionable and appear in an extraordinary simplicity shaftesbury          that one and the same spirit may without contest reign thro the whole of his design   our historical draught of hercules will afford us a very clear example in the case for considering that the hero is to appear   0 on this occasion retird and gloomy being withal in a manner naked and without any other covering than a lions skin which is itself of a yellow and dusky colour it woud be really impracticable for a painter to represent this principal figure in any extraordinary brightness or lustre from whence it follows that in the other inferior figures or subordinate parts of the work the painter must necessarily make use of such still quiet colours as may give to the whole piece a character of solemnity and simplicity agreeable with itself now shoud our painter honestly go about to follow his historian according to the literal sense of the history which represents virtue to us in a resplendent robe of the purest and most glossy white tis evident he must after this manner destroy his piece the good painter in this as in all other occasions of like nature must do as the good poet who undertaking to treat some common and known subject refuses however to follow strictly like a mere copyist or translator any preceding poet or histo shaftesbury         rian but so orders it that his work in itself becomes really new and original a public subject will be a private right to you if you will not linger around worthless and common matters nor will endeavor to return word for word as a conscientious interpreter   as for what relates to the perspective or scene of our historical piece it ought so to present itself as to make us instantly conceive that tis in the country and in a place of retirement near some wood or forest that this whole action passes for twoud be impertinent to bring architecture or buildings of whatever kind in view as tokens of company diversion or affairs in a place purposely chosen to denote solitude thoughtfulness and premeditated retreat besides that according to the poets our     guides and masters in this art neither the goddesses nor other divine forms of whatever kind card ever to present themselves to human sight elsewhere than in these deep recesses and tis worth observing here how particularly our philosophical historian affects to speak by way of prevention of the solitary place where hercules was retird and of his thoughtfulness preceding this apparition which from these circumstances may be construd shaftesbury          henceforward as a mere dream but as such a truly rational and divine one   as to the fortress temple or palace of virtue situated on a mountain after the emblematical way as we see represented in some pieces formd upon this subject there is nothing of this kind expressd by our historian and shoud this or any thing of a like nature present itself in our design it woud fill the mind with foreign fancys and mysterious views no way agreeable to the taste and genius of this piece nor is there any thing at the same time on pleasures side to answer by way of opposition to this palace of virtue which if expressd woud on this account destroy the just simplicity and correspondency of our work   another reason against the perspectivepart the architecture or other studyd ornaments of the landskipkind in this particular piece of ours is that in reality there being no occasion for these appearances they woud prove a mere incumbrance to the eye and woud of necessity disturb the sight by diverting it from that which is principal the history and fact whatsoever appears in a historical design which is not essential to the action serves only to confound the representation and perplex the mind more shaftesbury          particularly if these episodick parts are so lively wrought as to vie with the principal subject and contend for precedency with the figures and human life a just design or tablature shoud at first view discover what nature it is designd to imitate what life whether of the higher or lower kind it aims chiefly to represent the piece must by no means be equivocal or dubious but must with ease distinguish itself either as historical and moral or as perspective and merely natural if it be the latter of these beautys     which we desire to see delineated according to its perfection then the former must give place the higher life must be allayd and in a manner discountenancd and obscurd whilst the lower displays itself and is exhibited as principal even that which according to a term of art we commonly call stilllife and is in reality of the last and lowest degree of painting must have its superiority and just preference in a tablature of its own species tis the same in animalpieces where beasts or fowl are represented in landskip inanimates are principal tis the earth the water the stones and rocks which live all other life becomes subordinate humanity sense manners must in this place yield and become inferior twoud be a fault even to aim at the expression of any real beauty in this kind or go about to animate shaftesbury          or heighten in any considerable degree the accompanying figures of men or deitys which are accidentally introducd as appendices or ornaments in such a piece but if on the contrary the human species be that which first presents itself in a picture if it be the intelligent life which is set to view tis the other species the other life which must then surrender and become subservient the merely natural must pay homage to the historical or moral every beauty every grace must be sacrificd to the real beauty of this first and highest order for nothing can be more deformd than a confusion of many beautys and the confusion becomes inevitable where the subjection is not compleat  0 by the word moral are understood in this place all sorts of judicious representations of the human passions as we see even in battelpieces excepting those of distant figures and the diminutive kind which may rather be considerd as a sort of landskip in all other martial pieces we see expressd in lively action the several degrees of valor magnanimity cowardice terror anger according to the several characters of nations and particular men tis here that we may see heroes and chiefs such as the alexanders or constantines appear even in the hottest of the action shaftesbury       0  with a tranquillity and sedateness of mind peculiar to themselves which is indeed in a direct and proper sense profoundly moral    but as the moral part is differently treated in a poem from     what it is in history or in a philosophical work so must it of right in painting be far differently treated from what it naturally is either in the history or poem for want of a right understanding of this maxim it often happens that by endeavouring to render a piece highly moral and learned it becomes thorowly ridiculous and impertinent    for the ordinary works of sculpture such as the lowrelieves and ornaments of columns and edifices great allowance is made the very rules of perspective are here wholly reversd as necessity requires and are accommodated to the circumstance and genius of the place or building according to a certain oeconomy or order of a particular and distinct kind as will easily be observd by those who have thorowly studyd the trajan and antoninuspillars and other relieveworks of the antients in the same manner as to pieces of ingravd work medals or whatever shews itself in one substance as brass or stone or only by shade and light as in ordinary shaftesbury          drawings or stamps much also is allowd and many things admitted of the fantastick miraculous or hyberbolical kind tis here that we have free scope withal for whatever is learned emblematical or enigmatick but for the compleatly imitative and illusive art of painting whose character it is to employ in her works the united force of different colours and who surpassing by so many degrees and in so many privileges all other human fiction or imitative art aspires in a directer manner towards deceit and a command over our very sense she must of necessity abandon whatever is overlearned humorous or witty to maintain herself in what is natural credible and winning of our assent that she may thus acquit herself of what is her chief province the specious appearance of the object she represents otherwise we shall naturally bring against her the just criticism of horace on the scenical representation so nearly allyd to her whatsoever you show me disbelieving it i despise it         we are therefore to consider this as a sure maxim or observation in painting that a historical and moral piece must of necessity lose much of its natural simplicity and grace if any thing of the emblematical or enigmatick kind be shaftesbury          visibly and directly intermixd as if for instance the circle of the zodiack with its twelve signs were introducd now this being an appearance which carrys not any manner of similitude or colourable resemblance to any thing extant in real nature it cannot possibly pretend to win the sense or gain belief by the help of any poetical enthusiasm religious history or faith for by means of these indeed we are easily inducd to contemplate as realitys those divine personages and miraculous forms which the leading painters antient and modern have speciously designd according to the particular doctrine or theology of their several religious and national beliefs but for our tablature in particular it carrys nothing with it of the mere emblematical or enigmatick kind since for what relates to the double way of the vale and mountain this may naturally and with colourable appearance be represented at the mountains foot but if on the summit or highest point of it we shoud place the fortress or palace of virtue rising above the clouds this woud immediately give the enigmatical mysterious shaftesbury          air to our picture and of necessity destroy its persuasive simplicity and natural appearance    in short we are to carry this remembrance still along with us that the fewer the objects are besides those which are absolutely necessary in a piece the easier it is for the eye by one simple act and in one view to comprehend the sum or whole the multiplication of subjects tho subaltern renders the subordination more difficult to execute in the ordonnance or composition of a work and if the subordination be not perfect the order     which makes the beauty remains imperfect now the subordination can never be perfect except when the ordonnance is such that the eye not only runs over with ease the several parts of the design reducing still its view each moment to the principal subject on which all turns but when the same eye without the least detainment in any of the particular parts and resting as it were immovable in the middle or center of the tablature may see at once in an agreeable and perfect correspondency all which is there exhibited to the sight shaftesbury         chap   chapter vi of the casual or independent ornaments there remains for us now to consider only of the separate ornaments independent both of figures and perspective such as the †machinework or divinitys in the sky the winds cupids birds animals dogs or other loose pieces which are introducd without any absolute necessity and in a way of humour but as these belong chiefly to the ordinary life and to the comick or mixd kind our tablature which on the contrary is wholly epick heroick and in the tragick style woud not so easily admit of any thing in this light way   we may besides consider that whereas the mind is naturally led to fansy mystery in a work of such a genius or style of painting as ours and to confound with each other the two distinct kinds of the emblematick and merely historical or poetick we shoud take care not to afford shaftesbury          it this occasion of error and deviation by introducing into a piece of so uniform a design such appendices     or supplementary parts as under pretext of giving light to the history or characterizing the figures shoud serve only to distract or dissipate the sight and confound the judgment of the more intelligent spectators   will it then says one be possible to make out the story of these two dames in company with hercules without otherwise distinguishing them than as above describd—we answer it is possible and not that only but certain and infallible in the case of one who has the least genius or has ever heard in general concerning hercules without so much as having ever heard this history in particular but if notwithstanding this we woud needs add some exterior marks more declaratory and determinative of these two personages virtue and pleasure it may be performd however without any necessary recourse to what is absolutely of the emblemkind the manner of this may be explaind as follows   the energy or natural force of virtue according to the moral philosophy of highest note among the antients was expressd in the double effect of shaftesbury          forbearance and indurance or what we may otherwise call refrainment and support for the former the bit or bridle placd somewhere on the side of virtue may serve as emblem sufficient and for the second the helmet may serve in the same manner especially since they are each of them appurtenances essential to heroes who in the quality of warriors were also subduers or †managers of horses and that at the same time these are really portable instruments such as the martial dame who represents virtue may be well supposd to have brought along with her   on the side of pleasure certain vases and other pieces of imbossd plate wrought in the figures of satyrs fauns and bacchanals     may serve to express the debauches of the tablekind and certain draperys thrown carelesly on the ground and hung upon a neighbouring tree forming a kind of bower and couch for this luxurious dame may serve sufficiently to suggest the thought of other indulgences and to support the image of the effeminate indolent and amorous passions shaftesbury          besides that for this latter kind we may rest satisfyd tis what the painter will hardly fail of representing to the full the fear is lest he shoud overdo this part and express the affection too much to the life the appearance will no doubt be strongly wrought in all the features and proportions of this third figure which is of a relish far more popular and vulgarly ingaging than that other opposd to it in our historical design conc conclusion we may conclude this argument with a general reflection which seems to arise naturally from what has been said on this subject in particular that in a real historypainter the same knowledg the same study and views are requird as in a real poet never can the poet whilst he justly holds that name become a relator or historian at large he is allowd only to describe a single action not the actions of a single man or people the painter is a historian at the same rate but still more narrowly confind as in fact appears since it woud certainly prove a more ridiculous attempt to comprehend two or three distinct actions or parts of history in one picture shaftesbury          than to comprehend ten times the number in one and the same poem   tis well known that to each species of poetry there are natural proportions and limits assignd and it woud be a gross absurdity indeed to imagine that in a poem there was nothing which we coud call measure or number except merely in the verse an elegy and an epigram have each of em their measure and proportion as well as a tragedy or epick poem in the same manner as to painting sculpture or statuary there are particular measures     which form what we call a piece as for instance in mere portraiture a head or bust the former of which must retain always the whole or at least a certain part of the neck as the latter the shoulders and a certain part of the breast if any thing be added or retrenchd the piece is destroyd tis then a mangled trunk or dismemberd body which presents itself to our imagination and this too not thro use merely or on the account of custom but of necessity and by the nature of the appearance since there are such and such parts of the human body which are naturally matchd and must appear in company the section if unskilfully made being in reality horrid and representing rather an amputation in surgery than a seemly division or separa shaftesbury         tion according to art and thus it is that in general thro all the plastick arts or works of imitation whatsoever is drawn from nature with the intention of raising in us the imagination of the natural species or object according to real beauty and truth shoud be comprizd in certain compleat portions or districts which represent the correspondency or union of each part of nature with intire nature herself and tis this natural apprehension or anticipating sense of unity which makes us give even to the works of our inferior artizans the name of pieces by way of excellence and as denoting the justness and truth of work   in order therefore to succeed rightly in the formation of any thing truly beautiful in this higher order of design twere to be wishd that the artist who had understanding enough to comprehend what a real piece or tablature imported and who in order to this had acquird the knowledg of a whole and parts woud afterwards apply himself to the study of moral and poetick truth that by this means the thoughts sentiments or manners which hold the first rank in his historical work might appear sutable to the higher and nobler species of humanity in which he practisd to the genius of the age shaftesbury       0  which he describd and to the principal or main action which he chose to represent he woud then naturally learn to reject those false ornaments of affected graces exaggerated passions hyperbolical and prodigious forms which equally     with the mere capricious and grotesque destroy the just simplicity and unity essential in a piece and for his colouring he woud then soon find how much it became him to be reservd severe and chaste in this particular of his art where luxury and libertinism are by the power of fashion and the modern taste become so universally establishd   tis evident however from reason itself as well as from history and experience that nothing is more fatal either to painting architecture or the other arts than this false relish which is governd rather by what immediately strikes the sense than by what consequentially and by reflection pleases the mind and satisfies the thought and reason so that whilst we look on painting with the same eye as we view commonly the rich stuffs and colourd silks worn by our ladys and admird in dress equipage or furniture we must of necessity be effeminate in our taste and utterly set wrong as to all shaftesbury          judgment and knowledg in the kind for of this imitative art we may justly say that tho it borrows help indeed from colours and uses them as means to execute its designs it has nothing however more wide of its real aim or more remote from its intention than to make a shew of colours or from their mixture to raise a †separate and flattering pleasure to the sense shaftesbury           0     a letter concerning the art or science of design written from italy on the occasion of the judgment of hercules to my lord     the muses before all things vir georg lib ii         anthony ashley cooper shaftesbury march        naples a letter concerning design my lord this letter comes to your lordship accompanyd with a small writing intitled a notion for such alone can that piece deservedly be calld which aspires no higher than to the forming of a project and that too in so vulgar a science as painting but whatever the subject be if it can prove any way entertaining to you it will sufficiently answer my design and if possibly it may have that good success i shoud have no ordinary opinion of my project since i know how hard it woud be to give your lordship a real entertainment by any thing which was not in some respect worthy and useful shaftesbury         on this account i must by way of prevention inform your lordship that after i had conceivd my notion such as you see it upon paper i was not contented with this but fell directly to work and by the hand of a masterpainter brought it into practice and formd a real design this was not enough i resolvd afterwards to see what effect it woud have when taken out of mere blackandwhite into colours and thus a sketch was afterwards drawn this pleasd so well that being incouragd by the virtuosi who are so eminent in this part of the world i resolvd at last to engage my painter in the great work immediately a cloth was bespoke of a sutable dimension and the figures taken as big or bigger than the common life the subject being of the heroick kind and requiring rather such figures as shoud appear above ordinary human stature     thus my notion as light as it may prove in the treatise is become very substantial in the workmanship the piece is still in hand and like to continue so for some time otherwise the first draught or design shoud have accompanyd the treatise as the treatise does this letter but the design having grown thus into a sketch and the sketch afterwards into a shaftesbury          picture i thought it fit your lordship shoud either see the several pieces together or be troubled only with that which was the best as undoubtedly the great one must prove if the master i employ sinks not very much below himself in this performance far surely shoud i be my lord from conceiving any vanity or pride in amusements of such an inferior kind as these especially were they such as they may naturally at first sight appear i pretend not here to apologize either for them or for myself your lordship however knows i have naturally ambition enough to make me desirous of employing myself in business of a higher order since it has been my fortune in publick affairs to act often in concert with you and in the same views on the interest of europe and mankind there was a time and that a very early one of my life when i was not wanting to my country in this respect but after some years of hearty labour and pains in this kind of workmanship an unhappy breach in my health drove me not only from the seat of business but forcd me to seek these foreign climates where as mild as the winters generally are i have with much ado livd out this latterone and am now as your lordship finds employ shaftesbury         ing myself in such easy studys as are most sutable to my state of health and to the genius of the country where i am confind this in the mean time i can with some assurance say to your lordship in a kind of spirit of prophecy from what i have observd of the rising genius of our nation that if we live to see a peace any way answerable to that generous spirit with which this war was begun and carryd on for our own liberty and that of europe the figure we are like to make abroad and the increase of knowledg industry and sense at home will render united britain the principal seat of arts and by her politeness and advantages in this     kind will shew evidently how much she owes to those counsels which taught her to exert herself so resolutely in behalf of the common cause and that of her own liberty and happy constitution necessarily included i can myself remember the time when in respect of musick our reigning taste was in many degrees inferior to the french the long reign of luxury and pleasure under king charles the second and the foreign helps and studyd advantages given to musick in a following reign coud not raise our genius the least shaftesbury          in this respect but when the spirit of the nation was grown more free tho engagd at that time in the fiercest war and with the most doubtful success we no sooner began to turn ourselves towards musick and enquire what italy in particular producd than in an instant we outstripd our neighbours the french enterd into a genius far beyond theirs and raisd ourselves an ear and judgment not inferior to the best now in the world in the same manner as to painting tho we have as yet nothing of our own native growth in this kind worthy of being mentiond yet since the publick has of late begun to express a relish for ingravings drawings copyings and for the original paintings of the chief italian schools so contrary to the modern french i doubt not that in very few years we shall make an equal progress in this other science and when our humour turns us to cultivate these designing arts our genius i am persuaded will naturally carry us over the slighter amusements and lead us to that higher more serious and noble part of imitation which relates to history human nature and the chief degree or order of beauty i mean that of the rational life distinct from the merely vegetable and sensible as shaftesbury      00  in animals or plants according to those several degrees or orders of painting which your lordship will find suggested in this extemporary notion i have sent you as for architecture tis no wonder if so many noble designs of this kind have miscarryd amongst us since the genius of our nation has hitherto been so little turnd this way that thro several reigns we have patiently seen the noblest publick buildings perish     if i may say so under the hand of one single courtarchitect who if he had been able to profit by experience woud long since at our expence have provd the greatest master in the world but i question whether our patience is like to hold much longer the devastation so long committed in this kind has made us begin to grow rude and clamorous at the hearing of a new palace spoilt or a new design committed to some rash or impotent pretender tis the good fate of our nation in this particular that there remain yet two of the noblest subjects for architecture our princes palace and our house of parliament for i cant but fansy that when whitehall is thought of the neighbouring lords and commons will at the same time shaftesbury      0   be placd in better chambers and apartments than at present were it only for majestys sake and as a magnificence becoming the person of the prince who here appears in full solemnity nor do i fear that when these new subjects are attempted we shoud miscarry as grosly as we have done in others before our state in this respect may prove perhaps more fortunate than our church in having waited till a national taste was formd before these edifices were undertaken but the zeal of the nation coud not it seems admit so long a delay in their ecclesiastical structures particularly their metropolitan and since a zeal of this sort has been newly kindled amongst us tis like we shall see from afar the many spires arising in our great city with such hasty and sudden growth as may be the occasion perhaps that our immediate relish shall be hereafter censurd as retaining much of what artists call the gothick kind hardly indeed as the publick now stands shoud we bear to see a whitehall treated like a hamptoncourt or even a new cathedral like st pauls almost everyone now becomes concernd and interests himself in such publick structures even those pieces too are brought under the common censure which tho raisd shaftesbury      0   by private men are of such a grandure and magnificence as to become national ornaments the ordinary man may build his cottage or the plain gentleman his countryhouse according as he fansys but when a great man builds he will find little quarter from the     publick if instead of a beautiful pile he raises at a vast expence such a false and counterfeit piece of magnificence as can be justly arraignd for its deformity by so many knowing men in art and by the whole people who in such a conjuncture readily follow their opinion in reality the people are no small partys in this cause nothing moves successfully without em there can be no publick but where they are included and without a publick voice knowingly guided and directed there is nothing which can raise a true ambition in the artist nothing which can exalt the genius of the workman or make him emulous of afterfame and of the approbation of his country and of posterity for with these he naturally as a freeman must take part in these he has a passionate concern and interest raisd in him by the same genius of liberty the same laws and government by which his property and the rewards of his pains and industry are securd to him and to his generation after him shaftesbury      0  every thing cooperates in such a state towards the improvement of art and science and for the designing arts in particular such as architecture painting and statuary they are in a manner linkd together the taste of one kind brings necessarily that of the others along with it when the free spirit of a nation turns itself this way judgments are formd criticks arise the publick eye and ear improve a right taste prevails and in a manner forces its way nothing is so improving nothing so natural so congenial to the liberal arts as that reigning liberty and high spirit of a people which from the habit of judging in the highest matters for themselves makes em freely judg of other subjects and enter thorowly into the characters as well of men and manners as of the products or works of men in art and science so much my lord do we owe to the excellence of our national constitution and legal monarchy happily fitted for us and which alone coud hold together so mighty a people all sharers tho at so far a distance from each other in the government of themselves and meeting under one head in one vast metropolis whose enormous growth     however censurable in other respects is actually a cause that workmanship and shaftesbury      0   arts of so many kinds arise to such perfection what encouragement our higher powers may think fit to give these growing arts i will not pretend to guess this i know that tis so much for their advantage and interest to make themselves the chief partys in the cause that i wish no court or ministry besides a truly virtuous and wise one may ever concern themselves in the affair for shoud they do so they woud in reality do more harm than good since tis not the nature of a court such as courts generally are to improve but rather corrupt a taste and what is in the beginning set wrong by their example is hardly ever afterwards recoverable in the genius of a nation content therefore i am my lord that britain stands in this respect as she now does nor can one methinks with just reason regret her having hitherto made no greater advancement in these affairs of art as her constitution has grown and been establishd she has in proportion fitted herself for other improvements there has been no anticipation in the case and in this surely she must be esteemd wise as well as happy that ere she attempted to raise herself any other taste or relish she securd herself a shaftesbury      0   right one in government she has now the advantage of beginning in other matters on a new foot she has her models yet to seek her scale and standard to form with deliberation and good choice able enough she is at present to shift for herself however abandond or helpless she has been left by those whom it became to assist her hardly indeed coud she procure a single academy for the training of her youth in exercises as good soldiers as we are and as good horses as our climate affords our princes rather than expend their treasure this way have sufferd our youth to pass into a foreign nation to learn to ride as for other academys such as those for painting sculpture or architecture we have not so much as heard of the proposal whilst the prince of our rival nation raises academys breeds youth and sends rewards and pensions into foreign countrys to advance the interest and credit of his own now if notwithstanding the industry and pains of this foreign court and the     supine unconcernedness of our own the national taste however rises and already shews itself in many respects beyond that of our so highlyassisted neighbours what greater proof can there be of the superiority of genius in one of these nations above the other shaftesbury      0  tis but this moment that i chance to read in an article of one of the gazettes from paris that tis resolvd at court to establish a new academy for political affairs in it the present chiefminister is to preside having under him six academists douëz des talens nécessaires —no person to be receivd under the age of twenty five a thousand livres pension for each scholar—able masters to be appointed for teaching them the necessary sciences and instructing them in the treatys of peace and alliances which have been formerly made—the members to assemble three times a week—cest de ce seminaire says the writer quon tirera les secretaires dambassade qui par degrez pourront monter à de plus hauts emplois  i must confess my lord as great an admirer as i am of these regular institutions i cant but look upon an academy for ministers as a very extraordinary establishment especially in such a monarchy as france and at such a conjuncture as the present it looks as if the ministers of that court had discoverd lately some new methods of negotiation such as their predecessors richelieu shaftesbury      0   and mazarine never thought of or that on the contrary they have found themselves so declind and at such a loss in the management of this present treaty as to be forcd to take their lesson from some of those ministers with whom they treat a reproach of which no doubt they must be highly sensible but tis not my design here to entertain your lordship with any reflections upon politicks or the methods which the french may take to raise themselves new ministers or new generals who may prove a better match for us than hitherto whilst we held our   0 old i will only say to your lordship on this subject of academys that indeed i have less concern for the deficiency of such a one as this than of any other which coud be thought of for england and that as for a seminary of statesmen i doubt not but without this extraordinary help we shall be able out of our old stock and the common course of business constantly to furnish a sufficient number of wellqualifyd persons to serve upon occasion either at home or in our foreign treatys as often as such persons accordingly qualifyd shall duly honestly and bonâ fide be requird to serve shaftesbury      0  i return therefore to my virtuososcience which being my chief amusement in this place and circumstance your lordship has by it a fresh instance that i can never employ my thoughts with satisfaction on any subject without making you a party for even this very notion had its rise chiefly from the conversation of a certain day which i had the happiness to pass a few years since in the country with your lordship twas there you shewd me some ingravings which had been sent you from italy one in particular i well remember of which the subject was the very same with that of my written notion inclosd but by what hand it was done or after what master or how executed i have quite forgot twas the summerseason when you had recess from business and i have accordingly calculated this epistle and project for the same recess and leisure for by the time this can reach england the spring will be far advancd and the national affairs in a manner over with those who are not in the immediate administration were that indeed your lordships lot at present i know not whether in regard to my country i shoud dare throw such amusements as these in your way shaftesbury      0   yet even in this case i woud venture to say however in defense of my project and of the cause of painting that coud my young hero come to your lordship as well represented as he might have been either by the hand of a marat or a jordano the masters who were in being and in     repute when i first traveld here in italy the picture itself whatever the treatise provd woud have been worth notice and might have become a present worthy of our court and princes palace especially were it so blessd as to lodge within it a royal issue of her majestys such a piece of furniture might well fit the gallery or hall of exercises where our young princes shoud learn their usual lessons and to see virtue in this garb and action might perhaps be no slight memorandum hereafter to a royal youth who shoud one day come to undergo this trial himself on which his own happiness as well as the fate of europe and of the world woud in so great a measure depend this my lord is making as you see the most i can of my project and shaftesbury       0

naturally and of itself become relax and dissolute after such a relaxation and dissolution of manners consequent to the change of government and to the horrid luxury and effeminacy of the roman court even before the time of a claudius or a nero there was no more possibility of making a stand for language than for liberty as the world now stood the highest glory which coud be attaind by mortal man was to be mitigator or moderator of that universal tyranny already establishd to this i must add that in every city principality or smaller nation where single will prevails and courtpower instead of laws or constitutions guides the state tis of the highest difficulty for the best minister to procure a just or even a tolerable administration where such a minister is found who can but moderately influence the petty tyranny he deserves considerable applause and honour but in the case we have mentiond where a universal monarchy was actually establishd and the interest of a whole world concernd

sacrificial rites of god and was removing all the illwill from the mosaic reformation it was especially appropriate that god received some rites customary in former times into the number of his own sacred rituals and that the law given by moses carried some aspect of these assimilated practices certainly the israelites had been so born and reared having departed from egypt only recently that it was almost necessary to god it is right to say humane to indulge them in the practice of some of their former rituals and to adapt his laws to their habit and standard for they were a people habituated from childhood to the customs of the egyptians and confirmed in them by the practice of many years    the hebrews were accustomed not only to the manners of the egyptians but also to their obstinacies    just as a people from whatever locale and country have their own distinct character and habits peculiar to them so nature fashioned the race of the hebrews in distinction from the rest of the inhabitants of the world in disposition capricious difficult and stubborn even to the point of disgrace    therefore since the old hebrews had such harsh and savage manners the character of the people demanded that god would allow them some rituals of longstanding usage and a lawful servitude happened to them due to their own weakness just as theodorus says he established the ritual law suited to their weaknesses    the hebrews were a race full of superstitions and were almost destitute of all writing how deeply they were immersed in the superstitions of the race you may understand from the laws which were being imposed on the people as if they were antidotes for superstitions moreover stiffnecked superstition is a monster especially if from blind ignorance it will have drunk in a new ferocity and obstinacy in truth it can easily be believed that the israelites recently freed from slavery were untutored in civilized arts and scarcely had a taste for anything beyond the bricks and garlic of the egyptians and so since now god had a duty to people so barbarous and so thoroughly dedicated to superstition it was almost necessary that he give something to the inconstancy of those weak men and would draw them to himself by a certain trick not by arguments no animal is more full of dread so especially ignorant more wayward or in need of being taken in hand with greater

emperor by his greatest enemys even by those who to the shame of christianity boasted of his having been most insolently affronted on all occasions and even treacherously assassinated by one of his christian soldiers as for such authors as these shoud i cite them in their proper invective style and saintlike phrase they woud make no very agreeable appearance especially in miscellanys of the kind we have here undertaken but a letter of that elegant and witty emperor may not be improperly placd amongst our citations as a pattern of his humour and genius as well as of his principle and sentiments on this occasion julians epistles numb    julian to the bostrens i should have thought indeed that the galilaean leaders woud have esteemd themselves more indebted to me than to him who preceded me in the administration of the empire for in his time many of them sufferd exile persecution and imprisonment multitudes of those whom in their religion they term hereticks were put to the sword insomuch that in samosata cyzicum paphlagonia bithynia galatia and many other countrys whole towns were leveld with the earth the just reverse of this has been observd in my time the exiles have been recalld and the proscribd restord to the lawful possession of their estates but to that height of fury and distraction are this people arrivd that being no longer allowd the privilege to tyrannize over one another or persecute either their own sectarys or the religious of the lawful church they swell with rage and leave no stone unturnd no opportunity unimployd of raising tumult and sedition so little regard have they to true piety so little obedience to our laws and constitutions however humane and tolerating for still do we determine and steddily resolve never to suffer one of them to be drawn involuntarily to our altars    as for the mere people indeed they appear driven to these riots and seditions by those amongst them whom they call clericks who are now enragd to find themselves restraind in the use of their former power and intemperate rule    they can no longer act the magistrate or civil judg nor assume authority to make peoples wills supplant relations possess themselves of other mens patrimonys and by specious pretences transfer all into their own possession    for this reason i have thought fit by this publick edict to forewarn the people of this sort that they raise no more commotions nor gather in a riotous manner about their seditious clericks in defiance of the magistrate who has been insulted and in danger of being stond by these incited rabbles in their congregations they may notwithstanding assemble as they please and croud about their leaders performing worship receiving doctrine and praying according as they are by them taught and conducted but if with any tendency to sedition let them beware how they hearken or give assent and remember tis at their peril if by these means they are secretly wrought up to mutiny and insurrection    live therefore in peace and quietness neither spitefully opposing or injuriously treating one another you misguided people of the new way beware on your side and you of the antient and establishd church injure not your neighbours and fellowcitizens who are enthusiastically led away in ignorance and mistake rather than with design or malice tis by discourse and reason not by blows insults or

prescribd from of old by our peculiar laws concerning musick and the publick choruss that we shoud perform in the handsomest manner and with a just and manly countenance avoiding those grimaces and contortions of which some singers contract a habit and shall we not in the more immediate worship of the deity preserve this liberal air and manly appearance or on the contrary whilst we are nicely observant of other forms and decencys in the temple shall we neglect this greater decency in voice words and manners and with vile cries fawnings and prostitute behaviour betray the natural dignity and majesty of that divine religion and national worship deliverd down to us by our forefathers and purgd from every thing of a barbarous and savage kind what plutarch mentions here of the just countenance or liberal air the στόμα δίκαιον of the musical performer is agreeably illustrated in his alcibiades twas that heroick youth who as appears by this historian first gave occasion to the athenians of the higher rank wholly to abandon the use of flutes which had before been highly in favour with them the reason given was the illiberal air which attended such performers and the unmanly disfiguration of their looks and countenance which this pipingwork producd as for the real figure or plight of the superstitious mind our author thus describes it gladly woud the poor comfortless mind by whiles keep festival and rejoice but such as its religion is there can be no free mirth or joy belonging to it publick thanksgivings are but private mournings sighs and sorrows accompany its praises fears and horrors corrupt its best affections when it assumes the outward ornaments of best apparel for the temple it even then strikes melancholy and appears in paleness and ghastly looks while it worships it trembles it sends up vows in faint and feeble voices with eager hopes desires and passions discoverable in the whole disorder of the outward frame and in the main it evinces plainly by practice that the notion of pythagoras was but vain who dard assert that we were then in the best state and carryd our most becoming looks with us when we approachd the gods for then above all other seasons are the superstitious found in the most abject miserable state of mind and with the meanest presence and behaviour approaching the sacred shrines of the divine powers in the same manner as they woud the dens of bears or lions the caves of basilisks or dragons or other hideous recesses of wild beasts or raging monsters to me therefore it appears wonderful that we shoud arraign atheism as impious whilst superstition escapes the charge shall he who holds there are no divine powers be esteemd impious and shall not he be esteemd far more impious who holds the divine beings such

demonstrable testimonys for neither the societys or publick meetings in the temples nor the festivals themselves nor any other diverting partys sights or entertainments are more delightful or

having little of the orator and less of the constraint of formality belonging to some graver characters can be more familiar on this occasion and accordingly descending without the least scruple into whatever style or humour he refuses to make the least difficulty or mystery of this matter he pretends on this head to claim the assent not only of orators poets and the higher virtuosi but even of the beaux themselves and such as go no farther than the dancingmaster to seek for grace and beauty he pretends we see to fetch this natural idea from as familiar amusements as dress equipage the tiringroom or toyshop and thus in his proper manner of soliloquy or selfdiscourse we may imagine him running on beginning perhaps with some particular scheme or fansyd scale of beauty which according to his philosophy he strives to erect by distinguishing sorting and dividing into things animate inanimate and mixt as thus in the inanimate beginning from those regular figures and symmetrys with which children are delighted and proceeding gradually to the proportions of architecture and the other arts—the same in respect of sounds and musick from beautiful stones rocks minerals to vegetables woods aggregate parts of the world seas rivers mountains vales—the globe—celestial bodys and their order the higher architecture of nature—nature herself considerd as inanimate and passive in the animate from animals and their several kinds tempers sagacitys to men—and from single persons of men their private characters understandings geniuss dispositions manners to publick societys communitys or commonwealths—from flocks herds and other natural assemblages or groups of living creatures to human intelligencys and correspondencys or whatever is higher in the kind the correspondence union and harmony of nature herself considerd as animate and intelligent in the mixt as in a single person a body and a mind the union and harmony of this kind which constitutes the real person and the friendship love or whatever other affection is formd on such an object a houshold a city or nation with certain lands buildings and other appendices or local ornaments which jointly form that agreeable idea of home family country— and what of this says an airy spark no friend to meditation or deep thought what means this catalogue or scale as you are pleasd to call it only sir to satisfy myself that i am not alone or single in a certain fancy i have of a thing calld beauty that i have almost the whole world for my companions and that each of us admirers and earnest pursuers of beauty such as in a manner we all are if peradventure we take not a certain sagacity along with us we must err widely range extravagantly and run ever upon a false scent we may in the sportsmans phrase have many hares afoot but shall stick to no real game nor be fortunate in any capture which may content us see with what ardour and vehemence the young man neglecting his proper race and fellowcreatures and forgetting what is decent handsom or becoming in human affairs pursues these species in those common objects of his affection a horse a hound a hawk—what doting on these beautys—what admiration of the kind itself and of the particular animal what care and in a manner idolatry and consecration when the beast beloved is as often happens even set apart from use and only kept to gaze on and feed the enamourd fancy with highest delight—see in another youth not so forgetful of human kind but remembring it still in a wrong way a φιλόκαλος a lover of the beautiful of another sort a chaerea quàm elegans formarum spectator—see as to other beautys where there is no possession no enjoyment or reward but barely seeing and admiring as in the virtuosopassion the love of painting and the designing arts of every kind so often observd—how fares it with our princely genius our grandee who assembles all these beautys and within the bounds of his sumptuous palace incloses all these graces of a thousand kinds—what pains study science—behold the disposition and order of these finer sorts of apartments gardens villas—the kind of harmony to the eye from the various shapes and colours agreeably mixt and rangd in lines intercrossing without confusion and fortunately coincident—a parterre cypresses groves wildernesses—statues here and there of virtue fortitude temperance—heroesbusts philosophersheads with sutable mottos and inscriptions—solemn representations of things deeply natural—caves grottos rocks—urns and obelisks in retird places and disposd at proper distances and points of sight with all those symmetrys which silently express a reigning order peace harmony and beauty—but what is there answerable to this in the minds of the possessors—what possession or propriety is theirs what constancy or security of enjoyment what peace what harmony within— thus our monologist or selfdiscoursing author in his usual strain when incited to the search of beauty and the decorum by vulgar admiration and the universal acknowledgment of the species in outward things and in the meaner and subordinate subjects by this inferior species it seems our strict inspector disdains to be allurd and refusing to be captivated by any thing less than the superior original and genuine kind he walks at leisure without emotion in deep philosophical reserve thro all these pompous scenes passes unconcernedly by those courtpageants the illustrious and muchenvyd potentates of the place overlooks the rich the great and even the fair feeling no other astonishment than what is accidentally raisd in him by the view of these impostures and of this specious snare for here he observes those gentlemen chiefly to be caught and fastest held who are the highest ridiculers of such reflections as his own and who in the very height of this ridicule prove themselves the impotent contemners of a species which whether they will or no they ardently pursue some in a face and certain regular lines or features others in a palace and apartments others in an equipage and dress—o effeminacy effeminacy who woud imagine this coud be the vice of such as appear no inconsiderable men—but person is a subject of flattery which reaches beyond the bloom of youth the experiencd senator and aged general can in our days dispense with a toilet and take his outward form into a very extraordinary adjustment and regulation—all embellishments are affected besides the true and thus led by example whilst we run in search of elegancy and neatness pursuing beauty and adding as we imagine more lustre

extraordinary that the holy scriptures woud be the better relishd and receive a considerable advantage by the destruction of these rivals it seems they had no very high idea of the holy scriptures

priesthood when ignorance prevaild and the hierarchal dominion was so universal but tho their power had well nigh compassd the destruction of those great originals they were far from being able to

nouveau sujet de mépriser les patriarches de constantinople qui nétoient dailleurs rien moins que gens de bien mais jai de la poine à le croire parce quil nous est resté de poetes infiniment plus sales que ceux qui se sont perdus personne ne doute qu aristophane ne soit beaucoup plus sale que netoit menander plutarque en est un bon témoin dans la comparaison quil a faite de ces deux poetes il peuvoit être neanmoins arrivé que quelques ecclesiastiques ennemis des belles lettres en eussent usé comme dit chalcondyle sans penser quen conservant toute lantiquité grecque ils conserveroient la langue de leurs prédecesseurs  une infinité de faits qui servoient beaucoup à lintelligence  à la confirmation de lhistoire sacrée  même de la religion chretienne ces genslà devoient au moins nous conserver les histoires anciennes des orientaux comme des chaldéens des tyriens  des egyptiens mais ils agissoient plus par ignorance  par negligence que par raison if that is true behold yet again a new reason to disdain the patriarchs of constantinople who moreover were nothing less than good men but i have difficulty believing it because there has survived to us poets infinitely more bawdy than those who were lost no one doubts that aristophanes was not much more dirty than menander plutarch testifies well to this in the comparison he made of the two poets it could have happened nonetheless that certain clerics foes to belleslettres could have used them as chalcondyle says without thinking that by conserving all of greek antiquity they would conserve the language of their predecessors and an infinity of facts that would aid greatly in the understanding and confirmation of sacred history and even of the christian religion those men at least ought to conserve for us the ancient histories of the orientals such as the chaldeans the tyrians and the egyptians but they acted more from ignorance and negligence than by reason bibl chois tom xiv pag              such a one is the

imitator to look to the pattern which life presents and there learn the language of reality the chief of antient criticks we know extols homer above all things for understanding how to lye in perfection as the passage shews which we have cited above vol i pag     his lyes according to that masters opinion and the judgment of many of the gravest and most venerable writers were in themselves the justest moral truths and exhibitive of the best doctrine and instruction in life and manners it may be askd perhaps how comes the poet then to draw no single pattern of the kind no perfect character in either of his heroick pieces i answer that shoud he attempt to do it he woud as a poet be preposterous and false tis not the possible but the probable and likely which must be the poets guide in manners by this he wins attention and moves the conscious reader or spectator who judges best from within by what he naturally feels and experiences in his own heart the perfection of virtue is from long art and management selfcontroul and as it were force on nature but the common auditor or spectator who seeks pleasure only and loves to engage his passion by view of other passion and emotion comprehends little of the restraints allays and corrections which form this new and artificial creature for such indeed is the truly virtuous man whose art tho ever so natural in itself or justly founded in reason and nature is an improvement far beyond the common stamp or known character of human kind and thus the compleatly virtuous and perfect character is unpoetical and false effects must not appear where causes must necessarily remain unknown and incomprehensible a hero without passion is in poetry as absurd as a hero without life or action now if passion be allowd passionate action must ensue the same heroick genius and seeming magnanimity which transport us when beheld are naturally transporting in the lives and manners of the great who are describd to us and thus the able designer who feigns in behalf of truth and draws his characters after the moral rule fails not to discover natures propensity and assigns to these high spirits their proper exorbitancy and inclination to exceed in that tone or species of passion which constitutes the eminent or shining part of each poetical character the passion of an achilles is towards that glory which is acquird by arms and personal valour in favour of this character we forgive the generous youth his excess of ardor in the field and his resentment when injurd and provokd in council and by his allies the passion of an ulysses is towards that glory which is acquird by prudence wisdom and ability in affairs tis in favour of this character that we forgive him his subtle crafty and deceitful air since the intriguing spirit the overreaching manner and overrefinement of art and policy are as naturally incident to the experiencd and thorow politician as sudden resentment indiscreet and rash behaviour to the open undesigning character of a warlike youth the gigantick force and military toil of an ajax woud not be so easily credible or engaging but for the honest simplicity of his nature and the heaviness of his parts and genius for strength of body being so often noted by us as unattended with equal parts and strength of mind when we see this natural effect expressd and find our secret and malicious kind of reasoning confirmd on this hand we yield to any hyperbole of our poet on the other he has afterwards his full scope and liberty of enlarging and exceeding in the peculiar virtue and excellence of his hero he may lye splendidly raise wonder and be as astonishing as he pleases every thing will be allowd him in return for this frank allowance thus the tongue of a nestor may work prodigys whilst the accompanying allays of a rhetorical fluency and aged experience are kept in view an agamemnon may be admird as a noble and wise chief whilst a certain princely haughtiness a stiffness and stately carriage natural to the character are represented in his person and noted in their ill effects for thus the excesses of every character are by the poet redressd and the misfortunes naturally attending such excesses being justly applyd our passions whilst in the strongest manner engagd and movd are in the wholesomest and most effectual manner corrected and purgd were a man to form himself by one single pattern or original however perfect he woud himself be a mere copy but whilst he draws from various models he is original natural and unaffected we see in outward carriage and behaviour how ridiculous any one becomes who imitates another be he ever so graceful they are mean spirits who love to copy merely nothing is agreeable or natural but what is original our manners like our faces tho ever so beautiful must differ in their beauty an overregularity is next to a deformity and in a poem whether epick or dramatick a compleat and perfect character is the greatest monster and of all poetick fictions not only the least engaging but the least moral and improving—thus much by way of remark upon poetical truth and the just fiction or artful lying of the able poet according to the judgment of the mastercritick what horace expresses of the same lying virtue is of an easier sense and needs no explanation   atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet   primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum   de arte poet ver       such is his use of fiction such his combination of true and false that the middle does not clash with the beginning or the end with the middle the same may be observd not only in heroick draughts but in the inferior characters of comedy   quàm similis uterque est sui   ter phorm act iii sc   how like himself each man acts see vol i

studyd simplicity and affected it as the highest perfection in their performances they were therefore ignorant of parts and symphony against this is vossius amongst other authors cites the antient

in imitation of nature for painting by combining the natures of black and white yellow and red makes its representations correspond with their types music uniting sharp and grave notes and long and short syllables makes one harmony among different sounds grammar too bringing together vowels and consonants builds her whole art upon them this is the very point which was given forth by heraclitus the obscure who said combine wholes and parts that which is dispersed and that which is united that which makes discord and that which is in unison and out of all comes one and out of one comes all    there is one harmony arising from all the bodies which sound together and circle in the sky and it springs from one thing and ends in one we might with correct etymology call the universe an order but not a disorder and just as in a chorus when the leader has led off all the band of men and sometimes women joins in making by combination of different voices higher and lower one harmony in unison so it is also in the case of the deity who controls the universe see vol ii pag     and above pag           in the notes  viz supra misc i chap    magna inter molles concordia juven sat ii ver     to see the incorrigibleness of our poets in their pedantick manner their vanity defiance of criticism their rhodomontade and poetical bravado we need only turn to our famous poetlaureat the very mr bays himself in one of his latest and most valud pieces writ many years after the ingenious author of the rehearsal had drawn his picture i have been listening says our poet in his preface to don sebastian what objections had been made against the conduct of the play but found them all so trivial that if i shoud name them a true critick woud imagine that i plaid booty—some are pleasd to say the writing is dull but aetatem habet de se loquatur but he is mature let him speak for himself others that the double poison is unnatural let the common receivd opinion and ausoniuss famous epigram answer that lastly a more ignorant sort of creatures than either of the former maintain that the character of dorax is not only unnatural but inconsistent with itself let them read the play and think again—a longer reply is what those cavillers deserve not but i will give them and their fellows to understand that the earl of    was pleasd to read the tragedy twice over before it was acted and did me the favour to send me word that i had written beyond any of my former plays and that he was displeasd any thing shoud be cut away if i have not reason to prefer his single judgment to a whole faction let the world be judge for the opposition is the same with that of lucans hero against an army concurrere bellum atque virum they run together the war and the man i think i may modestly conclude c thus he goes on to the very end in the selfsame strain who after this can ever say of the rehearsalauthor that his picture of our poet was overchargd or the national humour wrong describd  viz plato aristotle

principal matters are founded upon truth and the rest as near resembling as may be tis a sceptick recites and the hero of the piece passes for an enthusiast if a perfect character be wanting tis the same case here as with the poets in some of their best pieces and this surely is a sufficient warrant for the author of a philosophical romance—thus our author himself who to conceal however his strict imitation of the antient poetick dialogue has prefixd an auxiliary title to his work and given it the sirname of rhapsody as if it were merely of that essay or mixd kind of works which come abroad with an affected air of negligence and irregularity but whatever our author may have affected in his titlepage twas so little his intention to write after that model of incoherent workmanship

and time sutable to the just simplicity of those dramatick works and this one woud think was easy enough for him to have done he needed only to have brought his first speakers immediately into action and savd the narrative or recitative part of philocles to palemon by producing them as speaking personages upon his stage the scene all along might have been the park from the early evening to the

epistlededicatory three or four leaves before        –            after which in the succeeding page he sums up his sense on this subject of sacred literature and the liberty of criticism and of private judgment and opinion in these matters in the following words since there are so many copys with infinite varietys of reading since a various interpunction a parenthesis a letter an accent may much alter the sense since some places have divers literal senses many have spiritual mystical and allegorical meanings since there are so many tropes metonymys ironys hyperboles proprietys and improprietys of language whose understanding depends upon such circumstances that it is almost impossible to know the proper interpretation now that the knowledg of such circumstances and particular storys is irrecoverably lost since there are some mysterys which at the best advantage of expression are not easy to be apprehended and whose explication by reason of our imperfections must needs be dark sometimes weak sometimes unintelligible and lastly since those ordinary means of expounding scripture as searching the originals conference of places parity of reason and analogy of faith are all dubious uncertain and very fallible he that is the wisest and by consequence the likeliest to expound truest in all probability of reason will be very far from confidence because every one of these and many more are like so many degrees of improbability and incertainty all depressing our certainty of finding out truth in such mysterys and amidst so many difficultys and therefore a wise man that considers this woud not willingly be prescribd to by others for it is best every man shoud be left in that liberty from which no man can justly take him unless he coud secure him from error the reverend prelate had but a few pages before viz pag     acknowledgd indeed that we had an apostolical warrant to contend earnestly for the faith but then says the good bishop very candidly and ingenuously as these things recede farther from the foundation our certainty is the less—and therefore it were very fit that our confidence shoud be according to our evidence and our zeal according to our confidence he adds pag  0  all these disputes concerning tradition councils fathers c are not arguments against or besides reason but contestations and pretenses of the best arguments and the most certain satisfaction of our reason but then all these coming into question submit themselves to reason that is to be judgd by human understanding upon the best grounds and information it can receive so that scripture tradition councils and fathers are the evidence in a question but reason is the judg that is we being the persons that are to be persuaded we must see that we be persuaded reasonably and it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser evidence when a greater and clearer is propounded but of that every man for himself is to take cognizance if he be able to judg if he be not he is not bound under the tie of necessity to know any thing of it  viz archbishop tillotson in his rule of faith pag      his grace subjoins immediately the traditionary church now receives the epistle to the hebrews as canonical i ask do they receive it as ever deliverd for such that they must if they receive it from oral tradition which conveys things to them under this notion as ever deliverd and yet st hierom speaking not as a speculator but a testifier says expressly of it that the custom of the latin church doth not receive it among the canonical scriptures what saith mr s     to this it is clear from this testimony that the roman church in st hieroms time did not acknowledg this epistle for canonical and tis as plain that the present roman church doth receive it for canonical † pag      the reader perhaps may find it worth while to read after this what the archbishop represents pag     c of the plausible introduction of the grossest article of belief in the times when the habit of making creeds came in fashion and accordingly it may be understood of what effect the dogmatizing practice in divinity has ever been we will suppose then that about the time when universal ignorance and the genuine daughter of it call her devotion or superstition had overspread the world and the generality of people were strongly inclind to believe strange things and even the greatest contradictions were recommended to them under the notion of mysterys being told by their priests and guides that the more contradictious any thing is to reason the greater merit there is in believing it i say let us suppose that in this state of things one or more of the most eminent then in the church either out of design or out of superstitious ignorance and mistake of the sense of our saviours words used in the consecration of the sacrament shoud advance this new doctrine that the words of consecration c    such a doctrine as this was very likely to be advancd by the ambitious clergy of that time as a probable means to draw in the people to a greater veneration of them    nor was such a doctrine less likely to take and prevail among the people in an age prodigiously ignorant and strongly inclind to superstition and thereby wellprepard to receive the grossest absurdities under the notion of mysterys    now supposing such a doctrine as this so fitted to the humour and temper of the age to be once asserted either by chance or out of design it woud take like wildfire especially if by some one or more who bore sway in the church it were but recommended with convenient gravity and solemnity     and for the contradictions containd in this doctrine it was but telling the people then as they do in effect now that contradictions ought to be no scruple in the way of faith that the more impossible any thing is tis the fitter to be believd that it is not praiseworthy to believe plain possibilitys but this is the gallantry and heroical power of faith this is the way to oblige god almighty for ever to us to believe flat and downright contradictions    the more absurd and unreasonable any thing is it is for that very reason the more proper matter for an article of faith and if any of these innovations be objected against as contrary to former belief and practice it is but putting forth a lusty act of faith and believing another contradiction that tho they be contrary yet they are the
