candide or the optimist to fully appreciate candide the most exquisite piece of philosophical banter ever penned it should be remembered that rousseau and pope had been preaching the creed that whatever is is right in this best of all possible worlds the terrible earthquake at lisbon thundered a scathing commentary on this comfortable gospel voltaire gave it noble expression in his poem on that calamity which should be read before candide is enjoyed the dignified eloquence and force of the poem moved rousseau to attempt a reply in an ingenious letter upholding the doctrine so shaken in its base disdaining a serious rejoinder voltaire retorted in this the drollest of profoundly philosophic queer stories which throws a merciless searchlight on the flimsier optimism of the period and stands as a perfect example of literary style razing a babel tower by the wave of a feather  0    chapter i how candide was brought up in a magnificent castle and how he was driven thence in the country of westphalia in the castle of the most noble baron of thundertentronckh lived a youth whom nature had endowed with a most sweet disposition his face was the true index of his mind he had a solid judgment joined to the most unaffected simplicity and hence i presume he had his name of candide the old servants of the house suspected him to have been the son of the barons sister by a very good sort of a gentleman of the neighborhood whom that young lady refused to marry because he could produce no more than threescore and eleven quarterings in his arms the rest of the genealogical tree belonging to the family having been lost through the injuries of time the baron was one of the most powerful lords in westphalia for his castle had not only a gate but even windows and his great hall was hung with tapestry he used to hunt with his mastiffs and spaniels instead of greyhounds his groom served him for huntsman and the parson of the parish    officiated as his grand almoner he was called my lord by all his people and he never told a story but every one laughed at it my lady baroness weighed three hundred and fifty pounds consequently was a person of no small consideration and then she did the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded universal respect her daughter was about seventeen years of age fresh colored comely plump and desirable the barons son seemed to be a youth in every respect worthy of the father he sprung from pangloss the preceptor was the oracle of the family and little candide listened to his instructions with all the simplicity natural to his age and disposition master pangloss taught the metaphysicotheologocosmolonigology he could prove to admiration that there is no effect without a cause and that in this best of all possible worlds the barons castle was the most magnificent of all castles and my lady the best of all possible baronesses it is demonstrable said he that things cannot be otherwise than as they are for as all things have been created for some end they must necessarily be created for the best end observe for instance the nose is formed for spectacles therefore we wear spectacles the legs are visibly designed for stockings accordingly we wear stockings stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles therefore my lord has a magnificent castle for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged    swine were intended to be eaten therefore we eat pork all the year round and they who assert that everything is right do not express themselves correctly they should say that everything is best candide listened attentively and believed implicitly for he thought miss cunegund excessively handsome though he never had the courage to tell her so he concluded that next to the happiness of being baron of thundertentronckh the next was that of being miss cunegund the next that of seeing her every day and the last that of hearing the doctrine of master pangloss the greatest philosopher of the whole province and consequently of the whole world one day when miss cunegund went to take a walk in a little neighboring wood which was called a park she saw through the bushes the sage doctor pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mothers chambermaid a little brown wench very pretty and very tractable as miss cunegund had a great disposition for the sciences she observed with the utmost attention the experiments which were repeated before her eyes she perfectly well understood the force of the doctors reasoning upon causes and effects she retired greatly flurried quite pensive and filled with the desire of knowledge imagining that she might be a sufficing reason for young candide and he for her on her way back she happened to meet the young man she blushed he blushed also she wished him    a good morning in a flattering tone he returned the salute without knowing what he said the next day as they were rising from dinner cunegund and candide slipped behind the screen the miss dropped her handkerchief the young man picked it up she innocently took hold of his hand and he as innocently kissed hers with a warmth a sensibility a grace—all very particular their lips met their eyes sparkled their knees trembled their hands strayed the baron chanced to come by he beheld the cause and effect and without hesitation saluted candide with some notable kicks on the breech and drove him out of doors the lovely miss cunegund fainted away and as soon as she came to herself the baroness boxed her ears thus a general consternation was spread over this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles chapter ii what befell candide among the bulgarians candide thus driven out of this terrestrial paradise rambled a long time without knowing where he went sometimes he raised his eyes all bedewed with tears towards heaven and sometimes he cast a melancholy look towards the magnificent castle where dwelt the fairest of young baronesses he laid himself down to sleep in a furrow heartbroken and supperless the snow fell in great flakes and    in the morning when he awoke he was almost frozen to death however he made shift to crawl to the next town which was called waldberghofftrarbkdikdorff without a penny in his pocket and half dead with hunger and fatigue he took up his stand at the door of an inn he had not been long there before two men dressed in blue fixed their eyes steadfastly upon him faith comrade said one of them to the other yonder is a well made young fellow and of the right size upon which they made up to candide and with the greatest civility and politeness invited him to dine with them gentlemen replied candide with a most engaging modesty you do me much honor but upon my word i have no money money sir said one of the blues to him young persons of your appearance and merit never pay anything why are not you five feet five inches high yes gentlemen that is really my size replied he with a low bow come then sir sit down along with us we will not only pay your reckoning but will never suffer such a clever young fellow as you to want money men were born to assist one another you are perfectly right gentlemen said candide this is precisely the doctrine of master pangloss and i am convinced that everything is for the best his generous companions next entreated him to accept of a few crowns which he readily complied with at the same time offering them his note for the payment which they refused and sat down to table    have you not a great affection for— o yes i have a great affection for the lovely miss cunegund may be so replied one of the blues but that is not the question we ask you whether you have not a great affection for the king of the bulgarians for the king of the bulgarians said candide oh lord not at all why i never saw him in my life is it possible oh he is a most charming king come we must drink his health with all my heart gentlemen says candide and off he tossed his glass bravo cry the blues you are now the support the defender the hero of the bulgarians your fortune is made you are in the high road to glory so saying they handcuffed him and carried him away to the regiment there he was made to wheel about to the right to the left to draw his rammer to return his rammer to present to fire to march and they gave him thirty blows with a cane the next day he performed his exercise a little better and they gave him but twenty the day following he came off with ten and was looked upon as a young fellow of surprising genius by all his comrades candide was struck with amazement and could not for the soul of him conceive how he came to be a hero one fine spring morning he took it into his head to take a walk and he marched straight forward conceiving it to be a privilege of the human species as well as of the brute creation to make use of their legs how and when they pleased he had not    gone above two leagues when he was overtaken by four other heroes six feet high who bound him neck and heels and carried him to a dungeon a courtmartial sat upon him and he was asked which he liked better to run the gauntlet six and thirty times through the whole regiment or to have his brains blown out with a dozen musketballs in vain did he remonstrate to them that the human will is free and that he chose neither they obliged him to make a choice and he determined in virtue of that divine gift called free will to run the gauntlet six and thirty times he had gone through his discipline twice and the regiment being composed of  000 men they composed for him exactly  000 strokes which laid bare all his muscles and nerves from the nape of his neck to his stern as they were preparing to make him set out the third time our young hero unable to support it any longer begged as a favor that they would be so obliging as to shoot him through the head the favor being granted a bandage was tied over his eyes and he was made to kneel down at that very instant his bulgarian majesty happening to pass by made a stop and inquired into the delinquents crime and being a prince of great penetration he found from what he heard of candide that he was a young metaphysician entirely ignorant of the world and therefore out of his great clemency he condescended to pardon him for which his name will be celebrated in every journal and in every age a skilful surgeon made a cure of    the flagellated candide in three weeks by means of emollient unguents prescribed by dioscorides his sores were now skinned over and he was able to march when the king of the bulgarians gave battle to the king of the abares chapter iii how candide escaped from the bulgarians and what befell him afterwards never was anything so gallant so well accoutred so brilliant and so finely disposed as the two armies the trumpets fifes hautboys drums and cannon made such harmony as never was heard in hell itself the entertainment began by a discharge of cannon which in the twinkling of an eye laid flat about  000 men on each side the musket bullets swept away out of the best of all possible worlds nine or ten thousand scoundrels that infested its surface the bayonet was next the sufficient reason of the deaths of several thousands the whole might amount to thirty thousand souls candide trembled like a philosopher and concealed himself as well as he could during this heroic butchery at length while the two kings were causing te deums to be sung in their camps candide took a resolution to go and reason somewhere else upon causes and effects after passing over heaps of dead or dying men the first place he came to was    a neighboring village in the abarian territories which had been burned to the ground by the bulgarians agreeably to the laws of war here lay a number of old men covered with wounds who beheld their wives dying with their throats cut and hugging their children to their breasts all stained with blood there several young virgins whose bodies had been ripped open after they had satisfied the natural necessities of the bulgarian heroes breathed their last while others half burned in the flames begged to be despatched out of the world the ground about them was covered with the brains arms and legs of dead men candide made all the haste he could to another village which belonged to the bulgarians and there he found the heroic abares had enacted the same tragedy thence continuing to walk over palpitating limbs or through ruined buildings at length he arrived beyond the theatre of war with a little provision in his budget and miss cunegunds image in his heart when he arrived in holland his provision failed him but having heard that the inhabitants of that country were all rich and christians he made himself sure of being treated by them in the same manner as at the barons castle before he had been driven thence through the power of miss cunegunds bright eyes he asked charity of several gravelooking people who one and all answered him that if he continued to follow this trade they would have him sent to the  0 house of correction where he should be taught to get his bread he next addressed himself to a person who had just come from haranguing a numerous assembly for a whole hour on the subject of charity the orator squinting at him under his broadbrimmed hat asked him sternly what brought him thither and whether he was for the good old cause sir said candide in a submissive manner i conceive there can be no effect without a cause everything is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best it was necessary that i should be banished from the presence of miss cunegund that i should afterwards run the gauntlet and it is necessary i should beg my bread till i am able to get it all this could not have been otherwise hark ye friend said the orator do you hold the pope to be antichrist truly i never heard anything about it said candide but whether he is or not i am in want to something to eat thou deservest not to eat or to drink replied the orator wretch monster that thou art hence avoid my sight nor ever come near me again while thou livest the orators wife happened to put her head out of the window at that instant when seeing a man who doubted whether the pope was antichrist she discharged upon his head a utensil full of water good heavens to what excess does religious zeal transport womankind a man who had never been christened an honest    anabaptist named james was witness to the cruel and ignominious treatment showed to one of his brethren to a rational twofooted unfledged being moved with pity he carried him to his own house caused him to be cleaned gave him meat and drink and made him a present of two florins at the same time proposing to instruct him in his own trade of weaving persian silks which are fabricated in holland candide penetrated with so much goodness threw himself at his feet crying now i am convinced that my master pangloss told me truth when he said that everything was for the best in this world for i am infinitely more affected with your extraordinary generosity than with the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black cloak and his wife the next day as candide was walking out he met a beggar all covered with scabs his eyes sunk in his head the end of his nose eaten off his mouth drawn on one side his teeth as black as a cloak snuffling and coughing most violently and every time he attempted to spit out dropped a tooth chapter iv how candide found his old master pangloss again and what happened to him candide divided between compassion and horror but giving way to the former bestowed on this shocking figure the two florins which the honest    anabaptist james had just before given to him the spectre looked at him very earnestly shed tears and threw his arms about his neck candide started back aghast alas said the one wretch to the other dont you know your dear pangloss what do i hear is it you my dear master you i behold in this piteous plight what dreadful misfortune has befallen you what has made you leave the most magnificent and delightful of all castles what has become of miss cunegund the mirror of young ladies and natures masterpiece oh lord cried pangloss i am so weak i cannot stand upon which candide instantly led him to the anabaptists stable and procured him something to eat as soon as pangloss had a little refreshed himself candide began to repeat his inquiries concerning miss cunegund she is dead replied the other dead cried candide and immediately fainted away his friend restored him by the help of a little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable candide opened his eyes and again repeated dead is miss cunegund dead ah where is the best of worlds now but of what illness did she die was it of grief on seeing her father kick me out of his magnificent castle no replied pangloss her body was ripped open by the bulgarian soldiers after they had subjected her to as much cruelty as a damsel could survive they knocked the baron her father on the head for attempting to defend her my lady her mother was    cut in pieces my poor pupil was served just in the same manner as his sister and as for the castle they have not left one stone upon another they have destroyed all the ducks and the sheep the barns and the trees but we have had our revenge for the abares have done the very same thing in a neighboring barony which belonged to a bulgarian lord at hearing this candide fainted away a second time but having come to himself again he said all that it became him to say he inquired into the cause and effect as well as into the sufficing reason that had reduced pangloss to so miserable a condition alas replied the preceptor it was love love the comfort of the human species love the preserver of the universe the soul of all sensible beings love tender love alas cried candide i have had some knowledge of love myself this sovereign of hearts this soul of souls yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty kicks on the backside but how could this beautiful cause produce in you so hideous an effect pangloss made answer in these terms o my dear candide you must remember pacquette that pretty wench who waited on our noble baroness in her arms i tasted the pleasures of paradise which produced these helltorments with which you see me devoured she was infected with an ailment and perhaps has since died of it she received this present of a learned cordelier who derived it from the fountain head he was indebted for it to an old    countess who had it of a captain of horse who had it of a marchioness who had it of a page the page had it of a jesuit who during his novitiate had it in a direct line from one of the fellowadventurers of christopher columbus for my part i shall give it to nobody i am a dying man o sage pangloss cried candide what a strange genealogy is this is not the devil the root of it not at all replied the great man it was a thing unavoidable a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds for if columbus had not caught in an island in america this disease which contaminates the source of generation and frequently impedes propagation itself and is evidently opposed to the great end of nature we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal it is also to be observed that even to the present time in this continent of ours this malady like our religious controversies is peculiar to ourselves the turks the indians the persians the chinese the siamese and the japanese are entirely unacquainted with it but there is a sufficing reason for them to know it in a few centuries in the meantime it is making prodigious havoc among us especially in those armies composed of welldisciplined hirelings who determine the fate of nations for we may safely affirm that when an army of thirty thousand men engages another equal in size there are about twenty thousand infected with syphilis on each side very surprising indeed said candide but    you must get cured lord help me how can i said pangloss my dear friend i have not a penny in the world and you know one cannot be bled or have a clyster without money this last speech had its effect on candide he flew to the charitable anabaptist james he flung himself at his feet and gave him so striking a picture of the miserable condition of his friend that the good man without any further hesitation agreed to take doctor pangloss into his house and to pay for his cure the cure was effected with only the loss of one eye and an ear as he wrote a good hand and understood accounts tolerably well the anabaptist made him his bookkeeper at the expiration of two months being obliged by some mercantile affairs to go to lisbon he took the two philosophers with him in the same ship pangloss during the course of the voyage explained to him how everything was so constituted that it could not be better james did not quite agree with him on this point men said he must in some things have deviated from their original innocence for they were not born wolves and yet they worry one another like those beasts of prey god never gave them twentyfour pounders nor bayonets and yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another to this account i might add not only bankruptcies but the law which seizes on the effects of bankrupts only to cheat the creditors all this was indispensably necessary replied the oneeyed doctor for    private misfortunes are public benefits so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good while he was arguing in this manner the sky was overcast the winds blew from the four quarters of the compass and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of lisbon chapter v a tempest a shipwreck an earthquake and what else befell dr pangloss candide and james the anabaptist onehalf of the passengers weakened and halfdead with the inconceivable anxiety and sickness which the rolling of a vessel at sea occasions through the whole human frame were lost to all sense of the danger that surrounded them the others made loud outcries or betook themselves to their prayers the sails were blown into shreds and the masts were brought by the board the vessel was a total wreck every one was busily employed but nobody could be either heard or obeyed the anabaptist being upon deck lent a helping hand as well as the rest when a brutish sailor gave him a blow and laid him speechless but with the violence of the blow the tar himself tumbled headforemost overboard and fell upon a piece of the broken mast which he immediately grasped honest james    forgetting the injury he had so lately received from him flew to his assistance and with great difficulty hauled him in again but in the attempt was by a sudden jerk of the ship thrown overboard himself in sight of the very fellow whom he had risked his life to save and who took not the least notice of him in this distress candide who beheld all that passed and saw his benefactor one moment rising above water and the next swallowed up by the merciless waves was preparing to jump after him but was prevented by the philosopher pangloss who demonstrated to him that the roadstead of lisbon had been made on purpose for the anabaptist to be drowned there while he was proving his argument a priori the ship foundered and the whole crew perished except pangloss candide and the sailor who had been the means of drowning the good anabaptist the villain swam ashore but pangloss and candide reached the land upon a plank as soon as they had recovered from their surprise and fatigue they walked towards lisbon with what little money they had left they thought to save themselves from starving after having escaped drowning scarcely had they ceased to lament the loss of their benefactor and set foot in the city when they perceived that the earth trembled under their feet and the sea swelling and foaming in the harbor was dashing in pieces the vessels that were riding at anchor large sheets of flames and cinders covered    the streets and public places the houses tottered and were tumbled topsyturvy even to their foundations which were themselves destroyed and thirty thousand inhabitants of both sexes young and old were buried beneath the ruins the sailor whistling and swearing cried damn it theres something to be got here what can be the sufficing reason of this phenomenon said pangloss it is certainly the day of judgment said candide the sailor defying death in the pursuit of plunder rushed into the midst of the ruin where he found some money with which he got drunk and after he had slept himself sober he purchased the favors of the first goodnatured wench that came in his way amidst the ruins of demolished houses and the groans of halfburied and expiring persons pangloss pulled him by the sleeve friend said he this is not right you trespass against the universal reason and have mistaken your time death and zounds answered the other i am a sailor and was born at batavia and have trampled four times upon the crucifix in as many voyages to japan you have come to a good hand with your universal reason in the meantime candide who had been wounded by some pieces of stone that fell from the houses lay stretched in the street almost covered with rubbish for gods sake said he to pangloss get me a little wine and oil i am dying    this concussion of the earth is no new thing said pangloss the city of lima in south america experienced the same last year the same cause the same effects there is certainly a train of sulphur all the way underground from lima to lisbon nothing is more probable said candide but for the love of god a little oil and wine probable replied the philosopher i maintain that the thing is demonstrable candide fainted away and pangloss fetched him some water from a neighboring spring the next day in searching among the ruins they found some eatables with which they repaired their exhausted strength after this they assisted the inhabitants in relieving the distressed and wounded some whom they had humanely assisted gave them as good a dinner as could be expected under such terrible circumstances the repast indeed was mournful and the company moistened their bread with their tears but pangloss endeavored to comfort them under this affliction by affirming that things could not be otherwise than they were for said he all this is for the very best end for if there is a volcano at lisbon it could be in no other spot and it is impossible but things should be as they are for everything is for the best by the side of the preceptor sat a little man dressed in black who was one of the familiars of the inquisition this person taking him up with great complaisance said possibly my good sir you do not believe in original sin for if everything  0 is best there could have been no such thing as the fall or punishment of man i humbly ask your excellencys pardon answered pangloss still more politely for the fall of man and the curse consequent thereupon necessarily entered into the system of the best of worlds that is as much as to say sir rejoined the familiar you do not believe in free will your excellency will be so good as to excuse me said pangloss free will is consistent with absolute necessity for it was necessary we should be free for in that the will— pangloss was in the midst of his proposition when the inquisitor beckoned to his attendant to help him to a glass of port wine chapter vi how the portuguese made a superb autodafé to prevent any future earthquakes and how candide underwent public flagellation after the earthquake which had destroyed threefourths of the city of lisbon the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to preserve the kingdom from utter ruin than to entertain the people with an autodafé it having been    decided by the university of coimbra that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire and with great ceremony is an infallible preventive of earthquakes in consequence thereof they had seized on a biscayan for marrying his godmother and on two portuguese for taking out the bacon of a larded pullet they were eating after dinner they came and secured doctor pangloss and his pupil candide the one for speaking his mind and the other for seeming to approve what he had said they were conducted to separate apartments extremely cool where they were never incommoded with the sun eight days afterwards they were each dressed in a sanbenito and their heads were adorned with paper mitres the mitre and sanbenito worn by candide were painted with flames reversed and with devils that had neither tails nor claws but doctor panglosss devils had both tails and claws and his flames were upright in these habits they marched in procession and heard a very pathetic sermon which was followed by an anthem accompanied by bagpipes candide was flogged to some tune while the anthem was being sung the biscayan and the two men who would not eat bacon were burned and pangloss was hanged which is not a common custom at these solemnities the same day there was another earthquake which made most dreadful havoc candide amazed terrified confounded astonished    all bloody and trembling from head to foot said to himself if this is the best of all possible worlds what are the others if i had only been whipped i could have put up with it as i did among the bulgarians but oh my dear pangloss my beloved master thou greatest of philosophers that ever i should live to see thee hanged without knowing for what o my dear anabaptist thou best of men that it should be thy fate to be drowned in the very harbor o miss cunegund you mirror of young ladies that it should be your fate to have your body ripped open he was making the best of his way from the place where he had been preached to whipped absolved and blessed when he was accosted by an old woman who said to him take courage child and follow me chapter vii how the old woman took care of candide and how he found the object of his love candide followed the old woman though without taking courage to a decayed house where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores showed him a very neat bed with a suit of clothes hanging by it and set victuals and drink before him there said she eat drink and sleep and may our blessed lady of atocha and the great st    anthony of padua and the illustrious st james of compostella take you under their protection i shall be back tomorrow candide struck with amazement at what he had seen at what he had suffered and still more with the charity of the old woman would have shown his acknowledgment by kissing her hand it is not my hand you ought to kiss said the old woman i shall be back tomorrow anoint your back eat and take your rest candide notwithstanding so many disasters ate and slept the next morning the old woman brought him his breakfast examined his back and rubbed it herself with another ointment she returned at the proper time and brought him his dinner and at night she visited him again with his supper the next day she observed the same ceremonies who are you said candide to her who has inspired you with so much goodness what return can i make you for this charitable assistance the good old beldame kept a profound silence in the evening she returned but without his supper come along with me said she but do not speak a word she took him by the arm and walked with him about a quarter of a mile into the country till they came to a lonely house surrounded with moats and gardens the old conductress knocked at a little door which was immediately opened and she showed him up a pair of back stairs into a small but richly furnished apartment there she made him sit down on a brocaded sofa shut the    door upon him and left him candide thought himself in a trance he looked upon his whole life hitherto as a frightful dream and the present moment as a very agreeable one the old woman soon returned supporting with great difficulty a young lady who appeared scarce able to stand she was of a majestic mien and stature her dress was rich and glittering with diamonds and her face was covered with a veil take off that veil said the old woman to candide the young man approached and with a trembling hand took off her veil what a happy moment what surprise he thought he beheld miss cunegund he did behold her—it was she herself his strength failed him he could not utter a word he fell at her feet cunegund fainted upon the sofa the old woman bedewed them with spirits they recovered—they began to speak at first they could express themselves only in broken accents their questions and answers were alternately interrupted with sighs tears and exclamations the old woman desired them to make less noise and after this prudent admonition left them together good heavens cried candide is it you is it miss cunegund i behold and alive do i find you again in portugal then you have not been ravished they did not rip open your body as the philosopher pangloss informed me indeed but they did replied miss cunegund but these two accidents do not always prove mortal but were your father and mother killed    alas answered she it is but too true and she wept and your brother and my brother also and how came you into portugal and how did you know of my being here and by what strange adventure did you contrive to have me brought into this house and how— i will tell you all replied the lady but first you must acquaint me with all that has befallen you since the innocent kiss you gave me and the rude kicking you received in consequence of it candide with the greatest submission prepared to obey the commands of his fair mistress and though he was still filled with amazement though his voice was low and tremulous though his back pained him yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation cunegund with her eyes uplifted to heaven shed tears when he related the death of the good anabaptist james and of pangloss after which she thus related her adventures to candide who lost not one syllable she uttered and seemed to devour her with his eyes all the time she was speaking chapter viii cunegunds story i was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased heaven to send the bulgarians to our delightful castle of thundertentronckh where they murdered    my father and brother and cut my mother in pieces a tall bulgarian soldier six feet high perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight attempted to ravish me the operation brought me to my senses i cried i struggled i bit i scratched i would have torn the tall bulgarians eyes out not knowing that what had happened at my fathers castle was a customary thing the brutal soldier enraged at my resistance gave me a wound in my left leg with his hanger the mark of which i still carry methinks i long to see it said candide with all imaginable simplicity you shall said cunegund but let me proceed pray do replied candide she continued a bulgarian captain came in and saw me weltering in my blood and the soldier still as busy as if no one had been present the officer enraged at the fellows want of respect to him killed him with one stroke of his sabre as he lay upon me this captain took care of me had me cured and carried me as a prisoner of war to his quarters i washed what little linen he possessed and cooked his victuals he was very fond of me that was certain neither can i deny that he was well made and had a soft white skin but he was very stupid and knew nothing of philosophy it might plainly be perceived that he had not been educated under doctor pangloss in three months having gambled away all his money and having grown tired of me he sold me to a jew named don    issachar who traded in holland and portugal and was passionately fond of women this jew showed me great kindness in hopes of gaining my favors but he never could prevail on me to yield a modest woman may be once ravished but her virtue is greatly strengthened thereby in order to make sure of me he brought me to this countryhouse you now see i had hitherto believed that nothing could equal the beauty of the castle of thundertentronckh but i found i was mistaken the grand inquisitor saw me one day at mass ogled me all the time of service and when it was over sent to let me know he wanted to speak with me about some private business i was conducted to his palace where i told him all my story he represented to me how much it was beneath a person of my birth to belong to a circumcised israelite he caused a proposal to be made to don issachar that he should resign me to his lordship don issachar being the court banker and a man of credit was not easy to be prevailed upon his lordship threatened him with an autodafé in short my jew was frightened into a compromise and it was agreed between them that the house and myself should belong to both in common that the jew should have monday wednesday and the sabbath to himself and the inquisitor the other four days of the week this agreement has subsisted almost six months but not without several contests whether the space from saturday night to sunday morning belonged to the    old or the new law for my part i have hitherto withstood them both and truly i believe this is the very reason why they are both so fond of me at length to turn aside the scourge of earthquakes and to intimidate don issachar my lord inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an autodafé he did me the honor to invite me to the ceremony i had a very good seat and refreshments of all kinds were offered the ladies between mass and the execution i was dreadfully shocked at the burning of the two jews and the honest biscayan who married his godmother but how great was my surprise my consternation and concern when i beheld a figure so like pangloss dressed in a sanbenito and mitre i rubbed my eyes i looked at him attentively i saw him hanged and i fainted away scarce had i recovered my senses when i saw you stripped of clothing this was the height of horror grief and despair i must confess to you for a truth that your skin is whiter and more blooming than that of the bulgarian captain this spectacle worked me up to a pitch of distraction i screamed out and would have said hold barbarians but my voice failed me and indeed my cries would have signified nothing after you had been severely whipped how is it possible i said to myself that the lovely candide and the sage pangloss should be at lisbon the one to receive a hundred lashes and the other to be hanged by order of my lord inquisitor of whom i am so great a favorite pangloss    deceived me most cruelly in saying that everything is for the best thus agitated and perplexed now distracted and lost now half dead with grief i revolved in my mind the murder of my father mother and brother committed before my eyes the insolence of the rascally bulgarian soldier the wound he gave me in the groin my servitude my being a cookwench to my bulgarian captain my subjection to the hateful jew and my cruel inquisitor the hanging of doctor pangloss the miserere sung while you were being whipped and particularly the kiss i gave you behind the screen the last day i ever beheld you i returned thanks to god for having brought you to the place where i was after so many trials i charged the old woman who attends me to bring you hither as soon as was convenient she has punctually executed my orders and i now enjoy the inexpressible satisfaction of seeing you hearing you and speaking to you but you must certainly be halfdead with hunger i myself have a great inclination to eat and so let us sit down to supper upon this the two lovers immediately placed themselves at table and after having supped they returned to seat themselves again on the magnificent sofa already mentioned where they were in amorous dalliance when señor don issachar one of the masters of the house entered unexpectedly it was the sabbath day and he came to enjoy his privilege  0 and sigh forth his passion at the feet of the fair cunegund chapter ix what happened to cunegund candide the grand inquisitor and the jew this same issachar was the most choleric little hebrew that had ever been in israel since the captivity of babylon what said he thou galilean slut the inquisitor was not enough for thee but this rascal must come in for a share with me in uttering these words he drew out a long poniard which he always carried about him and never dreaming that his adversary had any arms he attacked him most furiously but our honest westphalian had received from the old woman a handsome sword with the suit of clothes candide drew his rapier and though he was very gentle and sweettempered he laid the israelite dead on the floor at the fair cunegunds feet holy virgin cried she what will become of us a man killed in my apartment if the peaceofficers come we are undone had not pangloss been hanged replied candide he would have given us most excellent advice in this emergency for he was a profound philosopher but since he is not here let us consult the old woman she was very sensible and was beginning to give her advice when another door opened on a sudden it was    now one oclock in the morning and of course the beginning of sunday which by agreement fell to the lot of my lord inquisitor entering he discovers the flagellated candide with his drawn sword in his hand a dead body stretched on the floor cunegund frightened out of her wits and the old woman giving advice at that very moment a sudden thought came into candides head if this holy man thought he should call assistance i shall most undoubtedly be consigned to the flames and miss cunegund may perhaps meet with no better treatment besides he was the cause of my being so cruelly whipped he is my rival and as i have now begun to dip my hands in blood i will kill away for there is no time to hesitate this whole train of reasoning was clear and instantaneous so that without giving time to the inquisitor to recover from his surprise he ran him through the body and laid him by the side of the jew heres another fine piece of work cried cunegund now there can be no mercy for us we are excommunicated our last hour is come but how could you who are of so mild a temper despatch a jew and an inquisitor in two minutes time beautiful maiden answered candide when a man is in love is jealous and has been flogged by the inquisition he becomes lost to all reflection the old woman then put in her word there are three andalusian horses in the stable with as    many bridles and saddles let the brave candide get them ready madam has a parcel of moidores and jewels let us mount immediately though i have lost one of natures cushions let us set out for cadiz it is the finest weather in the world and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night candide without any further hesitation saddled the three horses and miss cunegund the old woman and he set out and travelled thirty miles without once halting while they were making the best of their way the holy brotherhood entered the house my lord the inquisitor was interred in a magnificent manner and master issachars body was thrown upon a dunghill candide cunegund and the old woman had by this time reached the little town of avacena in the midst of the mountains of sierra morena and were engaged in the following conversation in an inn where they had taken up their quarters chapter x in what distress candide cunegund and the old woman arrive at cadiz and of their embarkation who could it be that has robbed me of my moidores and jewels exclaimed miss cunegund all bathed in tears how shall we live what    shall we do where shall i find inquisitors and jews who can give me more alas said the old woman i have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend father cordelier who lay last night in the same inn with us at badajoz god forbid i should condemn any one wrongfully but he came into our room twice and he set off in the morning long before us alas said candide pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world are common to all men and that everyone has an equal right to the enjoyment of them but according to these principles the cordelier ought to have left us enough to carry us to the end of our journey have you nothing at all left my dear miss cunegund not a maravedi replied she what is to be done then said candide sell one of the horses replied the old woman i will get up behind miss cunegund though i have only one cushion to ride on and we shall reach cadiz in the same inn there was a benedictine friar who bought the horse very cheap candide cunegund and the old woman after passing through lucina chellas and letrixa arrived at length at cadiz a fleet was then getting ready and troops were assembling in order to induce the reverend fathers jesuits of paraguay who were accused of having excited one of the indian tribes in the neighborhood of the town of the holy sacrament to revolt against the kings of spain and portugal candide having been in the bulgarian service performed    the military exercise of that nation before the general of this little army with so intrepid an air and with such agility and expedition that he received the command of a company of foot being now made a captain he embarked with miss cunegund the old woman two valets and the two andalusian horses which had belonged to the grand inquisitor of portugal during their voyage they amused themselves with many profound reasonings on poor panglosss philosophy we are now going into another world and surely it must be there that everything is for the best for i must confess that we have had some little reason to complain of what passes in ours both as to the physical and moral part though i have a sincere love for you said miss cunegund yet i still shudder at the reflection of what i have seen and experienced all will be well replied candide the sea of this new world is already better than our european seas it is smoother and the winds blow more regularly god grant it said cunegund but i have met with such terrible treatment in this world that i have almost lost all hopes of a better one what murmuring and complaining is here indeed cried the old woman if you had suffered half what i have there might be some reason for it miss cunegund could scarce refrain from laughing at the good old woman and thought it droll enough to pretend to a greater share of misfortunes than her own alas my good dame    said she unless you had been ravished by two bulgarians had received two deep wounds in your belly had seen two of your own castles demolished had lost two fathers and two mothers and seen both of them barbarously murdered before your eyes and to sum up all had two lovers whipped at an autodafé i cannot see how you could be more unfortunate than i add to this though born a baroness and bearing seventytwo quarterings i have been reduced to the station of a cookwench miss replied the old woman you do not know my family as yet but if i were to show you my posteriors you would not talk in this manner but suspend your judgment this speech raised a high curiosity in candide and cunegund and the old woman continued as follows chapter xi the history of the old woman i have not always been bleareyed my nose did not always touch my chin nor was i always a servant you must know that i am the daughter of pope urban x and of the princess of palestrina to the age of fourteen i was brought up in a castle compared with which all the castles of the german barons would not have been fit for stabling and one of my robes would have bought half the    province of westphalia i grew up and improved in beauty wit and every graceful accomplishment and in the midst of pleasures homage and the highest expectations i already began to inspire the men with love my breast began to take its right form and such a breast white firm and formed like that of venus of medici my eyebrows were as black as jet and as for my eyes they darted flames and eclipsed the lustre of the stars as i was told by the poets of our part of the world my maids when they dressed and undressed me used to fall into an ecstasy in viewing me before and behind and all the men longed to be in their places i was contracted in marriage to a sovereign prince of massa carara such a prince as handsome as myself sweettempered agreeable witty and in love with me over head and ears i loved him too as our sex generally do for the first time with rapture transport and idolatry the nuptials were prepared with surprising pomp and magnificence the ceremony was attended with feasts carousals and burlettas all italy composed sonnets in my praise though not one of them was tolerable i was on the point of reaching the summit of bliss when an old marchioness who had been mistress to the prince my husband invited him to drink chocolate in less than two hours after he returned from the visit he died of most terrible convulsions but this is a mere trifle my mother distracted to the highest degree and yet less afflicted than i determined    to absent herself for some time from so fatal a place as she had a very fine estate in the neighborhood of gaeta we embarked on board a galley which was gilded like the high altar of st peters at rome in our passage we were boarded by a sallee rover our men defended themselves like true popes soldiers they flung themselves upon their knees laid down their arms and begged the corsair to give them absolution in articulo mortis the moors presently stripped us as bare as ever we were born my mother my maids of honor and myself were served all in the same manner it is amazing how quick these gentry are at undressing people but what surprised me most was that they made a rude sort of surgical examination of parts of the body which are sacred to the functions of nature i thought it a very strange kind of ceremony for thus we are generally apt to judge of things when we have not seen the world i afterwards learned that it was to discover if we had any diamonds concealed this practice has been established since time immemorial among those civilized nations that scour the seas i was informed that the religious knights of malta never fail to make this search whenever any moors of either sex fall into their hands it is a part of the law of nations from which they never deviate i need not tell you how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her mother to be made slaves and carried to morocco you may easily imagine    what we must have suffered on board a corsair my mother was still extremely handsome our maids of honor and even our common waitingwomen had more charms than were to be found in all africa as to myself i was enchanting i was beauty itself and then i had my virginity but alas i did not retain it long this precious flower which had been reserved for the lovely prince of massa carara was cropped by the captain of the moorish vessel who was a hideous negro and thought he did me infinite honor indeed both the princess of palestrina and myself must have had very strong constitutions to undergo all the hardships and violences we suffered before our arrival at morocco but i will not detain you any longer with such common things they are hardly worth mentioning upon our arrival at morocco we found that kingdom deluged with blood fifty sons of the emperor muley ishmael were each at the head of a party this produced fifty civil wars of blacks against blacks of tawnies against tawnies and of mulattoes against mulattoes in short the whole empire was one continued scene of carnage no sooner were we landed than a party of blacks of a contrary faction to that of my captain came to rob him of his booty next to the money and jewels we were the most valuable things he had i witnessed on this occasion such a battle as you never beheld in your cold european climates    the northern nations have not that fermentation in their blood nor that raging lust for women that is so common in africa the natives of europe seem to have their veins filled with milk only but fire and vitriol circulate in those of the inhabitants of mount atlas and the neighboring provinces they fought with the fury of the lions tigers and serpents of their country to decide who should have us a moor seized my mother by the right arm while my captains lieutenant held her by the left another moor laid hold of her by the right leg and one of our corsairs held her by the other in this manner almost all of our women were dragged by four soldiers my captain kept me concealed behind him and with his drawn scimitar cut down everyone who opposed him at length i saw all our italian women and my mother mangled and torn in pieces by the monsters who contended for them the captives my companions the moors who took us the soldiers the sailors the blacks the whites the mulattoes and lastly my captain himself were all slain and i remained alone expiring upon a heap of dead bodies similar barbarous scenes were transacted every day over the whole country which is of three hundred leagues in extent and yet they never missed the five stated times of prayer enjoined by their prophet mahomet i disengaged myself with great difficulty from such a heap of corpses and made a shift to crawl to a large orangetree that stood on the bank of a  00 neighboring rivulet where i fell down exhausted with fatigue and overwhelmed with horror despair and hunger my senses being overpowered i fell asleep or rather seemed to be in a trance thus i lay in a state of weakness and insensibility between life and death when i felt myself pressed by something that moved up and down upon my body this brought me to myself i opened my eyes and saw a pretty fairfaced man who sighed and muttered these words between his teeth o che sciagura dessere senza coglioni chapter xii the adventures of the old woman continued astonished and delighted to hear my native language and no less surprised at the young mans words i told him that there were far greater misfortunes in the world than what he complained of and to convince him of it i gave him a short history of the horrible disasters that had befallen me and as soon as i had finished fell into a swoon again he carried me in his arms to a neighboring cottage where he had me put to bed procured me something to eat waited on me with the greatest attention comforted me caressed me told me that he had never seen anything so perfectly beautiful as myself and that he had never so much regretted the  0  loss of what no one could restore to him i was born at naples said he where they make eunuchs of thousands of children every year some die of the operation some acquire voices far beyond the most tuneful of your ladies and others are sent to govern states and empires i underwent this operation very successfully and was one of the singers in the princess of palestrinas chapel how cried i in my mothers chapel the princess of palestrina your mother cried he bursting into a flood of tears is it possible you should be the beautiful young princess whom i had the care of bringing up till she was six years old and who at that tender age promised to be as fair as i now behold you i am the same i replied my mother lies about a hundred yards from here cut in pieces and buried under a heap of dead bodies i then related to him all that had befallen me and he in return acquainted me with all his adventures and how he had been sent to the court of the king of morocco by a christian prince to conclude a treaty with that monarch in consequence of which he was to be furnished with military stores and ships to enable him to destroy the commerce of other christian governments i have executed my commission said the eunuch i am going to take  0  ship at ceuta and ill take you along with me to italy ma che sciagura dessere senza coglioni i thanked him with tears of joy but instead of taking me with him into italy he carried me to algiers and sold me to the dey of that province i had not been long a slave when the plague which had made the tour of africa asia and europe broke out at algiers with redoubled fury you have seen an earthquake but tell me miss have you ever had the plague never answered the young baroness if you had ever had it continued the old woman you would own an earthquake was a trifle to it it is very common in africa i was seized with it figure to yourself the distressed condition of the daughter of a pope only fifteen years old and who in less than three months had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery had been debauched almost every day had beheld her mother cut into four quarters had experienced the scourges of famine and war and was now dying of the plague at algiers i did not however die of it but my eunuch and the dey and almost the whole seraglio of algiers were swept off as soon as the first fury of this dreadful pestilence was over a sale was made of the deys slaves i was purchased by a merchant who carried me to tunis this man sold me to another merchant who sold me again to another at tripoli from tripoli i was sold to alexandria from alexandria to smyrna  0  and from smyrna to constantinople after many changes i at length became the property of an aga of the janissaries who soon after i came into his possession was ordered away to the defence of azoff then besieged by the russians the aga being very fond of women took his whole seraglio with him and lodged us in a small fort with two black eunuchs and twenty soldiers for our guard our army made a great slaughter among the russians but they soon returned us the compliment azoff was taken by storm and the enemy spared neither age sex nor condition but put all to the sword and laid the city in ashes our little fort alone held out they resolved to reduce us by famine the twenty janissaries who were left to defend it had bound themselves by an oath never to surrender the place being reduced to the extremity of famine they found themselves obliged to kill our two eunuchs and eat them rather than violate their oath but this horrible repast soon failing them they next determined to devour the women we had a very pious and humane man who gave them a most excellent sermon on this occasion exhorting them not to kill us all at once cut off only one of the steaks of each of those ladies said he and you will fare extremely well if you are under the necessity of having recourse to the same expedient again you will find the like supply a few days hence heaven will approve of so charitable an action and work your deliverance  0  by the force of this eloquence he easily persuaded them and all of us underwent the operation the man applied the same balsam as they do to children after circumcision we were all ready to give up the ghost the janissaries had scarcely time to finish the repast with which we had supplied them when the russians attacked the place by means of flatbottomed boats and not a single janissary escaped the russians paid no regard to the condition we were in but there are french surgeons in all parts of the world and one of them took us under his care and cured us i shall never forget while i live that as soon as my wounds were perfectly healed he made me certain proposals in general he desired us all to be of a good cheer assuring us that the like had happened in many sieges and that it was perfectly agreeable to the laws of war as soon as my companions were in a condition to walk they were sent to moscow as for me i fell to the lot of a boyard who put me to work in his garden and gave me twenty lashes a day but this nobleman having about two years afterwards been broken alive upon the wheel with about thirty others for some court intrigues i took advantage of the event and made my escape i travelled over a great part of russia i was a long time an innkeepers servant at riga then at rostock wismar leipsic cassel utrecht leyden the hague and rotterdam i have grown old in misery and disgrace  0  living with only one buttock and having in perpetual remembrance that i am a popes daughter i have been a hundred times upon the point of killing myself but still i was fond of life this ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of the dangerous principles implanted in our nature for what can be more absurd than to persist in carrying a burden of which we wish to be eased to detest and yet to strive to preserve our existence in a word to caress the serpent that devours us and hug him close to our bosoms till he has gnawed into our hearts in the different countries which it has been my fate to traverse and at the many inns where i have been a servant i have observed a prodigious number of people who held their existence in abhorrence and yet i never knew more than twelve who voluntarily put an end to their misery namely three negroes four englishmen as many genevese and a german professor named robek my last place was with the jew don issachar who placed me near your person my fair lady to whose fortunes i have attached myself and have been more concerned with your adventures than with my own i should never have even mentioned the latter to you had you not a little piqued me on the head of sufferings and if it were not customary to tell stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time in short my dear miss i have a great deal of knowledge and experience in the world therefore  0  take my advice divert yourself and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story and if there is one of them all that has not cursed his existence many times and said to himself over and over again that he was the most wretched of mortals i give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea chapter xiii how candide was obliged to leave the fair cunegund and the old woman the fair cunegund being thus made acquainted with the history of the old womans life and adventures paid her all the respect and civility due to a person of her rank and merit she very readily acceded to her proposal of engaging the passengers to relate their adventures in their turns and was at length as well as candide compelled to acknowledge that the old woman was in the right it is a thousand pities said candide that the sage pangloss should have been hanged contrary to the custom of an autodafé for he would have given us a most admirable lecture on the moral and physical evil which overspreads the earth and sea and i think i should have courage enough to presume to offer with all due respect some few objections while everyone was reciting his adventures the ship continued her way and at length arrived at buenos ayres where cunegund captain candide and the old woman landed and went to wait upon  0  the governor don fernando dibaraa y figueora y mascarenes y lampourdos y souza this nobleman carried himself with a haughtiness suitable to a person who bore so many names he spoke with the most noble disdain to everyone carried his nose so high strained his voice to such a pitch assumed so imperious an air and stalked with so much loftiness and pride that everyone who had the honor of conversing with him was violently tempted to bastinade his excellency he was immoderately fond of women and miss cunegund appeared in his eyes a paragon of beauty the first thing he did was to ask her if she was not the captains wife the air with which he made this demand alarmed candide who did not dare to say he was married to her because indeed he was not neither did he venture to say she was his sister because she was not and though a lie of this nature proved of great service to one of the ancients and might possibly be useful to some of the moderns yet the purity of his heart would not permit him to violate the truth miss cunegund replied he is to do me the honor to marry me and we humbly beseech your excellency to condescend to grace the ceremony with your presence don fernando dibaraa y figueora y mascarenes y lampourdos y souza twirling his mustachio and putting on a sarcastic smile ordered captain candide to go and review his company the gentle candide obeyed and the governor was left with  0  miss cunegund he made her a strong declaration of love protesting that he was ready to give her his hand in the face of the church or otherwise as should appear most agreeable to a young lady of her prodigious beauty cunegund desired leave to retire a quarter of an hour to consult the old woman and determine how she should proceed the old woman gave her the following counsel miss you have seventytwo quarterings in your arms it is true but you have not a penny to bless yourself with it is your own fault if you do not become the wife of one of the greatest noblemen in south america with an exceeding fine mustachio what business have you to pride yourself upon an unshaken constancy you have been outraged by a bulgarian soldier a jew and an inquisitor have both tasted of your favors people take advantage of misfortunes i must confess were i in your place i should without the least scruple give my hand to the governor and thereby make the fortune of the brave captain candide while the old woman was thus haranguing with all the prudence that old age and experience furnish a small bark entered the harbor in which was an alcayde and his alguazils matters had fallen out as follows the old woman rightly guessed that the cordelier with the long sleeves was the person who had taken miss cunegunds money and jewels while they and candide were at badajoz in their flight from lisbon this same friar attempted to sell some of the  0  diamonds to a jeweller who presently knew them to have belonged to the grand inquisitor and stopped them the cordelier before he was hanged acknowledged that he had stolen them and described the persons and the road they had taken the flight of cunegund and candide was already the towntalk they sent in pursuit of them to cadiz and the vessel which had been sent to make the greater despatch had now reached the port of buenos ayres a report was spread that an alcayde was going to land and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the inquisitor the sage old woman immediately saw what was to be done you cannot run away said she to cunegund but you have nothing to fear it was not you who killed my lord inquisitor besides as the governor is in love with you he will not suffer you to be illtreated therefore stand your ground then hurrying away to candide she said be gone hence this instant or you will be burned alive candide found there was no time to be lost but how could he part from cunegund and whither must he fly for shelter chapter xiv the reception candide and cacambo met with among the jesuits in paraguay candide had brought with him from cadiz such a footman as one often meets with on the coasts of spain and in the colonies he was the fourth part of   0 a spaniard of a mongrel breed and born in tucuman he had successively gone through the profession of a singing boy sexton sailor monk peddler soldier and lackey his name was cacambo he had a great affection for his master because his master was a very good man he immediately saddled the two andalusian horses come my good master let us follow the old womans advice and make all the haste we can from this place without staying to look behind us candide burst into a flood of tears o my dear cunegund must i then be compelled to quit you just as the governor was going to honor us with his presence at our wedding cunegund so long lost and found again what will now become of you lord said cacambo she must do as well as she can women are never at a loss god takes care of them and so let us make the best of our way but whither wilt thou carry me where can we go what can we do without cunegund cried the disconsolate candide by st james of compostella said cacambo you were going to fight against the jesuits of paraguay now let us go and fight for them i know the road perfectly well ill conduct you to their kingdom they will be delighted with a captain that understands the bulgarian drill you will certainly make a prodigious fortune if we cannot succeed in this world we may in another it is a great pleasure to see new objects and perform new exploits then you have been in paraguay asked candide     ay marry i have replied cacambo i was a scout in the college of the assumption and am as well acquainted with the new government of los padres as i am with the streets of cadiz oh it is an admirable government that is most certain the kingdom is at present upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter and divided into thirty provinces the fathers there are masters of everything and the people have no money at all this you must allow is the masterpiece of justice and reason for my part i see nothing so divine as the good fathers who wage war in this part of the world against the troops of spain and portugal at the same time that they hear the confessions of those very princes in europe who kill spaniards in america and send them to heaven at madrid this pleases me exceedingly but let us push forward you are going to see the happiest and most fortunate of all mortals how charmed will those fathers be to hear that a captain who understands the bulgarian military drill is coming among them as soon as they reached the first barrier cacambo called to the advance guard and told them that a captain wanted to speak to my lord the general notice was given to the main guard and immediately a paraguayan officer ran to throw himself at the feet of the commandant to impart this news to him candide and cacambo were immediately disarmed and their two andalusian horses were seized the two strangers were conducted between     two files of musketeers the commandant was at the further end with a threecornered cap on his head his gown tucked up a sword by his side and a halfpike in his hand he made a sign and instantly fourandtwenty soldiers drew up round the newcomers a sergeant told them that they must wait the commandant could not speak to them and that the reverend father provincial did not suffer any spaniard to open his mouth but in his presence or to stay above three hours in the province and where is the reverend father provincial said cacambo he has just come from mass and is at the parade replied the sergeant and in about three hours time you may possibly have the honor to kiss his spurs but said cacambo the captain who as well as myself is perishing of hunger is no spaniard but a german therefore pray might we not be permitted to break our fast till we can be introduced to his reverence the sergeant immediately went and acquainted the commandant with what he heard god be praised said the reverend commandant since he is a german i will hear what he has to say let him be brought to my arbor immediately they conducted candide to a beautiful pavilion adorned with a colonade of green marble spotted with yellow and with an intertexture of vines which served as a kind of cage for parrots hummingbirds guineahens and all other     curious kinds of birds an excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold and while the paraguayans were eating coarse indian corn out of wooden dishes in the open air and exposed to the burning heat of the sun the reverend father commandant retired to his cool arbor he was a very handsome young man roundfaced fair and freshcolored his eyebrows were finely arched he had a piercing eye the tips of his ears were red his lips vermilion and he had a bold and commanding air but such a boldness as neither resembled that of a spaniard nor of a jesuit he ordered candide and cacambo to have their arms restored to them together with their two andalusian horses cacambo gave the poor beasts some oats to eat close by the arbor keeping a strict eye upon them all the while for fear of surprise candide having kissed the hem of the commandants robe they sat down to table it seems you are a german said the jesuit to him in that language yes reverend father answered candide as they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great amazement and with an emotion that neither could conceal from what part of germany do you come said the jesuit from the dirty province of westphalia answered candide i was born in the castle of thundertentronckh     oh heavens is it possible said the commandant what a miracle cried candide can it be you said the commandant on this they both drew a few steps backwards then running into each others arms embraced and wept profusely is it you then reverend father you are the brother of the fair miss cunegund you that was slain by the bulgarians you the barons son you a jesuit in paraguay i must confess this is a strange world we live in o pangloss pangloss what joy would this have given you if you had not been hanged the commandant dismissed the negro slaves and the paraguayans who presented them with liquor in crystal goblets he returned thanks to god and st ignatius a thousand times he clasped candide in his arms and both their faces were bathed in tears you will be more surprised more affected more transported said candide when i tell you that miss cunegund your sister whose belly was supposed to have been ripped open is in perfect health where in your neighborhood with the governor of buenos ayres and i myself was going to fight against you every word they uttered during this long conversation was productive of some new matter of astonishment their souls fluttered on their tongues listened in their ears and sparkled in their eyes like true germans they continued a long     while at table waiting for the reverend father and the commandant spoke to his dear candide as follows chapter xv how candide killed the brother of his dear cunegund never while i live shall i lose the remembrance of that horrible day on which i saw my father and mother barbarously butchered before my eyes and my sister ravished when the bulgarians retired we searched in vain for my dear sister she was nowhere to be found but the bodies of my father mother and myself with two servant maids and three little boys all of whom had been murdered by the remorseless enemy were thrown into a cart to be buried in a chapel belonging to the jesuits within two leagues of our family seat a jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water which was confounded salty and a few drops of it went into my eyes the father perceived that my eyelids stirred a little he put his hand upon my breast and felt my heart beat upon which he gave me proper assistance and at the end of three weeks i was perfectly recovered you know my dear candide i was very handsome i became still more so and the reverend father croust superior of that house took a great fancy to me he gave me the habit of the order and some years afterwards i was sent to rome     our general stood in need of new recruits of young german jesuits the sovereigns of paraguay admit of as few spanish jesuits as possible they prefer those of other nations as being more obedient to command the reverend fathergeneral looked upon me as a proper person to work in that vineyard i set out in company with a polander and a tyrolese upon my arrival i was honored with a subdeaconship and a lieutenancy now i am colonel and priest we shall give a warm reception to the king of spains troops i can assure you they will be well excommunicated and beaten providence has sent you hither to assist us but is it true that my dear sister cunegund is in the neighborhood with the governor of buenos ayres candide swore that nothing could be more true and the tears began again to trickle down their cheeks the baron knew no end of embracing candide he called him his brother his deliverer perhaps said he my dear candide we shall be fortunate enough to enter the town sword in hand and recover my sister cunegund ah that would crown my wishes replied candide for i intended to marry her and i hope i shall still be able to effect it insolent fellow cried the baron you you have the impudence to marry my sister who bears seventytwo quarterings really i think you have an insufferable degree of assurance to dare so much as to mention such an audacious design to me     candide thunderstruck at the oddness of this speech answered reverend father all the quarterings in the world are of no signification i have delivered your sister from a jew and an inquisitor she is under many obligations to me and she is resolved to give me her hand my master pangloss always told me that mankind are by nature equal therefore you may depend upon it that i will marry your sister we shall see to that villain said the jesuit baron of thundertentronckh and struck him across the face with the flat side of his sword candide in an instant drew his rapier and plunged it up to the hilt in the jesuits body but in pulling it out reeking hot he burst into tears good god cried he i have killed my old master my friend my brotherinlaw i am the best man in the world and yet i have already killed three men and of these three two were priests cacambo who was standing sentry near the door of the arbor instantly ran up nothing remains said his master but to sell our lives as dearly as possible they will undoubtedly look into the arbor we must die sword in hand cacambo who had seen many of this kind of adventures was not discouraged he stripped the baron of his jesuits habit and put it upon candide then gave him the dead mans threecornered cap     and made him mount on horseback all this was done as quick as thought gallop master cried cacambo everybody will take you for a jesuit going to give orders and we shall have passed the frontiers before they will be able to overtake us he flew as he spoke these words crying out aloud in spanish make way make way for the reverend fathercolonel chapter xvi what happened to our two travellers with two girls two monkeys and the savages called oreillons candide and his valet had already passed the frontiers before it was known that the german jesuit was dead the wary cacambo had taken care to fill his wallet with bread chocolate some ham some fruit and a few bottles of wine they penetrated with their andalusian horses into a strange country where they could discover no beaten path at length a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills opened to their view cacambo proposed to his master to take some nourishment and he set him an example how can you desire me to feast upon ham when i have killed the barons son and am doomed never more to see the beautiful cunegund what will it avail me to prolong a wretched life that must be     spent far from her in remorse and despair and then what will the journal of trévoux say was candides reply while he was making these reflections he still continued eating the sun was now on the point of setting when the ears of our two wanderers were assailed with cries which seemed to be uttered by a female voice they could not tell whether these were cries of grief or of joy however they instantly started up full of that inquietude and apprehension which a strange place naturally inspires the cries proceeded from two young women who were tripping disrobed along the mead while two monkeys followed close at their heels biting at their limbs candide was touched with compassion he had learned to shoot while he was among the bulgarians and he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching a leaf accordingly he took up his doublebarrelled spanish gun pulled the trigger and laid the two monkeys lifeless on the ground god be praised my dear cacambo i have rescued two poor girls from a most perilous situation if i have committed a sin in killing an inquisitor and a jesuit i have made ample amends by saving the lives of these two distressed damsels who knows but they may be young ladies of a good family and that the assistance i have been so happy to give them may procure us great advantage in this country he was about to continue when he felt himself struck speechless at seeing the two girls embracing   0 the dead bodies of the monkeys in the tenderest manner bathing their wounds with their tears and rending the air with the most doleful lamentations really said he to cacambo i should not have expected to see such a prodigious share of good nature master replied the knowing valet you have made a precious piece of work of it do you know that you have killed the lovers of these two ladies their lovers cacambo you are jesting it cannot be i can never believe it dear sir replied cacambo you are surprised at everything why should you think it so strange that there should be a country where monkeys insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies they are the fourth part of a man as i am the fourth part of a spaniard alas replied candide i remember to have heard my master pangloss say that such accidents as these frequently came to pass in former times and that these commixtures are productive of centaurs fauns and satyrs and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters but i looked upon the whole as fabulous now you are convinced said cacambo that it is very true and you see what use is made of those creatures by persons who have not had a proper education all i am afraid of is that these same ladies may play us some ugly trick these judicious reflections operated so far on     candide as to make him quit the meadow and strike into a thicket there he and cacambo supped and after heartily cursing the grand inquisitor the governor of buenos ayres and the baron they fell asleep on the ground when they awoke they were surprised to find that they could not move the reason was that the oreillons who inhabit that country and to whom the ladies had given information of these two strangers had bound them with cords made of the bark of trees they saw themselves surrounded by fifty naked oreillons armed with bows and arrows clubs and hatchets of flint some were making a fire under a large cauldron and others were preparing spits crying out one and all a jesuit a jesuit we shall be revenged we shall have excellent cheer let us eat this jesuit let us eat him up i told you master cried cacambo mournfully that these two wenches would play us some scurvy trick candide seeing the cauldron and the spits cried out i suppose they are going either to boil or roast us ah what would pangloss say if he were to see how pure nature is formed everything is right it may be so but i must confess it is something hard to be bereft of dear miss cunegund and to be spitted like a rabbit by these barbarous oreillons cacambo who never lost his presence of mind in distress said to the disconsolate candide do not     despair i understand a little of the jargon of these people i will speak to them ay pray do said candide and be sure you make them sensible of the horrid barbarity of boiling and roasting human creatures and how little of christianity there is in such practices gentlemen said cacambo you think perhaps you are going to feast upon a jesuit if so it is mighty well nothing can be more agreeable to justice than thus to treat your enemies indeed the law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbor and accordingly we find this practised all over the world and if we do not indulge ourselves in eating human flesh it is because we have much better fare but for your parts who have not such resources as we it is certainly much better judged to feast upon your enemies than to throw their bodies to the fowls of the air and thus lose all the fruits of your victory but surely gentlemen you would not choose to eat your friends you imagine you are going to roast a jesuit whereas my master is your friend your defender and you are going to spit the very man who has been destroying your enemies as to myself i am your countryman this gentleman is my master and so far from being a jesuit give me leave to tell you he has very lately killed one of that order whose spoils he now wears and which have probably occasioned your mistake to convince you of the truth of what i say take the habit he has on and carry it to the first barrier of the jesuits kingdom     and inquire whether my master did not kill one of their officers there will be little or no time lost by this and you may still reserve our bodies in your power to feast on if you should find what we have told you to be false but on the contrary if you find it to be true i am persuaded you are too well acquainted with the principles of the laws of society humanity and justice not to use us courteously and suffer us to depart unhurt this speech appeared very reasonable to the oreillons they deputed two of their people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of this affair who acquitted themselves of their commission like men of sense and soon returned with good tidings for our distressed adventurers upon this they were loosed and those who were so lately going to roast and boil them now showed them all sorts of civilities offered them girls gave them refreshments and reconducted them to the confines of their country crying before them all the way in token of joy he is no jesuit he is no jesuit candide could not help admiring the cause of his deliverance what men what manners cried he if i had not fortunately run my sword up to the hilt in the body of miss cunegunds brother i should have certainly been eaten alive but after all pure nature is an excellent thing since these people instead of eating me showed me a thousand civilities as soon as they knew i was not a jesuit     chapter xvii candide and his valet arrive in the country of el dorado—what they saw there when they got to the frontiers of the oreillons you see said cacambo to candide this hemisphere is not better than the other now take my advice and let us return to europe by the shortest way possible but how can we get back said candide and whither shall we go to my own country the bulgarians and the abares are laying that waste with fire and sword or shall we go to portugal there i shall be burned and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted but how can i bring myself to quit that part of the world where my dear miss cunegund has her residence let us return towards cayenne said cacambo there we shall meet with some frenchmen for you know those gentry ramble all over the world perhaps they will assist us and god will look with pity on our distress it was not so easy to get to cayenne they knew pretty nearly whereabouts it lay but the mountains rivers precipices robbers savages were dreadful obstacles in the way their horses died with fatigue and their provisions were at an end they subsisted a whole month on wild fruit till at length they came to a little river bordered with cocoa trees the sight of which at once revived their drooping spirits     and furnished nourishment for their enfeebled bodies cacambo who was always giving as good advice as the old woman herself said to candide you see there is no holding out any longer we have travelled enough on foot i spy an empty canoe near the river side let us fill it with cocoanuts get into it and go down with the stream a river always leads to some inhabited place if we do not meet with agreeable things we shall at least meet with something new agreed replied candide let us recommend ourselves to providence they rowed a few leagues down the river the banks of which were in some places covered with flowers in others barren in some parts smooth and level and in others steep and rugged the stream widened as they went further on till at length it passed under one of the frightful rocks whose summits seemed to reach the clouds here our two travellers had the courage to commit themselves to the stream which contracting in this part hurried them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity at the end of fourandtwenty hours they saw daylight again but their canoe was dashed to pieces against the rocks they were obliged to creep along from rock to rock for the space of a league till at length a spacious plain presented itself to their sight this place was bounded by a chain of inaccessible mountains the country appeared cultivated equally     for pleasure and to produce the necessaries of life the useful and agreeable were here equally blended the roads were covered or rather adorned with carriages formed of glittering materials in which were men and women of a surprising beauty drawn with great rapidity by red sheep of a very large size which far surpassed the finest coursers of andalusia tetuan or mecquinez here is a country however said candide preferable to westphalia he and cacambo landed near the first village they saw at the entrance of which they perceived some children covered with tattered garments of the richest brocade playing at quoits our two inhabitants of the other hemisphere amused themselves greatly with what they saw the quoits were large round pieces yellow red and green which cast a most glorious lustre our travellers picked some of them up and they proved to be gold emeralds rubies and diamonds the least of which would have been the greatest ornament to the superb throne of the great mogul without doubt said cacambo those children must be the kings sons that are playing at quoits as he was uttering these words the schoolmaster of the village appeared who came to call the children to school there said candide is the preceptor of the royal family the little ragamuffins immediately quitted their     diversion leaving the quoits on the ground with all their other playthings candide gathered them up ran to the schoolmaster and with a most respectful bow presented them to him giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgot their gold and precious stones the schoolmaster with a smile flung them upon the ground then examining candide from head to foot with an air of admiration he turned his back and went on his way our travellers took care however to gather up the gold the rubies and the emeralds where are we cried candide the kings children in this country must have an excellent education since they are taught to show such a contempt for gold and precious stones cacambo was as much surprised as his master they then drew near the first house in the village which was built after the manner of a european palace there was a crowd of people about the door and a still greater number in the house the sound of the most delightful instruments of music was heard and the most agreeable smell came from the kitchen cacambo went up to the door and heard those within talking in the peruvian language which was his mother tongue for every one knows that cacambo was born in a village of tucuman where no other language is spoken i will be your interpreter here said he to candide let us go in this is an eatinghouse immediately two waiters and two servantgirls     dressed in cloth of gold and their hair braided with ribbons of tissue accosted the strangers and invited them to sit down to the ordinary their dinner consisted of four dishes of different soups each garnished with two young paroquets a large dish of bouillé that weighed two hundred weight two roasted monkeys of a delicious flavor three hundred hummingbirds in one dish and six hundred flybirds in another some excellent ragouts delicate tarts and the whole served up in dishes of rockcrystal several sorts of liquors extracted from the sugarcane were handed about by the servants who attended most of the company were chapmen and wagoners all extremely polite they asked cacambo a few questions with the utmost discretion and circumspection and replied to his in a most obliging and satisfactory manner as soon as dinner was over both candide and cacambo thought they should pay very handsomely for their entertainment by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked off the ground but the landlord and landlady burst into a fit of laughing and held their sides for some time when the fit was over gentlemen said the landlord i plainly perceive you are strangers and such we are not accustomed to charge pardon us therefore for laughing when you offered us the common pebbles of our highways for payment of your reckoning to be sure you have none of the coin of     this kingdom but there is no necessity of having any money at all to dine in this house all the inns which are established for the convenience of those who carry on the trade of this nation are maintained by the government you have found but very indifferent entertainment here because this is only a poor village but in almost every other of these public houses you will meet with a reception worthy of persons of your merit cacambo explained the whole of this speech of the landlord to candide who listened to it with the same astonishment with which his friend communicated it what sort of a country is this said the one to the other that is unknown to all the world and in which nature has everywhere so different an appearance to what she has in ours possibly this is that part of the globe where everything is right for there must certainly be some such place and for all that master pangloss could say i often perceived that things went very ill in westphalia chapter xviii what they saw in the country of el dorado cacambo vented all his curiosity upon his landlord by a thousand different questions the honest man answered him thus i am very ignorant sir but i am contented with my ignorance however we have in this neighborhood an old man retired from   0 court who is the most learned and communicative person in the whole kingdom he then conducted cacambo to the old man candide acted now only a second character and attended his valet they entered a very plain house for the door was nothing but silver and the ceiling was only of beaten gold but wrought in such elegant taste as to vie with the richest the antechamber indeed was only incrusted with rubies and emeralds but the order in which everything was disposed made amends for this great simplicity the old man received the strangers on his sofa which was stuffed with hummingbirds feathers and ordered his servants to present them with liquors in golden goblets after which he satisfied their curiosity in the following terms i am now one hundred and seventytwo years old and i learned of my late father who was equerry to the king the amazing revolutions of peru to which he had been an eyewitness this kingdom is the ancient patrimony of the incas who very imprudently quitted it to conquer another part of the world and were at length conquered and destroyed themselves by the spaniards those princes of their family who remained in their native country acted more wisely they ordained with the consent of their whole nation that none of the inhabitants of our little kingdom should ever quit it and to this wise ordinance we owe the preservation of our innocence and happiness the     spaniards had some confused notion of this country to which they gave the name of el dorado and sir walter raleigh an englishman actually came very near it about three hundred years ago but the inaccessible rocks and precipices with which our country is surrounded on all sides has hitherto secured us from the rapacious fury of the people of europe who have an unaccountable fondness for the pebbles and dirt of our land for the sake of which they would murder us all to the very last man the conversation lasted some time and turned chiefly on the form of government their manners their women their public diversions and the arts at length candide who had always had a taste for metaphysics asked whether the people of that country had any religion the old man reddened a little at this question can you doubt it said he do you take us for wretches lost to all sense of gratitude cacambo asked in a respectful manner what was the established religion of el dorado the old man blushed again and said can there be two religions then ours i apprehend is the religion of the whole world we worship god from morning till night do you worship but one god said cacambo who still acted as the interpreter of candides doubts certainly said the old man there are not two     nor three nor four gods i must confess the people of your world ask very extraordinary questions however candide could not refrain from making many more inquiries of the old man he wanted to know in what manner they prayed to god in el dorado we do not pray to him at all said the reverend sage we have nothing to ask of him he has given us all we want and we give him thanks incessantly candide had a curiosity to see some of their priests and desired cacambo to ask the old man where they were at which he smiling said my friends we are all of us priests the king and all the heads of families sing solemn hymns of thanksgiving every morning accompanied by five or six thousand musicians what said cacambo have you no monks among you to dispute to govern to intrigue and to burn people who are not of the same opinion with themselves do you take us for fools said the old man here we are all of one opinion and know not what you mean by your monks during the whole of this discourse candide was in raptures and he said to himself what a prodigious difference is there between this place and westphalia and this house and the barons castle ah master pangloss had you ever seen el dorado you would no longer have maintained that the castle of thundertentronckh was the finest of all possible     edifices there is nothing like seeing the world thats certain this long conversation being ended the old man ordered six sheep to be harnessed and put to the coach and sent twelve of his servants to escort the travellers to court excuse me said he for not waiting on you in person my age deprives me of that honor the king will receive you in such a manner that you will have no reason to complain and doubtless you will make a proper allowance for the customs of the country if they should not happen altogether to please you candide and cacambo got into the coach the six sheep flew and in less than a quarter of an hour they arrived at the kings palace which was situated at the further end of the capital at the entrance was a portal two hundred and twenty feet high and one hundred wide but it is impossible for words to express the materials of which it was built the reader however will readily conceive that they must have a prodigious superiority over the pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones twenty beautiful young virgins in waiting received candide and cacambo on their alighting from the coach conducted them to the bath and clad them in robes woven of the down of hummingbirds after which they were introduced by the great officers of     the crown of both sexes to the kings apartment between two files of musicians each file consisting of a thousand agreeable to the custom of the country when they drew near to the presencechamber cacambo asked one of the officers in what manner they were to pay their obeisance to his majesty whether it was the custom to fall upon their knees or to prostrate themselves upon the ground whether they were to put their hands upon their heads or behind their backs whether they were to lick the dust off the floor in short what was the ceremony usual on such occasions the custom said the great officer is to embrace the king and kiss him on each cheek candide and cacambo accordingly threw their arms round his majestys neck who received them in the most gracious manner imaginable and very politely asked them to sup with him while supper was preparing orders were given to show them the city where they saw public structures that reared their lofty heads to the clouds the marketplaces decorated with a thousand columns fountains of spring water besides others of rose water and of liquors drawn from the sugarcane incessantly flowing in the great squares which were paved with a kind of precious stones that emitted an odor like that of cloves and cinnamon candide asked to see the high court of justice the parliament but was answered that they had none in that country being utter strangers to lawsuits     he then inquired if they had any prisons they replied none but what gave him at once the greatest surprise and pleasure was the palace of sciences where he saw a gallery two thousand feet long filled with the various apparatus in mathematics and natural philosophy after having spent the whole afternoon in seeing only about the thousandth part of the city they were brought back to the kings palace candide sat down at the table with his majesty his valet cacambo and several ladies of the court never was entertainment more elegant nor could any one possibly show more wit than his majesty displayed while they were at supper cacambo explained all the kings bons mots to candide and although they were translated they still appeared to be bons mots of all the things that surprised candide this was not the least they spent a whole month in this hospitable place during which time candide was continually saying to cacambo i own my friend once more that the castle where i was born is a mere nothing in comparison to the place where we now are but still miss cunegund is not here and you yourself have doubtless some fair one in europe for whom you sigh if we remain here we shall only be as others are whereas if we return to our own world with only a dozen of el dorado sheep loaded with the pebbles of this country we shall be richer than all the kings in europe we shall no longer need to stand in awe of     the inquisitors and we may easily recover miss cunegund this speech was perfectly agreeable to cacambo a fondness for roving for making a figure in their own country and for boasting of what they had seen in their travels was so powerful in our two wanderers that they resolved to be no longer happy and demanded permission of the king to quit the country you are about to do a rash and silly action said the king i am sensible my kingdom is an inconsiderable spot but when people are tolerably at their ease in any place i should think it would be to their interest to remain there most assuredly i have no right to detain you or any strangers against your wills this is an act of tyranny to which our manners and our laws are equally repugnant all men are by nature free you have therefore an undoubted liberty to depart whenever you please but you will have many and great difficulties to encounter in passing the frontiers it is impossible to ascend that rapid river which runs under high and vaulted rocks and by which you were conveyed hither by a kind of miracle the mountains by which my kingdom are hemmed in on all sides are ten thousand feet high and perfectly perpendicular they are above ten leagues across and the descent from them is one continued precipice however since you are determined to leave us i will immediately give orders to the superintendent of my carriages     to cause one to be made that will convey you very safely when they have conducted you to the back of the mountains nobody can attend you farther for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the kingdom and they are too prudent to break it ask me whatever else you please all we shall ask of your majesty said cacambo is only a few sheep laden with provisions pebbles and the clay of your country the king smiled at the request and said i cannot imagine what pleasure you europeans find in our yellow clay but take away as much of it as you will and much good may it do you he immediately gave orders to his engineers to make a machine to hoist these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom three thousand good machinists went to work and finished it in about fifteen days and it did not cost more than twenty millions sterling of that countrys money candide and cacambo were placed on this machine and they took with them two large red sheep bridled and saddled to ride upon when they got on the other side of the mountains twenty others to serve as sumpters for carrying provisions thirty laden with presents of whatever was most curious in the country and fifty with gold diamonds and other precious stones the king at parting with our two adventurers embraced them with the greatest cordiality it was a curious sight to behold the manner of their setting off and the ingenious method by which     they and their sheep were hoisted to the top of the mountains the machinists and engineers took leave of them as soon as they had conveyed them to a place of safety and candide was wholly occupied with the thoughts of presenting his sheep to miss cunegund now cried he thanks to heaven we have more than sufficient to pay the governor of buenos ayres for miss cunegund if she is redeemable let us make the best of our way to cayenne where we will take shipping and then we may at leisure think of what kingdom we shall purchase with our riches chapter xix what happened to them at surinam and how candide became acquainted with martin our travellers first days journey was very pleasant they were elated with the prospect of possessing more riches than were to be found in europe asia and africa together candide in amorous transports cut the name of miss cunegund on almost every tree he came to the second day two of their sheep sunk in a morass and were swallowed up with their lading two more died of fatigue some few days afterwards seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert and others at different times tumbled down precipices or were otherwise lost so that after travelling about a hundred days they had only two sheep left of the hundred and     two they brought with them from el dorado said candide to cacambo you see my dear friend how perishable the riches of this world are there is nothing solid but virtue very true said cacambo but we have still two sheep remaining with more treasure than ever the king of spain will be possessed of and i espy a town at a distance which i take to be surinam a town belonging to the dutch we are now at the end of our troubles and at the beginning of happiness as they drew near the town they saw a negro stretched on the ground with only one half of his habit which was a kind of linen frock for the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand good god said candide in dutch what dost thou here friend in this deplorable condition i am waiting for my master mynheer vanderdendur the famous trader answered the negro was it mynheer vanderdendur that used you in this cruel manner yes sir said the negro it is the custom here they give a linen garment twice a year and that is all our covering when we labor in the sugar works and the mill happens to snatch hold of a finger they instantly chop off our hand and when we attempt to run away they cut off a leg both these cases have happened to me and it is at this expense that you eat sugar in europe and yet when my   0 mother sold me for ten patacoons on the coast of guinea she said to me my dear child bless our fetiches adore them forever they will make thee live happy thou hast the honor to be a slave to our lords the whites by which thou wilt make the fortune of us thy parents alas i know not whether i have made their fortunes but they have not made mine dogs monkeys and parrots are a thousand times less wretched than i the dutch fetiches who converted me tell me every sunday that the blacks and whites are all children of one father whom they call adam as for me i do not understand anything of genealogies but if what these preachers say is true we are all second cousins and you must allow that it is impossible to be worse treated by our relations than we are o pangloss cried out candide such horrid doings never entered thy imagination here is an end of the matter i find myself after all obliged to renounce thy optimism optimism said cacambo what is that alas replied candide it is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst and so saying he turned his eyes towards the poor negro and shed a flood of tears and in this weeping mood he entered the town of surinam immediately upon their arrival our travellers inquired if there was any vessel in the harbor which they might send to buenos ayres the person they addressed themselves to happened to be the master     of a spanish bark who offered to agree with them on moderate terms and appointed them a meeting at a public house thither candide and his faithful cacambo went to wait for him taking with them their two sheep candide who was all frankness and sincerity made an ingenuous recital of his adventures to the spaniard declaring to him at the same time his resolution of carrying off miss cunegund from the governor of buenos ayres o ho said the shipmaster if that is the case get whom you please to carry you to buenos ayres for my part i wash my hands of the affair it would prove a hanging matter to us all the fair cunegund is the governors favorite mistress these words were like a clap of thunder to candide he wept bitterly for a long time and taking cacambo aside he said to him ill tell you my dear friend what you must do we have each of us in our pockets to the value of five or six millions in diamonds you are cleverer at these matters than i you must go to buenos ayres and bring off miss cunegund if the governor makes any difficulty give him a million if he holds out give him two as you have not killed an inquisitor they will have no suspicion of you ill fit out another ship and go to venice where i will wait for you venice is a free country where we shall have nothing to fear from bulgarians abares jews or inquisitors cacambo greatly applauded this wise resolution     he was inconsolable at the thoughts of parting with so good a master who treated him more like an intimate friend than a servant but the pleasure of being able to do him a service soon got the better of his sorrow they embraced each other with a flood of tears candide charged him not to forget the old woman cacambo set out the same day this cacambo was a very honest fellow candide continued some days longer at surinam waiting for any captain to carry him and his two remaining sheep to italy he hired domestics and purchased many things necessary for a long voyage at length mynheer vanderdendur skipper of a large dutch vessel came and offered his service what will you have said candide to carry me my servants my baggage and these two sheep you see here directly to venice the skipper asked ten thousand piastres and candide agreed to his demand without hesitation ho ho said the cunning vanderdendur to himself this stranger must be very rich he agrees to give me ten thousand piastres without hesitation returning a little while after he tells candide that upon second consideration he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand very well you shall have them said candide zounds said the skipper to himself this man agrees to pay twenty thousand piastres with as much ease as ten accordingly he goes back again and     tells him roundly that he will not carry him to venice for less than thirty thousand piastres then you shall have thirty thousand said candide odso said the dutchman once more to himself thirty thousand piastres seem a trifle to this man those sheep must certainly be laden with an immense treasure ill een stop here and ask no more but make him pay down the thirty thousand piastres and then we may see what is to be done farther candide sold two small diamonds the least of which was worth more than all the skipper asked he paid him beforehand the two sheep were put on board and candide followed in a small boat to join the vessel in the road the skipper took advantage of his opportunity hoisted sail and put out to sea with a favorable wind candide confounded and amazed soon lost sight of the ship alas said he this is a trick like those in our old world he returned back to the shore overwhelmed with grief and indeed he had lost what would have made the fortune of twenty monarchs straightway upon his landing he applied to the dutch magistrate being transported with passion he thundered at the door which being opened he went in told his case and talked a little louder than was necessary the magistrate began with fining him ten thousand piastres for his petulance and then listened very patiently to what he had to say promised     to examine into the affair on the skippers return and ordered him to pay ten thousand piastres more for the fees of the court this treatment put candide out of all patience it is true he had suffered misfortunes a thousand times more grievous but the cool insolence of the judge and the villainy of the skipper raised his choler and threw him into a deep melancholy the villainy of mankind presented itself to his mind in all its deformity and his soul was a prey to the most gloomy ideas after some time hearing that the captain of a french ship was ready to set sail for bordeaux as he had no more sheep loaded with diamonds to put on board he hired the cabin at the usual price and made it known in the town that he would pay the passage and board of any honest man who would give him his company during the voyage besides making him a present of ten thousand piastres on condition that such person was the most dissatisfied with his condition and the most unfortunate in the whole province upon this there appeared such a crowd of candidates that a large fleet could not have contained them candide willing to choose from among those who appeared most likely to answer his intention selected twenty who seemed to him the most sociable and who all pretended to merit the preference he invited them to his inn and promised to treat them with a supper on condition that every man should bind himself by an oath to relate his own     history declaring at the same time that he would make choice of that person who should appear to him the most deserving of compassion and the most justly dissatisfied with his condition in life and that he would make a present to the rest this extraordinary assembly continued sitting till four in the morning candide while he was listening to their adventures called to mind what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to buenos ayres and the wager she had laid that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with great misfortunes every story he heard put him in mind of pangloss my old master said he would be confoundedly put to it to demonstrate his favorite system would he were here certainly if everything is for the best it is in el dorado and not in the other parts of the world at length he determined in favor of a poor scholar who had labored ten years for the booksellers at amsterdam being of opinion that no employment could be more detestable this scholar who was in fact a very honest man had been robbed by his wife beaten by his son and forsaken by his daughter who had run away with a portuguese he had been likewise deprived of a small employment on which he subsisted and he was persecuted by the clergy of surinam who took him for a socinian it must be acknowledged that the other competitors were at least as wretched as     he but candide was in hopes that the company of a man of letters would relieve the tediousness of the voyage all the other candidates complained that candide had done them great injustice but he stopped their mouths by a present of a hundred piastres to each chapter xx what befell candide and martin on their passage the old philosopher whose name was martin took shipping with candide for bordeaux both had seen and suffered a great deal and had the ship been going from surinam to japan round the cape of good hope they could have found sufficient entertainment for each other during the whole voyage in discoursing upon moral and natural evil candide however had one advantage over martin he lived in the pleasing hopes of seeing miss cunegund once more whereas the poor philosopher had nothing to hope for besides candide had money and jewels and notwithstanding he had lost a hundred red sheep laden with the greatest treasure outside of el dorado and though he still smarted from the reflection of the dutch skippers knavery yet when he considered what he had still left and repeated the name of cunegund especially after meal times he inclined to pangloss doctrine and pray said he to martin what is your     opinion of the whole of this system what notion have you of moral and natural evil sir replied martin our priest accused me of being a socinian but the real truth is i am a manichæan nay now you are jesting said candide there are no manichæans existing at present in the world and yet i am one said martin but i cannot help it i cannot for the soul of me think otherwise surely the devil must be in you said candide he concerns himself so much replied martin in the affairs of this world that it is very probable he may be in me as well as everywhere else but i must confess when i cast my eye on this globe or rather globule i cannot help thinking that god has abandoned it to some malignant being i always except el dorado i scarce ever knew a city that did not wish the destruction of its neighboring city nor a family that did not desire to exterminate some other family the poor in all parts of the world bear an inveterate hatred to the rich even while they creep and cringe to them and the rich treat the poor like sheep whose wool and flesh they barter for money a million of regimented assassins traverse europe from one end to the other to get their bread by regular depredation and murder because it is the most gentlemanlike profession even in those cities which seem to enjoy the blessings of     peace and where the arts flourish the inhabitants are devoured with envy care and inquietudes which are greater plagues than any experienced in a town besieged private chagrins are still more dreadful than public calamities in a word concluded the philosopher i have seen and suffered so much that i am a manichæan and yet there is some good in the world replied candide may be so said martin but it has escaped my knowledge while they were deeply engaged in this dispute they heard the report of cannon which redoubled every moment each took out his glass and they spied two ships warmly engaged at the distance of about three miles the wind brought them both so near the french ship that those on board her had the pleasure of seeing the fight with great ease after several smart broadsides the one gave the other a shot between wind and water which sunk her outright then could candide and martin plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the vessel which was sinking who with hands uplifted to heaven sent forth piercing cries and were in a moment swallowed up by the waves well said martin you now see in what manner mankind treat one another it is certain said candide that there is something diabolical in this affair as he was speaking thus he spied something of a shining red hue which     swam close to the vessel the boat was hoisted out to see what it might be when it proved to be one of his sheep candide felt more joy at the recovery of this one animal than he did grief when he lost the other hundred though laden with the large diamonds of el dorado the french captain quickly perceived that the victorious ship belonged to the crown of spain that the other was a dutch pirate and the very same captain who had robbed candide the immense riches which this villain had amassed were buried with him in the deep and only this one sheep saved out of the whole you see said candide to martin that vice is sometimes punished this villain the dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserved very true said martin but why should the passengers be doomed also to destruction god has punished the knave and the devil has drowned the rest the french and spanish ships continued their cruise and candide and martin their conversation they disputed fourteen days successively at the end of which they were just as far advanced as the first moment they began however they had the satisfaction of disputing of communicating their ideas and of mutually comforting each other candide embraced his sheep with transport since i have found thee again said he i may possibly find my cunegund once more   0 chapter xxi candide and martin while thus reasoning with each other draw near to the coast of france at length they descried the coast of france when candide said to martin pray mr martin were you ever in france yes sir said martin i have been in several provinces of that kingdom in some onehalf of the people are fools and madmen in some they are too artful in others again they are in general either very goodnatured or very brutal while in others they affect to be witty and in all their ruling passion is love the next is slander and the last is to talk nonsense but pray mr martin were you ever in paris yes sir i have been in that city and it is a place that contains the several species just described it is a chaos a confused multitude where everyone seeks for pleasure without being able to find it at least as far as i have observed during my short stay in that city at my arrival i was robbed of all i had in the world by pickpockets and sharpers at the fair of st germain i was taken up myself for a robber and confined in prison a whole week after which i hired myself as corrector to a press in order to get a little money towards defraying my expenses back to holland on foot i knew the whole tribe of scribblers malcontents and fanatics it is said the     people of that city are very polite i believe they may be for my part i have no curiosity to see france said candide you may easily conceive my friend that after spending a month in el dorado i can desire to behold nothing upon earth but miss cunegund i am going to wait for her at venice i intend to pass through france on my way to italy will you not bear me company with all my heart said martin they say venice is agreeable to none but noble venetians but that nevertheless strangers are well received there when they have plenty of money now i have none but you have therefore i will attend you wherever you please now we are upon this subject said candide do you think that the earth was originally sea as we read in that great book which belongs to the captain of the ship i believe nothing of it replied martin any more than i do of the many other chimeras which have been related to us for some time past but then to what end said candide was the world formed to make us mad said martin are you not surprised continued candide at the love which the two girls in the country of the oreillons had for those two monkeys—you know i have told you the story surprised replied martin not in the least i see nothing strange in this passion i have seen so many extraordinary things that there is nothing extraordinary to me now do you think said candide that mankind     always massacred one another as they do now were they always guilty of lies fraud treachery ingratitude inconstancy envy ambition and cruelty were they always thieves fools cowards gluttons drunkards misers calumniators debauchees fanatics and hypocrites do you believe said martin that hawks have always been accustomed to eat pigeons when they came in their way doubtless said candide well then replied martin if hawks have always had the same nature why should you pretend that mankind change theirs oh said candide there is a great deal of difference for free will— and reasoning thus they arrived at bordeaux chapter xxii what happened to candide and martin in france candide staid no longer at bordeaux than was necessary to dispose of a few of the pebbles he had brought from el dorado and to provide himself with a postchaise for two persons for he could no longer stir a step without his philosopher martin the only thing that gave him concern was the being obliged to leave his sheep behind him which he intrusted to the care of the academy of sciences at bordeaux who proposed as a prize subject for the year to prove why the wool of this sheep was red     and the prize was adjudged to a northern sage who demonstrated by a plus b minus c divided by z that the sheep must necessarily be red and die of the mange in the meantime all the travellers whom candide met with in the inns or on the road told him to a man that they were going to paris this general eagerness gave him likewise a great desire to see this capital and it was not much out of his way to venice he entered the city by the suburbs of st marceau and thought himself in one of the vilest hamlets in all westphalia candide had not been long at his inn before he was seized with a slight disorder owing to the fatigue he had undergone as he wore a diamond of an enormous size on his finger and had among the rest of his equipage a strong box that seemed very weighty he soon found himself between two physicians whom he had not sent for a number of intimate friends whom he had never seen and who would not quit his bedside and two women devotees who were very careful in providing him hot broths i remember said martin to him that the first time i came to paris i was likewise taken ill i was very poor and accordingly i had neither friends nurses nor physicians and yet i did very well however by dint of purging and bleeding candides disorder became very serious the priest of     the parish came with all imaginable politeness to desire a note of him payable to the bearer in the other world candide refused to comply with his request but the two devotees assured him that it was a new fashion candide replied that he was not one that followed the fashion martin was for throwing the priest out of the window the clerk swore candide should not have christian burial martin swore in his turn that he would bury the clerk alive if he continued to plague them any longer the dispute grew warm martin took him by the shoulders and turned him out of the room which gave great scandal and occasioned a procèsverbal candide recovered and till he was in a condition to go abroad had a great deal of good company to pass the evenings with him in his chamber they played deep candide was surprised to find he could never turn a trick and martin was not at all surprised at the matter among those who did him the honors of the place was a little spruce abbé of périgord one of those insinuating busy fawning impudent necessary fellows that lay wait for strangers on their arrival tell them all the scandal of the town and offer to minister to their pleasures at various prices this man conducted candide and martin to the playhouse they were acting a new tragedy candide found himself placed near a cluster of wits this however did not prevent him from shedding tears     at some parts of the piece which were most affecting and best acted one of these talkers said to him between the acts you are greatly to blame to shed tears that actress plays horribly and the man that plays with her still worse and the piece itself is still more execrable than the representation the author does not understand a word of arabic and yet he has laid his scene in arabia and what is more he is a fellow who does not believe in innate ideas tomorrow i will bring you a score of pamphlets that have been written against him pray sir said candide to the abbé how many theatrical pieces have you in france five or six thousand replied the abbé indeed that is a great number said candide but how many good ones may there be about fifteen or sixteen oh that is a great number said martin candide was greatly taken with an actress who performed the part of queen elizabeth in a dull kind of tragedy that is played sometimes that actress said he to martin pleases me greatly she has some sort of resemblance to miss cunegund i should be very glad to pay my respects to her the abbé of perigord offered his service to introduce him to her at her own house candide who was brought up in germany desired to know what might be the ceremonial used on those occasions and how a queen of england was treated in france there is a necessary distinction to be observed in these matters said the abbé in a country town we take     them to a tavern here in paris they are treated with great respect during their life time provided they are handsome and when they die we throw their bodies upon a dunghill how said candide throw a queens body upon a dunghill the gentleman is quite right said martin he tells you nothing but the truth i happened to be at paris when miss monimia made her exit as one may say out of this world into another she was refused what they call here the rites of sepulture that is to say she was denied the privilege of rotting in a churchyard by the side of all the beggars in the parish they buried her at the corner of burgundy street which must certainly have shocked her extremely as she had very exalted notions of things this is acting very impolitely said candide lord said martin what can be said to it it is the way of these people figure to yourself all the contradictions all the inconsistencies possible and you may meet with them in the government the courts of justice the churches and the public spectacles of this odd nation is it true said candide that the people of paris are always laughing yes replied the abbé but it is with anger in their hearts they express all their complaints by loud bursts of laughter and commit the most detestable crimes with a smile on their faces who was that great overgrown beast said candide who spoke so ill to me of the piece with which i was so much affected and of the players     who gave me so much pleasure a very goodfornothing sort of a man i assure you answered the abbé one who gets his livelihood by abusing every new book and play that is written or performed he dislikes much to see any one meet with success like eunuchs who detest every one that possesses those powers they are deprived of he is one of those vipers in literature who nourish themselves with their own venom a pamphletmonger a pamphletmonger said candide what is that why a pamphletmonger replied the abbé is a writer of pamphlets—a fool candide martin and the abbé of périgord argued thus on the staircase while they stood to see the people go out of the playhouse though i am very anxious to see miss cunegund again said candide yet i have a great inclination to sup with miss clairon for i am really much taken with her the abbé was not a person to show his face at this ladys house which was frequented by none but the best company she is engaged this evening said he but i will do myself the honor to introduce you to a lady of quality of my acquaintance at whose house you will see as much of the manners of paris as if you had lived here for forty years candide who was naturally curious suffered himself to be conducted to this ladys house which was in the suburbs of st honoré the company was engaged at basset twelve melancholy punters     held each in his hand a small pack of cards the corners of which were doubled down and were so many registers of their ill fortune a profound silence reigned throughout the assembly a pallid dread had taken possession of the countenances of the punters and restless inquietude stretched every muscle of the face of him who kept the bank and the lady of the house who was seated next to him observed with lynxs eyes every play made and noted those who tallied and made them undouble their cards with a severe exactness though mixed with a politeness which she thought necessary not to frighten away her customers this lady assumed the title of marchioness of parolignac her daughter a girl of about fifteen years of age was one of the punters and took care to give her mamma a hint by signs when any one of the players attempted to repair the rigor of their ill fortune by a little innocent deception the company were thus occupied when candide martin and the abbé made their entrance not a creature rose to salute them or indeed took the least notice of them being wholly intent upon the business in hand ah said candide my lady baroness of thundertentronckh would have behaved more civilly however the abbé whispered in the ear of the marchioness who half raising herself from her seat honored candide with a gracious smile and gave martin a nod of her head with an air of inexpressible dignity she then ordered a seat for candide     and desired him to make one of their party at play he did so and in a few deals lost near a thousand pieces after which they supped very elegantly and every one was surprised at seeing candide lose so much money without appearing to be the least disturbed at it the servants in waiting said to each other this is certainly some english lord the supper was like most others of its kind in paris at first every one was silent then followed a few confused murmurs and afterwards several insipid jokes passed and repassed with false reports false reasonings a little politics and a great deal of scandal the conversation then turned upon the new productions in literature pray said the abbé good folks have you seen the romance written by the sieur gauchat doctor of divinity yes answered one of the company but i had not patience to go through it the town is pestered with a swarm of impertinent productions but this of dr gauchats outdoes them all in short i was so cursedly tired of reading this vile stuff that i even resolved to come here and make a party at basset but what say you to the archdeacon t—s miscellaneous collection said the abbé oh my god cried the marchioness of parolignac never mention the tedious creature only think what pains he is at to tell one things that all the world knows and how he labors an argument that is hardly worth the slightest consideration how absurdly he makes use of other peoples wit how miserably he mangles   0 what he has pilfered from them the man makes me quite sick a few pages of the good archdeacon are enough in conscience to satisfy any one there was at the table a person of learning and taste who supported what the marchioness had advanced they next began to talk of tragedies the lady desired to know how it came about that there were several tragedies which still continued to be played though they would not bear reading the man of taste explained very clearly how a piece may be in some manner interesting without having a grain of merit he showed in a few words that it is not sufficient to throw together a few incidents that are to be met with in every romance and that to dazzle the spectator the thoughts should be new without being farfetched frequently sublime but always natural the author should have a thorough knowledge of the human heart and make it speak properly he should be a complete poet without showing an affectation of it in any of the characters of his piece he should be a perfect master of his language speak it with all its purity and with the utmost harmony and yet so as not to make the sense a slave to the rhyme whoever added he neglects any one of these rules though he may write two or three tragedies with tolerable success will never be reckoned in the number of good authors there are very few good tragedies some are idyls in very wellwritten and harmonious dialogue and others a chain of political reasonings that set one     asleep or else pompous and highflown amplifications that disgust rather than please others again are the ravings of a madman in an uncouth style unmeaning flights or long apostrophes to the deities for want of knowing how to address mankind in a word a collection of false maxims and dull commonplace candide listened to this discourse with great attention and conceived a high opinion of the person who delivered it and as the marchioness had taken care to place him near her side he took the liberty to whisper her softly in the ear and ask who this person was that spoke so well he is a man of letters replied her ladyship who never plays and whom the abbé brings with him to my house sometimes to spend an evening he is a great judge of writing especially in tragedy he has composed one himself which was damned and has written a book that was never seen out of his booksellers shop excepting only one copy which he sent me with a dedication to which he had prefixed my name oh the great man cried candide he is a second pangloss then turning towards him sir said he you are doubtless of opinion that everything is for the best in the physical and moral world and that nothing could be otherwise than it is i sir replied the man of letters i think no such thing i assure you i find that all in this world is set the wrong end uppermost no one knows what is his rank     his office nor what he does nor what he should do with the exception of our evenings which we generally pass tolerably merrily the rest of our time is spent in idle disputes and quarrels jansenists against molinists the parliament against the church and one armed body of men against another courtier against courtier husband against wife and relations against relations in short this world is nothing but one continued scene of civil war yes said candide and i have seen worse than all that and yet a learned man who had the misfortune to be hanged taught me that everything was marvellously well and that these evils you are speaking of were only so many shades in a beautiful picture your hempen sage said martin laughed at you these shades as you call them are most horrible blemishes the men make these blemishes rejoined candide and they cannot do otherwise then it is not their fault added martin the greatest part of the gamesters who did not understand a syllable of this discourse amused themselves with drinking while martin reasoned with the learned gentleman and candide entertained the lady of the house with a part of his adventures after supper the marchioness conducted candide into her dressingroom and made him sit down under a canopy well said she are you still so violently fond of miss cunegund of thundertentronckh yes madam replied candide     the marchioness said to him with a tender smile you answer me like a young man born in westphalia a frenchman would have said it is true madam i had a great passion for miss cunegund but since i have seen you i fear i can no longer love her as i did  alas madam replied candide i will make you what answer you please you fell in love with her i find in stooping to pick up her handkerchief which she had dropped you shall pick up my garter with all my heart madam said candide and he picked it up but you must tie it on again said the lady candide tied it on again look ye young man said the marchioness you are a stranger i make some of my lovers here in paris languish for me a whole fortnight but i surrender to you at first sight because i am willing to do the honors of my country to a young westphalian the fair one having cast her eye on two very large diamonds that were upon the young strangers finger praised them in so earnest a manner that they were in an instant transferred from his finger to hers as candide was going home with the abbé he felt some qualms of conscience for having been guilty of infidelity to miss cunegund the abbé took part with him in his uneasiness he had but an inconsiderable share in the thousand pieces candide had lost at play and the two diamonds which had been in a manner extorted from him and therefore very prudently designed to make the most he     could of his new acquaintance which chance had thrown in his way he talked much of miss cunegund and candide assured him that he would heartily ask pardon of that fair one for his infidelity to her when he saw her at venice the abbé redoubled his civilities and seemed to interest himself warmly in everything that candide said did or seemed inclined to do and so sir you have an engagement at venice yes monsieur labbé answered candìde i must absolutely wait upon miss cunegund and then the pleasure he took in talking about the object he loved led him insensibly to relate according to custom part of his adventures with that illustrious westphalian beauty i fancy said the abbé miss cunegund has a great deal of wit and that her letters must be very entertaining i never received any from her said candide for you are to consider that being expelled from the castle upon her account i could not write to her especially as soon after my departure i heard she was dead but thank god i found afterwards she was living i left again after this and now i have sent a messenger to her near two thousand leagues from here and wait here for his return with an answer from her the artful abbé let not a word of all this escape him though he seemed to be musing upon something else he soon took his leave of the two adventurers after having embraced them with the     greatest cordiality the next morning almost as soon as his eyes were open candide received the following billet my dearest lover—i have been ill in this city these eight days i have heard of your arrival and should fly to your arms were i able to stir i was informed of your being on the way hither at bordeaux where i left the faithful cacambo and the old woman who will soon follow me the governor of buenos ayres has taken everything from me but your heart which i still retain come to me immediately on the receipt of this your presence will either give me new life or kill me with the pleasure at the receipt of this charming this unexpected letter candide felt the utmost transports of joy though on the other hand the indisposition of his beloved miss cunegund overwhelmed him with grief distracted between these two passions he took his gold and his diamonds and procured a person to conduct him and martin to the house where miss cunegund lodged upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble his heart flutter his tongue falter he attempted to undraw the curtain and called for a light to the bedside lord sir cried a maid servant who was waiting in the room take care what you do miss cannot bear the least light and so saying she pulled the curtain close again cunegund my dear cunegund cried candide bathed in tears how do you do if you cannot     bear the light speak to me at least alas she cannot speak said the maid the sick lady then put a plump hand out of the bed and candide first bathed it with tears then filled it with diamonds leaving a purse of gold upon the easy chair in the midst of his transports came an officer into the room followed by the abbé and a file of musketeers there said he are the two suspected foreigners at the same time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison travellers are not treated in this manner in the country of el dorado said candide i am more of a manichæan now than ever said martin but pray good sir where are you going to carry us said candide to a dungeon my dear sir replied the officer when martin had a little recovered himself so as to form a cool judgment of what had passed he plainly perceived that the person who had acted the part of miss cunegund was a cheat that the abbé of périgord was a sharper who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of candide and that the officer was a knave whom they might easily get rid of candide following the advice of his friend martin and burning with impatience to see the real miss cunegund rather than be obliged to appear at a court of justice proposed to the officer to make him a present of three small diamonds each of them worth three thousand pistoles ah sir said this understrapper of justice had you committed ever     so much villainy this would render you the honestest man living in my eyes three diamonds worth three thousand pistoles why my dear sir so far from carrying you to jail i would lose my life to serve you there are orders for stopping all strangers but leave it to me i have a brother at dieppe in normandy i myself will conduct you thither and if you have a diamond left to give him he will take as much care of you as i myself should but why said candide do they stop all strangers the abbé of périgord made answer that it was because a poor devil of the country of atrebata heard somebody tell foolish stories and this induced him to commit a parricide not such a one as that in the month of may    0 but such as that in the month of december in the year      and such as many that have been perpetrated in other months and years by other poor devils who had heard foolish stories the officer then explained to them what the abbé meant horrid monsters exclaimed candide is it possible that such scenes should pass among a people who are perpetually singing and dancing is there no flying this abominable country immediately this execrable kingdom where monkeys provoke tigers i have seen bears in my country but men i have beheld nowhere but in el dorado in the name of god sir said he to the officer do me the kindness to conduct me to venice where i am to wait for miss cunegund really sir     replied the officer i cannot possibly wait on you farther than lower normandy so saying he ordered candides irons to be struck off acknowledged himself mistaken and sent his followers about their business after which he conducted candide and martin to dieppe and left them to the care of his brother there happened just then to be a small dutch ship in the harbor the norman whom the other three diamonds had converted into the most obliging serviceable being that ever breathed took care to see candide and his attendants safe on board this vessel that was just ready to sail for portsmouth in england this was not the nearest way to venice indeed but candide thought himself escaped out of hell and did not in the least doubt but he should quickly find an opportunity of resuming his voyage to venice chapter xxiii candide and martin touch upon the english coast—what they see there ah pangloss pangloss ah martin martin ah my dear miss cunegund what sort of a world is this thus exclaimed candide as soon as he got on board the dutch ship why something very foolish and very abominable said martin you are acquainted with england said candide are they as great fools in that country as in france yes but in a different manner answered martin     you know that these two nations are at war about a few acres of barren land in the neighborhood of canada and that they have expended much greater sums in the contest than all canada is worth to say exactly whether there are a greater number fit to be inhabitants of a madhouse in the one country than the other exceeds the limits of my imperfect capacity i know in general that the people we are going to visit are of a very dark and gloomy disposition as they were chatting thus together they arrived at portsmouth the shore on each side the harbor was lined with a multitude of people whose eyes were steadfastly fixed on a lusty man who was kneeling down on the deck of one of the menofwar with something tied before his eyes opposite to this personage stood four soldiers each of whom shot three bullets into his skull with all the composure imaginable and when it was done the whole company went away perfectly well satisfied what the devil is all this for said candide and what demon or foe of mankind lords it thus tyrannically over the world he then asked who was that lusty man who had been sent out of the world with so much ceremony when he received for answer that it was an admiral and pray why do you put your admiral to death because he did not put a sufficient number of his fellowcreatures to death you must know he had an engagement with a french admiral and it has been proved against him that   0 he was not near enough to his antagonist but replied candide the french admiral must have been as far from him there is no doubt of that but in this country it is found requisite now and then to put an admiral to death in order to encourage the others to fight candide was so shocked at what he saw and heard that he would not set foot on shore but made a bargain with the dutch skipper were he even to rob him like the captain of surinam to carry him directly to venice the skipper was ready in two days they sailed along the coast of france and passed within sight of lisbon at which candide trembled from thence they proceeded to the straits entered the mediterranean and at length arrived at venice god be praised said candide embracing martin this is the place where i am to behold my beloved cunegund once again i can confide in cacambo like another self all is well all very well all as well as possible chapter xxiv of pacquette and friar giroflée upon their arrival at venice candide went in search of cacambo at every inn and coffeehouse and among all the ladies of pleasure but could hear nothing of him he sent every day to inquire what ships were in still no news of cacambo it is     strange said he to martin very strange that i should have had time to sail from surinam to bordeaux to travel thence to paris to dieppe to portsmouth to sail along the coast of portugal and spain and up the mediterranean to spend some months at venice and that my lovely cunegund should not have arrived instead of her i only met with a parisian impostor and a rascally abbé of périgord cunegund is actually dead and i have nothing to do but follow her alas how much better would it have been for me to have remained in the paradise of el dorado than to have returned to this cursed europe you are in the right my dear martin you are certainly in the right all is misery and deceit he fell into a deep melancholy and neither went to the opera then in vogue nor partook of any of the diversions of the carnival nay he even slighted the fair sex martin said to him upon my word i think you are very simple to imagine that a rascally valet with five or six millions in his pocket would go in search of your mistress to the further end of the world and bring her to venice to meet you if he finds her he will take her for himself if he does not he will take another let me advise you to forget your valet cacambo and your mistress cunegund martins speech was not the most consolatory to the dejected candide his melancholy increased and martin never ceased trying to prove to him that there is very little virtue or happiness     in this world except perhaps in el dorado where hardly anybody can gain admittance while they were disputing on this important subject and still expecting miss cunegund candide perceived a young theatin friar in st marks place with a girl under his arm the theatin looked freshcolored plump and vigorous his eyes sparkled his air and gait were bold and lofty the girl was pretty and was singing a song and every now and then gave her theatin an amorous ogle and wantonly pinched his ruddy cheeks you will at least allow said candide to martin that these two are happy hitherto i have met with none but unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe except in el dorado but as to this couple i would venture to lay a wager they are happy done said martin they are not what you imagine well we have only to ask them to dine with us said candide and you will see whether i am mistaken or not thereupon he accosted them and with great politeness invited them to his inn to eat some macaroni with lombard partridges and caviare and to drink a bottle of montepulciano lacryma christi cyprus and samos wine the girl blushed the theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him eyeing candide every now and then with a mixture of surprise and confusion while the tears stole down her cheeks no sooner did she enter his apartment than she cried out how mr candide have you quite     forgot your pacquette do you not know her again candide had not regarded her with any degree of attention before being wholly occupied with the thoughts of his dear cunegund ah is it you child was it you that reduced doctor pangloss to that fine condition i saw him in alas sir answered pacquette it was i indeed i find you are acquainted with everything and i have been informed of all the misfortunes that happened to the whole family of my lady baroness and the fair cunegund but i can safely swear to you that my lot was no less deplorable i was innocence itself when you saw me last a cordelier who was my confessor easily seduced me the consequences proved terrible i was obliged to leave the castle some time after the baron kicked you out from there and if a famous surgeon had not taken compassion on me i had been a dead woman gratitude obliged me to live with him some time as a mistress his wife who was a very devil for jealousy beat me unmercifully every day oh she was a perfect fury the doctor himself was the most ugly of all mortals and i the most wretched creature existing to be continually beaten for a man whom i did not love you are sensible sir how dangerous it was for an illnatured woman to be married to a physician incensed at the behavior of his wife he one day gave her so affectionate a remedy for a slight cold she had caught that she died in less than two hours in most dreadful convulsions     her relations prosecuted the husband who was obliged to fly and i was sent to prison my innocence would not have saved me if i had not been tolerably handsome the judge gave me my liberty on condition he should succeed the doctor however i was soon supplanted by a rival turned off without a farthing and obliged to continue the abominable trade which you men think so pleasing but which to us unhappy creatures is the most dreadful of all sufferings at length i came to follow the business at venice ah sir did you but know what it is to be obliged to receive every visitor old tradesmen counsellors monks watermen and abbés to be exposed to all their insolence and abuse to be often necessitated to borrow a petticoat only that it may be taken up by some disagreeable wretch to be robbed by one gallant of what we get from another to be subject to the extortions of civil magistrates and to have forever before ones eyes the prospect of old age a hospital or a dunghill you would conclude that i am one of the most unhappy wretches breathing thus did pacquette unbosom herself to honest candide in his closet in the presence of martin who took occasion to say to him you see i have half won the wager already friar giroflée was all this time in the parlor refreshing himself with a glass or two of wine till dinner was ready but said candide to pacquette     you looked so gay and contented when i met you you sang and caressed the theatin with so much fondness that i absolutely thought you as happy as you say you are now miserable ah dear sir said pacquette this is one of the miseries of the trade yesterday i was stripped and beaten by an officer yet today i must appear good humored and gay to please a friar candide was convinced and acknowledged that martin was in the right they sat down to table with pacquette and the theatin the entertainment was agreeable and towards the end they began to converse together with some freedom father said candide to the friar you seem to me to enjoy a state of happiness that even kings might envy joy and health are painted in your countenance you have a pretty wench to divert you and you seem to be perfectly well contented with your condition as a theatin faith sir said friar giroflée i wish with all my soul the theatins were every one of them at the bottom of the sea i have been tempted a thousand times to set fire to the convent and go and turn turk my parents obliged me at the age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit only to increase the fortune of an elder brother of mine whom god confound jealousy discord and fury reside in our convent it is true i have preached often paltry sermons by which i have got a little money part of which the prior robs me of and the     remainder helps to pay my girls but at night when i go hence to my convent i am ready to dash my brains against the walls of the dormitory and this is the case with all the rest of our fraternity martin turning towards candide with his usual indifference said well what think you now have i won the wager entirely candide gave two thousand piastres to pacquette and a thousand to friar giroflée saying i will answer that this will make them happy i am not of your opinion said martin perhaps this money will only make them wretched be that as it may said candide one thing comforts me i see that one often meets with those whom one never expected to see again so that perhaps as i have found my red sheep and pacquette i may be lucky enough to find miss cunegund also i wish said martin she one day may make you happy but i doubt it much you lack faith said candide it is because said martin i have seen the world observe those gondoliers said candide are they not perpetually singing you do not see them answered martin at home with their wives and brats the doge has his chagrin gondoliers theirs nevertheless in the main i look upon the gondoliers life as preferable to that of the doge but the difference is so trifling that it is not worth the trouble of examining into i have heard great talk said candide of the senator pococuranté who lives in that fine house     at the brenta where they say he entertains foreigners in the most polite manner they pretend this man is a perfect stranger to uneasiness i should be glad to see so extraordinary a being said martin candide thereupon sent a messenger to seignor pococuranté desiring permission to wait on him the next day chapter xxv candide and martin pay a visit to seignor pococuranté a noble venetian candide and his friend martin went in a gondola on the brenta and arrived at the palace of the noble pococuranté the gardens were laid out in elegant taste and adorned with fine marble statues his palace was built after the most approved rules of architecture the master of the house who was a man of affairs and very rich received our two travellers with great politeness but without much ceremony which somewhat disconcerted candide but was not at all displeasing to martin as soon as they were seated two very pretty girls neatly dressed brought in chocolate which was extremely well prepared candide could not help making encomiums upon their beauty and graceful carriage the creatures are well enough said the senator i amuse myself with them sometimes for i am heartily tired of the women of the     town their coquetry their jealousy their quarrels their humors their meannesses their pride and their folly i am weary of making sonnets or of paying for sonnets to be made on them but after all these two girls begin to grow very indifferent to me after having refreshed himself candide walked into a large gallery where he was struck with the sight of a fine collection of paintings pray said candide by what master are the two first of these they are by raphael answered the senator i gave a great deal of money for them seven years ago purely out of curiosity as they were said to be the finest pieces in italy but i cannot say they please me the coloring is dark and heavy the figures do not swell nor come out enough and the drapery is bad in short notwithstanding the encomiums lavished upon them they are not in my opinion a true representation of nature i approve of no paintings save those wherein i think i behold nature herself and there are few if any of that kind to be met with i have what is called a fine collection but i take no manner of delight in it while dinner was being prepared pococuranté ordered a concert candide praised the music to the skies this noise said the noble venetian may amuse one for a little time but if it were to last above half an hour it would grow tiresome to everybody though perhaps no one would care to own it music has become the art of executing what is difficult     now whatever is difficult cannot be long pleasing i believe i might take more pleasure in an opera if they had not made such a monster of that species of dramatic entertainment as perfectly shocks me and i am amazed how people can bear to see wretched tragedies set to music where the scenes are contrived for no other purpose than to lug in as it were by the ears three or four ridiculous songs to give a favorite actress an opportunity of exhibiting her pipe let who will die away in raptures at the trills of a eunuch quavering the majestic part of cæsar or cato and strutting in a foolish manner upon the stage but for my part i have long ago renounced these paltry entertainments which constitute the glory of modern italy and are so dearly purchased by crowned heads candide opposed these sentiments but he did it in a discreet manner as for martin he was entirely of the old senators opinion dinner being served they sat down to table and after a hearty repast returned to the library candide observing homer richly bound commended the noble venetians taste this said he is a book that was once the delight of the great pangloss the best philosopher in germany homer is no favorite of mine answered pococuranté coolly i was made to believe once that i took a pleasure in reading him but his continual repetitions of battles have all such a resemblance with   0 each other his gods that are forever in haste and bustle without ever doing anything his helen who is the cause of the war and yet hardly acts in the whole performance his troy that holds out so long without being taken in short all these things together make the poem very insipid to me i have asked some learned men whether they are not in reality as much tired as myself with reading this poet those who spoke ingenuously assured me that he had made them fall asleep and yet that they could not well avoid giving him a place in their libraries but that it was merely as they would do an antique or those rusty medals which are kept only for curiosity and are of no manner of use in commerce but your excellency does not surely form the same opinion of virgil said candide why i grant replied pococuranté that the second third fourth and sixth books of his æneid are excellent but as for his pious æneas his strong cloanthus his friendly achates his boy ascanius his silly king latinus his illbred amata his insipid lavinia and some other characters much in the same strain i think there cannot in nature be anything more flat and disagreeable i must confess i prefer tasso far beyond him nay even that sleepy taleteller ariosto may i take the liberty to ask if you do not experience great pleasure from reading horace said candide there are maxims in this writer replied     pococuranté whence a man of the world may reap some benefit and the short measure of the verse makes them more easily to be retained in the memory but i see nothing extraordinary in his journey to brundusium and his account of his bad dinner nor in his dirty low quarrel between one rupillius whose words as he expresses it were full of poisonous filth and another whose language was dipped in vinegar his indelicate verses against old women and witches have frequently given me great offence nor can i discover the great merit of his telling his friend mæcenas that if he will but rank him in the class of lyric poets his lofty head shall touch the stars ignorant readers are apt to judge a writer by his reputation for my part i read only to please myself i like nothing but what makes for my purpose candide who had been brought up with a notion of never making use of his own judgment was astonished at what he heard but martin found there was a good deal of reason in the senators remarks o here is a tully said candide this great man i fancy you are never tired of reading indeed i never read him at all replied pococuranté what is it to me whether he pleads for rabirius or cluentius i try causes enough myself i had once some liking for his philosophical works but when i found he doubted everything i thought i knew as much as himself and had no need of a guide to learn ignorance     ha cried martin here are fourscore volumes of the memoirs of the academy of sciences perhaps there may be something curious and valuable in this collection yes answered pococuranté so there might if any one of these compilers of this rubbish had only invented the art of pinmaking but all these volumes are filled with mere chimerical systems without one single article conducive to real utility i see a prodigious number of plays said candide in italian spanish and french yes replied the venetian there are i think three thousand and not three dozen of them good for anything as to those huge volumes of divinity and those enormous collections of sermons they are not all together worth one single page in seneca and i fancy you will readily believe that neither myself nor anyone else ever looks into them martin perceiving some shelves filled with english books said to the senator i fancy that a republican must be highly delighted with those books which are most of them written with a noble spirit of freedom it is noble to write as we think said pococuranté it is the privilege of humanity throughout italy we write only what we do not think and the present inhabitants of the country of the cæsars and antonines dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a dominican father i should be enamored of the spirit of the english nation did it not utterly frustrate the good     effects it would produce by passion and the spirit of party candide seeing a milton asked the senator if he did not think that author a great man who said pococuranté sharply that barbarian who writes a tedious commentary in ten books of rumbling verse on the first chapter of genesis that slovenly imitator of the greeks who disfigures the creation by making the messiah take a pair of compasses from heavens armory to plan the world whereas moses represented the deity as producing the whole universe by his fiat can i think you have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled tassos hell and the devil who transforms lucifer sometimes into a toad and at others into a pygmy who makes him say the same thing over again a hundred times who metamorphoses him into a schooldivine and who by an absurdly serious imitation of ariostos comic invention of firearms represents the devils and angels cannonading each other in heaven neither i nor any other italian can possibly take pleasure in such melancholy reveries but the marriage of sin and death and snakes issuing from the womb of the former are enough to make any person sick that is not lost to all sense of delicacy this obscene whimsical and disagreeable poem met with the neglect it deserved at its first publication and i only treat the author now as he was treated in his own country by his contemporaries     candide was sensibly grieved at this speech as he had a great respect for homer and was fond of milton alas said he softly to martin i am afraid this man holds our german poets in great contempt there would be no such great harm in that said martin o what a surprising man said candide still to himself what a prodigious genius is this pococuranté nothing can please him after finishing their survey of the library they went down into the garden when candide commended the several beauties that offered themselves to his view i know nothing upon earth laid out in such bad taste said pococuranté everything about it is childish and trifling but i shall have another laid out tomorrow upon a nobler plan as soon as our two travellers had taken leave of his excellency well said candide to martin i hope you will own that this man is the happiest of all mortals for he is above everything he possesses but do not you see answered martin that he likewise dislikes everything he possesses it was an observation of plato long since that those are not the best stomachs that reject without distinction all sorts of aliments true said candide but still there must certainly be a pleasure in criticising everything and in perceiving faults where others think they see beauties that is replied martin there is a pleasure in having no pleasure well well said candide i find that i shall be the     only happy man at last when i am blessed with the sight of my dear cunegund it is good to hope said martin in the meanwhile days and weeks passed away and no news of cacambo candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not reflect on the behavior of pacquette and friar giroflée who never stayed to return him thanks for the presents he had so generously made them chapter xxvi candide and martin sup with six sharpers—who they were one evening as candide with his attendant martin was going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn where they had taken up their quarters a man with a face the color of soot came behind him and taking him by the arm said hold yourself in readiness to go along with us be sure you do not fail upon this turning about to see from whom these words came he beheld cacambo nothing but the sight of miss cunegund could have given him greater joy and surprise he was almost beside himself after embracing this dear friend cunegund said he cunegund is come with you doubtless where where is she carry me to her this instant that i may die with joy in her presence cunegund is     not here answered cacambo she is in constantinople good heavens in constantinople but no matter if she were in china i would fly thither quick quick dear cacambo let us be gone soft and fair said cacambo stay till you have supped i cannot at present stay to say anything more to you i am a slave and my master waits for me i must go and attend him at table but mum say not a word only get your supper and hold yourself in readiness candide divided between joy and grief charmed to have thus met with his faithful agent again and surprised to hear he was a slave his heart palpitating his senses confused but full of the hopes of recovering his dear cunegund sat down to table with martin who beheld all these scenes with great unconcern and with six strangers who had come to spend the carnival at venice cacambo waited at table upon one of those strangers when supper was nearly over he drew near to his master and whispered in his ear sire your majesty may go when you please the ship is ready and so saying he left the room the guests surprised at what they had heard looked at each other without speaking a word when another servant drawing near to his master in like manner said sire your majestys postchaise is at padua and the bark is ready the master made him a sign and he instantly withdrew the company all stared at each other again and the general astonishment     was increased a third servant then approached another of the strangers and said sire if your majesty will be advised by me you will not make any longer stay in this place i will go and get everything ready and instantly disappeared candide and martin then took it for granted that this was some of the diversions of the carnival and that these were characters in masquerade then a fourth domestic said to the fourth stranger your majesty may set off when you please saying which he went away like the rest a fifth valet said the same to a fifth master but the sixth domestic spoke in a different style to the person on whom he waited and who sat near to candide troth sir said he they will trust your majesty no longer nor myself neither and we may both of us chance to be sent to jail this very night and therefore i shall take care of myself and so adieu the servants being all gone the six strangers with candide and martin remained in a profound silence at length candide broke it by saying gentlemen this is a very singular joke upon my word how came you all to be kings for my part i own frankly that neither my friend martin here nor myself have any claim to royalty cacambos master then began with great gravity to deliver himself thus in italian i am not joking in the least my name is achmet iii i was grand seignor for many years i dethroned my brother my nephew dethroned me my viziers lost their     heads and i am condemned to end my days in the old seraglio my nephew the grand sultan mahomet gives me permission to travel sometimes for my health and i am come to spend the carnival at venice a young man who sat by achmet spoke next and said my name is ivan i was once emperor of all the russias but was dethroned in my cradle my parents were confined and i was brought up in a prison yet i am sometimes allowed to travel though always with persons to keep a guard over me and i am come to spend the carnival at venice the third said i am charles edward king of england my father has renounced his right to the throne in my favor i have fought in defence of my rights and near a thousand of my friends have had their hearts taken out of their bodies alive and thrown in their faces i have myself been confined in a prison i am going to rome to visit the king my father who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather and i have come to spend the carnival at venice the fourth spoke thus i am the king of poland the fortune of war has stripped me of my hereditary dominions my father experienced the same vicissitudes of fate i resign myself to the will of providence in the same manner as sultan achmet the emperor ivan and king charles edward whom god long preserve and i have come to spend the carnival at venice     the fifth said i am king of poland also i have twice lost my kingdom but providence has given me other dominions where i have done more good than all the sarmatian kings put together were ever able to do on the banks of the vistula i resign myself likewise to providence and have come to spend the carnival at venice it now came to the sixth monarchs turn to speak gentlemen said he i am not so great a prince as the rest of you it is true but i am however a crowned head i am theodore elected king of corsica i have had the title of majesty and am now hardly treated with common civility i have coined money and am not now worth a single ducat   0 i have had two secretaries and am now without a valet i was once seated on a throne and since that have lain upon a truss of straw in a common jail in london and i very much fear i shall meet with the same fate here in venice where i came like your majesties to divert myself at the carnival the other five kings listened to this speech with great attention it excited their compassion each of them made the unhappy theodore a present of twenty sequins and candide gave him a diamond worth just a hundred times that sum who can this private person be said the five princes to one another who is able to give and has actually given a hundred times as much as any of us just as they rose from table in came four serene highnesses who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war and had come to spend the remainder of the carnival at venice candide took no manner of notice of them for his thoughts were wholly employed on his voyage to constantinople where he intended to go in search of his lovely miss cunegund chapter xxvii candides voyage to constantinople the trusty cacambo had already engaged the captain of the turkish ship that was to carry sultan achmet back to constantinople to take candide and     martin on board accordingly they both embarked after paying their obeisance to his miserable highness as they were going on board candide said to martin you see we supped in company with six dethroned kings and to one of them i gave charity perhaps there may be a great many other princes still more unfortunate for my part i have lost only a hundred sheep and am now going to fly to the arms of my charming miss cunegund my dear martin i must insist on it that pangloss was in the right all is for the best i wish it may be said martin but this was an odd adventure we met with at venice i do not think there ever was an instance before of six dethroned monarchs supping together at a public inn this is not more extraordinary said martin than most of what has happened to us it is a very common thing for kings to be dethroned and as for our having the honor to sup with six of them it is a mere accident not deserving our attention as soon as candide set his foot on board the vessel he flew to his old friend and valet cacambo and throwing his arms about his neck embraced him with transports of joy well said he what news of miss cunegund does she still continue the paragon of beauty does she love me still how does she do you have doubtless purchased a superb palace for her at constantinople my dear master replied cacambo miss cunegund washes dishes on the banks of the propontis     in the house of a prince who has very few to wash she is at present a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named ragotsky whom the grand turk allows three crowns a day to maintain him in his exile but the most melancholy circumstance of all is that she is turned horribly ugly ugly or handsome said candide i am a man of honor and as such am obliged to love her still but how could she possibly have been reduced to so abject a condition when i sent five or six millions to her by you lord bless me said cacambo was not i obliged to give two millions to seignor don fernando dibaraa y fagueora y mascarenes y lampourdos y souza the governor of buenos ayres for liberty to take miss cunegund away with me and then did not a brave fellow of a pirate gallantly strip us of all the rest and then did not this same pirate carry us with him to cape matapan to milo to nicaria to samos to petra to the dardanelles to marmora to scutari miss cunegund and the old woman are now servants to the prince i have told you of and i myself am slave to the dethroned sultan what a chain of shocking accidents exclaimed candide but after all i have still some diamonds left with which i can easily procure miss cunegunds liberty it is a pity though she is grown so ugly then turning to martin what think you friend said he whose condition is most to be pitied the emperor achmets the emperor ivans     king charles edwards or mine faith i cannot resolve your question said martin unless i had been in the breasts of you all ah cried candide was pangloss here now he would have known and satisfied me at once i know not said martin in what balance your pangloss could have weighed the misfortunes of mankind and have set a just estimation on their sufferings all that i pretend to know of the matter is that there are millions of men on the earth whose conditions are a hundred times more pitiable than those of king charles edward the emperor ivan or sultan achmet why that may be answered candide in a few days they reached the bosphorus and the first thing candide did was to pay a high ransom for cacambo then without losing time he and his companions went on board a galley in order to search for his cunegund on the banks of the propontis notwithstanding she was grown so ugly there were two slaves among the crew of the galley who rowed very ill and to whose bare backs the master of the vessel frequently applied a lash candide from natural sympathy looked at these two slaves more attentively than at any of the rest and drew near them with an eye of pity their features though greatly disfigured appeared to him to bear a strong resemblance with those of pangloss and the unhappy baron jesuit miss cunegunds brother this idea affected him with grief and compassion he examined them more attentively than before in     troth said he turning to martin if i had not seen my master pangloss fairly hanged and had not myself been unlucky enough to run the baron through the body i should absolutely think those two rowers were the men no sooner had candide uttered the names of the baron and pangloss than the two slaves gave a great cry ceased rowing and let fall their oars out of their hands the master of the vessel seeing this ran up to them and redoubled the discipline of the lash hold hold cried candide i will give you what money you shall ask for these two persons good heavens it is candide said one of the men candide cried the other do i dream said candide or am i awake am i actually on board this galley is this my lord baron whom i killed and that my master pangloss whom i saw hanged before my face it is i it is i cried they both together what is this your great philosopher said martin my dear sir said candide to the master of the galley how much do you ask for the ransom of the baron of thunderten tronckh who is one of the first barons of the empire and of mr pangloss the most profound metaphysician in germany why then christian cur replied the turkish captain since these two dogs of christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians who no doubt are of high rank in their own country thou shalt give me fifty thousand sequins you shall have them sir carry me back     as quick as thought to constantinople and you shall receive the money immediately—no carry me first to miss cunegund the captain upon candides first proposal had already tacked about and he made the crew ply their oars so effectually that the vessel flew through the water quicker than a bird cleaves the air candide bestowed a thousand embraces on the baron and pangloss and so then my dear baron i did not kill you and you my dear pangloss are come to life again after your hanging but how came you slaves on board a turkish galley and is it true that my dear sister is in this country said the baron yes said cacambo and do i once again behold my dear candide said pangloss candide presented martin and cacambo to them they embraced each other and all spoke together the galley flew like lightning and soon they were got back to port candide instantly sent for a jew to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond richly worth one hundred thousand though the fellow swore to him all the time by father abraham that he gave him the most he could possibly afford he no sooner got the money into his hands than he paid it down for the ransom of the baron and pangloss the latter flung himself at the feet of his deliverer and bathed him with his tears the former thanked him with a gracious nod and promised to return him the money the first opportunity but is it possible said he that my sister should     be in turkey nothing is more possible answered cacambo for she scours the dishes in the house of a transylvanian prince candide sent directly for two jews and sold more diamonds to them and then he set out with his companions in another galley to deliver miss cunegund from slavery chapter xxviii what befell candide cunegund pangloss martin etc pardon said candide to the baron once more let me entreat your pardon reverend father for running you through the body say no more about it replied the baron i was a little too hasty i must own but as you seem to be desirous to know by what accident i came to be a slave on board the galley where you saw me i will inform you after i had been cured of the would you gave me by the college apothecary i was attacked and carried off by a party of spanish troops who clapped me in prison in buenos ayres at the very time my sister was setting out from there i asked leave to return to rome to the general of my order who appointed me chaplain to the french ambassador at constantinople i had not been a week in my new office when i happened to meet one evening with a young icoglan extremely handsome and well made the     weather was very hot the young man had an inclination to bathe i took the opportunity to bathe likewise i did not know it was a crime for a christian to be found naked in company with a young turk a cadi ordered me to receive a hundred blows on the soles of my feet and sent me to the galleys i do not believe that there was ever an act of more flagrant injustice but i would fain know how my sister came to be a scullion to a transylvanian prince who has taken refuge among the turks but how happens it that i behold you again my dear pangloss said candide it is true answered pangloss you saw me hanged though i ought properly to have been burned but you may remember that it rained extremely hard when they were going to roast me the storm was so violent that they found it impossible to light the fire so they hanged me because they could do no better a surgeon purchased my body carried it home and prepared to dissect me he began by making a crucial incision from my navel to the clavicle it is impossible for anyone to have been more lamely hanged than i had been the executioner was a subdeacon and knew how to burn people very well but as for hanging he was a novice at it being quite out of practice the cord being wet and not slipping properly the noose did not join in short i still continued to breathe the crucial incision made me scream to such a degree that my surgeon fell flat     upon his back and imagining it was the devil he was dissecting ran away and in his fright tumbled down stairs his wife hearing the noise flew from the next room and seeing me stretched upon the table with my crucial incision was still more terrified than her husband and fell upon him when they had a little recovered themselves i heard her say to her husband my dear how could you think of dissecting a heretic dont you know that the devil is always in them ill run directly to a priest to come and drive the evil spirit out i trembled from head to foot at hearing her talk in this manner and exerted what little strength i had left to cry out have mercy on me at length the portuguese barber took courage sewed up my wound and his wife nursed me and i was upon my legs in a fortnights time the barber got me a place to be lackey to a knight of malta who was going to venice but finding my master had no money to pay me my wages i entered into the service of a venetian merchant and went with him to constantinople one day i happened to enter a mosque where i saw no one but an old man and a very pretty young female devotee who was telling her beads her neck was quite bare and in her bosom she had a beautiful nosegay of tulips roses anemones ranunculuses hyacinths and auriculas she let fall her nosegay i ran immediately to take it up and presented it to her with a most respectful bow i was so long in delivering it that the imam began to be angry     and perceiving i was a christian he cried out for help they carried me before the cadi who ordered me to receive one hundred bastinadoes and sent me to the galleys i was chained in the very galley and to the very same bench with the baron on board this galley there were four young men belonging to marseilles five neapolitan priests and two monks of corfu who told us that the like adventures happened every day the baron pretended that he had been worse used than myself and i insisted that there was far less harm in taking up a nosegay and putting it into a womans bosom than to be found stark naked with a young icoglan we were continually whipped and received twenty lashes a day with a heavy thong when the concatenation of sublunary events brought you on board our galley to ransom us from slavery well my dear pangloss said candide to him when you were hanged dissected whipped and tugging at the oar did you continue to think that everything in this world happens for the best i have always abided by my first opinion answered pangloss for after all i am a philosopher and it would not become me to retract my sentiments especially as leibnitz could not be in the wrong and that preestablished harmony is the finest thing in the world as well as a plenum and the materia subtilis  00 chapter xxix in what manner candide found miss cunegund and the old woman again while candide the baron pangloss martin and cacambo were relating their several adventures and reasoning on the contingent or noncontingent events of this world on causes and effects on moral and physical evil on free will and necessity and on the consolation that may be felt by a person when a slave and chained to an oar in a turkish galley they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the coasts of the propontis the first objects they beheld there were miss cunegund and the old woman who were hanging some tablecloths on a line to dry the baron turned pale at the sight even the tender candide that affectionate lover upon seeing his fair cunegund all sunburnt with blear eyes a withered neck wrinkled face and arms all covered with a red scurf started back with horror but recovering himself he advanced towards her out of good manners she embraced candide and her brother they embraced the old woman and candide ransomed them both there was a small farm in the neighborhood which the old woman proposed to candide to make shift with till the company should meet with a more favorable destiny cunegund not knowing that she was grown ugly as no one had informed her of it  0  reminded candide of his promise in so peremptory a manner that the simple lad did not dare to refuse her he then acquainted the baron that he was going to marry his sister i will never suffer said the baron my sister to be guilty of an action so derogatory to her birth and family nor will i bear this insolence on your part no i never will be reproached that my nephews are not qualified for the first ecclesiastical dignities in germany nor shall a sister of mine ever be the wife of any person below the rank of a baron of the empire cunegund flung herself at her brothers feet and bedewed them with her tears but he still continued inflexible thou foolish fellow said candide have i not delivered thee from the galleys paid thy ransom and thy sisters too who was a scullion and is very ugly and yet condescend to marry her and shalt thou pretend to oppose the match if i were to listen only to the dictates of my anger i should kill thee again thou mayest kill me again said the baron but thou shalt not marry my sister while i am living chapter xxx conclusion candide had in truth no great inclination to marry miss cunegund but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match and cunegund pressed him so warmly that  0  he could not recant he consulted pangloss martin and the faithful cacambo pangloss composed a fine memorial by which he proved that the baron had no right over his sister and that she might according to all the laws of the empire marry candide with the left hand martin concluded to throw the baron into the sea cacambo decided that he must be delivered to the turkish captain and sent to the galleys after which he should be conveyed by the first ship to the fathergeneral at rome this advice was found to be good the old woman approved of it and not a syllable was said to his sister the business was executed for a little money and they had the pleasure of tricking a jesuit and punishing the pride of a german baron it was altogether natural to imagine that after undergoing so many disasters candide married to his mistress and living with the philosopher pangloss the philosopher martin the prudent cacambo and the old woman having besides brought home so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas would lead the most agreeable life in the world but he had been so robbed by the jews that he had nothing left but his little farm his wife every day growing more and more ugly became headstrong and insupportable the old woman was infirm and more illnatured yet than cunegund cacambo who worked in the garden and carried the produce of it to sell at constantinople was above his labor and cursed his fate pangloss despaired  0  of making a figure in any of the german universities and as to martin he was firmly persuaded that a person is equally illsituated everywhere he took things with patience candide martin and pangloss disputed sometimes about metaphysics and morality boats were often seen passing under the windows of the farm laden with effendis bashaws and cadis that were going into banishment to lemnos mytilene and erzerum and other cadis bashaws and effendis were seen coming back to succeed the place of the exiles and were driven out in their turns they saw several heads curiously stuck upon poles and carried as presents to the sublime porte such sights gave occasion to frequent dissertations and when no disputes were in progress the irksomeness was so excessive that the old woman ventured one day to tell them i would be glad to know which is worst to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates to have one buttock cut off to run the gauntlet among the bulgarians to be whipped and hanged at an autodafé to be dissected to be chained to an oar in a galley and in short to experience all the miseries through which every one of us hath passed or to remain here doing nothing this said candide is a grand question this discourse gave birth to new reflections and martin especially concluded that man was born to live in the convulsions of disquiet or in the lethargy of idleness though candide did not absolutely  0  agree to this yet he did not determine anything on that head pangloss avowed that he had undergone dreadful sufferings but having once maintained that everything went on as well as possible he still maintained it and at the same time believed nothing of it there was one thing which more than ever confirmed martin in his detestable principles made candide hesitate and embarrassed pangloss which was the arrival of pacquette and brother giroflée one day at their farm this couple had been in the utmost distress they had very speedily made away with their three thousand piastres they had parted been reconciled quarrelled again been thrown into prison had made their escape and at last brother giroflée had turned turk pacquette still continued to follow her trade but she got little or nothing by it i foresaw very well said martin to candide that your presents would soon be squandered and only make them more miserable you and cacambo have spent millions of piastres and yet you are not more happy than brother giroflée and pacquette ah said pangloss to pacquette it is heaven that has brought you here among us my poor child do you know that you have cost me the tip of my nose one eye and one ear what a handsome shape is here and what is this world this new adventure engaged them more deeply than ever in philosophical disputations in the neighborhood lived a famous dervish who  0  passed for the best philosopher in turkey they went to consult him pangloss who was their spokesman addressed him thus master we come to entreat you to tell us why so strange an animal as man has been formed why do you trouble your head about it said the dervish is it any business of yours but my reverend father said candide there is a horrible deal of evil on the earth what signifies it said the dervish whether there is evil or good when his highness sends a ship to egypt does he trouble his head whether the rats in the vessel are at their ease or not what must then be done said pangloss be silent answered the dervish i flattered myself replied pangloss to have reasoned a little with you on the causes and effects on the best of possible worlds the origin of evil the nature of the soul and a preestablished harmony at these words the dervish shut the door in their faces during this conversation news was spread abroad that two viziers of the bench and the mufti had just been strangled at constantinople and several of their friends empaled this catastrophe made a great noise for some hours pangloss candide and martin as they were returning to the little farm met with a goodlooking old man who was taking the air at his door under an alcove formed of the boughs of orangetrees pangloss who was as inquisitive as he was disputative asked him what was  0  the name of the mufti who was lately strangled i cannot tell answered the good old man i never knew the name of any mufti or vizier breathing i am entirely ignorant of the event you speak of i presume that in general such as are concerned in public affairs sometimes come to a miserable end and that they deserve it but i never inquire what is doing at constantinople i am contented with sending thither the produce of my garden which i cultivate with my own hands after saying these words he invited the strangers to come into his house his two daughters and two sons presented them with divers sorts of sherbet of their own making besides caymac heightened with the peels of candied citrons oranges lemons pineapples pistachio nuts and mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of batavia or the american islands after which the two daughters of this good mussulman perfumed the beards of candide pangloss and martin you must certainly have a vast estate said candide to the turk who replied i have no more than twenty acres of ground the whole of which i cultivate myself with the help of my children and our labor keeps off from us three great evils—idleness vice and want candide as he was returning home made profound reflections on the turks discourse this good old man said he to pangloss and martin appears to me to have chosen for himself a lot much  0  preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honor to sup human grandeur said pangloss is very dangerous if we believe the testimonies of almost all philosophers for we find eglon king of moab was assassinated by aod absalom was hanged by the hair of his head and run through with three darts king nadab son of jeroboam was slain by baaza king ela by zimri okosias by jehu athaliah by jehoiada the kings jehooiakim jeconiah and zedekiah were led into captivity i need not tell you what was the fate of crœsus astyages darius dionysius of syracuse pyrrhus perseus hannibal jugurtha ariovistus cæsar pompey nero otho vitellius domitian richard ii of england edward ii henry vi richard iii mary stuart charles i the three henrys of france and the emperor henry iv neither need you tell me said candide that we must take care of our garden you are in the right said pangloss for when man was put into the garden of eden it was with an intent to dress it and this proves that man was not born to be idle work then without disputing said martin it is the only way to render life supportable the little society one and all entered into this laudable design and set themselves to exert their different talents the little piece of ground yielded them a plentiful crop cunegund indeed was very ugly but she became an excellent hand at pastrywork pacquette embroidered the old woman had  0  the care of the linen there was none down to brother giroflée but did some service he was a very good carpenter and became an honest man pangloss used now and then to say to candide there is a concatenation of all events in the best of possible worlds for in short had you not been kicked out of a fine castle for the love of miss cunegund had you not been put into the inquisition had you not travelled over america on foot had you not run the baron through the body and had you not lost all your sheep which you brought from the good country of el dorado you would not have been here to eat preserved citrons and pistachio nuts excellently observed answered candide but let us take care of our garden  0  part ii chapter i how candide quitted his companions and what happened to him we soon become tired of everything in life riches fatigue the possessor ambition when satisfied leaves only remorse behind it the joys of love are but transient joys and candide made to experience all the vicissitudes of fortune was soon disgusted with cultivating his garden mr pangloss said he if we are in the best of possible worlds you will own to me at least that this is not enjoying that portion of possible happiness but living obscure in a little corner of the propontis having no other resource than that of my own manual labor which may one day fail me no other pleasures than what mrs cunegund gives me who is very ugly and which is worse is my wife no other company than yours which is sometimes irksome to me or that of martin which makes me melancholy or that of giroflée who is but very lately become an honest man or that of pacquette the danger of whose correspondence you have so fully experienced or that of the hag who has but   0 one buttock and is constantly repeating old wives tales to this pangloss made the following reply philosophy teaches us that monads divisible in infinitum arrange themselves with wonderful sagacity in order to compose the different bodies which we observe in nature the heavenly bodies are what they should be they are placed where they should be they describe the circles which they should describe man follows the bent he should follow he is what he should be he does what he should do you bemoan yourself o candide because the monad of your soul is disgusted but disgust is a modification of the soul and this does not hinder but everything is for the best both for you and others when you beheld me covered with sores i did not maintain my opinion the less for that for if miss pacquette had not made me taste the pleasures of love and its poison i should not have met with you in holland i should not have given the anabaptist james an opportunity of performing a meritorious act i should not have been hanged in lisbon for the edification of my neighbor i should not have been here to assist you with my advice and make you live and die in leibnitzs opinion yes my dear candide everything is linked in a chain everything is necessary in the best of possible worlds there is a necessity that the burgher of montauban should instruct kings that the worm of quimpercorentin should carp carp carp that the declaimer against     philosophers should occasion his own crucifixion in st denis street that a rascally recollet and the archdeacon of st malo should diffuse their gall and calumny through their christian journals that philosophy should be accused at the tribunal of melpomene and that philosophers should continue to enlighten human nature notwithstanding the croakings of ridiculous animals that flounder in the marshes of learning and should you be once more driven by a hearty kicking from the finest of all castles to learn again your exercise among the bulgarians should you again suffer the dirty effects of a dutchwomans zeal be half drowned again before lisbon to be unmercifully whipped again by order of the most holy inquisition should you run the same risks again among los padres the oreillons and the french should you in short suffer every possible calamity and never understand leibnitz better than i myself do you will still maintain that all is well that all is for the best that a plenum the materia subtilis a preestablished harmony and monads are the finest things in the world and that leibnitz is a great man even to those who do not comprehend him to this fine speech candide the mildest being in nature though he had killed three men two of whom were priests answered not a word but weary of the doctor and his society next morning at break of day taking a white staff in his hand marched off without knowing whither he was going but in     quest of a place where one does not become disgusted and where men are not men as in the good country of el dorado candide so much the less unhappy as he had no longer a love for miss cunegund living upon the bounty of different people who were not christians but yet give alms arrived after a very long and very tiresome journey at tauris upon the frontiers of persia a city noted for the cruelties which the turks and persians have by turns exercised therein half dead with fatigue having hardly more clothes than what were necessary to cover that part which constitutes the man and which men call shameful candide could not well relish pangloss opinion when a persian accosted him in the most polite manner beseeching him to ennoble his house with his presence you make a jest of me cried candide to him i am a poor devil who has left a miserable dwelling i had in propontis because i had married miss cunegund because she is grown very ugly and because i was disgusted i am not indeed able to ennoble anybodys house i am not noble myself thank god if i had the honor of being so baron thundertentronckh should have paid very dearly for the kicks on the backside with which he favored me or i should have died of shame for it which would have been pretty philosophical besides i have been whipped ignominiously by the executioners of the most holy inquisition and by two thousand heroes at three pence     halfpenny a day give me what you please but do not insult my distress with taunts which would deprive you of the whole value of your beneficence my lord replied the persian you may be a beggar and this appears pretty plainly but my religion obliges me to use hospitality it is sufficient that you are a man and under misfortunes that the apple of my eye should be the path for your feet vouchsafe to ennoble my house with your radiant presence i will since you desire it answered candide come then enter said the persian they went in accordingly and candide could not forbear admiring the respectful treatment shown him by his host the slaves anticipated his desires the whole house seemed to be busied in nothing but contributing to his satisfaction should this last said candide to himself all does not go so badly in this country three days were passed during which time the kindness of the persian still continued and candide already cried out master pangloss i always imagined you were in the right for you are a great philosopher chapter ii what befell candide in this house—how he got out of it candide being well fed well clothed and free from chagrin soon became again as ruddy as fresh and as gay as he had been in westphalia his host     ismael raab was pleased to see this change he was a man six feet high adorned with two small eyes extremely red and a large nose full of pimples which sufficiently declared his infraction of mahomets law his whiskers were the most famous in the country and mothers wished their sons nothing so much as a like pair raab had wives because he was rich but he thought in a manner that is but too common in the east and in some of our colleges in europe your excellence is brighter than the stars said the cunning persian to the brisk candide one day half smiling and half suppressing his words you must have captivated a great many hearts you are formed to give and receive happiness alas answered our hero i was happy only by halves behind a screen where i was but half at my ease mademoiselle cunegund was handsome then—mademoiselle cunegund poor innocent thing follow me my lord said the persian and candide followed accordingly they came to a very agreeable retreat where silence and pleasure reigned there ismael raab tenderly embraced candide and in a few words made a declaration of love like that which the beautiful alexis expresses with so much pleasure in virgils eclogues candide could not recover from his astonishment no cried he i can never suffer such infamy what cause and what horrible effect i had rather die so you shall replied ismael enraged how thou christian dog because i would     politely give you pleasure—resolve directly to satisfy me or to suffer the most cruel death candide did not long hesitate the cogent reason of the persian made him tremble for he feared death like a philosopher we accustom ourselves to everything in time candide well fed well taken care of but closely watched was not absolutely disgusted with his condition good cheer and the different diversions performed by ismaels slaves gave some respite to his chagrin he was unhappy only when he thought and thus it is with the greatest part of mankind at that time one of the most stanch supporters of the monkish crew in persia the most learned of the mahometan doctors who understood arabic perfectly and even greek as spoken at that day in the country of demosthenes and sophocles the reverend edivanbaaldenk returned from constantinople where he had conversed with the reverend mamoudabram on a very delicate point of doctrine namely whether the prophet had plucked from the angel gabriels wing the pen which he used for the writing of the koran or if gabriel had made him a present of it they had disputed for three days and three nights with a warmth worthy of the noblest sages of controversy and the doctor returned home persuaded like all the disciples of ali that mahomet had plucked the quill while mamoudabram remained convinced like the rest of omars followers that the prophet was incapable of     committing any such rudeness and that the angel had very politely made him a present of this quill for his pen it is said that there was at constantinople a certain freethinker who insinuated that it was necessary to examine first whether the koran was really written with a pen taken from the wing of the angel gabriel but he was stoned candides arrival had made a noise in tauris many who had heard him speak of contingent and noncontingent effects imagined he was a philosopher the reverend edivanbaaldenk was told of him he had the curiosity to come and see him and raab who could hardly refuse a person of such consequence sent for candide to make his appearance he seemed to be well pleased with the manner in which candide spake of bad physics bad morals of agent and effect i understand that you are a philosopher and thats all but it is enough candide said the venerable recluse it is not right that so great a man as you are should be treated with such indignity as i am told in the world you are a stranger ismael raab has no right over you i propose to conduct you to court there you shall meet with a favorable reception the sophi loves the sciences ismael you must put this young philosopher into my hands or dread incurring the displeasure of the prince and drawing upon yourself the vengeance of heaven but especially of the monks these last words frightened the otherwise     undaunted persian and he consented to everything candide blessing heaven and the monks went the same day out of tauris with the mahometan doctor they took the road to ispahan where they arrived loaded with the blessings and favors of the people chapter iii candides reception at court and what followed the reverend edivanbaaldenk made no delay in presenting candide to the king his majesty took a particular pleasure in hearing him he made him dispute with several learned men of his court who looked upon him as a fool an ignoramus and an idiot which much contributed to persuade his majesty that he was a great man because said he to them you do not comprehend candides reasonings you abuse him but i who also comprehend nothing at all of them assure you that he is a great philosopher and i swear to it by my whisker upon these words the literati were struck dumb candide had apartments assigned him in the palace he had slaves to wait on him he was dressed in magnificent clothes and the sophi commanded that whatever he should say no one should dare to assert that he was wrong his majesty did not     stop here the venerable monk was continually soliciting him in favor of his guest and his majesty at length resolved to rank him among the number of his most intimate favorites god be praised and our holy prophet said the imam addressing himself to candide i am come to tell you an agreeable piece of news that you are happy my dear candide that you are going to raise the envy of the world you shall swim in opulence you may aspire to the most splendid posts in the empire but do not forget me my friend think that it is i who have procured you the favor you are just on the point of enjoying let gayety reign over the horizon of your countenance the king grants you a favor which has been sought by many and you will soon exhibit a sight which the court has not enjoyed these two years past and what are these favors demanded candide with which the prince intends to honor me this very day answered the monk quite overjoyed this very day you are to receive fifty strokes with a leathern lash on the soles of your feet in the presence of his majesty the eunuchs named for perfuming you for the occasion are to be here directly prepare yourself to go cheerfully through this little trial and thereby render yourself worthy of the king of kings let the king of kings cried candide in a rage keep his favors to himself if i must receive fifty blows with a lash in order to merit them it is thus replied the doctor coldly that he deals     with those on whom he means to pour down his benefits i love you too much to regard the little temper which you show on this occasion and i will make you happy in spite of yourself he had not done speaking when the eunuchs arrived preceded by the executor of his majestys private pleasures who was one of the greatest and most robust lords of the court candide in vain remonstrated against their proceedings they perfumed his legs and feet according to custom four eunuchs carried him to the place appointed for the ceremony through the midst of a double file of soldiers while the trumpets sounded the cannon fired and the bells of all the mosques of ispahan jingled the sophi was already there accompanied by his principal officers and most distinguished personages of his court in an instant they stretched out candide upon a little form finely gilded and the executor of the private pleasures put himself in a posture for entering upon his office o master pangloss master pangloss were you but here said candide weeping and roaring out with all his force a circumstance which would have been thought very indecent if the monk had not given the people to understand that his guest had put himself into such   0 violent agitations only the better to divert his majesty this great king it is true laughed like a fool he even took such delight in the affair that after the fifty blows had been given he ordered fifty more to be added but his first minister having represented to him with a firmness not very common that such an unheard of favor with regard to a stranger might alienate the hearts of his subjects he revoked that order and candide was carried back to his apartments they put him to bed after having bathed his feet with vinegar the grandees came round him in order to congratulate him on his good fortune the sophi then came to assist him in person and not only gave him his hand to kiss according to the custom but likewise honored him with a great blow of his fist on his mouth whence the politicians conjectured that candide would arrive at extraordinary preferment and what is very uncommon though politicians they were not deceived chapter iv fresh favors conferred on candide his great advancement as soon as our hero was cured he was introduced to the king to return him his thanks the monarch received him very graciously he gave him two or three hearty boxes on the ear during     their conversation and conducted him back as far as the guardroom with several sound kicks on the posterior at which the courtiers were ready to burst for envy since his majesty had been in a drubbing humor no person had ever received such signal marks of his majestys favor in this way as did candide three days after this interview our philosopher who was enraged at the favors he had received and thought that everything went very bad was nominated governor of chusistan with an absolute power he was decorated with a fur cap which is a grand mark of distinction in persia he took his leave of the sophi and departed for sus the capital of his province from the moment that candide made his appearance at court the grandees had plotted his destruction the excessive favors which the sophi had heaped on him served but to increase the storm ready to burst upon his head he however applauded himself on his good fortune and especially his removal from court he enjoyed in prospect the pleasures of supreme rank and he said from the bottom of his heart how blest the subject from his lord removed he had not gone quite twenty miles from ispahan before five hundred horsemen armed capapie came up with him and his attendants and discharged a volley of firearms upon them candide imagined at first that this was intended to do him an honor but the ball which broke his leg soon gave him to     know what was going on his people laid down their arms and candide more dead than alive was carried to a castle remote from any other dwelling his baggage camels slaves white and black eunuchs with thirtysix women which the sophi had given him for his use all became the prey of the conqueror our heros leg was cut off for fear of mortification and care was taken of his life that a more cruel death might be inflicted on him o pangloss pangloss what would now become of your optimism if you saw me short of one leg in the hands of my cruelest enemies just as i was entering upon the path of happiness and was governor or king as one may say of one of the most considerable provinces of the empire of ancient media when i had camels slaves black and white eunuchs and thirtysix women for my own use and of which i had not made any thus candide spoke as soon as he was able to speak but while he was thus bemoaning himself everything was going for the best for him the ministry informed of the outrages committed against him had detached a body of welldisciplined troops in pursuit of the mutineers and the monk edivanbaaldenk took care to publish by means of others of his fraternity that candide being the work of the monks was consequently the work of god such as had any knowledge of this atrocious attempt were so much the more ready to discover it as the ministers of religion gave assurance on the part of     mahomet that every one who had eaten pork drank wine omitted bathing for any number of days together or had conversed with women at the time of their impurity against the express prohibitions of the koran should be ipso facto absolved upon declaring what they knew concerning the conspiracy they soon discovered the place of candides confinement which they broke open and as it was a religious affair the party worsted were exterminated to a man agreeably to custom in that case candide marching over a heap of dead bodies made his escape triumphed over the greatest peril he had hitherto encountered and with his attendants resumed the road to his government he was received there as a favorite who had been honored with fifty blows of a lash on the soles of his feet in the presence of the king of kings chapter v how candide became a very great man and yet was not contented the good of philosophy is its inspiring us with a love for our fellowcreatures paschal is almost the only philosopher who seems desirous to make us hate our neighbors luckily candide had not read paschal and he loved the poor human race very cordially this was soon perceived by the upright     part of the people they had always kept at a distance from the pretended legates of heaven but made no scruple of visiting candide and assisting him with their counsels he made several wise regulations for the encouragement of agriculture population commerce and the arts he rewarded those who had made any useful experiments and even encouraged such as had produced some essays on literature when the people in my province are in general content said he with a charming candor possibly i shall be so myself candide was a stranger to mankind he saw himself torn to pieces in seditious libels and calumniated in a work entitled the friend to mankind he found that while he was laboring to make people happy he had only made them ungrateful ah cried candide how hard it is to govern these beings without feathers which vegetate on the earth why am i not still in propontis in the company of master pangloss miss cunegund the daughter of pope urban x with only one cushion brother giroflée and the most luscious pacquette chapter vi the pleasures of candide candide in the bitterness of his grief wrote a very pathetic letter to the reverend edivanbaaldenk     he painted to him in such lively colors the present state of his soul that edivan greatly affected with it obtained permission of the sophi that candide should resign his employments his majesty in recompense of his services granted him a very considerable pension eased from the weight of grandeur our philosopher immediately sought after pangloss optimism in the pleasures of a private life he till then had lived for the benefit of others and seemed to have forgotten that he had a seraglio he now called it to remembrance with that emotion which the very name inspires let everything be got ready said he to his first eunuch for my visiting my women my lord answered the shrillpiped slave it is now that your excellency deserves the title of wise the men for whom you have done so much were not worthy of employing your thoughts but the women— that may be said candide modestly at the bottom of a garden where art had assisted nature to unfold her beauties stood a small house of simple and elegant structure very different from those which are to be seen in the suburbs of the finest city in europe candide could not approach it without blushing the air round this charming retreat diffused a delicious perfume the flowers amorously intermingled seemed here to be guided by the instinct of pleasure and preserved for a long time their various beauties here the rose never     lost its lovely hue the view of a rock from which the waters precipitated themselves with a murmuring and confused noise invited the soul of that soft melancholy which is ever the forerunner of pleasure candide entered trembling into a chamber where taste and magnificence were united his senses were drawn by a secret charm he cast his eyes on young telemachus who breathed on the canvas in the midst of the nymphs of calypsos court he next turned them to diana halfnaked flying into the arms of the tender endymion his agitation increased at the sight of a venus faithfully copied from that of medici his ears were struck with a divine harmony a company of young circassian females appeared covered with their veils they formed round him a sort of dance agreeably designed and more graceful than those trifling jigs that are performed on as trifling stages after the representation of the death of cæsar and pompey at a signal given they threw off their veils and discovered faces full of expression that lent new life to the diversion these beauties studied the most seducing attitudes without appearing to intend it one expressed in her looks a passion without bounds another a soft languor which waits for pleasures without seeking them this fair one stooped and raised herself precipitately to disclose to view those enchanting charms which the fair sex display in such full scope at paris another threw aside a part of her cymar to show a form which alone is capable of     inflaming a mortal of any delicacy the dance ceased and they remained in profound silence this pause recalled candide to himself the fire of love took possession of his breast he darted the most ardent looks on all around him imprinted warm kisses on lips as warm and eyes that swam in liquid fire he passed his hand over globes whiter than alabaster whose palpitating motion repelled the touch admired their proportion perceived little vermilion protuberances like those rosebuds which only wait the genial rays of the sun to unfold them he kissed them with rapture and his lips for some time remained glued thereon our philosopher next admired for a while a majestic figure of a fine and delicate shape burning with desires he at length threw the handkerchief to a young person whose eyes he had observed to be always fixed upon him and which seemed to say teach me the meaning of a trouble i am ignorant of and who blushing at the secret avowal became a thousand times more charming the eunuch then opened the door of a private chamber consecrated to the mysteries of love into which the lovers entered and the eunuch addressing his master said here it is my lord you are going to be truly happy oh answered candide i am in great hopes of it the ceiling and walls of this little retreat were covered with mirrors in the midst was placed a divan of black satin on which candide threw the     young circassian and caressed her in silent ecstasy the fair one gave him no other interruption but to imprint kisses full of fire on his lips my lord said she to him in the turkish language which she spoke perfectly how fortunate is your slave to be thus honored with your transports an energy of sentiment can be expressed in every language by those who truly feel it these few words enchanted our philosopher he was no longer himself all he saw all he heard was new to him what difference between miss cunegund grown ugly and violated by bulgarian freebooters and a circassian girl of eighteen till then a stranger to man this was the first time the wise candide enjoyed her the objects which he devoured were repeated in the mirrors wherever he cast his eyes he saw upon the black satin the most beautiful and fairest body possible and the contrast of colors lent it new lustre with round firm and plump thighs an admirable fall of loins a—but i am obliged to have a regard to the false delicacy of our language it is sufficient for me to say that our philosopher tasted by frequent repetitions of that portion of happiness he was capable of receiving and that the young circassian in a little while proved his sufficing reason o master my dear master cried candide almost beside himself everything here is as well as in el dorado a fine woman can alone complete the wishes of man i am as happy as it is possible to be leibnitz is in the right and you are a great     philosopher for instance i engage that you my lovely girl have always had a bias towards optimism because you have always been happy alas no answered she i do not know what optimism is but i swear to you that your slave has not known happiness till today if my lord is pleased to give me leave i will convince him of it by a succinct recital of my adventures i am very willing said candide i am in a position to hear an historical detail upon which the fair slave began as follows chapter vii the history of zirza my father was a christian and so likewise am i as far as i have been told he had a little hermitage near cotatis where by his fervent devotion and practising austerities shocking to human nature he acquired the veneration of the faithful crowds of women came to pay him their homage and took a particular satisfaction in bathing his posteriors which he lashed every day with several smart strokes of discipline doubtless it was to one of the most devout of these visitants that i owe my being i was brought up in a cave in the neighborhood of my fathers little cell i was twelve years of age and had not yet left this kind of grave when the earth shook with a dreadful noise the arch of the vault fell in and i was drawn out from under the   0 rubbish half dead when light struck my eyes for the first time my father took me into his hermitage as a predestined child the whole of this adventure appeared strange to the people my father declared it a miracle and so did they i was called zirza which in persian signifies child of providence notice was soon taken of my poor charms the women already came but seldom to the hermitage and the men much oftener one of them told me that he loved me villain said my father to him hast thou substance sufficient to love her this is a great gift which god has intrusted to me he has made his appearance to me this night under the shape of a venerable hermit and he forbade me to give up the possession thereof for less than a thousand sequins get thee gone poor devil lest thine impure breath should blast her charms i have answered he only a heart to offer her but say barbarian dost thou not blush to make sport of the deity for the gratification of thine avarice with what front vile wretch darest thou pretend that god has spoken to thee this is throwing the greatest contempt upon the author of beings to represent him conversing with such men as thou art o blasphemy cried my father in a rage god himself has commanded me to stone blasphemers as he spoke these words he fell upon my lover and with repeated blows laid him dead on the ground and his blood flew in my face though i had not yet known what love was this man had interested     me and his death shocked me and rendered the sight of my father insufferable to me i took a resolution to leave him he perceived it ungrateful said he to me it is to me thou owest thy being thou are my daughter—and thou hatest me but i am going to deserve thy hatred by the most rigorous treatment he kept his word but too well with me cruel man during five years which i spent in tears and groans neither my youth nor my clouded beauty could in the least abate his wrath sometimes he stuck a thousand pins into all the parts of my body at other times with his discipline he made the blood trickle down my body this said candide gave you less pain than the pins true my lord answered zirza at last continued she i fled from my fathers habitation and not daring to trust myself to anybody i flung myself into the thickest part of the woods where i was three days without food and should have died were it not for a tiger which i had the happiness to please and who was willing to share with me the prey he caught but i had many horrors to encounter from this formidable beast and the brute had moods as changeable and dangerous as those which render men in certain conditions the prey of brutal passions which degrade their humanity bad food gave me the scurvy scarcely was i cured when i followed a merchant of slaves who was going to tiflis the plague was there then and i took it these various misfortunes did not absolutely affect my features nor hinder the sophis purveyor     from buying me for your use i have languished in tears these three months that i have been among the number of your women my companions and i imagined ourselves to be the objects of your contempt and if you knew my lord how disagreeable eunuchs are and how little adapted for comforting young girls who are despised—in short i am not yet eighteen years of age and of these i have spent twelve in a frightful cavern undergone an earthquake been covered with the blood of the first good man i had hitherto seen endured for the space of four years the most cruel tortures and have had the scurvy and the plague consumed with desires amidst a crew of black and white monsters still preserving that which i have saved from the fury of an awkward tiger and cursing my fate i have passed three months in this seraglio where i should have died of the jaundice had not your excellency honored me at last with your embraces o heavens cried candide is it possible that you have experienced such great misfortunes at so tender an age what would pangloss say could he hear you but your misfortunes are at an end as well as mine everything does not go badly now is not this true upon that candide resumed his caresses and was more than ever confirmed in the belief of pangloss system     chapter viii candides disgusts—an unexpected meeting our philosopher in the midst of his seraglio dispensed his favors equally he tasted the pleasures of variety and always returned to the child of providence with fresh ardor but this did not last long he soon felt violent pains in his loins and an excruciating colic he dried up as he grew happy then zirzas breast appeared no longer so white or so well placed her thighs not so hard nor so plump her eyes lost all their vivacity in those of candide her complexion its lustre and her lips that pure vermilion which had enchanted him at first sight he now perceived that she walked badly and had an offensive smell he saw with the greatest disgust a spot upon the mount of venus which he had never observed before to be tainted with any blemish the vehement ardor of zirza became burdensome to him he could see with great coolness the faults of his other women which had escaped him in his first transports of passion he saw nothing in them but a barefaced impudence he was ashamed to have walked in the steps of the wisest of men and he found women more bitter than death candide always cherishing christian sentiments spent his leisure time in walking over the streets of sus when one day a cavalier in a superb dress came up to him suddenly and called him by his name is it possible cried candide my lord that you     are — it is not possible otherwise you are so very like the abbé of périgord i am the very man answered the abbé upon this candide started back and with his usual ingenuousness said are you happy mr abbé a fine question replied the abbé the little deceit which i have put upon you has contributed not a little to gain me credit the police had employed me for some time but having fallen out with them i quitted the ecclesiastical habit which was no longer of any service to me i went over into england where persons of my profession are better paid i said all i knew and all i did not know about the strength and weakness of the country i had lately left i especially gave bold assurances that the french were the dregs of the world and that good sense dwelt nowhere but in london in short i made a splendid fortune and have just concluded a treaty at the court of persia which will exterminate all the europeans who come for cotton and silk into the sophis dominions to the detriment of the english the object of your mission is very commendable said our philosopher but mr abbé you are a cheat i like not cheats and i have some credit at court tremble now your happiness has arrived at its utmost limits you are just upon the point of suffering the fate you deserve my lord candide cried the abbé throwing himself on his knees have pity on me i feel myself drawn to evil by an irresistible force as you find yourself necessitated to the practice of virtue     this fatal propensity i have perceived from the moment i became acquainted with mr wasp and worked at the feuilles what do you call feuilles said candide feuilles answered the abbé are sheets of seventytwo pages in print in which the public are entertained in the strain of calumny satire and dulness an honest man who can read and write and who is not able to continue among the jesuits has set himself to compose this pretty little work that he may have wherewithal to give his wife some lace and bring up his children in the fear of god and there are certain honest people who for a few pence and some bottles of bad wine assist the man in carrying on his scheme this mr wasp is besides a member of a curious club who divert themselves by making poor ignorant people drunk and causing them to blaspheme or in bullying a poor simple devil breaking his furniture and afterwards challenging him such pretty little amusements these gentry call mystifications and richly deserve the attention of the police in fine this very honest man mr wasp who boasts he never was in the galleys is troubled with a disposition which renders him insensible to the clearest truths and from which position he can be drawn only by certain violent means which he sustains with a resignation and courage above conception i have worked for some time under this celebrated genius i have become an eminent writer in my turn and i had but just quitted mr wasp to do a little for myself when i     had the honor of paying you a visit at paris though you are a very great cheat mr abbé yet your sincerity in this point makes some impression on me go to court ask for the rev edivanbaaldenk i shall write to him in your behalf but upon express condition that you promise me to become an honest man and that you will not be the occasion of some thousands having their throats cut for the sake of a little silk and cotton the abbé promised all that candide requested and they parted good friends chapter ix candides disgraces travels and adventures no sooner had the abbé got access to court than he employed all his skill in order to ingratiate himself with the minister and ruin his benefactor he spread a report that candide was a traitor and that he had spoken disrespectfully of the hallowed whiskers of the king of kings all the courtiers condemned him to be burned in a slow fire but the sophi more favorable only sentenced him to perpetual banishment after having previously kissed the sole of his accusers foot according to the usage among the persians the abbé went in person to put the sentence in execution he found our philosopher in pretty good health and disposed to become happy again my friend said the english ambassador     to him i come with regret to let you know that you must quit this kingdom with all expedition and kiss my feet with a true repentance for your horrid crimes kiss your feet mr abbé certainly you are not in earnest and i do not understand joking upon which some mutes who had attended the abbé entered and took off his shoes letting poor candide know by signs that he must submit to this piece of humiliation or else expect to be empaled candide by virtue of his free will kissed the abbés feet they put on him a sorry linen robe and the executioner drove him out of the town crying all the time behold a traitor who has spoken irreverently of the sophis whiskers irreverently of the imperial whiskers what did the officious monk while his friend whom he protected was treated thus i know nothing of that it is probable that he was tired of protecting candide who can depend on the favor of kings and especially that of monks in the meantime our hero went sadly on i never spoke said he to himself about the king of persias whiskers i am cast in an instant from the pinnacle of happiness into the abyss of misery because a wretch who has violated all laws accuses me of a pretended crime which i have never committed and this wretch this monster this persecuter of virtue—he is happy candide after travelling for some days found himself upon the frontiers of turkey he directed     his course towards the propontis with a design to settle there again and pass the rest of his days in the cultivation of his garden he saw as he entered a little village a great multitude of people tumultuously assembled he inquired into the cause of it this said an old man to him is a singular affair it is some time ago since the wealthy mahomet demanded in marriage the daughter of the janissary zamoud he found her not to be a virgin and in pursuance of a principle quite natural and authorized by the laws he sent her home to her father after having branded her in the face zamoud exasperated at the disgrace brought on his family in the first transports of a fury that is very natural with one stroke of his scimitar clove the disfigured visage of his daughter his eldest son who loved his sister passionately which is very frequent in nature flew upon his father and plunged a sharp poniard to his heart afterwards like a lion who grows more enraged at seeing his own blood flow the furious zamoud ran to mahomets house and after striking to the ground some slaves who opposed his passage murdered mahomet his wives and two children then in the cradle all of which was very natural considering the violent passion he then was in at last to crown all he killed himself with the same poniard reeking with the blood of his father and his enemies which is also very natural what a scene of horrors cried candide what would you have said master     pangloss had you found such barbarities in nature would not you acknowledge that nature is corrupted that all is not— no said the old man for the preestablished harmony— o heavens do ye not deceive me is this pangloss cried candide whom i again see the very same answered the old man i knew you but i was willing to find out your sentiments before i would discover myself come let us discourse a little on contingent effects and see if you have made any progress in the art of wisdom alas said candide you choose your time ungenerously rather let me know what has become of miss cunegund tell me where are brother giroflée pacquette and pope urbans daughter i know nothing of them replied pangloss it is now two years since i left our habitation in order to find you out i have travelled over almost all turkey i was upon the point of setting out for the court of persia where i heard you made a great figure and i only tarried in this little village among these good people till i should gather strength to continue my journey what is this i see answered candide quite surprised you want an arm my dear doctor that is nothing replied the onehanded and the oneeyed doctor nothing is more common in the best of worlds than to see persons who want one eye and one arm this accident befell me in a journey from mecca our caravan was attacked by a troop of arabs our guard attempted to make   0 resistance and according to the rules of war the arabs who found themselves to be the strongest side massacred us all without mercy there perished about five hundred persons in this attack among whom were about a dozen pregnant women for my part i had only my skull split and an arm cut off i did not die for all this and i still found that everything went for the best but as to yourself my dear candide why is it that you have a wooden leg upon this candide began and gave an account of his adventures our philosophers turned together towards the propontis and enlivened their journey by discoursing on physical and moral evil free will and predestination monads and preestablished harmony chapter x candide and pangloss arrive at the propontis—what they saw there—what became of them o candide said pangloss why were you tired of cultivating your garden why did we not still continue to eat citrons and pistachio nuts why were you weary of your happiness because everything is necessary in the best of worlds there was a necessity that you should undergo the bastinado in the presence of the king of persia have your leg cut off in order to make chusistan happy to experience     the ingratitude of men and draw down upon the heads of some atrocious villains the punishment which they had deserved with such talk as this they arrived at their old habitation the first objects that presented themselves were martin and pacquette in the habit of slaves whence said candide to them is this metamorphosis after embracing them tenderly alas answered they sobbing you have no more a habitation another has undertaken the labor of cultivating your garden he eats your preserved citrons and pistachios and we are treated like negroes who said candide is this other the high admiral answered they a mortal the least humane of all mortals the sultan willing to recompense his services without putting himself to any expense has confiscated all your goods under pretext that you had gone over to his enemies and condemned us to slavery be advised by me candide added martin and continue your journey i always told you everything is for the worst the sum of evil exceeds by much that of good begone and i do not despair but you may become a manichæan if you are not so already pangloss would have begun an argument in form but candide interrupted him to ask about miss cunegund the old woman brother giroflée and cacambo cacambo answered martin is here he is at present employed in emptying slops the old woman is dead from a kick given her by a eunuch in the breast brother giroflée has     entered among the janissaries miss cunegund has recovered her plumpness and former beauty she is in our masters seraglio what a chain of misfortunes said candide was there a necessity for miss cunegund to become handsome only to make me a cuckold it matters little said pangloss whether miss cunegund be beautiful or ugly in your arms or those of another that is nothing to the general system for my part i wish her a numerous progeny philosophers do not perplex themselves by whom women have children provided they have them population— alas exclaimed martin philosophers might much better employ themselves in rendering a few individuals happy than engaging them to multiply the number of sufferers while they were thus arguing a great noise was heard on a sudden it was the admiral diverting himself by causing a dozen slaves to be whipped pangloss and candide both frightened with tears in their eyes parted from their friends and in all haste took the road to constantinople there they found all the people in a great stir a fire had broken out in the suburb of pera five or six hundred houses were already consumed and two or three thousand persons perished in the flames what a horrible disaster cried candide all is well said pangloss these little accidents happen every year it is entirely natural for the fire to catch houses built of wood and for those who are in them to be burned besides this procures some resources     to honest people who languish in misery what is this i hear said an officer of the sublime porte how wretch darest thou say that all is well when half constantinople is in flames dog be cursed of our prophet receive the punishment due to thy impudence and as he uttered these words he took pangloss by the middle and flung him headlong into the flames candide half dead with fright crept on all fours as well as he could to a neighboring quarter where all was more quiet and we shall see what became of him in the next chapter chapter xi candide continues his travels i have nothing left said our philosopher but to make myself either a slave or a turk happiness has forsaken me forever a turban would corrupt all my pleasures i shall be incapable of tasting tranquillity of soul in a religion full of imposture into which i enter merely from a motive of vile interest no i shall never be content if i cease to be an honest man let me make myself then a slave candide had no sooner taken this resolution than he set about putting it into execution he chose an armenian merchant for his master who was a man of a very good character and passed for virtuous as much as an armenian can be he gave candide two hundred sequins as the price of his liberty the     armenian was upon the point of departing for norway he took candide with him in the hope that a philosopher would be of use to him in his traffic they embarked and the wind was so favorable for them that they were not above half the usual time in their passage they even had no occasion for buying a wind from the lapland witches and contented themselves with giving them some stockfish that they might not disturb their good fortune with their enchantments which sometimes happens if we may believe moréris dictionary on this head the armenian no sooner landed than he provided a stock of whaleblubber and ordered our philosopher to go over all the country to buy him some dried salt fish candide acquitted himself of his commission in the best manner possible returned with several reindeer loaded with this merchandise and made profound reflections on the astonishing difference which is to be found between the laplanders and other men a very diminutive female laplander whose head was a little bigger than her body her eyes red and full of fire a flat nose and very wide mouth wished him a good day with an infinite grace my little lord said this being a foot and ten inches high to him i think you very handsome do me the favor to love me a little so saying she flew to him and caught him round the neck candide pushed her away with horror she cried out when her husband came in with several other laplanders what is the meaning of all this     uproar said they it is answered the little thing that this stranger—alas i am choked with grief he despises me so then said the lapland husband thou impolite dishonest brutal infamous cowardly rascal thou bringest disgrace upon my house thou dost me the most sensible injury thou refusest to embrace my wife lo heres a strange custom cried our hero what would you have said then if i had embraced her i would have wished thee all sort of prosperity said the laplander to him in wrath but thou only deservest my indignation at uttering this he discharged on candides back a volley of blows with a cudgel the reindeer were seized by the relatives of the offended husband and candide for fear of worse was forced to betake himself to flight and renounce forever his good master for how dared he present himself before him without money whaleblubber or reindeer chapter xii candide still continues his travels—new adventures candide travelled a long time without knowing whither he was going at length he resolved to go to denmark where he had heard that everything went pretty well he had a few pieces of money about him which the armenian had made him a     present of and this sum though inconsiderable he hoped would carry him to the end of his journey hope rendered his misery supportable to him and he still passed some happy moments he found himself one day in an inn with three travellers who talked to him with great warmth about a plenum and the materia subtilis this is well said candide to himself these are philosophers gentlemen said he to them a plenum is incontestable there is no vacuum in nature and the materia subtilis is a wellimagined hypothesis you are then a cartesian cried the three travellers yes answered candide and a leibnitzian which is more so much the worse for you replied the philosophers descartes and leibnitz had not common sense we are newtonians and we glory in it if we dispute it is only the better to confirm ourselves in our opinions and we all think the same we search for truth in newtons tract because we are persuaded that newton is a very great man and descartes too and leibnitz and pangloss likewise said candide these great men are worth a thousand of yours you are a fool friend answered the philosophers do you know the laws of refraction attraction and motion have you read the truths which dr clarke has published in answer to the vagaries of your leibnitz do you know what centrifugal and centripetal force is and that colors depend on their density have you any notion of the theory of light and gravitation do you know     the period of twentyfive thousand nine hundred and twenty years which unluckily do not agree with chronology no undoubtedly you have but false ideas of all these things peace then thou contemptible monad and beware how you insult giants by comparing them to pygmies gentlemen answered candide were pangloss here he would tell you very fine things for he is a great philosopher he has a sovereign contempt for your newton and as i am his disciple i likewise make no great account of him the philosophers enraged beyond measure fell upon poor candide and drubbed him most philosophically their wrath subsiding they asked our heros pardon for their too great warmth upon this one of them began a very fine harangue on mildness and moderation while they were talking they saw a grand funeral procession pass by our philosophers thence took occasion to descent on the foolish vanity of man would it not be more reasonable said one of them that the relatives and friends of the deceased should without pomp and noise carry the bier themselves would not this funeral act by presenting to them the idea of death produce an effect the most salutary the most philosophical this reflection which would offer itself namely the body i carry is that of my friend my relative he is no more and like him i must cease to be in this world would not this i say be a means of lessening the     number of crimes in this vile world and of bringing back to virtue beings who believe in the immortality of the soul men are too much inclined to remove from them the thoughts of death for fear of presenting too strong images of it whence is it that people keep at a distance from such a spectacle as a mother and a wife in tears the plaintive accents of nature the piercing cries of despair would do much greater honor to the ashes of the dead than all these individuals clad in black from head to foot together with useless female mourners and that crowd of ministers who sing funeral orations which the deceased cannot hear this is extremely well spoken said candide and did you always speak thus well without thinking proper to beat people you would be a great philosopher our travellers parted with expressions of mutual confidence and friendship candide still continued travelling towards denmark he plunged into the woods where musing deeply on all the misfortunes which had happened to him in the best of worlds he turned aside from the road and lost himself the day began to draw towards the evening when he perceived his mistake he was seized with dismay and raising his eyes to heaven and leaning against the trunk of a tree our hero spoke in the following terms i have gone over half the world seen fraud and calumny triumphant have only sought to do service to mankind and i have been persecuted     a great king honors me with his favor and fifty blows i arrive with a wooden leg in a very fine province there i taste pleasures after having drunk deep of mortifications an abbé comes i protect him he insinuates himself at court through my means and i am obliged to kiss his feet i meet with my poor pangloss only to see him burned i find myself in company with philosophers the mildest and most sociable of all the species of animals that are spread over the face of the earth and they give me an unmerciful drubbing all must necessarily be for the best since pangloss has said it but nevertheless i am the most wretched of all possible beings here candide stopped short to listen to the cries of distress which seemed to come from a place near him he stepped forward out of curiosity when he beheld a young woman who was tearing her hair as if in the greatest despair whoever you are said she to him if you have a heart follow me he went with her but they had not gone many paces before candide perceived a man and a woman stretched out on the grass their faces declared the nobleness of their souls and origin their features though distorted by pain had something so interesting that candide could not forbear informing himself with a lively eagerness about the cause which reduced them to so miserable a situation it is my father and mother whom you see explained the young woman yes these are the authors of my wretched being continued she   0 throwing herself into their arms they fled to avoid the rigor of an unjust sentence i accompanied them in their flight happy to share in their misfortune thinking that in the deserts where we were going to hide ourselves my feeble hands might procure them a necessary subsistence we have stopped here to take some rest i discovered that tree which you see whose fruit has deceived me—alas sir i am a wretch to be detested by the world and myself arm your hand to avenge offended virtue and to punish the parricide strike this fruit i presented to my father and mother they ate of it with pleasure i rejoiced to have found the means of quenching the thirst with which they were tormented—unhappy wretch it was death i presented to them this fruit is poison this tale made candide shudder his hair stood on end and a cold sweat ran over all his body he was eager as much as his present condition could permit to give some relief to this unfortunate family but the poison had already made too much progress and the most efficacious remedies would not have been able to stop its fatal effect dear child our only hope cried the two unhappy parents god pardon thee as we pardon thee it was the excess of thy tenderness which has robbed us of our lives generous stranger vouchsafe to take care of her her heart is noble and formed to virtue she is a trust which we leave in your hands that is infinitely more precious to us than our past     fortune dear zenoida receive our last embraces mingle thy tears with ours heavens how happy are these moments to us thou hast opened to us the dreary cave in which we languished for forty years past tender zenoida we bless thee mayest thou never forget the lessons which our prudence hath dictated to thee and may they preserve thee from the abyss which we see ready to swallow thee they expired as they pronounced these words candide had great difficulty to bring zenoida to herself the moon enlightened the affecting scene the day appeared and zenoida plunged in sorrow had not as yet recovered the use of her senses as soon as she opened her eyes she entreated candide to dig a hole in the ground in order to inter the bodies she assisted in the work with an astonishing courage this duty fulfilled she gave free scope to her tears our philosopher drew her from this fatal place they travelled a long time without observing any certain route at length they perceived a little cottage two persons in the decline of life dwelt in this desert who were always ready to give every assistance in their power to their fellowcreatures in distress these old people were such as philemon and baucis are described to us for fifty years they had tasted the soft endearments of marriage without ever experiencing its bitterness an unimpaired health the fruit of temperance and tranquillity of mind mild and simple manners a fund of inexhaustible candor in their character all the virtues     which man owes to himself formed the glorious and only fortune which heaven had granted them they were held in veneration in the neighboring villages the inhabitants of which full of a happy rusticity might have passed for honest people had they been catholics they looked upon it as a duty not to suffer agaton and sunama for so the old couple were called to want for anything their charity extended to the newcomers alas said candide it is a great loss my dear pangloss that you were burned you were master of sound reason but yet in all the parts of europe and asia which i have travelled over in your company everything is not for the best it is only in el dorado whither no one can go and in a little cottage situated in the coldest most barren and frightful region in the world what pleasure should i have to hear you harangue about the preestablished harmony and monads i should be very willing to pass my days among these honest lutherans but i must renounce going to mass and resolve to be torn to pieces in the journal chrétien candide was very inquisitive to learn the adventures of zenoida but compassion withheld him from speaking to her about it she perceived the respectful constraint he put upon himself and satisfied his impatience in the following terms     chapter xiii the history of zenoida—how candide fell in love with her i am come of one of the most ancient families in denmark one of my ancestors perished at that horrid feast which the wicked christiern prepared for the destruction of so many senators the riches and dignities with which our family has been distinguished have hitherto served only to make them more eminently unfortunate my father had the presumption to displease a great man in power by boldly telling him the truth he was presently accused by suborned witnesses of a number of crimes which had no foundation his judges were deceived alas where is that judge who can always discover those snares which envy and treachery lay for unguarded innocence my father was sentenced to be beheaded he had no way left to avoid his fate but by flight accordingly he withdrew to the house of an old friend whom he thought deserving of that truly noble appellation we remained some time concealed in a castle belonging to him on the seaside and we might have continued there to this day had not the base wretch with whom we had taken refuge attempted to repay himself for the services rendered us in a manner that gave us all reason to detest him this infamous monster had conceived a most unnatural passion for my mother and myself at the same time he attempted our virtue by methods the     most unworthy of a man of honor and we were obliged to expose ourselves to the most dreadful dangers to avoid the effects of his brutal passion in a word we took to flight a second time and you know the rest in finishing this short narrative zenoida burst into tears afresh candide wiped them from her eyes and said to her by way of consolation madam everything is for the best if your father had not died by poison he would infallibly have been discovered and then his head would have been cut off the good lady your mother would in all probability have died of grief and we should not have been in this poor hut where everything is as comfortable as in the finest of possible castles alas sir replied zenoida my father never told me that everything was for the best but he has often said we are all children of the same divine father who loves us but who has not exempted us from sorrows the most grievous maladies and an innumerable tribe of miseries that afflict the human race poison grows by the side of the efficacious quinquina in america the happiest of all mortals has some time or other shed tears what we call life is a compound of pleasure and pain it is the passing away of a certain stated portion of time that always appears too long in the sight of the wise man and which every one ought to employ in doing good to the community in which he is placed in the enjoyment of the works of providence without idly seeking     after hidden causes in squaring his conduct by the rules of conscience and above all in showing a due respect to religion happy is he who can follow this unerringly these things my everrespected father has frequently inculcated in me ill betide those wretched scribblers he would often say who attempt to pry into the hidden ways of providence from the principle that god will be honored from thousands of atoms mankind has blended the most absurd chimeras with respectable truths the turkish dervish the persian brahmin the chinese bonze and the indian talapoin all worship the deity in a different manner but they enjoy a tranquillity of soul amidst the darkness in which they are plunged and he who would endeavor to enlighten them does them but ill service it is not loving mankind to tear the bandage of prejudice from their eyes  why you talk like a philosopher said candide may i ask you my pretty young lady of what religion you are i was brought up in the lutheran profession answered zenoida every word you have spoken said candide has been like a ray of light that has penetrated to my heart and i find a sort of esteem and admiration for you that—but how in the name of wonder came so bright an understanding to be lodged in so beautiful a form upon my word miss i esteem and admire you as i said before so much that— candide stammered out a few words more when zenoida     perceiving his confusion quitted him and from that moment carefully avoided all occasions of being alone with him and candide on his part sought every opportunity of being alone with her or else remained alone he was buried in a melancholy that to him had charms he was deeply enamored of zenoida but endeavored to conceal his passion from himself his looks however too plainly evinced the feelings of his heart alas would he often say to himself if master pangloss was here he would give me good advice for he was a great philosopher chapter xiv continuation of the loves of candide the only consolation that candide felt was in conversing with zenoida in the presence of their hosts how happens it said he to her one day that the monarch to whom you have access has suffered such injustice to be done to your family assuredly you have sufficient reason to hate him how said zenoida who can hate their king who can do otherwise than love that person to whose hand is consigned the keenedged sword of the laws kings are the living images of the deity and we ought never to arraign their conduct obedience and respect is the duty of a subject i admire you more and more said candide indeed     madam i do pray do you know the great leibnitz and the great pangloss who was burned after having escaped a hanging are you acquainted with the monads the materia subtilis and the vortices no sir replied zenoida i never heard my father mention any of these he only gave me a slight tincture of experimental philosophy and taught me to hold in contempt all those kinds of philosophy that do not directly tend to make mankind happy that give him false notions of his duty to himself and his neighbor that do not teach him to regulate his conduct and fill his mind only with uncouth terms or illfounded conjectures that do not give him a clearer idea of the author of nature than what he may acquire from his works and the wonders that are every day passing before our sight once again miss you enchant me you ravish me you are an angel that heaven has sent to remove from before my eyes the mist of master pangloss sophistical arguments poor wretch that i was after having been so heartily kicked flogged and bastinadoed after having been in an earthquake having seen doctor pangloss once hanged and very lately burned after having been outraged by a villainous persian who put me to the most excruciating torture after having been robbed by a decree of the divan and soundly drubbed by the philosophers after all these things i say to think that everything was for the best but now thank heaven i am disabused but truly speaking nature never appeared     half so charming to me as since i have been blessed with the sight of you the melody of the rural choristers charms my ears with a harmony to which they were till now utter strangers i breathe a new soul and the glow of sentiment that enchants me seems imprinted on every object i do not feel that effeminate languor which i did in the gardens of sus the sensation with which you inspire me is wholly different let us stop here said zenoida you seem to be running to lengths that may perhaps offend my delicacy which you ought to respect i will be silent then said candide but my passion will only burn with the more force on saying these words he looked steadfastly at zenoida he perceived that she blushed and as a man who was taught by experience conceived the most flattering hopes from those appearances the beautiful dane continued a long time to shun the presence of candide one day as he was walking hastily to and fro in the garden he cried out in an amorous ecstasy ah why have i not now my el dorado sheep why have i not the power to purchase a small kingdom ah were i but a king what should i be to you said a voice which pierced the heart of our philosopher is it you lovely zenoida cried he falling on his knees i thought myself alone the few words i heard you just now utter seem to promise me the felicity to which my soul aspires i shall in all probability never be a king nor ever possessed of a fortune     but if you love me—do not turn from me those lovely eyes but suffer me to read in them a declaration which is alone capable of confirming my happiness beauteous zenoida i adore you let your heart be open to compassion—what do i see you weep ah my happiness is too great yes you are happy said zenoida nothing can oblige me to disguise my tenderness for a person i think deserving of it hitherto you have been attached to my destiny only by the bands of humanity it is now time to strengthen those by ties most sacred i have consulted my heart reflect maturely in your turn but remember that if you marry me you become obliged to be my protector to share with me those misfortunes that fate may yet have in store for me and to soothe my sorrows marry you said candide those words have shown me all the folly of my conduct alas dear idol of my soul i am not deserving of the goodness you show towards me cunegund is still living— cunegund who is that she is my wife answered candide with his usual frankness our two lovers remained some moments without uttering a word they attempted to speak but the accents died away on their lips their eyes were bathed in tears candide held the fair zenoidas hands in his he pressed them to his breast and devoured them with kisses he had even the boldness to carry his to the bosom of his mistress he found her breath grew short his soul flew to his lips and   0 fixing his mouth with ardor to that of zenoida he brought the fair one back to those senses which she had nearly lost candide thought he read his pardon in her eyes dearest lover said she to him anger would but ill suit with the liberty which i myself have given yet hold you will ruin me in the opinion of the world and you yourself would soon cease to have an affection for me when once i was become the object of contempt forbear therefore and spare my weakness how cried candide because the illjudging vulgar say that a woman loses her honor by bestowing happiness on a being whom she loves by following the tender bent of nature that in the first happy ages of the world— but i will forbear to relate the whole of the interesting conversation and content myself with saying that the eloquence of candide heightened by the warmth of amorous expression had all the effect that may be imagined on a young sensible female philosopher the lovers who till then had passed their days in tedious melancholy now counted every hour by a fresh succession of amorous joys pleasure flowed through their veins in an uninterrupted current the gloomy woods the barren mountains surrounded by horrid precipices the icy plains and dreary fields covered with snow on all sides were so many continual mementoes to them of the necessity of loving they determined never to quit that     dreadful solitude but fate was not yet weary of persecuting them as we shall see in the ensuing chapter chapter xv the arrival of wolhall—a journey to copenhagen candide and zenoida amused themselves with discoursing on the works of the deity the worship which mankind ought to pay him the mutual duties they owe to each other especially that of charity the most useful of all virtues they did not confine themselves to frivolous declamations candide taught the young men the respect due to the sacred restraints of the laws zenoida instructed the young women in the duties they owed their parents both joined their endeavors to sow the hopeful seeds of religion in their young hearts one day as they were busied in those pious offices sunama came to tell zenoida that an old gentleman with several servants was just alighted at their house and that by the description he had given her of a person of whom he was in search she was certain it could be no other than zenoida herself this stranger had followed sunama close at her heels and entered before she had done speaking into the room where were candide and zenoida at sight of him zenoida instantly fainted away     but wolhall not in the least affected with the condition he saw her in took hold of her hand and pulling her to him with violence brought her to her senses which she had no sooner recovered than she burst into a flood of tears so niece said he with a sarcastic smile i find you in very good company i do not wonder you prefer this habitation to the capital to my house and the company of your family yes sir replied zenoida i do prefer this place where dwell simplicity and truth to the mansions of treason and imposture i can never behold but with horror that place where first began my misfortunes where i have had so many proofs of your black actions and where i have no other relative but yourself come madam said wolhall follow me if you please for you must accompany me even if you should faint again saying this he dragged her to the door of the house and made her get into a postchaise which was waiting for him she had only time to tell candide to follow and to bestow her blessing on her hosts with promises of rewarding them amply for their generous cares a domestic of wolhall was moved with pity at the grief in which he saw candide plunged he imagined that he felt no other concern for the fair dane than what unfortunate virtue inspires he proposed to him taking a journey to copenhagen and he facilitated the means for his doing it he did more he insinuated to him that he might be admitted as one of wolhalls domestics if he had no     other resources than going to service candide liked his proposal and had no sooner arrived than his future fellowservant presented him as one of his relatives for whom he would be answerable rascal said wolhall to him i consent to grant you the honor of approaching a person of such rank as i am never forget the profound respect which you owe to my commands execute them if you have sufficient sagacity for it think that a man like me degrades himself in speaking to a wretch such as you our philosopher answered with great humility to this impertinent discourse and from that day he was clad in his masters livery it is easy to imagine the joy and surprise that zenoida felt when she recognized her lover among her uncles servants she threw several opportunities in the way of candide who knew how to profit by them they swore eternal constancy zenoida had some unhappy moments she sometimes reproached herself on account of her love for candide she vexed him sometimes by a few caprices but candide idolized her he knew that perfection is not the portion of man and still less so of woman zenoida resumed her good humor the kind of constraint under which they lay rendered their pleasures the more lively they were still happy     chapter xvi how candide found his wife again and lost his mistress our hero had only to bear with the haughty humors of his master and that was purchasing his mistress favors at no dear rate happy love is not so easily concealed as many imagine our lovers betrayed themselves their connection was no longer a mystery but to the shortsighted eyes of wolhall all the domestics knew it candide received congratulations on that head which made him tremble he expected the storm ready to burst upon his head and did not doubt but a person who had been dear to him was upon the point of accelerating his misfortune he had for some days perceived a face resembling miss cunegund he again saw the same face in wolhalls courtyard the object which struck him was poorly clothed and there was no likelihood that a favorite of a great mahometan should be found in the courtyard of a house at copenhagen this disagreeable object however looked at candide very attentively when coming up to him and seizing him by the hair she gave him the smartest blow on the face with her open hand that he had received for some time i am not deceived cried our philosopher o heavens who would have thought it what do you do here after having suffered yourself to be violated by a follower of mahomet go perfidious spouse i know you     not thou shalt know me replied cunegund by my outrageous fury i know the life thou leadest thy love for thy masters niece and thy contempt for me alas it is now three months since i quitted the seraglio because i was there good for nothing further a merchant has bought me to mend his linen he takes me along with him when he makes a voyage to this country martin cacambo and pacquette whom he has also bought are with me doctor pangloss through the greatest chance in the world was in the same vessel as a passenger we were shipwrecked some miles from here i escaped the danger with the faithful cacambo who i swear to thee has a skin as firm as thy own i behold thee again and find thee false tremble then and fear everything from a provoked wife candide was quite stupefied at this affecting scene he had suffered cunegund to depart without thinking of the proper measures which are always to be taken with those who know our secrets when cacambo presented himself to his sight they embraced each other with tenderness candide informed him of the conversation he had just had he was very much affected by the loss of the great pangloss who after having been hanged and burned was at last unhappily drowned they spoke with that free effusion of heart which friendship inspires a little billet thrown in at the window by zenoida put an end to the conversation candide opened it and found in it these words     fly my dear lover all is discovered an innocent propensity which nature authorizes and which hurts no one is a crime in the eyes of credulous and cruel men wolhall has just left my chamber and has treated me with the utmost inhumanity he is gone to obtain an order for thee to be clapped into a dungeon there to perish fly my ever dear lover preserve a life which thou canst not pass any longer near me those happy moments are no more in which we gave proofs of our reciprocal tenderness ah my beloved how hast thou offended heaven to merit so harsh a fate but i wander from the purpose remember always thy precious dear zenoida and thou my dear lover shalt live eternally within my heart—thou hast never thoroughly understood how much i loved thee—canst thou receive upon my inflamed lips my last adieu i find myself ready to join my unhappy father in the grave the light is hateful to me it serves only to reveal crimes cacambo always wise and prudent drew candide who no longer was himself along with him they made the best of their way out of the city candide opened not his mouth and they were already a good way from copenhagen before he was roused from that lethargy in which he was buried at last he looked at his faithful cacambo and spoke in these terms     chapter xvii how candide had a mind to kill himself and did not do it—what happened to him at an inn dear cacambo formerly my valet now my equal and always my friend thou hast borne a share in my misfortunes thou hast given me salutary advice and thou hast been witness to my love for miss cunegund— alas my old master said cacambo it is she who has served you this scurvy trick it is she who after having learned from your fellowservants that your love for zenoida was as great as hers for you revealed the whole to the barbarous wolhall if this is so said candide i have nothing further to do but die our philosopher pulled out of his pocket a little knife and began whetting it with a coolness worthy of an ancient roman or an englishman what do you mean to do cried cacambo to cut my throat answered candide a most noble thought replied cacambo but the philosopher ought not to take any resolution but upon reflection you will always have it in your power to kill yourself if your mind does not alter be advised by me my dear master defer your resolution till tomorrow the longer you delay it the more courageous will the action be i perceive the strength of thy reasoning said candide besides if i should cut my throat     immediately the gazetteer of trévoux would insult my memory i am determined therefore that i will not kill myself till two or three days hence as they talked thus they arrived at elsinore a pretty considerable town not far from copenhagen there they lay that night and cacambo hugged himself for the good effect which sleep had produced upon candide they left the town at daybreak candide still the philosopher for the prejudices of childhood are never effaced entertained his friend cacambo on the subject of physical good and evil the discourses of the sage zenoida and the striking truths which he had learned from her conversation had not pangloss been dead said he i should combat his system in a victorious manner god keep me from becoming a manichæan my mistress taught me to respect the impenetrable veil with which the deity envelopes his manner of operating upon us it is perhaps man who precipitates himself into the abyss of misfortunes under which he groans from a frugivorous animal he has made himself a carnivorous one the savages whom we have seen eat only jesuits and do not live upon bad terms among themselves these savages if there be one scattered here and there in the woods only subsisting on acorns and herbs are without doubt still more happy society has given birth to the greatest crimes there are men in society who are necessitated by their condition to wish the death of others the shipwreck of a vessel the burning of a     house and the loss of a battle cause sadness in one part of society and give joy to another all is very bad my dear cacambo and there is nothing left for a philosopher but to cut his own throat with all imaginable calmness you are in the right answered cacambo but i perceive an inn you must be very dry come my old master let us drink one draught and we will after that continue our philosophical disquisitions when they entered the inn they saw a company of country lads and lassies dancing in the midst of the yard to the sound of some wretched instruments gayety and mirth sat in every countenance it was a scene worthy the pencil of watteau as soon as candide appeared a young woman took him by the hand and entreated him to dance my pretty maid answered candide when a person has lost his mistress found his wife again and heard that the great pangloss is dead he can have little or no inclination to cut capers moreover i am to kill myself tomorrow morning and you know that a man who has but a few hours to live ought not to lose them in dancing cacambo hearing candide talk thus addressed him in these terms a thirst for glory has always been the characteristic of great philosophers cato of utica killed himself after having taken a sound nap socrates drank the hemlock potion after discoursing familiarly with his friends many of the english have blown their brains out with a pistol after coming from an entertainment   0 but i never yet heard of a great man who cut his own throat after a dancing bout it is for you my dear master that this honor is reserved take my advice let us dance our fill and we will kill ourselves tomorrow have you not remarked answered candide this young country girl is she not a very pretty brunette she has something very taking in her countenance said cacambo she has squeezed my hand replied the philosopher did you notice said cacambo how that in the hurry of the dance her handkerchief falling aside disclosed two admirable little rosebuds i took particular notice of them look you said candide had i not my heart filled with miss zenoida— the little brunette interrupted him by begging him to take one dance with her our hero at length consented and danced with the best grace in the world the dance finished he kissed his smart country girl and retired to his seat without calling out the queen of the ring upon this a murmuring arose everyone performers as well as spectators appeared greatly incensed at so flagrant a piece of disrespect candide never dreamed he had been guilty of any fault and consequently did not attempt to make any reparation a rude clown came up to him and gave him a blow with his fist upon the nose cacambo returned it to the peasant with a kick in the belly in an instant the musical instruments were all broken the girls lost their caps candide and cacambo fought like heroes but at     length were obliged to take to their heels after a very hearty drubbing everything is embittered to me said candide giving his arm to his friend cacambo i have experienced a great many misfortunes but i did not expect to be thus beaten to a mummy for dancing with a country girl at her own request chapter xviii candide and cacambo go into a hospital—whom they meet there cacambo and his old master were quite dispirited they began to fall into that sort of malady of the mind which extinguishes all the faculties they fell into a depression of spirits and despair when they perceived a hospital which was built for strangers cacambo proposed going into it candide followed him there they met with the most obliging reception and charitable treatment in a little time they were cured of their wounds but they caught the itch the cure of this malady did not appear to be the work of a day the idea of which filled the eyes of our philosopher with tears and he said scratching himself thou wouldst not let me cut my throat my dear cacambo thy unwise counsels have brought me again into disgrace and misfortune and yet should i cut my throat now it will be published in the journal of trévoux and it     will be said this man was a poltroon who killed himself only for having the itch see what thou hast exposed me to by the mistaken compassion thou hadst for my fate our disasters are not without remedy answered cacambo if you will but please to listen to me let us settle here as friars i understand a little surgery and i promise you to alleviate and render supportable our wretched condition ah cried candide may all asses perish and especially asses of surgeons who are so dangerous to mankind i will never suffer that thou shouldst give out thyself to be what thou art not this is a treachery the consequences of which i dread besides if thou didst but conceive how hard it is after having been viceroy of a fine province after having seen myself rich enough to purchase kingdoms and after having been the favorite lover of zenoida to resolve to serve in quality of friar in a hospital i concede all that you say replied cacambo but i also realize that it is very hard to die of hunger think moreover that the expedient which i propose to you is perhaps the only one which you can take to elude the inquiries of the bloodyminded wolhall and avoid the punishment which he is preparing for you one of the friars was passing along as they talked in this manner they put some questions to him to which he gave satisfactory answers he assured them that the brothers wanted for nothing and enjoyed a reasonable liberty candide thereupon     determined to acquiesce in cacambos counsels they took the habit together which was granted them upon the first application and our two poor adventurers now became underlings to those whose duty it was to perform the most servile offices one day as candide was serving the patients with some wretched broth an old man fixed his eye earnestly upon him the visage of this poor wretch was livid his lips were covered with froth his eyes half turned in his head and the image of death strongly imprinted on his lean and sunken cheeks poor man said candide to him i pity you your sufferings must be horrible they are very great indeed answered the old man with a hollow voice like a ghost i am told that i am hectic phthisicky asthmatic and poxed to the bone if that be the case i am indeed very ill yet all does not go so badly and this gives me comfort ah exclaimed candide none but dr pangloss in a case so deplorable can maintain the doctrine of optimism when all others besides would preach up pessim— do not pronounce that abominable word cried the poor man i am the pangloss you speak of wretch that i am let me die in peace all is well all is for the best the effort which he made in pronouncing these words cost him the last tooth which he spit out with a great quantity of corrupted matter and expired a few moments after candide lamented him greatly for he had a good heart his obstinate perseverance was a source of     reflection to our philosopher he often called to mind all his adventures cunegund remained at copenhagen candide learned that she exercised there the occupation of a mender of old clothes with all possible distinction the humor of travelling had quite left him the faithful cacambo supported him with his counsels and friendship candide did not murmur against providence i know said he at times that happiness is not the portion of man happiness dwells only in the good country of el dorado where it is impossible for anyone to go chapter xix new discoveries candide was not so unhappy as he had a true friend he found in a mongrel valet what the world vainly looks for in our quarter of the globe perhaps nature which gives origin to herbs in america that are proper for the maladies of bodies on our continent has also placed remedies there for the maladies of our hearts and minds possibly there are men in the new world of a quite different conformation from us who are not slaves to personal interests and are worthy to burn with the noble fire of friendship how desirable would it be that instead of bales of indigo and cochineal all covered with blood some of these men were imported among us this     sort of traffic would be of vast advantage to mankind cacambo was of greater value to candide than a dozen of red sheep loaded with the pebbles of el dorado our philosopher began again to taste the pleasure of life it was a comfort to him to watch for the conservation of the human species and not to be a useless member of society god blessed such pure intentions by giving him as well as cacambo the enjoyment of health they had got rid of the itch and fulfilled with cheerfulness the painful functions of their station but fortune soon deprived them of the security which they enjoyed cunegund who had set her heart upon tormenting her husband left copenhagen to follow his footsteps chance brought her to the hospital she was accompanied by a man whom candide knew to be baron thundertentronckh one may easily imagine what must have been his surprise the baron who saw him addressed him thus i did not tug long at the oar in the turkish galleys the jesuits heard of my misfortune and redeemed me for the honor of their society i have made a journey into germany where i received some favors from my fathers heirs i omitted nothing to find my sister and having learned at constantinople that she had sailed from there in a vessel which was shipwrecked on the coasts of denmark i disguised myself took letters of recommendation to danish merchants who have correspondence with the society and in fine i found my sister who still loves you base and unworthy     as you are of her regard and since you have had the impudence to lie with her i consent to the ratification of the marriage or rather a new celebration of it with this express proviso that my sister shall give you only her left hand which is very reasonable since she has seventyone quarters and you have never a one alas said candide all the quarters of the world without beauty—miss cunegund was very ugly when i had the imprudence to marry her she afterwards became handsome again and another has enjoyed her charms she is once more grown ugly and you would have me give her my hand a second time no upon my word my reverend father send her back to her seraglio at constantinople she has done me too much injury in this country ungrateful man screamed cunegund with the most frightful contortions be persuaded and relent in time do not provoke the baron who is a priest to kill us both to wipe out his disgrace with our blood dost thou believe me capable of having failed in intention to the fidelity which i owed thee what wouldst thou have had me do against a man who found me handsome neither my tears nor my cries could have softened his brutal insensibility seeing there was nothing to be done i disposed myself in such a manner as to be violated with the least brutality possible and every other woman would have done the same this is all the crime i have committed and does not merit thy displeasure but i know my greatest     crime with thee is having deprived thee of thy mistress and yet this action ought to convince thee of my love come my dear spouse if ever i should again become handsome if ever my breasts now lank and withered should recover their roundness and elasticity if—it will be only for thee my dear candide we are no longer in turkey and i swear faithfully to thee never to suffer any violation for the future this discourse did not make much impression upon candide he desired a few hours to make his resolution how to proceed the baron granted him two hours during which time he consulted his friend cacambo after having weighed the reasons pro and contra they determined to follow the jesuit and his sister into germany they accordingly left the hospital and set out together on their travels not on foot but on good horses hired by the baron they arrived on the frontiers of the kingdom a huge man of a very villainous aspect surveyed our hero with close attention it is the very man said he casting his eyes at the same time upon a little bit of paper he had in his hand sir if i am not too inquisitive is not your name candide yes sir so i have always been called sir i flatter myself you are the very same you have black eyebrows eyes level with your head ears not prominent of a middling size and a round fleshcolored visage to me you plainly appear to be five feet five inches high yes sir that is my stature but     what have you to do with my ears and stature sir we cannot use too much circumspection in our office permit me further to put one single question more to you have you not formerly been a servant to lord wolhall sir upon my word answered candide quite disconcerted i know nothing of what you mean maybe so sir but i know for certain that you are the person whose description has been sent me take the trouble then to walk into the guardhouse if you please here soldiers take care of this gentleman get the black hole ready and let the armorer be sent for to make him a pretty little set of fetters of about thirty or forty pounds weight mr candide you have a good horse there i am in want of such a one and i fancy he will answer my purpose i shall make free with him the baron was afraid to say the horse was his they carried off poor candide and miss cunegund wept for a whole quarter of an hour the jesuit seemed perfectly unconcerned at this accident i should have been obliged to have killed him or to have made him marry you over again said he to his sister and all things considered what has just happened is much the best for the honor of our family cunegund departed with her brother and only the faithful cacambo remained who would not forsake his friend     chapter xx consequence of candides misfortune—how he found his mistress again—the fortune that happened to him o pangloss said candide what a pity it is you perished so miserably you have been witness only to a part of my misfortunes and i had hoped to prevail on you to forsake the illfounded opinion which you maintained to your last breath no man ever suffered greater calamities than i have done but there is not a single individual who has not cursed his existence as the daughter of pope urban warmly expressed herself what will become of me my dear cacambo faith i cannot tell said cacambo all i know is that i will not forsake you but miss cunegund has forsaken me said candide alas a wife is of far less value than a menial servant who is a true friend candide and cacambo discoursed thus in the black hole from there they were taken out to be carried back to copenhagen it was there that our philosopher was to know his doom he expected it to be dreadful and our readers doubtless expect so too but candide was mistaken as our readers will be likewise it was at copenhagen that happiness waited to crown all his sufferings he was hardly arrived when he understood that wolhall was dead this barbarian had no one to regret him while everybody interested themselves in candide his   0 irons were knocked off and his freedom gave him so much the more joy as it was immediately followed by the sight of his dear zenoida he flew to her with the utmost transport they were a long time without speaking a word but their silence was infinitely more expressive than words they wept they embraced each other they attempted to speak but tears stopped their utterance cacambo was a pleased spectator of this scene so truly interesting to a sensible being he shared in the happiness of his friend and was almost as much affected as candide himself dear cacambo adorable zenoida cried candide you efface from my heart the deep traces of my misfortunes love and friendship prepare for me future days of serenity and uninterrupted delight through what a number of trials have i passed to arrive at this unexpected happiness but they are all forgot dear zenoida i behold you once more you love me everything is for the best in regard to me all is good in nature by wolhalls death zenoida was left at her own disposal the court had given her a pension out of her fathers fortune which had been confiscated she shared it with candide and cacambo she appointed them apartments in her own house and gave out that she had received several considerable services from these two strangers which obliged her to procure them all the comforts and pleasures of life and to repair the injustice which fortune had done them there were some who saw through the motive of her     beneficence which was no very hard matter to do considering the great talk her connection with candide had formerly occasioned the greater part blamed her and her conduct was only approved by some few who knew how to reflect zenoida who set a proper value on the good opinion even of fools was nevertheless too happy to repent the loss of it the news of the death of miss cunegund which was brought by the correspondents of the jesuit merchants in copenhagen procured zenoida the means of conciliating the minds of people she ordered a genealogy to be drawn up for candide the author who was a man of ability in his way derived his pedigree from one of the most ancient families in europe he even pretended his true name was canute which was that of one of the former kings of denmark which appeared very probable as dide into ute is not such a great metamorphosis and candide by means of this little change became a very great lord he married zenoida in public they lived with as much tranquillity as it is possible to do cacambo was their common friend and candide said often all is not so well as in el dorado but all does not go so badly  the exposition of      was then open in paris  the dutch traders to japan are actually obliged to trample upon a crucifix in token of their aversion to the christian religion which the japanese abhor  an autodafé was actually to have been celebrated the very day on which the earthquake destroyed lisbon everybody knows than an autodafé is a general jail delivery from the prisons of the inquisition when the wretches condemned by that tribunal are brought to the stake or otherwise stigmatized in public  there never was a tenth pope of that name so that this number is mentioned to avoid scandal  this is too just a reproach upon those christian powers who for the thirst of lucre shamefully patronize and supply the barbarians of africa with the means of gratifying their rapacity
