world the romans have most excelled in the art of poetry and even among the romans virgil has been the most deservedly celebrated from whom the justest rules of this art are rather to be taken than from the dry precepts of the critics to the end therefore that we may the more truly ascertain the beauties and faults which occur among the rest of the writers of heroic poetry let us compare them with the style of virgil who if he be in any thing deficient it is when he has sometimes in his eclogues mingled such a purity of style as is not entirely agreeable with the dialect of shepherds and frequently the dignity of his verse seems no way consonant to the rural pipe in every book of his georgicks he treats of country affairs with an inimitable elegancy of style but above all we are most delighted with his last book of the nature of bees where in a poem on so inconsiderable a subject our author purposely affects a peculiarly solemn and pompous style in this piece he compares the labors of the bees to those of the cyclops and in the same lofty numbers recounts the skirmishes of these little insects among themselves as he does the rencounters of aeneas and turnus all along the generals of this small republic the populace the factions the customs and forms of government exercised within the narrow limits of the beehive are described with an inexpressible beauty and magnificence throughout the whole work what mostly raises our admiration is that in the persuit of his discourse on planting grazing and agriculture waving the common forms of speech he suits his poetic diction to so unpolite a theme how seemingly depressed with the meanness of his subject he never sinks into a plebeian style but the force and energy of his expression are so conspicuous that many too rashly indeed have not scrupled to prefer the georgicks to the aeneid but in a work of this nature no other parts of poetry could be displayed except an elegance of style and description in both these ways virgil has this peculiar to himself that he captivates the soul with his wonderful sweetness and his descriptions are as lively as if we had the object placed before our eyes  in the purity of his style next follows lucretius whose diction allowing for his obsoleteness and numbers almost prosaick may challenge a share of praise in those who have any taste of the roman eloquence for descriptions however the second post of honor is due to claudian who has throughout in a most beautiful style interwoven his agreeable images faulty in this alone that he expatiates upon his subjects beyond all decency and frequently gives us the same thoughts diversified only in expression claudian well knew what a master he was in this art for on whatsoever topic he is engaged he diligently searches out matter for description nay most of the subjects he has wrote upon are wholly such as may be seen in his prefaces his eclogues his books of the rape of proserpine his phoenix his porcupine his crampfish and most of his epigrams  ovid like a true courtier as he was describes the affairs of love in neat and polite verse in the rest of his works we meet with the more vulgar way of expression for trusting to a good genius he was little soliitous about forming a more elaborate style but yet in his metamorphoses he has painted in the greatest perfection the various changes of all creatures and the transformations proceed in a most easy and gradual manner  statius has frequently discharged both these requisites of a poet we just now observed lucan neither whose diction although very bombast is not enlivened either by beautiful phrases or epithets but comes nearer prose than poetry nay there is in him commonly such a mean choice of words as is sometimes even beneath proof itself and although he abounds in descriptions and is always making excursions of that kind yet he seldom finishes his work as he ought or brings his thoughts to any justness of conclusion  but now as to statius he has given us compositions worthy of the envy of the best poets but with all his beauties he has greater faults for in his expression he makes too much use of gigantick words and not considering his subject mingles useless thunder in his numbers nor is he less faulty in his descriptions for encouraging too great a heat while he attempts to excel he shoots beyond his mark and swells unnaturally of both which extremes claudian is too often guilty  and now since there have been many pieces written and those of note on the subject of virgils aeneis and less notice is taken of the poetry of statius and lucan to whose productions only the latins allow the title of epick poetry as to lucan it has been often disputed whether history of which the pharsalia consists be a proper subject for an heroic poem for the decision of this point we must enquire into the true nature of heroic poetry which our countryman the lord bacon has admirably described in his treatise of the advancement of learning   as for narrative poesy or if you please heroical so you understand it of the matter not of the verse it seems to be raised altogether from a noble foundation which makes much for the dignity of mans nature for seeing this sensible world is in dignity inferior to the soul of man poesy seems to endow human nature with that which history denies and to give satisfaction to the mind with at least the shadow of things where the substance cannot be had for if the matter be thoroughly considered a strong argument may be drawn from poesy that a more stately greatness of things a more perfect order and a more beautiful variety delights the soul of man than any way can be found in nature since the fall wherefore seeing the acts and events which are the subject of true history are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical because true history reports the successes of business not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices poesy corrects it and presents events and fortunes according to desert and according to the law of providence because true history through the frequent satiety and similitude of things works a distaste and misprision in the mind of man poesy cheereth and refreshes the soul chaunting things rare and various and full of vicissitudes so as poesy serves and conferreth to delectation magnanimity and morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some participation of divineness because it accommodates its images and descriptions to the utmost desire and wish of the soul not subjecting the mind to things or facts as reason and history do from whence it is sufficiently manifest that history and epick poetry are by no means proper companions and therefore that lucan has very much failed in his principal subject the five heroes who make the greatest figure in his poem are caesar pompey brutus cato and cicero each of them indeed as distinguishable in their lives as to be lamented in their deaths men whose virtues allowing for the frailties of human nature came nearest to that pitch of heroic perfection which other poets have falsely attributed to their heroes lucan every where snarls at caesar and passionately espouses pompeys interest but most of all celebrates the characters of brutus and cato for that spirit of stoicism which he had equally imbibed with them and indeed most of the faults objected to lucan are rather to be imputed to this kind of philosophy from whence sprung that boundless vein of wit and that peculiar affectation of a lofty style which like that sect of men he always delighted in and therefore gives the preference rather to great than good actions and upon this account in raising the passions that most excellent part of poetry he succeeded but ill because upon the principles of his philosophy the passions themselves were accounted as absolutely unlawful to confirm this passing by many others i will produce but one instance after caesar had obtained the victory over pomfey in the battle of pharsalia lucan certainly if he had enlarged on any circumstance foreign to history it self should upon so remarkable an occasion have lamented the undeserved fate of pompey in the most mournful strain especially since he pays so high a deference to him throughout his whole work or at least as there was an open field for grief he should have introduced pompey either complaining of romes lost liberty the death of his friends or his own misfortunes but lucan is so far from raising the passions to this just height that he warmly advises pompey when vanquished he retires from the field of action to commiserate the condition of his conqueror caesar because he had not won the day but by unjustifiable methods dont you rejoice that your superior foes have snatched you from a scene of future woes that blessed in exile you escape the sight of armies bleeding in domestic fight behold each river drags her tardy flood choked up with carnage and distained with blood your victorsire with pitying eyes survey nor envy him the fortune of the day how shall he enter rome devoid of shame who on the public ruins builds his name   who can bear to hear the poet philosophizing in this ridiculous manner as if pompey a man in years an exile miserable and vanquished should have any concern upon him for the crimes of his conqueror he ought to have been very much stoicized indeed who despoiled of all the goods of fortune could place the sum of his felicity in mere naked virtue but none of the poets have touched this passion of grief like virgil the generality of other writers when they attempt to move their readers offend in this point that they are too prolix in spinning out their complaints and think their flood of tears inexhaustible or else while they labor to express the greatness of their genius in the profuseness of their verse rather raise our admiration at the flowing of their numbers than excite our pity in the catastrophe of their story virgil has carefully avoided both these extremes and dresses his images of sorrow in their native simplicity and wherever he touches upon the pathetick he does it with a masterly quickness for according to cicero our expressions of grief ought to be short and concise because our tears quickly dry up and it is unnatural to detain either an auditor or reader in too long a suspension of grief  but to return to statius his spirit is indeed lofty and aspiring to which while he gives too great a loose he runs into bombast and to his poetry often adds useless sounding words the subject of his thebais seems indeed suited to the barbarity of his genius but is beneath the dignity of an heroic poem for neither eteocles polynices nor tydeus whose actions are recorded in this poem have any thing in them except their fortitude agreeable to heroes nay throughout the whole piece there are no examples produced unless of persons infamous for the most flagitious enormities such as parricide treachery cruelty and revenge while on the contrary every thing praiseworthy shines bright in virgils heroes and in the person of aeneas we have placed before our eyes an instance of consummate piety toward the gods his son his wife his friends and his father the epithets of statius are generally forced and very metaphorical while such properties are ascribed to inanimates as really only belong to animals in the choice of his words and frequently in his metaphors he is followed by claudian with the utmost elegance virgil is sparing in both these particulars statius abounds much with similitudes in which he seems to imitate virgil but in this instance lucan had had better success if he had hit upon the proper medium but while virgil stoops down to the humble subjects of bees ants and other such like delightful themes of nature on the other hand lucan bellows out nothing but stories of oaks split by lightening earthquakes and the worlds conflagration let this in short suffice observable concerning the writers of heroic poetry in itself new and never before taken notice of  something now remains to be said of the satyrists among whom whether juvenal or horace have most right to the bays it is dfficult to determine for it has been long a dispute among the learned whether that keenness and bitterness of expression with which juvenal has armed his satires or horaces more jocose lampoons are most agreeable to the end of satire now that we may give a clearer decision on this head a few things must be premised horace bears to this day an ill character for the looseness of his conduct in life juvenal was a rigid practiser of virtue the one was conversant in the most perfectly polite court of augustus the other lived in the dregs of domitians time and therefore both these poets accommodated their writings to the manners of the different ages they lived in for horace is entirely upon the ludicrous and persues not so much the licentiousness of the times as the ridiculous fopperies of some particular courtiers for had he attempted to correct these trifles with severity he had not missed of being laughed at but juvenal lashes the grossest crimes prevalent in his time and complains of enormities which one would be ashamed to mention and nothing less than the highest resentmemt of soul ardency of expression and sharpness of speech could be an equal match to crimes so notorious though whenever he descends to be jocose we frequently meet with the pleasantry of horace both of them allowing for the different manner of their writing are perfect masters in their several ways in the one the ridicule appears better than the severe in the other the severe better than the ridicule  the rest of horaces pieces are so admirable that they exceed our highest encomiums and are not only beyond our dislike but above our praise  as to what concerns the dramatic poets plautus and terence bear away the bell whose plots turns and elegancy of style are so well known that nothing new can be said upon them  as to seneca mankind have had different opinions of him some have ranked him with the best tragoedians others have sunk him below the worst he certainly had a great genius an elegant and concise way of expression he abounds with smart turns which always savor much of that stoicism of which he was a follower upon which account he has always been esteemed by those who have had little or no taste of dramatic poetry but then if we consider him as such his tragedies are throughout too elaborate and this to pass by his other faults seems peculiarly senecas that he makes all his actors without any regard to the characters they bear talk in the same strain all of them inculcate rigid philosophical dogmata and such morality as is rather fit for the schools of the stoics than the roman theater for with him the king and the slave strut in the same buskin nay you may perceive the nurse herself deeply tinged with the principles of stoicism  among the epigrammatists martial and claudian have bore the greatest reputaion the first for the severe point in the close of his epigrams and the peculiar jingle of his words the other for dispersing the poignancy of his wit throughout his epigrams and that in the most beautiful latin phrase  the rest of the lower class of the latin poets creep so low in their numbers that they are beneath the notice either of gods or men and though we may now and then discover in the affected songs and sonnets of catullus and the obscene poetry of tibullus and propertius some not disagreeable pieces yet it is not worth our while to rake the dunghills for the sake of the jewels  tentamen de poetis romany elegiacis saepe mecum ipse mirari soleo ex tot

indecora tralatione digna sunt eaquidem omnia paucis illustrata commentariis non solum erunt intellectu facilia verum etiam lectoribus mere anglicanis magnam afferent voluptatem  an essay upon the roman elegiac poets i have often wondered that among so many who have busied or diverted themselves in translating the ancient classick poets so few have thought the writers of elegy worthy their pains or amusement i cannot but believe that these have succeeded as happily in their way as the others and that they may be read with no less advantage than pleasure for my own part i can affirm that when at any time my mind has been ruffled by some peevish accident or disappointment i have always found my temper sooner composed by taking a turn with tibullus in my hand than by having recourse to the lessons of philosophy or the precepts of divines whatever is very solemn carries with it i dont know how somewhat of constraint and it frequently happens by an unlucky disposition either in the pupil or the preacher that those severer kinds of discipline i speak not this with the least irreverence serve rather to punish than reform us it is perhaps no difficult matter to convince one of the reasonableness of this or that action but the secret lies in engaging one in the practice it is a memorable sentence of a celebrated moralist this virtus est vitium fugere and sapientia prima stultitia caruisse  horat it is the beginning of virtue to depart from vice and the first step toward wisdom is to forsake our folly may it not as justly be said the first step toward happiness is to forget our misery the best method to bring that about is not i presume by alarming the thinking faculty but by soothing and lulling to rest our too active and unquiet reflections  whilst our poor tottering bark continues in this uncertain voyage of life and is so often kept out at sea in rough and stormy weather far from the sight of any hospitable shore the soul its passenger cannot sure but feel a mighty satisfaction arising within when she finds herself afterwads stealing as it were away under smoother courses and born gently down the tide of tenderness in soft and easy gales of passion  there is a charm in verse that never fails agreeably to affect a heart that is rightly placed and there is in my opinion something peculiarly moving in the verses of that goodnatured class of poets catullus tibullus propertius and ovid there are but few pieces of catullus it is true that can strictly be ranked among those of the elegiac order but whenever he does touch upon the softer subjects of humanity his sentiments have the utmost propriety and delicacy and therefore i could not but mention him among his companions they were all four men of family and condition in their country their inclinations led them naturally to pleasure and their good sense to a discovery of the knavery of business and the vanity of ambition the three former may be said to have been as extraordinary a triumvirate as perhaps any age has produced i mean in an idle way of life polite in their manners easy in their fortunes successful in their amors happy in each others acquaintance beloved in general while they lived and universally lamented when they died as for ovid he was certainly master of all the fine qualities and accomplishments that could be desired in a gentleman but having offended augustus either by happening to be an unexpected witness of that emperors loveintrigues or else by too lasciviously describing his own which was the crime pretended he was banished from italy in his fiftieth year and languished out the remainder of his days at tamos the modern temeswaer as some think there are i believe but two instances in story of a punishment like this for what at the worst could be called only an indiscretion one in the person of ovid the other in that of rabutin their masters were equally absolute equally wise and equally jealous  from this little draught of their characters one may judge how edifying any of their compositions must needs be to an elegant understanding and indeed what sincerity in friendship what fondness in love what kindness to relations what instances of all the social virtues do we not meet with in their writings not to mention a thousand ornaments of wit a wonderful sweetness and easy cadence in their numbers and so true a picture of life that one can scarce fancy the scene to lie at the distance it is placed  there is one objection which i must not pass over and that is generally charged upon these poets imean their too great license and obscenity in their ideas and language  to this i would reply that if upon some occasions they seem not to have been very scrupulous about the terms they made use of in communicating their amorous adventers it ought not to be imputed to a scandalous singularity in them but to the common indulgence of the age in which they flourished horace must plead guilty to the same indictment nay virgil himself as applauded as he is for modesty has left many expressions in his eclogues that might be argued of wantonness after all the whole matter will turn upon this single point a person whose principles are uncorrupted may freely converse with these authors without danger of infection and for such who have more wickedness than wit the greatest curse that can befall a fool their senseless vice will tempt them to pervert even the most sacred things to the vilest purposes however though all their poems may be read in the originals with safety i do not pretend to say they can all be translated with decency but since many of them may it is pity i think we have not more of them in english to enrich our language with a variety of pleasing images that are as innocent as they are delightful  there is one difficulty that will still lie upon the hands of any who shall undertake this work and this arises from their frequent allusions to the ceremonies and notions of their religion instances of this abound even in those copies of their verses that are writ the most in the spirit of lewdness as sueprstition has ever been an especial bawd to lust but for all such as are proper to be translated they may be rendered by a few explanatory notes not only intelligible but very entertaining to a mere english reader  finis
