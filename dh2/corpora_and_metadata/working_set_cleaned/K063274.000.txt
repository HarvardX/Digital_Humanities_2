schemes and plans of a voyage to sweden and a lapland journey would come to nothing and like shakespeares cloudcapt towers and gorgeous palaces leave not a wreck behind when you see this letter however all your doubts will vanish as we are now embarked upon the wide ocean and favonian breezes are wasting us to the shores of sweden you and perhaps our other friends are smiling at our romantic expedition you are laying your heads together and consulting how three mortals like sir h g l mr b and myself can expect to subsist upon lapland mountains or how we ever formed the resolution of undertaking so enterprizing a journey but my dear friend give yourself no trouble about us we have begun our expedition with good spirits and undiminished courage and hope to finish it with equal eclat perhaps you will not believe me when i say that we are enjoying ourselves in our cabin with our usual english cheer disdaining the blustering of boreas or the tumult of the waves with one wide ocean all around us all above us one black sky   there is a variety in a short voyage very agreeable to a person accustomed to live on land provided he can ensure himself from seasickness the unbounded blue horizon the sunbeam playing upon the waters the floating of the sails and gay tackling of the ship give a brilliancy to the scene that cannot fail to please this is the delightful prospect which the landman is so apt to paint but when the melancholy sailor takes up the pencil how different is the picture which he draws he delineates stormy skies and rolling waves he paints the overhanging rock and foundered ship and all the hardships of a seamans life but i think i had better draw a curtain before this painting lest like the child that dresses up a giant in our present situation i should happen to be afraid of the creature of my own fancy  when we arrive at gottenburg which we hourly expect i will give you the journal of our voyage and as occasion offers will continue my narrative during the remainder of our expedition though in all probability you will not meet with much novelty for i pretend not to vie with such celebrated travelers as coxe or wraxal yet such reflections you will meet with as will at least satisfy your curiosity how we executed our agreeable scheme  we took our departure from ravensworthcastle the seat of sir h g l on the   th day of may      and embarked about six the same evening at shields on board the gottenburg merchant capt george fothergill we got underway about twelve oclock at night with a brisk gale at w n w  letter ii gottenburg may         safely landed on the coast of sweden i have now time to resume my writing and fulfill my promise i engaged myself to give you a faithful narrative of our proceedings it will be necessary therefore to relate every circumstance with the same regularity that it happened from the time that we lost sight of tynmouth castle and the english shore the two first days passed along with unvaried tranquillity our ship sailing gently with a fair wind from four and an half to sometimes seven and eight knots in an hour on saturday the   th about six in the morning we made in the sailors language the naze a point of land on the norway coast at the entrance of the scaggerac or as it is sometimes called cattegat sea the country here appears to be very high and mountainous soon after we came in sight of the jutland part of the danish territories on the opposite side and past the scaw a light house on this coast with a fresh breeze almost increasing to a gale of wind we were obliged to reef our topsails the sea running so very high the weather hazy and exceeding cold as our voyage however was almost over we had no great reason to complain about eleven in the morning we made wings beacon which is situated on an high barren rock not far from the mouth of the river gotha in this exposed situation live the pilots braving the storms and tempests for the sake of their profession as this commands a fine seaview and ships may be seen from hence at a great distance when we came near this place we hoisted a jack upon the maintopmasthead as a signal to the pilots they soon obeyed the summons and the same afternoon we were safely moored in the harbor of gottenburg  soon after we landed we dined at the english hotel after dinner the english consuls coach attended us at the inn and conducted us to the house of mr smith a merchant resident here whose attention and civility demand our warmest thanks we spent the evening with him and were entertained with much ease and hospitality  the town of gottenburg is neat clean and well built the streets are regular and uniform the houses chiefly of wood painted so as to resemble brick and stone part of the town stands upon a swampy plain which like the dutch towns is intersected by canals the other part upon the declivity of an hill the harbor is commodious and convenient there are establishments here of several branches of commerce particularly an east india company and an herring fishery from these two causes alone this place has increased considerably in the space of a very few years the entrance of the harbor is guarded by the fort of new elfsburg which is situated on a small rocky island and garrisoned the markets here are extremely well supplied with necessaries and for very moderate prices the chief magistrate here is the burgomaster who regulates the markets and possesses the civil direction of the town in the same manner as the mayor of corporate towns in england  you will naturally expect that i should not be many hours in sweden before i should be able to give some account of the fairer part of the creation who in every quarter of the globe are entitled to attention but i will not be too rash in delivering my opinion i am as yet but a young swede and therefore cannot be supposed to have had many opportunities of observation the ladies that have hitherto fallen in my way have generally covered their beauties with a veil at least i am willing to suppose there is beauty where i cannot prove the contrary though i own from their shapes and sizes that spectator is very complaisant who gives them credit for personal qualifications which certainly do not present themselves before his eyes  letter iii gottenburg june        as we intend leaving gottenburg tomorrow i shall resume my narrative and give you some account of our proceedings since i wrote last on the   th we accepted an invitation to dinner from mr hall a merchant of eminence in this place at whose house we were elegantly entertained after the swedish fashion the dinner as well as supper which followed consisted chiefly of sweetmeats fruits etc which were plentifully interspersed with ornamental images but do not imagine this was the whole of our entertainment other more substantial dishes were placed on the corners of the table amongst which were a chader a swedish bird a cock of the wood another great rarity and a pike pudding the latter dish will require some explanation it consists of a pike dressed so as to resemble the taste of a custard and yet not losing the flavor of a fish i thought it rather palatable than otherwise the method of conducting themselves at table has a very singular appearance to a stranger every dish after being cut up is handed about in rotation from one to another every one helps himself and passes it to the next wine and all other liquors stand upon the table the rule is to help yourselves without any kind of ceremony they drink no healths the ladies were particularly assiduous in perpetually filling our glasses the cloth is not drawn as in england neither do the gentlemen sit after the ladies rise each gentleman conducts a lady to another suit of apartments where coffee is ready prepared tea about three hours after then cards and music or a walk till supper upon this occasion several officers both of naval and military distinction were present  the day after we dined with mr smith and were received by him with great politeness it is the etiquette of this country to salute the hand of every lady you are introduced to a ceremony you may be assured we did not forget upon this occasion we partook of a most elegant dinner consisting of various slight dishes after coffee mr bows mr hall junior and myself walked with the ladies by the side of a beautiful canal leading to the country returned to tea and cards supped and spent the evening very agreeably several swedish french and english songs were remarkably well sung about twelve we returned to our lodgings  on the   st we were accommodated with the consuls coach and made an excursion of a few miles into the country the rocks which we past were picturesque and magnificent the valleys seemed rich and were clothed with a fine verdure we returned to dine at the english tavern and spent the evening with mr smith  on the  st of june we took a view of the swedish ordnance which were then exercising for a review it would be too humiliating to draw a comparison between what we saw and the english artillery the soldiers in general look old and inactive their regimentals are bad and unbecoming especially those of the officers which are both whimsical gaudy and ridiculously ornamented with ribbons died feathers etc it may not be improper in this place to observe that the forces of sweden are properly speaking a regulated militia their armies consisted formerly of peasants who were remarkable only for their courage and numbers the cavalry are supported by a rate raised upon the nobility and gentry according to their estates the infantry by the peasants every farm of sixty pounds a year is charged with a foot soldier who if he marry has a house built at the charge of the peasant who also must furnish him with hay to keep a cow in winter pasturage in summer and must plough sow and reap for him and when this soldier dies they must provide one in his room the officers of horse and foot are maintained by the king who appoints a certain portion of land for that end so that every officer has a house and land and the rent of as many farms as make up his pay  we dined this day with the consul where the swedish admiral the french consul and many barons invested with different orders according to the constitution and custom of the country were present in the afternoon we saw the artillery fire at a target the military performances were very indifferent returned to the consuls and spent the evening  the next day was agreeably spent in a visit to mr halls country seat which is situated about five english miles from gottenburg the situation is most beautiful and romantic it is environed with rocks of various shapes which run in ridges for many miles below appears to the view a fine extensive lake far exceeding those of either cumberland or westmorland it abounds in pike perch trout and a variety of other fish the woods consist chiefly of oak horsechesnut birch and mountainash which grow tall but are slender owing i imagine to the very thin surface of soil the cattle which we saw here were in general small the sheep few and bad their clothing more resembles hair than wool the horses are small like the welsh ponies but amazingly active their common posting is about nine or ten english miles an hour the drivers are truly ridiculous both in manner and appearance they have no harness for their carriages but use only ropes tied together with knots which often slip and impede your expedition otherwise the velocity would be beyond the travellers conception  letter iv stockholm june        at length after a long and not disagreeable journey in which we seldom stopped longer than necessity required we arrived at the metropolis of the kingdom of sweden last night that you may travel along with us in idea i shall continue to mention such particulars as occurred on the road  we left gottenburg on the afternoon of the  d instant and slept that night at a small village called vadebaka where we met with very bad accommodations of every kind our beds were dirty and uncomfortable and no kind of victuals were to be got but what we brought along with us the roads however were remarkably good and the country agreeably variegated with rocks and woods tillageland and barren moors the woods principally consist of the spruce and silver fir some few oaks and mountainashes the day following we pursued our journey through a fine country and as before with delightful roads i cannot omit a proper commendation of this attention to travelers indeed the advantage must be great to every country where so much care is taken of the public roads though we have no great reason to complain in england of our public turnpike roads yet nothing there is comparable to these swamps morasses etc are all equally made good and those fine woods and gravel roads have so beautiful an effect that the traveller might frequently suppose himself entering the avenue or approach to some great mansion we stopped at a very neat town called lidkioping near the beautiful lake wenner which is the largest in sweden being about one hundred miles long and seventyfive broad the river gotha runs from hence by gottenburg to the sea at trolhetta there are several cataracts of great height and magnificence in one place it falls over a rock sixty feet high with such a noise that it is heard at the distance of two hundred furlongs the timber that is floated down this river falls over this precipice with such impetuosity that it disappears for a considerable time before it makes its appearance again the bed into which this cataract falls has been founded by lines of several hundred fathom but never discovered the same night we slept at enebacken our beds bad and horrid accommodations as usual  very early in the morning on the  th we took our departure and traveled with wonderful velocity to mariestadt where we breakfasted this is a large town upon the same beautiful and extensive lake the woods were remarkably fine and thick on each side of the road which is good but mountainous we found this a long and tedious stage yet the variety of objects wood water and rocks beautifully arranged rendered it agreeable the woods were so extensive that we could seldom see their limits of the feathered tribe which we met with in this country were the chader ora and black cock of the quadrupeds the wolf the bear red and fallow deer foxes hares and it is said some few elks  this evening we rested if it might be so called at blacksta beds worse than before and as the luxury of sheets was not to be had we slept in our clothes and even these did not protect us from troublesome companions a large species of the flea peculiar to that country  we continued our journey the day following and passed through a barren rocky country very different from the last stage there was no entertainment to the eye for many miles till we came to stromsholm a palace belonging to the king of sweden a very poor mansion for royalty indeed but delightfully situated upon the lake meller which extends as far as stockholm the kings stables in this place are thought magnificent and worth the travellers notice but in my opinion the very contrary is the truth they are little better than our yorkshire barns they contain twentytwo horses which are esteemed beautiful in sweden no straw is here used for bedding but the horses lie upon boards so far i must acknowledge from my own observation that this method of treating horses is preferable to our own through all sweden and denmark you seldom see a lame or foundered horse which is not the case in england the reason undoubtly is that they are rendered more tender by standing on a hotbed produced by their own litter  on the next day we pursued our journey to stockholm not without hopes that we should reach our temporary home before night we traveled the three first stages over barren heaths morasses etc a rocky wild scene around us afforded us but little pleasure as our eye could neither be gratified by a fine prospect nor our palate by a satisfaction of a different nature we were at length agreeably relieved by entering a rich cultivated country delightful well watered valleys lakes ornamented with many trees and beautiful overhanging rocks at tibla we were not unpleasantly surprised with a tolerable dinner and we arrived the same evening at stockholm  a description of this metropolis i must defer till i have had an opportunity of examining the scenes around me here however we are safe and well and able to inform you how sincerely i remain etc  letter v stockholm june         the city of stockholm is a well built town though badly paved it is surrounded by the baltic sea and lake meller at their confluence it is governed by two burgomasters and twentyfour rodmen or aldermen the kings palace is magnificent the exchange is also a good and spacious building the resort of many capital merchants the churches here are superbly decorated with a great variety of splendid ornaments the people show you much politeness and dress in a style resembling that of the spaniards the almost obsolete french fashion is still in practice among the men as they seldom meet but they salute each other  the day after our arrival we dined at a tavern remarkable for dirt and bad accommodation in the evening we went to the opera the house is a handsome building magnificently lighted up his majesty the young prince and many of the nobility were present the dresses of the actors were superb the performance a swedish historical piece representing gustavus i besieging the city of stockholm and routing the danes out of the country a magnificent statue is erected before the diethouse in memory of that prince whom the swedes regard at this day as their deliverer from danish tyranny  the next day we waited upon sir thomas wroughton who is the english minister resident at this court a gentleman of great politeness and affability who fills that department with much credit to himself and honor to his country  on saturday the  0th we made a party to view the citadel an ancient building where may be seen the royal armory colors and other trophies worthy of observation taken by the military heroes of the nation the curiosities which we thought most remarkable were charles the xiis shirt coat boots and gloves which he wore at the time when he was killed at the siege of frederickshall the regimental coat is of a dark blue color with large round gilt buttons the waistcoat and breeches yellow his shirt fine but plain a black plain cravat his boots very strong and long with square toes and steel spurs his gloves made of very strong leather with stiff tops the hat also which he wore that day was shot through above the right eye a shot which killed him upon the spot various are the conjectures even to this day concerning the fall of that rash hero it is surmised with circumstantial probability that he fell by the hand of some of his own army it is certain blood is still to be seen on the gloves and the mark of his fingers is evident upon his sword belt it seems as if he had put his hand to the wound when shot and immediately attempted to draw his sword to stab or defend himself against the assassin undoubtedly he had involved his country in much debt and many difficulties but being of a turbulant spirit almost bordering on madness would not listen to the distresses and repeated solicitations of his injured subjects his premature death therefore may be thus accounted for without any improbability he fell a martyr to his ambition  on sunday the   th we went to st nicholass church after divine service we were shown many superb and costly ornaments of silver and gold as the lutheran profession is very different from that of the church of rome i was much surprised to find the popish mode of worship with respect to external splendour so much adopted in those churches the priest upon approaching the altar invests himself in a rich embroidered cope and also officiates according to many roman catholic customs above the altartable the ascension of our savior is represented in solid gold inlaid with silver of most exquisite workmanship well worth the travellers attention there were many crucifixes of solid silver and gold  afterward we were conducted to the church of redesholm where lie interred many of the swedish kings the sepulcher of charles xii had been attempted to be opened out of curiosity when prince henry of prusia visited stockholm about twenty years ago but being of marble and the lid beginning to break they desisted the lutherans are very rigid in their attendance upon divine service but when that is over as in france and other foreign countries they go to plays operas and all kind of amusements  on the   th we dined with the english minister where a swedish admiral several officers of destinction and many english gentlemen were present sir thomas paid us the compliment of inviting many of our own countrymen to his table that he might give us an english dinner but alas that proved merely nominal as it all underwent a swedish disguise  letter vi stockholm i take the liberty of continuing in this letter my miscellaneous remarks on this country which i expect you must receive with no small degree of indulgence as many of them are the result of hasty observation i would not have it understood that the swedish ladies in general are disgusting to an english taste there are many whose education and accomplishments are as distinguished as their birth and whose affable temper and disposition render them perfectly amiable these qualifications a stranger to their language cannot always enjoy they possess no small share of vivacity wit and affability with many other accomplishments and to these we must add the greatest delicacy of manners it is true their mode of dress appears at first sight rather singular to a stranger as in some degree divesting them of elegance but that soon wears off and becomes reconciled to us by fashion the modern corrector of all absurdities in honor and justification of the swedish fair this peculiar merit must certainly be allowed them they possess a stability of temper and are by no means prone to frequent and fantastic changes either of mind or apparel neither are they subject to the extremes of decoration but observe a strict mediocrity they are not actuated by that spirit of emulation which we may observe in some countries that we know neither do they endeavor to exceed or excel one another in distinctions of this trifling nature  music is esteemed one of the most polite accomplishments among the ladies it is indeed almost a general science in this country many of their music masters are held in high repute and that vocation is thought so honorable as to introduce them to all assemblies with people of the first distinction the church music of the swedes inspires the mind with religious awe it operates however often too powerfully on weak minds and produces more the show than the true spirit of religion  it is not my intention however to deny the power of music in disposing the mind to seriousness and adding to the very spirit of devotion milton who we all know was not over fond of the external decorations of religion as practiced in the church of england yet allows the power of harmony in this respect after describing the studious cloister the high embowred roof the antique pillars and storied windows casting as he says a dim religious light he adds there let the pealing organ blow to the full voicd quire below in service high and anthems clear as may with sweetness through mine ear dissolve me into ecstasies and bring all heaven before mine eyes   much credit is due to this nation with respect to the education and training up of young people so as to render them useful members of society they are particularly attentive to the education of the inferior classes of people for which beneficial purpose they have instituted seminaries and schools which are carefully inspected by the superior and dignified clergy when a youth attains a certain age so as to be capable either of trade or any professional line of life if he shows any particular marks of genius or an uncommon assiduity in any of the walks of science these ecclesiastical directors report him to the king who gives orders as the reward of his merit that he may receive an education suitably adapted to his temper and the bent of his inclination if he continues his diligence and attention his promotion his certain this truly laudable institution and exemplary pattern may well be thought worthy the imitation of more enlightened nations as it is certainly productive of much emulation and improvement to dig the rough diamond from the mine is doubtless a commendable labor but to polish it and make it fit for use deserves the highest praises  letter vii stockholm the diet of the state which is sitting at this time consists of the king and general estates of the kingdom which are thus divided first the nobility secondly the clergy thirdly the burgers and fourthly the peasants every military person of rank from a general to a captain has the privilege of sitting in council and giving his vote the clergy elect from their deaneries and separate parishes a certain number who with the bishops and inferior clergy represent that body every corporation elects the burgers to represent them from stockholm as it is the capital and containing the largest number of inhabitants they have double the number which when united form a large and considerable body the peasants who choose one of their own people from every parish to represent them take also their seat in diet  when the king convenes the diet which he generally does on particular and emergent occasions the assembly meet at stockholm in a very elegant edifice built for this purpose their method of proceeding is this his majesty informs them by a speech from the throne of the cause of their convention they then divide and separate into four different chambers the nobles into a house of their own the clergy into the cathedral the burgers and peasants into another building across the marketplace in their several chambers they consider the matter in question and give their assent or dissent the vote is carried by a majority every chamber has a negative in passing a law after each of the states has come to a determination they return in regular order from the separate chambers to the diethouse where the king sits and receives their decisive votes  i could not but remark the pomp of their procession from the council chamber to the diethouse they are arranged in great form and the town guard turns out under arms as they pass the first noble venerable in age and dressed in the court fashion went first the rest of the nobility in pairs after then the archbishop of upsala a man of a very reverend and apostolic appearance with a gold chain about his neck the other bishops and clergy two and two then the principal magistrate of stockholm at the head of the burgers and lastly the poor peasants the singularity of whose apparel and lank hair formed a remarkable contrast with those who went before yet though appearances dont favor those people i was well informed that they are far from being deficient in the politics of their own country and wonderfully skilled in the knowledge of their own national constitution they are firm in opinion neither to be bribed or biassed but adhere strictly to the welfare and credit of their nation  these people are particularly and most vigourously attentive to the actions and honor of the senate which is composed of fourteen senators though the peasants themselves are excluded from voting for the election of a senator yet the senate is always accountable to the diet of which they make a part for every transaction of its administration so that the peasants have the power of checking the irregularity or encroaching power of a presumptuous noble neither will they admit the most trisling infringement of any constitutional privilege whatever rights of such importance though vested as may be imagined in an illiterate race of people produce the good effects of decorum and a well regulated government  a senator is appointed as president to every court of justice and a council to manage and regulate all boards established for the use of public revenues such as military offices marine departments and all other civil and commercial appointments their laws are comprised in a small compass and seldom subject them to the disturbance of litigation so that the profession of the long robe in sweden is of small repute  letter viii stockholm his majestys late animated and enterprizing attempt for a revolution succeeded to a certain degree but not so far as to introduce and establish an unlimited monarchy he gained the soldiers and many of his subjects joined his party and took the oaths of allegiance in consequence of a most nervous and spirited address which he made to his people his elocution affable manner and great condescension which indeed was only assumed to serve his turn rendered him the idol of his country and what added more to the patriotic zeal which they showed for him was that he was a native of sweden his person is rather low but well made and active it is very singular that of one side of his face does not at all resemble the other he delights much in military exercises and forms an annual camp at a small distance from stockholm where he dedicates his time to military improvements  the want of population which is very much the case in sweden and above all the want of current coin will always give a most effectual check to monarchical ambibition though the king maintains and personally inspects the most minute department of state and attaches himself to every frugal system of regal management yet all is not sufficient to effect his purposes necessity is a plea which even kings cannot resist  whether this was the reason or whether he suspected some imposition in the management of the public revenues and particulaly in that of distilled spirits or whether he had an eye only to his own private emolument certain it is that his majesty issued an edict for discontinuing every distillery of spirituous liquors throughout the kingdom a second ordinance was immediately proclaimed for erecting distilleries of his own in every province and laying a severe penalty on those who dared to manufacture their own brandy this expectation of increasing wealth soon vanished and proved but an additional calamity partly from his own injudicious management and partly from the impositions of those he employed he soon found the ill effects of his schemes doubtless from such a precipitate misconduct it was natural to imagine that many and great dissentions would have arisen among the people such discontents his majesty was aware of and to appease them ordered a reduction of the price from seven shillings per gallon to three shillings and sixpence this still had not the desired effect but on the contrary proved the consequence of more immediate ruin this want of commercial knowledge plunged him in serious and unforseen dificulties till at length it determined him to an application to diet for relief how far these aristocratical people complied with his desires how far the exigences of his situation were relieved or whether any supply was granted has not yet transpired  letter ix stockholm in my last i gave you an account of the transactions that have been passing between the king and the diet i can now inform you that this powerful assembly men venerable in office and ready to oppose every apparent principle of despotism refused to comply with a scheme which he laid before them for a general liquidation of the royal debts a further impropriety of conduct his majesty was guilty of in attempting to exact from his country a more exorbitant sum to defray as he said his expenses to england this was equally disapproved of by the haughty swedes who immediately and emphatically pronounced a general negative further appeals were then unnecessary and all addresses to his obstinate countrymen proved ineffectual  this disappointment was not well relished and indeed incurred the royal displeasure being a man of a warm and impetuous disposition his majesty dismissed the diet with a very spirited speech censuring their measures and disapproving of their opposition to him after this he retired to the camp and did not return to stockholm for some days this had likely to have terminated in a very serious manner but by the proper and timely interference of good ministers tranquillity was at length happily restored to this court  though the imprudence of his majestys conduct may frequently throw a shade over some parts of his character yet he possesses many good qualities which more than counterbalance these failings and indeed add a brilliancy to his many distinguished virtues he is firm in friendship and always ready most liberally to recompense the fidelity of his servants so far as pecuniary ability will permit when this cannot be done which is sometimes the case he very judiciously confers honors and distinctions titles stars and ribbons these honors he confers promiscuously on all ranks and stations neither regarding birth or any family distinction whatever this policy adopted now by the sovereigns of most countries rewards merit at a small expense and procures an additional number of retainers to the court he uses the same means for the encouragement of literature and in promoting the arts and sciences in this country and a happy distinction it is even the lowest mechanic is encouraged by a reward equal to the ingenuity which he possesses this proper policy cannot fail in the end of producing good effects throughout the swedish dominions and affords an example worthy the imitation of the most civilized kingdoms  letter x stockholm the late dowager queen who was sister to his late majesty of prusia opposed many of the present kings public measures and showed great disapprobation of her sons partiality to the customs and manners of the french which as it was likely did not fail to give the french several advantages the consequence of such delusion that politic people in this case did not omit the improvement of so favorable an opportunity of advancing their interests at length by gradual approaches and unsuspected subtilty they made an invaluable purchase and became possessors of a great part of the harbor of gottenburg this so greatly displeased the dowager queen that from that time she absented herself from the court and retired to the small but beautiful palace built in the garden at drodenholm  it would be wrong to pass over the character of this lady in silence she partook of many of the strong mental qualities of her brother she was not only well skilled in all the parts of profound literature but her unlimited knowledge extended through every system of politics early in life she took much delight in the cultivation of a strong natural understanding which she continued to improve to her death that she might have a retirement proper for this purpose she built this small palace in the garden at drodenholm which is elegant and of most exquisite architecture the chinese taste prevails most there are several apartments decorated with mandarins chinavases and various ornaments which highly compliment her taste and judgment in this retirement she dedicated her time to books and by indesatigable study became a proficient in almost every language but particularly in the latin tongue which it is said she thoroughly understood the library which is of her own collection and extremely well chosen is now a standing testimony of her genius her private character whatever may have been said by the tongue of flander it is not my business to investigate  tomorrow we intend to pursue our journey to lapland when i return to stockholm i shall continue my reflections upon either the customs manners or politics of this people as it may happen but do not suppose this shall in the mean time prevent your hearing from me i shall write as often as i am able presuming on your friendship that i cannot too often subscribe myself yours etc  entrance into upsal letter xi upsala   th june upsala where we arrived this morning on our road to lapland is the first university of eminence and repute in sweden many foreigners and students of different nations even from england resort here for education the professors of science and language are men of unquestionable abilities and of great reputation for learning i had the pleasure of dining with two of these professional gentlemen instead as i expected of finding them a formal and precise people i was agreeably surprised to see them set aside every unnecessary reserve and with the greatest politeness freedom and good humor entertain us with every information which we wished  the city of upsala is a pleasant and healthful situation in the lower part of the city there is a fine square which forms the marketplace on an eminence is the castle which consists of many beautiful and lofty buildings chiefly of wood commanding a distant but most extensive view of the gulf of bothnia from hence there is a most commodious communication with stockholm the much renowned linaeus first formed here his celebrated botanical garden it affords no extraordinary appearance to a stranger ignorant of botany but is matter of much curiosity to students in that science  the fair in this place will not allow themselves to pass unobserved i should not therefore excuse myself of rudeness if i were to omit the least appearance of respect they show great attention to strangers and assume a peculiar gaiety which in england might have the appearance of levity it may not however appear so very extraordinary that these ladies should possess some knowledge of the softer passions having all the advantage of a college education  it must not be considered as a particular want of respect to the married ladies of upsala if i remark that at this place some fell under our observation whose conduct and behavior still less obeyed the rules of decorum than the unmarried fair ones i have already mentioned i am not the first traveller that has had occasion to make this remark not on sweden only but on many of the northern kingdoms particularly germany whatever reason may be assigned for this it is certainly true and it would be well if in more fashionable countries the mask of matrimony were not so frequently made use of as a covering for levity and dissipation a skreen for the improper indulgence of licentious inclinations  this celebrated city and university deserves a more particular attention than i am at present able to bestow upon it when we return which we shall do through this place i will endeavor to give you a better account of its history  sir h g l has caused a drawing of our entrance into this city to be engraved which will accompany this letter  letter xii june         i write this from a village on the road that i may not interrupt the narrative of our journey i shall resume my pen when we become more stationary  we left upsala early in the morning on the   th of june and attempted to dine at a dirty village about noon but alas nothing comfortable was to be met with but though our palates this day received no gratification our eyes certainly did from prospects the most romantic and entertaining we traveled for many miles by the side of a very beautiful and extensive lake and passed a most wonderful and picturesque cataract called elkerby fall in the evening we arrived at gefle gefle is a seaport situated on the gulf of bothnia an arm of the baltic sea there appeared more industry in the cultivation of land here than in any part of this country which we had hitherto passed leaving behind us these traces of civilized life we entered into woods that did not terminate for many miles  the next day we continued our journey as before through almost endless woods and passed a variety of lakes one of which we were obliged to cross in a ferry about half a mile over the swedish watermen who are neither expeditious nor expert greatly impeded our journey about eleven at night we arrived at a town called igsund we had letters of recommendation to a gentleman of that place by whom we were most policely received and hospitably treated the town of igfund though in itself small yet very extensive ironworks are carried on here the property of merchants in stockholm after breakfasting the next morning with our hospitable friend and his lady we left igsund and traveled through a country full of rocks and precipices deep and heavy sands with little variety the woods as usual were very extensive some small villages are scattered upon the borders of the lakes which are inhabited by boors whose sole subsistence depends upon the fish they can procure from the lake on which they live they have very little corn and in order to increase the quantity of food they mix it up and grind it with the thin rind or inward bark of the fir tree afterward they form it into thin large cakes though their diet is very meagre yet they are a large bony athletic people capable of bearing much fatigue  the woods here are remarkably extensive and thick and are supposed to harbor more wild beasts than any other part of sweden we were informed of a melancholy instance of the ferocity of these wild animals near a neighboring village while we were there two unsortunate girls attending their hrds in the wood were both devoured by a ravenous shebear and her young which the day before had been seen prowling for prey  the same night we reached sunval a seaport town upon the same gulf the trade of this place chiefly consists in the building of ships which is very convenient on account of its near situation to such extensive and fine forests it neither imports nor exports any thing except tar which they extract from their firs  on the morning of the   th we crossed two serries and passed a most mountainous country the hills on every side were almost precipices altogether inaccessible this day we dined at an insignificant village where we unexpectedly met with tolerable accommodations in the afternoon we crossed a lake a mile and a half long the country to dogstau where we slept was almost a constant succession of steep rocks and barren hills which delayed us much for which reason we did not reach that place till two in the morning where we found accommodations of every kind exceeding bad here we delayed not long but left dogstau very early and passed under an exceeding high rock at some small distance from the town the summit of this rock is much resorted to by strangers to see the sun at midnight  we dined at a neat village the house was uncommonly clean and we were agreeably surprised with unlooked for delicacies such as a variety of wild fowl eggs chaders etc from hence we made a slow progress in traveling as the roads were deep and sandy and arrived at lesver the same night a town situated in a wretched country the land producing no corn for three years past this circumstance threatens them with the dreadful consequences of a general famine a calamity too often experienced in this miserable country  letter xiii june         this morning we entered uma a beautiful wellbuilt town situated upon a fine river of the same name where ships are built of large burden the river runs on the south side of the town and empties itself into the gulf of bothnia it gives its name to a part of swedish lapland in which it has its source from hence called uma lapmark it is too broad to admit of a bridge which renders the passage very incommodious as the ferries are very bad and ill supplied the governor of west bothnia resides here which is about two hundred and eighty miles north of stockholm  the same night we arrived at richlea the first town at which we slept in lapland the roads here are like those we had left with rocks woods and in the height of summer burning sands the town of richlea vies with and indeed far surpasses the towns in the swedish territories in dirt and poverty beds there were indeed if such they may be called which we lay upon and by the assistance of fatigue contrived to sleep till morning by day we were bit by the musquetofly and during the night by insects of a nature equally disagreeable to our feelings our faces legs and bodies were so immoderately swelled as to render us truly pitiable objects we left that place to free ourselves from such an uncomfortable situation as early as possible  on the next day we arrived very early at a small village called gumboda here we were entertained with an encampment of swedish soldiers which made a very indifferent military appearance from their awkwardness and apparent want of discipline i took them for some new raised lapland militia we slept that night at sunana where we found an excellent inn every thing much to our surprise was uncommonly clean for that country the landlady seemed very desirous to please that circumstance could only be guessed at from her actions as an entire ignorance of the language of the country rendered any other intercourse impracticable  our journey the next day was much retarded by the wilful negligence of those boors who are obliged to supply all travelers with horses a negligence in this respect subjects them either to corporal punishment or a pecuniary fine on which account the traveller sign a book which is kept for this purpose and at the same time particularly notes how long he had been detained by their neglect this book must be produced at every quarterly meeting of their magistrates who regulate every punishment according to the desert of the offender were it not for the strictness of this regulation no foreigner could commodiously travel but must be subject to the greatest impositions  this country abounds in lakes and rivers which though particularly beautiful and romantic greatly hindered the progress of our journey as we were obliged to pass over many of them for which reason we did not arrive at pithia till five in the afternoon here we dined at the burgomasters house were genteelly received and set down to a very slight dinner which we quickly dispatched pithia like uma gives its name to a province of swedish lapland is situated upon a river of the same name which rises in the lapland mountains and runs into the gulf of bothnia  from hence we set out for ernasto where we arrived the same night but finding the beds damp we were obliged to sleep in our clothes from this circumstance you will not be surprised that we were very soon ready to pursue our journey in the morning the town of pithia is perhaps one of the largest and best built towns in lapland it is governed by a burgomaster and twelve rodmen this place has more the appearance than the reality of trade though extremely well situated for that purpose it is surrounded by a fine navigable water which communicates with many lakes and rivers the inhabitants seem to be an inanimate sort of people neither desirous to please nor giving themselves much trouble to show their displeasure  letter xiv tornao   th june after leaving pithia and passing over a large extent of country very little of which is good the greater part bad and indifferent a better prospect presents itself before us here plenty might have been expected from the apparent good quality of the soil if the people were inclined to industry but alas on account of their indolence and ignorance in the art of agriculture poverty scanty poverty continues to oppress them  after crossing a very indifferent ferry we arrived at a small but neat town called gambelstaden where it is recorded that king charles xi of sweden on his return from tornao humourously declared that he had in his tour met with three very extraordinary circumstances the first was seeing the sun at midnight at tornao the second that in crossing the ferry a large salmon leaped into the boat and lastly that when he attended divine service at gambelstaden the parish minister ascended the rostrum to preach before him but being overcome by diffidence and awed by the presence of majesty returned again to his seat without uttering a word here we visited the church which is a spacious building superbly ornamented with gaudy grandeur  the same night we slept at grot the clergyman of the parish was the landlord not far from this place we observed two criminals stretched upon the wheel for murder capital executions are not common in this country and indeed are but seldom inflicted except in cases of murder on such occasions only they have not yet laid aside the use of torture a proof among others that the government of sweden has not yet attained that degree of refinement which in more southern kingdoms every where prevails  the morning following after passing a noble river we entered finland the country here is deep and sandy and of course barren and unfruitful the inhabitants are to appearance rough and their manners uncultivated to a great degree but though to a stranger they appear ignorant yet they are sufficiently knowing where their own interest is concerned this day we arrived at tornao a beautiful well built town surrounded by a river of the same name or rather the river here swells into a spacious lake this water produces a great quantity of salmon of uncommon weight and size this town is the place of residence of many capital merchants the principal trade here consists of tar and furs of all kinds brought down from the high country by the laplanders which they barter for cloth hardware and other merchandise  at twelve oclock this night we saw the sun in full beauty the horizon being remarkably clear gave us a most delightful view of that to us extraordinary sight sir h g l has caused an engraving to be made of this agreeable scene see the frontispiece the inhabitants of this climate no doubt reap many advantages from this circumstance during the summer season but alas a long and dreary winter reverses the scene and involves them in continual darkness yet this is not quite so dismal as might be imagined the aurora borealis appears with peculiar splendour in all northern countries and supplies in some degree the place of the sun the stars too in their clear frosty nights shed an agreeable light and enable them without much impediment to follow many of their ordinary occupations  letter xv tornao june   th as we had great need of rest after a journey of eight hundred miles through a country destitute of every comfort and convenience of life it was thought expedient to halt at this place yesterday and today this town is situated on the confines of finland the languages both of the laplanders and the finlanders are spoken here our interpreter being well skilled in all the dialects of this country we met with fewer difficulties in the common course of things than we had reason to expect  this day we attended the church which stands at some distance from the town it is a small but neat building and the benefice about eighty pounds per annum few church preferments in this country are of greater value in the afternoon we received an invitation from the judges lady to drink coffee the judge himself then attending the diet at stockholm we accepted the invitation and were most politely received by the lady her dress was very superb having a gold chain about her neck a diamond cross ear rings and a variety of precious stones on every finger her vestment was a rich brocade very short after the country fashion in the evening we were introduced to a grand ball where we were much entertained with their peculiar manner of dancing soon after the judges lady made her appearance when she entered the room the company all rose and paid her much respect from this it may be imagined that she is considered as a person of no small consequence in this place though she was not now in the meridian of youth and beauty she danced minuets cotillions and many of their own country dances with uncommon activity and spirit the inhabitants of this place though living as it were at a great distance from polished society are far from being an unpolished people the master of the ceremonies paid us the utmost respect and attention being ignorant of their customs we were according to the english phrase going to take a french leave but were given to understand that it would be deemed the highest disrespect if we did not particularly salute the judges lady and make a general obeisance to the whole company with this ceremony though by no means pleasant to us we were obliged to comply  tornao is the chief town of west bothnia about three hundred and twenty miles north east of stckholm situated on a river of the same name which rises in lapland runs south east and falls at tornao into the gulf of bothnia they have a tolerable trade here in furs with the laplanders their neighbors on the west and north and the finlanders who inhabit the eastern side of the gulf  letter xvi tornao june it is our fortune to be at tornao on midsummer day  a day always celebrated with the greatest festivity in sweden the boors flock to this place in great numbers from the surrounding country and endeavor to amuse themselves in various ways their curiosity has been very much excited by sir h g ls landaw which they have viewed with much admiration they are also as desirous of seeing us as we can possibly be of observing them for this purpose through ignorance or curiosity i will not call it impertinence they are continually staring at us through the windows of our dining room  i must now relate an adventure though of no great importance yet as it amused us i shall have your pardon for so doing in the evening a stout finlander laid his elbows upon the window and without much ceremony called to us frequently for brandy we nodded to him as we were drinking our wine while he continued to repeat his former request in his own language anna ma vino hurra kultana dear gentlemen give me brandy sir h with great good nature complied with his request and gave him two or three glasses which he seemed to enjoy very much but still he called hurra kultana a few glasses more were given him which made him drop his elbow from the window and rather grow shorter as his legs would not bear him up he bent his knees against the wall and by the help of his hands he supported himself by holding fast by the window post but still he called hurra kultana two glasses more were given him till at length he could say nothing but kultana kultana and gradually sunk from the window  when his countrymen who were standing around saw him drop they took him carefully up and carried him away word however was soon brought that the man was so ill that they expected his throat would soon be on fire and if he did not recover before the morning our post horses would be stopped and our journey prevented  our anxiety was removed in an hour or twos time by the mans appearance once more upon the stage he came into the yard and began to play several anticks and to show us how the bear dances in the fields  about eleven oclock the same night the much renowned professor helands waited on sir harry his countenance and appearance showed that he was a true born son of lapland his age about sixty nine he spoke the french language tolerably well and said many handsome things of the english nation he informed us how many english gentlemen had visited tornao in his time and showed us letters he had received from persons of rank in london  there is one circumstance concerning him i cannot omit mentioning to show the high estimation in which learning is held and the credulity of the common people as well as the veneration which is paid in unenlightened nations to men of superior knowledge we were informed and i believe the circumstance was entirely credited by the person who told us that for his winter amusement this learned professor had taught a swarm of bees to hunt and even to kill mice it is impossible to say how far the minds of the ignorant may be imposed upon it is not perhaps many centuries ago that this story would have found believers even in england  we walked in the evening to the side of the river to see the finlanders draw their nets at the salmon fishery they form an enclosure with poles driven down in the water the length of which is three hundred yards the breadth one hundred with only one entrance for the salmon every two hours they draw their net and generally catch about forty or fifty salmon at a time the inhabitants of this place pickle and salt it in barrels and export it from hence to all parts of sweden a large quantity is smoked and dried and sold very cheap our landlord the same evening bought a large salmon that weighed twentyone pounds for nine dollars copper about half a crown the pike is a fish very abundant at tornao and in lapland these also are dried by the natives and sold to the merchants for exportation but of all the fish which their water can supply none is to be compared with the ruda either for goodness or for flavor it resembles the carp in shape and is equally pleasant to the palate  letter xvii tornao the laplanders in general are below the middle stature with flat faces high cheek bones long black hair and their complexions of a mahogany hue their habitations are dirty to a great degree but on account of their unsed life are portable they leave an aperture at the top which serves both for window and chimney and a small hole on one side for an entrance in short their dwellings are not unlike those described in cooks voyage of the inhabitants of kamschatka the laplanders are muscular and active though at the same time which seems to imply a contradiction they are naturally idle but perfectly pacific in their tempers the women likewise are low with large broad features but have so gentle and complaisant a manner that their behavior removes a prejudice which their first appearance does not fail to excite as their manners are gentle so their characters are chaste  the language of the laplanders is a harsh and unintelligible jargon derived from their neighbors the ancient inhabitants of finland their voices however are musical and they never require much entreaty to oblige the few specimens which we possess of lapland poetry give you a favorable impression of their taste and taste most certainly it is uncorrupted by foreign ideas and entirely the production of nature in the spectator you have two elegant odes translated from the language of lapland nos     and  0  i shall make no apology for adding a third  a lapland song the snows are dissolving on tornaos rude side and the ice of lulhea flows down the dark tide thy dark stream oh lulhea flows freely away and the snowdrop unfolds her pale beauties to day far off the keen terrors of winter retire and the norths dancing streamers relinquish their fire the suns genial beams swell the bud on the tree and enna chaunts forth her wild warblings with glee the reindeer unharnessd in freedom shall play and safely over odons steep precipice stray the wolf to the forests recesses shall fly and howl to the moon as she glides through the sky then haste my fair luah oh haste to the grove and pass the sweet season in rapture and love in youth let our bosoms in extacy glow for the winter of life never a transport can know with respect to religion i am afraid the laplanders have yet much to learn though like every other quarter of the globe knowledge is making gradual advances even here the high laps as they are called that is those who inhabit the mountains have not yet quite forgot their original paganism notwithstanding the great pains which the swedes have taken to introduce christianity amongst them many superstitious customs still remain to proclaim the darkness of their minds augury and witchcraft make a part of their belief they still whisper to their reindeer when they undertake a journey and address their ancient idols for the increase and safety of their flocks you have heard no doubt of their conjuring drums i met with one in the possession of a priest at uma who had attended a reformed pagan in his dying moments his original opinions he had long since changed but retained this piece of ancient superstition to delude the ignorant and supply his own necessities  this instrument is of an oval form made of the bark of the fir pine or birchtree one end of which is covered with a sort of parchment dressed from the reindeer skin this is loaded with brass rings artfully fastened to it the conjuror then beats it upon his breast with a variety of frantic postures after this he besmears it with blood and draws upon it rude figures of various kinds when he has gone through all his manaeuvres he informs his credulous audience what they wish to know which he says was communicated to him during the paroxism of his attitudes like other fortune tellers his answers are generally of a favorable kind for which he receives presents of brandy which adds fuel to his frenzy and renders him mighty wise  letter xviii tornao the wealth of the laplanders consists chiefly in the number of reindeer these draw their sledges in winter but in summer these animals loose their vigor and swiftness and are easily overcome by heat i have seen them reclining in the woods and apparently so enfeebled as scarcely able to get out of your way when thus oppressed they make a noise resembling the grunting of an hog even then the laplanders make use of them to transport their effects from one station to another which they have occasion to do more frequently in summer the reindeer drawn from the living animal  than in winter as they are then in quest of fertile plains for the maintenance of their numerous flocks  the reindeer is of the shape of a stag but rather stronger the hair light rather inclining to an ash color his horns are very long and finely branched the lower branches which fall very near the forehead are said to be used by the animal in breaking the ice when the waters are frozen over that he may get drink his food is shrubs and plants or moss and the bark of trees his legs are very hairy and his hoofs moveable for he expands and opens them in going he is an extremely swift as well as an extremely strong animal  after speaking of the reindeer it is but proper that i should mention the sledge which renders them so useful the sledge is formed something like a boat its bottom is unequal of course none but a person well practiced in such a mode of traveling could preserve himself from oversetting every moment it is square behind but projecting to a point before the traveller is tied in this sledge like a child in a cradle he manages his carriage with great dexterity by means of a stick with a flat end to remove stones or any obstructions which he might meet with in this situation they travel with great rapidity  the laplander is very dexterous in making utensils of wood he is his own carpenter and boatbuilder i was not a little surprised in a tent of wandering laplanders to find the cheese which they make of the reindeers milk curiously impressed with a wooden instrument such as is commonly used in the english daries they fasten their boards together when they make their boats or other movables with twigs or the nerves of the reindeer the women also make use of the latter as a substitute for thread in sewing the female laplanders show great ingenuity in embroidering their garments with brasswire tin or any other gaudy ornament they take much delight in adorning their heads neck and shoulders with glass beads etc and are very fanciful in their girdles which are embroidered and fringed with large tufts at the two extremes and tied in large knots this they look upon as the greatest ornament of their dress  the dress of lapland ladies of superior rank such as are resident in towns is equal to their fortunes this is often very superb and costly whimsically loaded with ornaments gold and silver rings diamonds and pearls etc i have already mentioned the dress of the judges lady at this place the vest of a lady of quality is of the richest brocade silk trimmed with ribbons which float round the neck and waist the cap of blue or white satin wrought with embroidery of various colors the young women wear a gold ring on the middle finger of the right hand when they marry it is changed to the left  there are but very few dogs in lapland and these of a breed peculiar to the country small sized with cur tails and pointed ears not unlike the wolf dog they are very useful to hunters in the woods they are generally well trained and of wonderful sagacity in finding game particularly the chader and ora after the bird is sprung the dog pursues and watches its perch which commonly is upon a high tree the bird becomes unaccountably fascinated by the steady posture and barking of the dog so that the master has no difficulty in discovering the object of his pursuit  the fishing laplanders choose their habitation upon the shore of one of their lakes they are very dexterous in this art and no wonder as on this their whole subsistence depends this however can only be a summer employment when the lakes are frozen they are obliged to betake themselves to their forests and subsist by hunting the fish of these lakes are most excellent in quality and flavor but they know not how to dress them the following are the names by which the variety of them are known the gadda abborre mort loyan gris ruda or carassir a species of the carp but much larger the stremling and negenogon of the herring kind but inhabitants of fresh water the lax or salmon skomakaren rudor simper and lake  when the season approaches for curing their fish for their winter provisions they are obliged to take a long and tedious journey over deserts and mountains to procure salt at their seaport towns these journeys are generally performed in large parties  the kader male and female ad naturam scale of   feet    letter xix tornao from the wild appearance of this mountainous region far from population and cultivated life the sportsman may expect the highest gratification wild game indeed of various kinds may be found here in great abundance it cannot be expected in an excursion of this kind that i should give you a complete natural history of the countries which i visit neither will i pretend to be very accurate even in those things which i do describe i can only relate what i beheld and describe as well as the circumstances of our situation would permit  amongst others the kader or chader is a remarkably fine bird as large as a common turkey the cock is black the hen of an orange color and not quite so large as the cock the hen generally lays about eight or ten eggs one evening as sir h g l was out on a shooting party his dog sprung a chader upon walking to the place he found her nest at the foot of a rotten fir tree with eight eggs in it  the ora nearly resembles our black game in england but larger but the hierpe is reckoned the finest game that can be eaten in size it is like a young pigeon its color black gray and white see the plate the snoripa is rather larger for the first two years this bird turns white in the winter and gray in the summer like the hares in this country afterward it remains always white this bird makes an extraordinary noise and particularly at nights it is not to be found any where but in lapland or the neighboring countries by some accident a few years ago this bird happened to make its appearance within an hundred miles of stockholm which very much alarmed the common people in the neighborhood where it was found in short from the particular noise it made at nights a report prevailed amongst the vulgar that the wood was haunted by a ghost so much were they terrified by this invisible spirit that nothing could tempt the postboys after it was dark to pass this dreadful wood this spirit however was at last happily removed by the sagacity of some gentlemen who the orre male and female ad naturam scale of   feet  the hierpe the snoripa ad naturam scale of

and sold at very high prices besides these they have the moorkulla akeshon purrhons rapphons gelenotte kneeper which is a kind of snipe and the yierper  woodcocks breed both in lapland and in sweden as well as other northern countries after the breeding season for a certain time the woods of lapland and finland abound with them these they call in their language the seasonbird but they neither destroy or eat them judging them to be unwholesome food from the circumstance of their having no crops it has been an observation in england that for several years past woodcocks have become remarkably scarce this may probably be accounted for in the following manner sweden like other countries is making a gradual progress in the arts of luxury amongst which the indulgence of the palate takes no undistinguished place wild fowl eggs have of late become a great delicacy among the inhabitants of that country who encourage the boors to sind out their nests the egg of the woodcock they are particularly fond of which is about the size of that of the plover and is exceeding rich in flavor i have seen the boors offering large quantities of these eggs for sale in the market at stockholm from this practice it is not improbable but that the breed of this bird as well as of the chader ora etc will be greatly diminished if not at last totally exterpated upon enquiry however i do not find that any alteration in point of quantity has as yet been perceived in lapland  letter xx tornao from the number size and retired situation of the lapland lakes it may be imagined that they abound in a variety of aquatic fowls this possibly may be the case but in order to be a judge of this it would be necessary to take up our abode in these cold regions during the winter months there are several of the duck species to be found here one i was shown which had been shot by a boor resembling the moorcock in plumage and which a person not well versed in natural history might have mistaken for one but the bill and feet proved it to be an inhabitant of the waters  there is a small bird sometimes to be met with in this country and in other northern climates one of this kind was lately taken near ravensworth castle in the county of durham and is now in the possession of lady liddell it is about the size of a thrush this bird is called the siebenschwantz or bohemian chatterer a solitary bird from whence it is conjectured to have been called the microphoenix it has a long tail of blue red and yellow feathers which give it a very glowing appearance on almost every feather of the wing there is a small red bright spot like a drop of red sealing wax this last has been particularly observed in a bird of the same size though otherwise less gaily feathered in the southern parts of america but it seems probable that these birds are not of the same kind as this has a tuft upon its head which does not answer the description of the other it is not however surprising that birds who are well provided for long journeys should be found in very distant countries particularly as it seems within their power to remove from one place to another according to the temperature of different seasons or for other reasons not so evident to men who are unable to judge of their instincts  from this country a large quantity of aedderdown is collected from a duck of that name to be found only in the northern climes the down is of such value when in its purity that it is sold for two rixdollars per pound it is extremely soft and warm and so light and apt to expand that two handfulls squeezed together are sufficient to fill a down quilt which is a covering like a feather bed used in those cold countries instead of a common quilt or blanket  i must not forget to mention the jofugl a bird remarkable for robbing other birds of their prey which he is too lazy to look out for himself if he cannot intimidate them by his cry or appearance he strikes them with his bill so violently on the back as to cause them to drop their excrement which he catches as it falls  the alk is a bird of the size of a small goose it will dive twenty fathomas deep in pursuit of herrings and has sometimes been drawn up by a fishhook from that depth  the scarv or loom is a very singular aquatic bird about the size of a muscovy duck the egg after half an hours boiling remains liquid the boors take these birds by lighting a fire under the rock where they build the smoke and heat make them giddy and they drop down in numbers  many clusters of swallows in their torpid state i was credibly informed are frequently found by sishermen among reeds and bushes in the lakes both of norway and sweden  though this country seems to be situated under an inclemnent sky yet we must not suppose that nature has entirely deprived it of the fruits of the earth besides others which may be found in cold climates the following are the native fruits of lapland the akerbar which grows in stony places and is reckoned a rarity at the first tables in sweden it is preserved and used as a desert from which also they make a sort of wine the hiortron which grows in swamps of the size of the raspberry is yellow and very delicious to the palate and the lingon a fruit not unlike a cranbury but as large again which is preserved and generally used in sweden to roast beef  the forests of lapland produce in great perfection the spruce and silver fir another species has lately been discovered here called the mazartree it is a tall thick and useful timber the bole when cut in two is beautifully variegated and hard enough to take an excellent polish tables of great beauty and other ornamental furniture have been made of this wood which is purchased for this purpose by the swedes and their northern neighbors  lapland too has its flowers which during its short summer flourish in the valleys this country in general is very mountainous and barren the situations on its lakes however and in the interstices of its hills are picturesque and beautiful but there are extensive forests dark and dismal long and dreary plains covered with moss and swampy the prospect of which cannot but make the inhabitant of most other countries truly thankful for comforts which the laplander cannot possibly enjoy  yet even the native of lapland does not want his enjoyments  nature a mother kind alike to all still grants her bliss at labors earnest call with food as well the peasant is supplied on laplands cliff as arnos shelvy side and though the rocky crested summits frown these rocks by custom turn to beds of down goldsmiths traveller letter xxi tornao it has not been my intention as it certainly was beyond my ability to give you a complete history of the present state of lapland to do this a long residence in the country would be required it would be necessary to expose yourself to the bitter winter blasts of this inclement region to climb mountains deemed inaccessible to the feet of man to live in the dark and dirty huts of the native inhabitants and to seed upon slender cheese or the powdered bark of some neighboring tree now you know me too well to imagine that i would be thus liberal of my labors for the benefit of the world fatigue and hunger are but miserable companions yet i will not say how far curiosity and the love of novelty would carry me to become better acquainted with this polar clime and country you must however content yourself with such observations as i have been able to give you and that you may not say i have carried you over so many lakes and mountains through so many forests and plains without offering one agreeable repast to your mind i feel myself inclined to give you thompsons beautiful description of the scenes i have been describing there is another advantage i intend from this long quotation and that is if my reflections do not corroborate the sentiments of the poet the poet will at least justify and illustrate my reflections after describing the martial hordes of the north this poet of nature proceeds not such the sons of lapland wisely they despise the insensate barbarous trade of war they ask no more than simple nature gives they love their mountains and enjoy their storms no false desires no pridecreated wants disturb the peaceful current of their time and through the restless ever tortured maze of pleasure or ambition bid it rage their reindeer form their riches these their tents their robes their beds and all their homely wealth supply their wholesome fare and cheerful cups obsequious at their call the docile tribe yield to the sled their necks and whirl them swift over hill and dale heaped into one expanse of marbled snow as far as eye can sweep with a blue crest of ice unbounded glazed by dancing meteors then that ceaseless shake a waving blaze refracted over the heavens and vivid moons and stars that keener play with doubled luster from the glossy waste even in the depth of polar night they find a wondrous day enough to light the chase or guide their daring steps to finland sairs wished spring returns and from the hazy south while dim aurora slowly moves before the welcome sun just verging up at first by small degrees extends the swelling curve till seen at last for gay rejoicing mouths still round and round his spiral course he winds and as he nearly dips his flaming orb wheels up again and reascends the sky in that glad season from the lakes and flood where pure niemis m de maupertuis in his book on the figure of the earth after having described the beautiful lake and mountains of niemi in lapland says  from this height we had opportunity several times to see those vapors rise from the lake which the people of the country call haltios and which they deem to be the guardian spirits of the mountains we had been frighted with stories of bears that haunted this place but saw none it seemed rather a place of resort for fairies and genii than bears fairy mountains rise and fringed with roses tenglio the same author observes  i was surprised to see upon the banks of this river tenglio roses of as lively a red as any that are in our gardens rolls his stream they draw the copious fry

plunder and rapacious power in whom fell interest never yet has sown the seeds of vice whose spotless swains never knew injurious deed nor blasted by the breath of faithless love their blooming daughters woe thompsons winter  letter xxii tornao a people that live without exercising the arts of agriculture even the simple ones of ploughing sowing and planting affords a singular instance in the present history of the world such a people are the natives of lapland ignorant of all the improvements of life unknowing in the several embellishments of society they live in the interior parts of lapland as much as possible in a state of nature  yet providence who always finds a substitute where full enjoyment is denied darts a ray of contentment beneath the raster of the laplander happy would it be for more polished society if in the midst of their entertainments they could meet with the same consolation if the native of lapland possesses not his flocks and his herds if he sees not around him valleys smiling with corn nor his rich pastures and fine meadows of this at least he is certain that he has no occasion for them his reindeer is his all of all tame animals this is at once the most serviceable and provided for with the least trouble and inconvenience i have had occasion to remark that their usual food is moss when they are unable to procure grass upon the mountains  i have before mentioned both the reindeer and the sledge but as i have an opportunity of sending you a drawing of the latter which has been purchased by sir h g l for the purpose of sending home as a curiosity i shall add a more particular account of it  the sledge is shaped like a small boat with a backboard for the person to lean against who sits laced fast in and well secured from the cold it is peaked before to which part the leather thong is fixed which yokes the reindeer to the carriage there is a cloth girt around the body of the animal which is fastened on the back the bit is a piece of small leather tacked to the reins of the bridle over the deers head and neck and from the breast a leather strap passing under the belly is fastened to the forepart of the sledge which serves instead of shafts  the lapland sledge a the leather strap or trace by which the sledge is drawn b pieces of different colored cloth formed into a rose c the covering of the sledge made of beautiful spotted sealskin d a brass ring and looped piece of cord e green cloth with a red scalloped border f cloth g yellow cloth h a plate of brass round the backboard i cordage k a crooked piece of horn and the strap pulled through a loop of several ply of cordage   letter xxiii tornao it may be expected while i am at this place that i should say something of the inhabitants of the neighboring province of swedish finland tornao as i have informed you stands at the very head of the gulf of bothnia the eastern shore of which is inhabited by the finlanders subjects of the king of sweden the other division of finland lies further to the east and owes allegiance to the empress of russia  the finlanders which fell under our observation at and near tornao appear to be more uncouth in their figures less civilized in their manners and less intelligible in their language than their neighbors the natives of lapland like these they are low in stature but stout and active and from that temperance inseparable from their situation live to very great ages their country is of the same nature with swedish lapland abounding in mountains high and rugged with rich and fertile vales extensive and beautiful lakes many of these lakes are navigable and might be made still more so at a very trifling expense they communicate with the gulf of finland and might very easily be made the seats of a good trade ships are built here of a very large burden and ship building in this place is a trade which from the cheapness of materials might be very beneficial several french agents during the late war visited tornao to purchase tar and other naval stores this in all probability would have turned to great advantage if the suddenness of the peace had not put a stop to their transactions from this circumstance i was credibly informed they lost above a third part of their contract  at tornao there is a great annual fair frequented by the mountain laplanders and finlanders at that season they resort thither in great companies and barter furs and other commodities the produce of their country for hardware and other necessaries this fair continues a week and is considered as a sort of finland jubilee when they depart for their own mountains the arrangement of their deer and loaded pulchas or sledges makes a very singular appearance they do not travel in a mixed multitude and without order but with much regularity and method precedence is always claimed and allowed to the senior the others follow in rotation which presents to the eye a procession of deer and sledges the uncouth figures of men and utensils of various kinds and shapes extending from seven to eight or nine miles in length  the furs which are purchased by the merchants of tornao and the other finland towns are made into male and female dresses and sent to stockholm and other parts of sweden  there is no very essential difference between this country and those of the neighboring latitudes their fish fowl and wild animals are much the same though preference has sometimes been given to the finland fish the lakes though of a pacific appearance and presenting to the eye a transparent glassy surface are often turbulent and stormy so that many instances have occurred of vessels even of large burdens being shipwrecked  the religion of the inhabitants of finland like those of lapland is the lutheran but alas much is still wanting to make them real christians it would be a charitable action nay i could go farther and say that it is the duty of all the neighboring sovereigns to endeavor to inculcate the knowledge of true christianity into this yet unenlightened people they are not separated by unnavigable seas or inaccessible mountains their understandings though unimproved are not mean their tempers though rough and uncivilized are yet gentle enough to receive instruction it would be a glorious act to undertake to civilize this ferocious people i would not here be understood to mean that this is a general description of all ranks of men in this district of the globe i would confine these observations to the mountain inhabitants for the inhabitants of their large towns and other places of trade are not far behind the rest of the world in the arts of life or in the cultivation of religion  letter xxiv pithia june    the most nothern point to which our journey extended was tornao from whence i have endeavored to give you some account of the inhabitants of this country we left that place yesterday and though our accommodations were not of the most agreeable nature yet they were rendered tolerable by the civility and politeness with which we were entertained we had not traveled far before we were informed that we might have an opportunity of observing a laplander and his family who were feeding their herd of reindeer at no great distance we got out of the carriage and walked about the distance of an english mile through a very thick wood where we found their family in a tent or hut this consisted of an old man his wife a young man and his wife with a very young child probably about two months old the infant was most curiously trussed up in a cradle or machine almost resembling a fiddlecase made of the thick bark of a tree so formed that it exactly contained the babe who was fixed in it with a kind of brass chain made so portable and light that the mother might easily carry it in one hand this cradle which is also sometimes made of a hollow piece of timber like a small boat the lapland women when they travel tie with the child in it to their back the child is not covered with bed clothes but with a soft and fine moss over which they lay the tender skin of a young reindeer when they rock the child they fasten the cradle with a rope to the top of the hut and tossing it from one side to the other lull the child asleep this lapland family invited us to their tent and offered us their common and only fare which consists of deers milk and cheese made of the same milk occasionally they eat deers flesh but have no kind of bread we presented them in return for their civilities with some wine which they seemed to relish very much but gave us to understand that brandy would have been more acceptable  the laplanders are a strong featured people low in stature but so constitutionally hard as to bear the severity of the most inclement season these people are generally bornin woods and are frequently upon the snow and wanderers from their birth to their lifes end their huts are formed of pieces of timber or rafters joined together and covered with turf or the branches or bark of pine trees so that architecture here may be said to appear in its first rudiments sometimes coarse cloth makes a part of the covering of their tents in some places we were told that their houses were built upon the trunks of trees raised above the surface of the earth or upon a stone foundation to prevent in those desolate regions their being overwhelmed in the enormous drifts of snow or devoured by wild beasts  in summer the laplanders wear a close garment which reaches to the middle of their legs girded close about them with a belt they have no linen but their clothes are made in general of a coarse wool without dying their shoes and caps of the skin of the reindeer with the hair outward in winter their clothes are of skin with the hair inwards the womens apparel is not very different from that of the men  it is said that the natives of lapland are great cowards and for that reason the swedes never employ them as soldiers how unlike are these to the brave highlanders of scotland whose courage and intrepidity are as immovable as their mountains extreme cold has diminished the stature and congealed the faculties of the laplanders and the arctic tribes alone among the sons of men are ignorant of war and unconscious of human blood an happy ignorance if reason and virtue were the guardians of their peace buffon hist naturelle tom v p   in   mo gustavus adolphus attempted without success to form a regiment of laplanders grotius says of these arctic tribes arma arcus et pharetra sed adversus seras annal   iv p     and attempts after the manner of tacitus to varnish with philosophy their brutal ignorance gibbons hist vol   page     quarto    after feasting with the laplanders we pursued our journey without intermission till we arrived at vitan here though our accommodations were miserable to a great degree we took a little rest which we were in great need of this evening we arrived once more at pithia where we have been most hospitably received by the burgomaster whose politeness and civility we had before experienced  letter xxv uma june    we ordered horses at four in the morning of the   th promising ourselves some repast upon the road but no refreshment of any kind could be obtained till we arrived at sunnana about four in the afternoon the poverty of the country is beyond any thing you can conceive we slept the same night at burea the residence of dirt and famine but quitted it as expeditiously as posible  on thursday the   th we breakfasted at gumboda another seat of misery and want sir h g ls liberality of three rix dollars was here most humanely applied and gratefully received by a poor indigent boor who had reared a family of seven children with hardly any other subsistence than the bark of the fir tree the sight of such a sum and the possession of it also almost overcame the poor man his meagre pensive and melancholy visage soon brightened up and changed to joy and gladness thousands of his countrymen are in the same miserable situation  in the course of our journey this day after we had passed gumboda we received an invitation to dine with the dean of bogde our empty stomachs could by no means refuse so well timed an invitation we were received at the door by the dean and his lady the dean was a portly good looking elderly gentleman his lady young and rather handsome  after some little formal ceremony we were ushered into a very handsome apartment and set down to what we were now quite strangers to a good dinner the dean speaking neither french nor english accosted us in latin sir harry being the best linguist found out two phrases which were of great use to us bonum vinum and pone circum these though a little out of the deans depth he soon was made to understand and we profited by his knowledge  after coffee and many expressions of thanks to our hospitable dean and his lady for their unbounded civility we took our departure and arrived at uma this evening in our way we passed through a small but pleasant town called ojebyn which was the native place of the celebrated doctor solander his mother we were informed is still living in that place  letter xxvi sunval july   we left uma early on the morning of the  0th but were detained at dejecnaboda four hours for want of horses having crossed many rivers and met with various impediments we did not arrive at the town of anskt till near ten oclock where we intended to take a little refreshment but were obliged to content ourselves with very short commons here also we proposed sleeping bnt alas the want of beds obliged us to travel for the rest of the night  the next day about noon we arrived at veda with a strong inclination to dine but were much disappointed famine and dirt having got a prior possession of that place our mortification was not a little increased by being detained with such disagreeable companions we attempted to cross a very large lake in a small boat but were not able from the inactivity or inexperience of the watermen who were afraid to take charge of the carriage the wind blowing rather strong ferry boats of a large burden not being used here we were obliged to lash two small boats together by which means though with no small difficulty the carriage got safe over but our distresses did not cease here either through the wilful negligence of the boors or indolence of our host no horses could be procured for seven hours this indeed was a further and unexpected intrusion on the small remnant of patience we had left but time the surmounter of all difficulties at length released us and brought us to the town of hernosand a beautiful well built seaport of much traffic here indeed we fared sumtuously which produced i fear for the first time a grateful thanksgiving for what we were going to receive etc great and due commendations i must bestow on the inn and our host in particular every thing being neat clean and good of its kind the first and only compliment i have hitherto had in my power to pay to a swedish publican  after a short stay at hernosand we pursued our journey toward sunval where we arrived very late on the  d of july having so many rivers to cross and to travel over a mountainous country we found were great impediments to expedition a very great drought had prevailed for many weeks and we suffered much inconvenience from the heat but this evening a fine refreshing rain seasonably relieved us while we were sitting at supper this evening we were agreeably entertained by some shepherdesses who played upon a kind of long trumpet made of the bark of the birchtree called in the swedish language lur this musical instrument is sometimes four yards in length has a strong and sharp sound and in calm weather can be heard at the distance of four or five miles it is generally used by the shepherds in the woods and mountains and employed by them with much success in frightening away wild animals  letter xxvii igsund   july we set out early in the morning from sunval and arrived the same evening at igsund where we had been so hospitably entertained on our road to tornao the same gentleman politely received us again and we slept at his house  from the neighborhood of this place were the two lapland girls taken who are intended by sir h g l to be sent to england to fulfill a particular engagement which he had made as it is my intention afterward to write you a full account of these females i shall pass over the subject at present it will then be in my power to inform you how they performed their journey and voyage how they were received and treated in england and by what means they returned to their native country certain it is we had no difficulty in persuading them to undertake this enterprise they immediately accepted our offers and relied with the greatest confidence on our professions as their minds were entirely uncorrupted by the influence of foreign intercourse as they had never traveled beyond their native mountains as their return was at least uncertain it is very remarkable that they should so easily be prevailed upon to leave their friends and connexions their huts and their flocks to undertake a dangerous or at least a tedious journey and voyage to visit a country of which they were ignorant and reside among a people whose manners and customs they could not know this probably may in some measure be accounted for from the poverty of their own country yet still we find in the history of the human race an inclination deeply rooted and strong toward our native home there is something in the very word home that fills us with inexpressible affection and if according to the old english maxim it be ever so homely still our wants and our wishes center there  from these thoughts my friend you will conclude that my reflections at this moment are turned upon poor old england they are indeed and while i am viewing these bleak mountains and barren heaths while i turn my eyes upon a large extent of sandy deserts or immeasurable woods i cannot forbear casting one sigh toward a snug retreat amidst the cleveland hills or the rich plains of the bishopric of durham  variety however renders all situations agreeable it will be some pleasure to me to reflect that i have been in lapland nor can any one describe the comfort arising from a good dinner and a bottle of honest port so well as he who has been in want of both such therefore are the consolations that may be drawn from the variety of circumstances with which this world abounds such i suppose were the expectations of the lapland girls when they agreed to accompany us to england  as our time is not always at our own disposal as we are sometimes governed by winds and waves sometimes by postboys and posthorses you must forgive me if my letters do not always reach a reasonable length but believe me whether in england or in lapland whether writing on giltedged paper or on a scrap torn from your own letters still i remain faithfully yours  letter xxviii avestadt   july the gentleman whose politeness i have before remarked and at whose house we were so hospitably entertained at igsund proposed a fishing party on the morning of the fourth on the lake which is contiguous to his house his son was so obliging as to make one of our company and do his utmost endeavors to entertain us the scheme however though well intended did not answer our expectations of pleasure our sport was not good and therefore we exchanged our entertainment on the water for a good dinner with our hospitable host  in the afternoon with many expressions of thanks we took our leave and continued our journey we did not halt till we came to gefle near one hundred miles distant from igsund by disappointments in procuring horses and other impediments we did not arrive there till the next morning at ten oclock after so long and fatiguing a journey you may imagine we were greatly in want of rest therefore after taking some refreshment we retired to bed and slept till four in the afternoon then dined and set forwards again a little before one in the morning  we arrived at faulund a town in the province of dalarna remarkable for a great copper mine about nine oclock at night after having been confined to our carriage about twentyeight hours without any sort of provision whatever and encountering our usual difficulties with respect to posthorses the indolence and unconcern of the inhabitants and people of this place surpass all conception after a tedious and tiresome journey we naturally hoped and looked for some refreshment especially in so large a town but our expectations were there defeated by a succession of additional grievances such as the want of food a dirty house a drunken landlord with many other circumstances equally comfortless and disagreeable  the town of faulund is a large and undoubtedly an opulent town on account of the circulation of money that must naturally accrue from the carrying on so immense and extensive a work these copper works are undoubtedly worth the travellers inspection the impositions we met with in faulund and the many delays upon the road from the wilful obstinacy and incivility of the people urged us to the disagreeable necessity of making a formal complaint against them to the burgomaster as also to the commandant sir h g l showed a very proper and necessary spirit upon this occasion  on the  th we arrived at avestadt where there is a curious copper work and also the kings mint for coining copper money the variety of purifications which that metal undergoes as well as the various processes before it comes to the mint are well worth observation the governor of the mint paid us much attention giving us an invitation to his house and treating us with strong beer a rare and uncommon beverage in that country at this place we met the spanish and dutch ambassadors on a tour through that country with a very inconsiderable retinue  letter xxix upsala july   we arrived at sahla between two and three oclock on the morning of the  th of july near this town there is a considerable silver mine the ore from which the metal is extracted resembles the lead ore in england indeed many of the english lead mines yield a large quantity of silver as we are only birds of passage i had no opportunity of examining the manner of working these mines neither can i give you any account of their produce we were told that the mine we passed near this place is about two hundred and twenty six fathoms in depth  in the last division of our journey we did not travel over inhospitable deserts as before neither through woods of immeasurable length but through a fine rich cultivated country in short the whole of the road from fauland to upsala was pleasant and agreeable the tillageground appeared to be well wrought and clear of weeds and to my surprise was judiciously trenched the grain principally cultivated was rye with a little barley and some wheat the province of agriculture is not altogether entrusted to men as in england women here bear their part and handle the plough which on that account is made very light and small  in the afternoon we arrived once more at upsala and lost no time in viewing this ancient city and university this has been a place of eminence from the earliest times of the swedish history all the kings of sweden before the reformation were crowned and buried here and here queen christina resigned her crown in the year      the celebrity of this place indeed in the times of popery was owing not so much perhaps to its being the place of the residence of their kings as of the archbishop for the archbishops of upsala frequently made a greater figure than the kings themselves and deposed them according to their own power and interest  the city of upsala is situated upon the banks of the river sala which falls into the lake encopen and is about thirty miles north west from stockholm there is an old castle here built and fortified after the gothic manner which stands high and commands the whole city in former days this fortress was a place of great importance there are many excellent paintings medals and other curiosities in the possession of the university though upsala has been for many centuries a place of eminence yet the university was not founded till      when pope sixtus quartus gave it all the privileges of the university of bononia king gustavus adolphus was a great patron of learning throughout all his dominions and amongst others was very liberal to this place he endowed professorships in most sciences with tolerable salaries these received an augmentation from the piety and munificence of his daughter the celebrated christina whose protection of learned men and encouragement to every branch of science is deservedly extolled this princess was the patroness of the learned grotius whom she called to sweden made him one of her counselors and sent him ambassador to lewis xiii after he had discharged the duties of his employment he set out from france to give an account of his embassy to his royal mistress he met queen christina at stockholm and after he had discoursed with her about the affairs he had been entrusted with he most humbly begged of her to grant him his dismission this he had much difficulty to obtain though this princess gave him several marks of her great esteem for him she invited cartesius to sweden and was never more happy than in the promotion of piety and learning so long as upsala is remembered linnaeus whom i have once before mentioned will not be forgotten the king himself bore testimony to his merits in a public speech which he made soon after the death of that truly celebrated man  i must not forget to mention the venerable cathedral at this place in which lie entombed the ancient kings of sweden this is a very magnificent structure in it is an excellent organ very beautifully ornamented there is also a clock very justly mentioned by all historians of upsala as a particular curiosity it shows not only the day hour and minute but also the remarkable motions of the heavenly bodies and besides these it tells every festival whether fixed or moveable with many other singularly curious operations near the altar the remains of king eric stand enclosed in a silver gilt box where they have rested quietly and undisturbed upwards of three hundred years tradition says he was slain by the danes in a battle upon a sunday the enemy approached upsala when the king was at his devotions in the cathedral he would not move till the service was over when he found the greatest part of the city in the hands of the enemy he made an assault and though he sell his people were victorious  letter xxx stockholm  0 july yesterday about six in the morning we reentered the metropolis of sweden not a little rejoiced to find ourselves once more in a civilized country our first care was to enjoy some of those comforts we had been so long deprived of a refreshing sleep with clean sheets were charms not to be resisted you will not therefore be surprised that we indulged most of that day in bed in the afternoon as it was sunday we attended divine service in the kings chapel but could not expect much edification from our ignorance of the language the preacher seemed very much animated in the delivery of his sermon which continued almost an hour  our continuance at stockholm lays us under great obligations to sir thomas wroughton who has given orders to his secretary to attend us upon several excursions particularly to drottingholm palace which is well worth the strangers notice we passed the lake meller in the admirals barge which sir thomas had procured us for the occasion this palace is a stately fabric situated on the banks of the lake meller the gardens though extensive did not impress us with the idea of royalty they are very much neglected and laid out in the dutch taste which began to prevail in england in the time of king william i must own i was equally disappointed in the paintings though i pretend not to be any great connoisseur myself in this agreeable art yet i could discern that they were more adapted to an attic story or lumber garret than to be used as the ornamental decorations of a royal palace  there is at this place a very curious collection of antiquities by the late queen dowager particularly from the ruins of herculaneum with other roman curiosities there is also a well collected library which does the royal foundress much credit this palace is the favorite summer residence of his present majesty i was therefore the more astonished to see so little attention paid to render it neat and comfortable  letter xxxi stockholm the city of stockholm though at present the metropolis of the kingdom of sweden was not many centuries ago a place of no great importance indeed we are told that not much above three hundred years since it was only an island with two or three cottages for fishermen but upon building a castle here to watch the motions of their russian neighbors and afterward the court making this a place of residence it was raised by degrees to its present state of prosperity this castle was burnt down about a century ago but has been rebuilt in a more magnificent manner  the city at present extends itself over six islands which are connected together by bridges with very extensive suburbs the rocks particularly toward the sea form a sort of natural fortification the harbor is very large and commodious and will contain one thousand sail of ships but with all its conveniences as a harbor the utility of its situation is diminished from the difficulty of communication with the sea the lake meller falls from it into the baltic but the passage having so many windings and the circumstance of there being no tides to assist the navigation of the ships renders it very difficult of access and if to this we add that for four months at least in every year they are frozen up these circumstances will be found great impediments to commerce the population of the capital of sweden is reckoned at about one hundred thousand souls the castle which is used as an arsenal as well as for the lodgings of the officers is a large building and covered with copper as several buildings are in stockholm from the many coppermines with which this country abounds  i am unable to inform you of the exact produce of the copper and iron mines of sweden doubtless it must be very large both to the proprietors and the king who receives about a fourth part yet notwithstanding the large income of the crown it is by no means equal to the annual expenses of the government  the market which is held at stockholm is a circumstance i must not omit the butchermeat is sold in shambles on the shore while vegetables and other marketable commodities are exposed to sale in boats upon the water this is at once a singular and pleasing sight the moving shops and variety of wares that are passing before your eyes the busy mixed multitude which crowd the surface of the water render this a very agreeable scene something of this kind may be seen in the thames upon the arrival of a large fleet in the pool  in stockholm as in other cold countries the custom of drinking spirits prevails rather too much even ladies who by no means deserve an improper epithet comply with this pernicious custom it is usual in this country previous to dinner for the company to assemble round the sideboard and to regale themselves with bread butter cheese or any thing of that nature which preface is regularly followed in both sexes by a bumper of brandy this custom in the fair sex reminds me of a set of rules which i have seen for the regulation of a russian assembly it concludes with this remarkable injunction  n b ladies are not to be drunk before ten oclock  i had occasion in a former letter to mention the distilleries of this kingdom i cannot omit though a circumstance i never before heard of to inform you that grain is not the only ingredient used in sweden for the distilling of spirits the low priced brandies are made from rye and ants a species of insect very plentiful in this country upon enquiry i find that ants supply a resin an oil and an acid which have been deemed of considerable service in the art of physic see cyclopaedia word ant the ant used upon these occasions is a remarkably large black insect commonly found in small round hills at the bottom of the fir tree it is less to be wondered that they should use these insects in their distilleries than that they should eat them and consider them as highly palatable and pleasant as i was walking with a young gentleman in a wood near gottenburg i observed him sit down upon one of these living hills which from the nature of its inhabitants i should rather have avoided and begin with some degree of keenness to devour these insects first nipping off their heads and wings the slavour he declared was of the finest acid rather resembling that of a lemon my young friend entreated me much to follow his example but i could not overcome the antipathy which i felt to such a kind of food  letter xxxii stockholm when i left this place a month ago i promised on my return to lay before you such reflections as might happen to occur i shall therefore like a man of my word proceed to fulfill that promise and as dogberry says in the play bestow all my tediousness upon you  i have passed so large a tract of country during the last few weeks that you will naturally expect to hear something of the agriculture of sweden if the knowledge of agriculture could be learned or by any means attained by the swedish peasants and the large and almost unlimmited tracts of ground be unincumbered of wood which i have no doubt might be effected by time and industry what a blessed change might be wrought in the sace of this country the quality of the soil appears in general no way inferior to ours in england there is no reason therefore to suppose but that the common method of english husbandry would equally promote and produce the like vegetation in sweden  one day when we were at dinner with sir thomas wroughton where agriculture and improvements were the topic of conversation i could not help regretting that so very large a tract of improvable ground as i had lately passed over should be suffered to continue in so rude and uncultivated a state which by the hand of the industrious ploughman might become rich and fertile it is too true replied a swedish gentleman present but indolence and inactivity are the constitutional failings of my countrymen and may probably be ascribed to the severity of the climate in which we live we enjoy no mediocrity of season there is here no spring or natural progressive warmth to introduce summer neither any autumn or gradual decrease of heat which might temper the habit against so sudden a transition to an inclement winter each season from its intenseness deprives the body of its proper and necessary exertion this produces inability and habitual indolence but though the productions of this country are comparatively so very insignificant yet are they more speedy in their growth than perhaps any other part of the world the sun is eighteen hours and a half above the horizon for some weeks this in a great measure excludes night and the heat of the sun multiplies in proportion to its duration  letter xxxiii stockholm architecture as well as other arts and sciences is at this day in sweden at least a century behind england i must not however omit observing their method of building bridges over their broadest and deepest rivers several of which we passed in our excursion to the northern parts of this kingdom they are undoubtedly tremendous to the stranger who might imagine with some kind of dread that instead of measuring the breadth of the waters he is about to cross he would first be obliged to sathom the depth they have no quay or wall on either side of the river on which to form a basis for such a building it is therefore curiously and well constructed in this manner the thickest end of a thick piece of timber the length and shape of the mast of a large ship is fastened to the rock or mountain the other end extended on the water a second timber of the same length is placed upon it extending a fathom beyond it and so a third and sourth to the middle of the stream where it meets with another series of timbermasts from the opposite side and this without any cement but merely resting upon each other so that in passing this as it were floating bridge the elasticity is sometimes so great that about the middle it appears to swing and the weight of either horse or carriage dips it under the surface of the water a circustance so tremendous and apparently dangerous that a person unaccustomed to such bridges may well imagine that it will rise no more i have frequently seen travelers stop and water their horses on the middle of the bridge when they already touch the water from the subsiding of the platform when freed from the weight of the carriage or passenger it immediately rises to its proper height  were it not for the intense cold and drifted snow a passage over the rivers and lakes in winter would be as much more commodious for the traveller as it is for the business and intercourse of the inhabitants who are safely conveyed over the ice in sledges at the rate of fifteen english miles an hour  i have often observed in this country though in so high a northern latitude especially near towns without even the benefit of manure a rich natural herbage from whence it is obvious that grass and tillage dont delight both in the same climate as there is often very little corn and that of a very inferior quality where grass is both plentiful and luxuriant as for the esculent productions of gardens these they have neither taste nor industry for nor even curiosity to promote except indeed a kind of turnip which is useful in their soups tobacco and flax which i have observed in small quantities near huts and cottages this i think is the utmost extent of their improvements in agriculture  letter xxxiv stockholm in the northern parts of sweden fruit trees seldom or ever arrive at any degree of perfection but the inexhaustible forests liberally compensate that defect even the most barren mountains are singularly productive of trees more particularly of the pine tree which will shoot from the smallest fissures of the rocks and thrive much better than when carefully planted in a good soil the firtree thrives best in an independent situation if i may be allowed the expression when the seeds are scattered abroad by the keen northern blast this is the easiest method of propagating this tree and the most likely way to make it flourish collect the cones which contain the seed hang them up till perfectly dry then commit the seed which is small and light to the spontaneous distribution of the wind there is a peculiar moss adherent to those trees which in winter and the deepest snows is a natural provender to the reindeer its quality is of the same nature with that which grows upon the rocks on the barren summits of the mountains for this reason when the snow is impenetrably frozen in the severe winter the boors are obliged to cut down some thousands of those mosscloathed trees for the sustenence of their herds  letter xxxv stockholm in the citadel we were shown a set of small ordnance which belonged to king charles xii consisting of four and twenty brass cannon mounted on their carriages very early in life before his love of destruction had occasioned so many wild adventures he used to amuse himself with firing at objects with this artillery probably it would have been happier for him as well as his country if he had been always thus innocently employed general stenbork was the princes instructor in this science he had discovered several improvements in the art of gunnery and got this set of brass cannon cast to illustrate his principles to his royal pupil for whom he intended them as a present  there is an anecdote related of this prince which happened at the time of his receiving this present as it in some measure had an influence on his future conduct toward the ladies i will tell it you without however vouching for its authenticity very early the next morning after he had received this present before it was light he waited privately upon the general after much knocking the door was opened by a maid servant and in a few moments the royal visitor was at the bedside of the general after returning thanks for so acceptable a present and a long discourse on the generals new plan of sending a cannon ball to its greatest distance he took his leave and was lighted down stairs by the same maid servant that introduced him  though unaccustomed to acts of gallantry and always upon his guard against excesses of this kind yet for once charles was surprised by an amourous inclination observing the attendant to be a young and handsome girl he attempted to take some liberties with her which were not agreeable being a native of dahlarna and not knowing or pretending not to know the prince she gave him an hearty box on the ear from this time it is said e took a dislike to the fairsex it is certain that he never afterward sought their society even the beautiful lady koningsmark who was reckoned the handsomest woman of that time could never make any impression upon his heart when this lady found herself slighted by him she left the kingdom and became mistress to the king of poland  from that time they never met but once when that was i think i will inform you as i am now in the humor for telling a story at the time king charles xii laid siege to warsaw he with very few attendants left the camp and rode privately to the city to see an opera which was to be represented that evening the subject probably had attracted him and he did not always consider the consequences of a rash action this was the representation of a battle between the polish and swedish armies the former of which upon this occasion was certain of success at the end of the mockfight one of the swedish officers exclaimed we are undone now the king replied let the poles obtain the battle on the stage but the swedes in the field his voice was heard by lady koningsmark who knew him at once and with great anxiety dispatched a page to apprize him of his danger when the king received the message he looked toward the lady who immediately fainted the king and his attendants took the hint which had been so kindly given them and returned to the camp before the poles gained the least intelligence that that august person had been present in the very heart of their city as an humble spectator of the defeat of himself and his army  letter xxxvi nordkoping we left stockholm on the evening of the   th and slept at sodertelge a small town two stages from the metropolis the next morning our road lay through a very fine sertile country with large luxuriant fields of corn and other tillage they were making hay in the meadows which seemed to yield very plentiful crops the roads in general are not unlike those of lapland passing through very extensive forests over rocks and steep hills we were much delayed by the kings retinue which was then upon the road all the posthorses etc were engaged for their conveyance which prevented our arrival at nordkoping till two in the morning  this is one of the largest and best built towns in the swedish dominions pleasantly situated on the banks of a beautiful lake notwithstanding which it could not so much as afford either tolerable provision or any comfortable accommodation happy were we to find beds though bad ones to these we retired like philosophers with the old proverb in our mouths what cannot be cured etc we took our departure so early the next morning from the famous town of nordkoping that i lamented much that we were not able to examine it with more attention as what i saw in passing through appeared truly beautiful  it stands upon a large space of ground a beautiful river runs through the middle of it though not navigable yet it has a commercial appearance upon enquiry i found it was not remarkable for trade or any particular manufactory there are many shops and neat well built houses the streets are spacious and regular but like the rest of the swedish towns it is illpaved the churches are lofty and magnificent  after passing through the town which took up some time we entered a most delightful country and were agreeably surprised to find prospects around us which brought to our remembrance old england we were treated with many noble views not inferior to those of richmond or windsor large fields of luxuriant corn hills richly clothed with lofty trees especially oaks of an uncommon size the beautiful and large lake wetter along the side of which we traveled extends itself for several miles with many pleasant villages on its banks there is in the center of this lake an island fourteen or fifteen miles long which forms one complete parish and is a most delightful place of residence this night we spent at nordkoping from whence i write  letter xxxvii on the  0th we continued our journey through a fine country with delightful views for near five swedish miles after which we entered woods with a swampy country on each side our delays have been so frequent for want of horses that we have been obliged to travel incessantly night and day and to complete our distresses frequently have not been able to procure any refreshment we were not so provident as other travelers who are acquainted with the miseries of such a country as this and carry their provision along with them the next day we passed through extensive woods which continued for many miles the oaks in particular seemed to be remarkably fine and of much antiquity it is somewhat extraordinary that they are not converted to some useful purpose as every oak in sweden is the property of the king whose poverty frequently demands assistance from his subjects  as many travelers were at this time upon the road the provisions which at the best are but scanty were all consumed before our arrival at the several stages so that from six on friday morning the   st we traveled till saturday morning without food or sleep except a very small portion accidentally met with of hard salt swedish beef delicious morsel and of great relief after so long a fast our additional troubles were as usual want of horses as well as want of beds  about eleven in the morning of saturday the  d we arrived at helsingborg a pretty town garrisoned by swedish huzzars and situated on the side of the narrow straight known by the name of the sound on the coast opposite elsinore there is a small sortified castle at this place in which as i was informed there is a dungeon an hundred and seventy five feet deep in this dismal prison many of the danish nobility were confined and numbers of them suffered to perish during the long and destructive wars between those neighboring kingdoms  the governor very politely waited upon us and gave us an invitation to his house which time would not permit us to accept after some small refreshment we embarked for denmark in a small vessel crossed the sound and landed at elsinore a place of trade and garrisoned  there was much superfluous trouble and parade in examining our passport as well as baggage the magnificent castle of cronenburg stands alone by the sea to guard the passage it will excite a sigh in the breast of an englishman when he views this castle to reflect that here was confined a few years ago the sister of his sovereign matilda the unfortunate queen of denmark it is now inhabited by the queen dowager of denmark who generally makes it the place of her summer residence the passage of the sound is about three miles in a direct line between the opposite shores of sweden and denmark all vessels that sail up and down the baltic pay a toll at this place to the king of denmark and lower their topsails as they pass the castle of cronenburg this tribute is not so much paid from any fear of the cannon of this fortress as from immemorial custom and the general law of nations  having some letters of recommendation to mr fenwick the consuls brother we dined with him and immediately after set out for copenhagen where we arrived at nine that night we experienced much inconvenience again and trouble in entering the town undergoing a most strict search by officers both civil and military  letter xxxviii copenhagen the road from elsinore for near five miles is exceedingly rough and illmade though the best materials are to be found within half a mile when you come from the sea coast to what is called the kings road it is remarkably broad and well made but is in great want of that fine gravel which is a most excellent covering to the swedish roads upon your entering the great road the eye seldom or never wants entertainment till you arrive at copenhagen the distant and nearer views are equally amusing the country is rich fertile and luxuriantly embellished with villages delightful gardens teadrinking places etc copenhagen is a handsome well built town and notwithstanding its disadvantageous situation which is in a flat marshy country yet is there a magnificent appearance in most of the structures the kings palace especially has a distinguishing royalty which strikes the strangers eye their churches are neat and not quite so gaudily decorated as those of the swedes the women are fair well made and not unlike the english not far from copenhagen is an island called amak inhabited by a singular people originally dutch but now living under the danish government they were placed here by elizabeth wise of christian ii and sister of the emperor charles v for the purpose of supplying her with vegetables and country fare they wear one uniform of coarse black cloth the habits of the women are of the same color with caps of uncommon form and most curiously plaited they pay a tax to the king for that peculiarity of dress though it is of their own manufactory they are a most laborious industrious and useful set of people indefatigable in the culture of gardens on which they principally depend for support they appear and wish to be thought poor but from their industry have become an independent people  the manners and customs of the danes differ much from their neighbors though separated only by the sound denmark greatly exceeds sweden in the cultivation of land their breed of horses which are of the holstein kind and in many other advantages which they enjoy yet i am told by very good authority the consul of elsinore that they are obliged to the swedes for the greatest part of their cattle which they privately smuggle this is very extraordinary and could hardly be credited from the appearonce of each country these two near neighbors like other contiguous states cordially hate each other they avoid all kind of intercourse except when interest interferes that they pay as much attention to as any hollander whatever the danes in general seem of a phlegmatic constitution and are very obstinate a quality which we fully experienced in our posting through that country the driver indeed is not so much to be blamed as he has the sanction of the police to travel only at the rate of five miles an hour but a worse privilege is that of stopping where and when he pleases so that you are totally at the mercy of an obstinate drone whom nothing can enliven but the touch of a danish ducat the king is now disqualified from holding the reins of government that power is for the most part invested in the young prince and council the prince of denmark is much and deservedly respected by his people he conducts himself with great affability and judgment his chief amusements and those in which he takes great pleasure are military maneuvres neither is literature without a share in the attention of this amiable character no small part of his own private fortune is destined to the promotion of learning and the encouragement of learned men this is a singular instance in the history of nations and there is great reason to hope that the beautiful appearance of this rising sun will be succeeded by a full blaze of meridian splendour  the soldiers in general are well chosen men the officers exceedingly polite and well bred their uniforms resemble those of the english which is also the case in their discipline  letter xxxix copenhagen the king of denmark has seven different palaces but few of them affording a very royal appearance copenhagen is generally his place of winter residence fredericksburg of his summer since the prince of denmark has taken a share in the government of this kingdom the queen dowager has not been allowed to appear at court except upon public days it is said that when she complained of being obliged to reside in the castle of cronenburg her grandson replied that there had been a time when she did not think it an improper place of residence for his mother  the city of copenhagen is intersected by canals so that merchandise can be brought to the doors of the warehouses commerce flourishes here exceedingly and the harbor which is a good one is generally well filled with ships  the reformed religion of luther is the religion of the state they are very punctual in the performance of all religious duties and attend public worship with uncommon strictness and assiduity the churches are kept open at particular times and a clergyman constantly in waiting to administer the sacrament to the sick to give comfort to the afflicted or perform any of the other duties of his function the clergy preach extempore and lead very exemplary lives their whole dependence and support are in the hands of government of course they often act with too much servility and pay too much submission to the court they are held in high veneration by the common people over whom they sometimes exercise too great an authority  the danes are very strict in their police and act with great severity against all those who are guilty of frauds or misdemeanors even the tongue that unruly member must be guarded with great care for they will not suffer it to be used licentiously against the state or in any political matter murder and manslaughter are punished in denmark by decapitation burglaries and petty thefts are not common and you may walk the streets at all hours of the night or day without any molestation  agriculture would flourish better if it were better encouraged the oppression however which the farmer meets with from the owner of his lands entirely damps the spirit of improvement they succeed extremely well in the breed of horses which are a contrast to those of sweden being from sixteen to seventeen hands high  literature flourishes at copenhagen there is a very good and well endowed university as well as an academy of sciences i must not omit to mention the observatory or round tower which was built by the order of christian iv who laid the first stone himself in      it was finished in      and called uraniburg being built instead of that of the same name belonging to the celebrated astronomer tycho brahe in the isle of hun which was demolished in his reign the top of this tower is flat surrounded with iron rails the ascent to it is fifteen foot broad and so easy that it is not exaggeration to say that a coach may go up it the danes called it stelleburg from the use for which it was intended there is a museum here containing many curiosities both of nature and art  the government of denmark is an hereditary monarchy its military establishment about forty thousand men the laws of this kingdom deserve the admiration and imitation of all other states they are contained in one volume of no great bulk and are easily understood by the very meanest of the people justice here is of a very summary nature a mans fortune can neither be diminished nor his heart broken by a tedious lawsuit the determination of no suit however great its importance can be protracted beyond one year and a month for this reason the number of lawyers in this country is but small there are three courts in denmark the city or town court from whence there lies an appeal to the county and from that to the high court in copenhagen where the king is supposed to preside there is one circumstance however attending this from which a free people cannot but revolt that is the king or his counselors can alter or explain any matter of dispute according to his or their pleasure better therefore is it to be subject to all the prolixity as well as perplexity of law than to have our property and persons dependent on the nod of perhaps a capricious tyrant or interested judges  the nobility though they resigned their power to the crown still exercise great authority over the peasantry whom they keep in a state of vassalage it were to be wished that this species of oppression might be entirely exploded in all the kingdoms of the continent as it is in our own the cultivators of land would then rise to a proper importance in the scale of subjects then would they feel their consequence agriculture would be pursued with diligence and their toil would be crowned with success  letter xl after leaving the danish territories which we did on the   th we landed at helsingborg being now once more on swedish ground and no longer subject to the tedious obstinacy of danish postboys we used our utmost exertions to reach gottenburg which we accomplished on saturday the   th which completed our travels by land after a journey of three thousand seven hundred and eighty four miles the greater part of which was over a barren unfrequented tract of country no little reason had we to rejoice and be thankful considering the many difficulties we had both experienced and surmounted when we found ourselves once more placed in a land of hospitality and comfort without having had a visitation of sickness or any other material cause of regret  from saturday the   th of july to the   th of august we were wind bound at gottenburg during which time we experienced a repetition of civilities from our most hospitable friends there on the   th of august we reembarked on board the gottenburgmerchant captain fothergill weighed anchor at nine in the morning and dropped down the river but for want of a fair wind we were obliged to anchor above the castle the next day the wind coming favorable we got under way put to sea with a fine breeze and continued our course with a fresh gale the weather being hazy we did not fall in with the english land till thursday morning about twelve when we made tynmouth castle and got into shields about six set off for ravensworth where we arrived at ten that night  thus my friend i have brought you back to the point from whence we at first set out i ought here to thank you for the patience with which you have attended to my tedious recital if i have not added much to the stock of information you must not be disappointed as you may remember i did not promise a great deal when we set forward with respect to myself the journey has answered all my expectations it has opened a new scene and given a variety to prospects which before i could enjoy only in idea  we have beheld human nature under her rudest appearances we have seen her in a state very different from that which appears in cities or at courts and have been enabled to draw conclusions from the varieties of life pleasure too has not been wanting in our excursion prospects pleasing and romantic the roaring cataract and high projecting cliff the large and beautiful lakes the mountains stretching to the clouds and the extensive forests like the shifting scenes in a theater appeared in an agreeable succession before our eyes and if we have sometimes encountered dangers and been deprived of comforts the lesson we have been taught by this excursion is always to be contented with such enjoyments as we actually possess  end of the tour sighre and aniea lapland women brought to england by for henry george liddell bart appendix letter xli i made you a promise that before i concluded my correspondence i would send you some account of the two female adventurers that accompanied us from lapland it is now my intention to give you that intelligence the motives which induced sir h g l to bring them so very far from their native home are sufficiently known his humanity and particular attention to them when in england his great care that they should meet with no accident in their return and the comparative opulence with which he sent them back to their native mountains do credit to that heart which planned the whole journey many unfair and uncharitable censures i know have been thrown upon these innocent laplanders the voice of busy rumor is not often silent upon such subjects an easy constitutional temper joined to good health and good spirits is very apt to be misinterpreted by the morose and censorious that this was the only foundation for any reflections upon the lapland girls i dare venture to affirm it is therefore cruel malevolence to attempt to depreciate innocence from mere suspicion  we first met with our two female travelers at igsund a small town the property of clas grill knight of the order of vasa and chief director of the swedish east india company their names are sigree and anea and they are natives of jockmo lapmark with respect to their persons they are low in stature with broad features like the rest of their countrywomen we must not however measure the beauty of a laplander by the standard of other countries custom in many respects answers the purpose of a more perfect model and there is no doubt but a laplander or a negro would prefer the substantial beauties of the one or the sable charms of the other to the alabaster skin or glowing tints of the most celebrated english belle that you may have some idea however both of their likeness dress and persons a drawing taken in england will accompany this letter  we had no great difficulty in persuading them to take this journey they seemed so satisfied that our intentions were good and relied so entirely upon the promise of sir h g l that he would send them safely back again to their friends and country that they made very little opposition to his proposals in all probability the poverty of these females joined to an enterprizing spirit occasioned their easy acquiescence they thought that if they returned at all a circumstance they saw no room to doubt they would not return in the same state of indigence in which they then were  it is more surprising that their parents should consent to their undertaking this arduous journey they did so without any bribe or any other consideration than the faithful promise of our baronet they dropped indeed some natural tears but wiped them soon from igsund they accompanied their children a part of their journey then took an affectionate leave and returned home how extraordinary was the confidence of these old people nothing but the idea that their daughters would return laden with opulence probably could have tempted them to have parted from them though even this is not apparent as they were not so mercenary as to expect to be bribed into their consent will it be allowed me to reason from hence that the nearer we approach to a state of nature the less the human mind is subject to suspicions there are philosophers that would pursue this idea through all its windings but as i pretend not to so exalted a character i shall after having started the game suffer you to pursue it according to your own pleasure  when our lapland female friends had determined to undertake the journey among other questions they desired to know whether there were any churches in england i know not what idea they could have formed of this country probably they imagined that it was something like their own and that the inhabitants consisted partly of professors of the reformed religion and partly of pagans or of those who profess no religion at all how far such an idea would have been consistent with truth i shall not take upon me to determine the lapland girls however were not without their sentiments of religion and before they left their own country applied to their minister for a certificate of their fidelity to their own church  the female laplanders with three more as companions walked on foot with the five reindeer near six hundred miles by land before they reached gottenburg where we met them and embarked altogether for england  you will excuse me if i digress for one moment on the subject of these reindeer these animals since their arrival in england have bred and are likely to become very prolific monsieur buffon and other naturalists have affirmed that they will never thrive or breed in any country but lapland the experiment which has been made upon this occasion will effectually confute this idea few indeed have had the same advantages in making it as sir henry george liddell as few can have that convenience and ground for them to walk on that he has at eslingtoncastle one of his countryseats situated in the northern part of the county of northumberland upon the estate there are several large fir plantations besides very extensive moors abounding in white moss a sort of food they are particularly fond of notwithstanding they will eat good grass or fog from their present appearance there seems no doubt but that they will become very numerous and amply repay sir h g l for his great expense in bringing them to england  the female laplanders were received in this country as great curiosities and visited by all ranks of people and probably they were as curious to see others as others were to see them i have before told you that they were lively and cheerful i may add also that they were graceful and unaffected the natural habits and constitutions of these two females were truly amiable their tempers steady and unvariable their happy disposition pictured in their faces besides they were particularly easy in their address especially sigree so much so that instead of their lapland mountains you would have imagined their education had been in the drawing room this observation has been frequently made by lady l whose natural ease and politeness give the greatest weight to her opinion  it is some satisfaction too to reflect that during their stay in england they lost none of those natural accomplishments which they brought along with them though introduced to people of distinction they lost none of their modesty and humility though distant from their native country and possibly uncertain of their return they lost none of their liveliness  the time came when they were to return and the same friend who brought them into this country was particularly anxious that they should meet with no accidents in returning they reembarked in the same ship that brought them and we know for certain that they safely reached their native land after an absence of several months when our lapland female adventurers returned to their native country we were informed by a correspondent from sweden that their appearance in that kingdom and in the city of stockholm was not less attended to as a novelty than when they first arrived in england the curiosity of the swedes was great and their interogatories many concerning the reception they met with in england to all these questions they were able to give the most satisfactory answers their apparel and their little stock of riches testified the manner in which they had been treated and they themselves expressed the most grateful regard to the hospitality of ravensworthcastle and the liberal favors they had received from its worthy owners  when the king of swedens brother heard of their arrival at stockholm he expressed a desire to see them they were accordingly ushered into his presence the royal swede was very particular in enquiring into all the circumstances of their journey their replies all tended to the honor of the english nation and they did not scruple to inform him of their reluctance to leave that land of hospitality  though the untutored minds of these girls could never have been taught any of the sublime virtues or impressed with a proper sense of gratitude yet from all these circumstances it is evident that they possessed it in all its purity they lost no opportunity in england or in sweden and i doubt not afterward in lapland of gratefully acknowledging the favors of their munificent benefactor when they returned to their native huts they sound themselves possessed of wealth much superior to their neighbors for opulence entirely depends upon comparison they possessed in english coin fifty pounds which in the currency of sweden is equal to one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars silver mint or three thousand seven hundred and fifty copper mint nor was this all their riches they had besides many bountiful presents of trinkets both valuable and numerous  it is one part of the ceremony at a lapland wedding to adorn the bride with a crown ornamented with a variety of gaudy trinkets and on these occasions the most splendid baubles are generally borrowed of their more opulent neighbors in this kind of gayety and splendour our travelers excel their whole country and their english trinkets are obtained at a great price to deck out and ornament their marriage solemnities  thus have i given you a general account of our travels and of our lapland fellow travelers you will have much to pardon and i am afraid not much to commend to make up for my deficiences upon this occasion i will conclude the whole with making you this faithful promise that the next time i go to lapland i will endeavor to furnish you with a better account  finis
