a short account of the nature and use of spectacles  in which is recommended a kind of glass for spectacles preferable to any hitherto made use of for that purpose  by james ayscough optician at the great golden spectacles in ludgatestreet london  london printed in the year mdccl  a short account of the nature and use of spectacles my design in the following tract is to explain the structure of the eye and the nature of vision so far as is necessary to understand the use and advantage of spectacles the method of choosing the best sort of glasses and such as are suitable to the different defects of the eye in different persons and to recommend a kind of glass for this purpose much preferable to any that has been hitherto made use of  the nature of vision and use of spectacles will be best explained by the common experiment of the dark room or as it is usually called the camera obscura which is this in any room that is pretty much darkened let an hole be made in the windowshutter in which hole place a unequal lens or round globular glass then holding a sheet of white paper within the room at a proper distance from the hole which you will find by trials you will see on the paper the pictures of all objects before the hole both in their just proportions and in their proper colors only they will be upside down if the paper remain in the same place and in the room of the aforesaid unequal glass or lens one that is flatter be used the picture upon the white paper will then be confused but by placing a unequal spectacleglass before the lens of a due convexity the image on the paper will again be rendered distinct if a more unequal lens than the first be used the image on the paper will again be confused but may be rendered distinct by placing in this case a concave spectacleglass before the lens  this experiment exactly represents the manner of vision by the eye for the eye is of a globular or unequal form resembling the lens placed in the hole in the windowshutter the outside coat of which is called the cornea and gives the unequal shape to the aqueous or watery humor contained within it on the bottom of the eye is expanded a fine membrane called the retina which resembles the white paper mentioned in the experiment on this membrane the pictures of all external objects are formed when the pictures are formed distinct on the retina then the object appears clear and distinct if the pictures on the retina are confused then the object appears hazy and confused this account of the eye and the cause of vision is farther confirmed by these arguments that anatomists when they have taken off from the bottom of the eye that outward and thickest coat called the dura matter can then see the pictures of objects lively painted on the retina and these pictures propagated by motion along the fibers of the optic nerves into the brain are the cause of vision for according as these pictures are perfect or imperfect the object is seen perfectly or imperfectly if the eye be tinged with any color as in the disease of the jaundice so as to tinge the pictures in the bottom of the eye with that color then all objects appear tinged with the same color  from hence we shall easily see the use of spectacles for the humors of the eye decay by old age so as by shrinking to make the cornea grow flatter than before in which case the light will not be refracted enough and for want of a sufficient refraction will not converge to the bottom of the eye but to some place beyond it and by consequence will paint in the bottom of the eye a confused picture and according to the indistinctness of this picture the object will appear confused just as the image on the paper became confused when a lens flatter than just was substituted in the room of the right one  this is the reason of the decay of sight in old men and shows why their sight is mended by spectacles for the unequal glasses supply the defect of plumpness in the eye and by increasing the refractions make the rays converge sooner so as to convene distinctly at the bottom of the eye if the glass has a due degree of convexity exactly in the same manner as the defect of the too flat lens was corrected and the picture rendered distinct by placing a spectacleglass of due convexity before it  and the contrary happens in shortsighted men whose eyes are too plump for the refractions being now too great the rays converge and convene in the eyes before they come at the bottom and therefore the picture made in the bottom and the vision caused thereby will not be distinct unless the plumpness of the eye be taken off and the refraction diminished by a concave glass of a due concavity just as the confusion of the image occasioned by the use of too unequal a lens was remedied by placing a spectacleglass of a due concavity before it  this in general is the manner in which the defects of the eye are remedied by the use of glasses but these defects are neither the same in different persons of the same age nor in the same persons at different ages the defects of the eye are partly natural and partly arise from habits of looking either at very remote or very near objects in the former case we flatten the eye a little in the latter we draw it up into a more unequal form to see distinctly and by habit the eye will acquire and retain that form and will have a fixed shape either too flat or too globular for objects at a moderate distance we see this confirmed by every days experience for engravers watchmakers chasers etc by frequently forcing their eyes into too unequal a form to see minute objects very near at last have their eyes fixed in this form and become shortsighted especially if they are used to these businesses very young while the coats of the eye are tender and pliable on the contrary sailors and husbandmen by looking out for distant objects are rarely or ever shortsighted and want the assistance of unequal glasses very soon because the habit of flattening the eye to see remote objects at last fixes it in this form  from hence we may see that the defects of all persons eyes will likely alter according as they accustom themselves to such habits as may either increase or diminish these defects besides this age itself alters the form of the eye making the eyes of most persons grow flatter especially those who see well at a moderate distance when young persons naturally shortsighted seldom find any considerable alteration in the eye but when they do alter i have observed that they oftener grow more shortsighted than otherwise  since therefore the defects of the eye and the glasses proper to remedy these defects vary so much both in different persons and different ages i shall now lay down some rules by which every one may choose not only good glasses in their kind but such too as are best suited to the form and shape of their own eye every good eye has one certain distance or nearly so of seeing a common print to read with ease when the eye begins to grow too flat you will find yourself obliged to hold your book at a greater distance you may observe also that if you read write or work any long time a sort of diziness like a cobweb will appear before your eyes or if you read by a candle you find it necessary to hold the paper behind it  these are signs of the want of spectacles and whenever this appears to be the case no person should be without them for your endeavors to see what you cannot without great difficulty strains and weakens the eye and by this you receive more injury in a month or two than perhaps you otherwise would do in as many years with the assistance of such glasses as would supply that defect and render the vision distinct and easy  the next thing then to be considered is what degree of convexity is sufficient to supply this defect in order to make a proper choice hold a small print at the distance at which you was used to read distinctly when your eyes were good which with most people is about nine or ten inches then choose a pair of spectacles of such a degree of convexity as render the letters as plain as they used to appear before your sight was defective if you choose them too young i e not unequal enough they will scarce remedy the defect of the eye and you will not see distinctly unless the print is so far off that the letters will appear too small to be read if you choose them too old that is too unequal you will then be obliged to flatten the eye to compensate the over great convexity and thereby be in danger of increasing that defect which age naturally brings on  but in many curious pieces of workmanship there is an absolute necessity of viewing the object under a larger angle that the most minute parts may be observed in this case glasses of a larger convexity may be used and if the work be brought nearer to the eye its form will not be much altered but the shorter time these objects are viewed the better  for shortsighted persons the best way is to look through a concave lens at some distant object and the least concave of all the glasses through which you can see it distinctly is the best i divide all my glasses into  0 degrees marked       and so on when a person has fitted himself i set down his name with the number of the glass chosen which prevents any more trouble of trial or even going for it but such person may be supplied by sending a servant or letter unless any material alteration of the eye should happen  a person whose residence is in the country and has no opportunity of making that trial may nearly as well be fitted by the following method viz let the person take a common print and move it to the eye till he sees distinctly then measure the exact distance from the eye to the paper by sending an account of that distance to any person in the trade they may be fitted to a sufficient degree of exactness  i come now to point out the defects of the glasses themselves and the way of discovering these defects now these are either a false figure veins in the glass or the color of it and first for the figure take any common print lay it on a table then hold the spectacles in your hand at a good distance from the eye and looking through them remove them gradually from the paper till the spectacles are at the focal distance from it which in a unequal glass is somewhat nearer to the print than the point at which it begins to appear consused if the spectacles are salse the object through the middle of the glass will appear regular and distinct but through the edges distorted and confused thus if you view any cross lines which form small squares through a false ground glass the squares in the middle will appear with strait sides distinct and all of a size but those near the edges with crooked sides of a different bigness and confused so that the whole appearance will neither be like the original nor all parts of it distinct at the same distance if you view it through a true glass it will be perfectly like the original figure only bigger and distinct in every part and as you gradually remove the glass beyond the focus all parts of the object will become indistinct together  to discover the veins in unequal glasses place a candle from you about five or six yards then looking through the glass move it from your eye till you fill it full of light and you will then discover every vein and speck in it these veins always distort objects and in the object glasses of telescopes and microscopes are especially mischievous since all these errors are much magnified by the eyeglass specks differ from veins for specks are only small opake spots which do not distort the object but only intercept an inconsiderable part of the light coming from it  for the color of glass the whitest has been generally made use of for spectacles but i am inclined on many accounts to prefer another sort before it or any other material that has been made use of for this purpose for the common white glass gives an offensive glaing light very painful and prejudicial to the eyes insomuch that some advise green or blue glass though it tinge every object with its own color rather than this white sort that which i would recommend is of a finer composition than any commonly used its color is the finest of any and being a little tinged with blue it takes off the glaring light from the paper and renders every object so easy and pleasant that the tenderest eye may through it view any thing intently without pain but besides this there are many other reasons for rejecting the common white glass for it is of a softer body than any other and will not receive so true a figure in the polishing as a glass of a harder nature will neither will the polish itself be so fine and beautiful nor of so long continuance for if it lies by any considerable time it will change to a reddish color which is owing to the nature of the materials it is composed of besides this sort of glass is generally found to be very full both of specks and veins insomuch that one can hardly see any spectacles made of this sort of glass that are free from it that which i would here recommend is of an harder nature such as will receive a true figure and will take a very fine and high polish is perfectly transparent and the freest of any from veins and specks i have always found this much preferable to any other sort both in telescopes and microscopes where the least faults are discernable especially in the objectglass where every error in the image they form is greatly magnified by the eyeglass  brazil pebbles and rock crystal stones are much cried up by some for spectacles they are indeed very hard and therefore will take a true figure and a good polish but besides a glaring whiteness all these stones have a grain much like the island crystal see sir isaac newtons optics book   quere     and not only a grain but like that too a double refraction so that all objects appear double thus instead of one letter there will appear two one over the other what confusion this must occasion in the print of a book may be easily guessed at and though this is sometimes not great so that the letters are not much confused yet it will occasion an haziness and indistinctness very like that of some copperplate prints which have been moved a little on the plate while they were printing off if any one has a mind to be fully satisfied of the fitness of these bodies for spectacles let him try to use them for the objectglass of a telescope every one conversant in optics knows the greatest exactness in figure the most perfect freedom from veins and the clearest substances are always requisite to make a good objectglass in a long telescope but if these substances are so far from being preferable that they are the worst of all others for that purpose so that it is scarce possible to make any telescope at all with them they must of course be the worst of all others for spectacles too though their faults are not so easily discerned in so simple an instrument  finis
